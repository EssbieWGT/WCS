Just in the past few weeks, a woman in Minneapolis was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the U.S. government attacked Venezuela and captured its head of state, and Trump withdrew the United States from more than 60 international cooperation efforts. It’s a dangerous and volatile moment in U.S. history, one that is a culmination of a huge slide toward authoritarian practices many of us could never have imagined.

Amnesty International has long documented authoritarian practices in many countries and contexts. We recognize the warning signs and so are ringing the alarm bells. And we also know there is still time to stop it.

Trump silences free speech and punishes journalists

Over the past year, the Trump administration has leveraged multiple tools, including government censorship and targeting protesters, to try to crush dissent. Peaceful protesters, particularly students and activists advocating for Palestinian rights, have been singled out for punishment, with the clear aim of spreading fear among all who might dare to raise their voices.

Universities have come under pressure to suppress student voices, with academic freedom and freedom of expression thrown to the wayside. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester at Columbia University, was detained for months before a judge ordered his release, simply for speaking his mind.

Despite his release, he continues to face immigration proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a 33-year-old Palestinian woman, has been arbitrarily detained since March following a protest at Columbia University. Their examples send a clear message: Exercising the right to speak out can put your liberty and your future in this country at risk. The goal is clear: to instill fear and make dissent too dangerous to attempt.

At the same time, the administration has sought to limit press freedom. Journalists covering protests and human rights violations have been detained, harassed, threatened and, in some cases, like U.S.-based Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, deported. Punishing journalists is a key feature of authoritarian practices, as it denies the public the needed information to hold those in power accountable, thus enabling human rights violations to go unchecked.

These attacks on freedom of speech and press are reinforced by the expansion of surveillance and increased law enforcement and military presence in our communities. Across the country, militarized federal forces have been deployed − often over the objections of local officials and in defiance of court rulings.

Protesters challenging or recording cruel ICE tactics have been met with riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets, threats of arrests and pointed guns, deterring others from speaking out. And sometimes with deadly consequences, as we saw in Minneapolis.

Trump's policies hurt human rights agreements

Vilifying and targeting immigrants while cracking down on protests against Trump’s cruel policies are central to this administration’s authoritarian practices. People seeking safety at the border are denied their right to seek asylum. Immigrants are being detained and deported at historic levels, many without warrants or due process. People are being held in inhumane conditions, enduring torture, denied medical care and cut off from legal counsel.

What makes this moment especially dangerous is the administration’s simultaneous assault on the institutions designed to restrain power and ensure oversight and accountability. The Trump administration is attempting to curb the authority of courts when they issue rulings the White House doesn't agree with and threatening lawyers and judges.

It isn’t only in the United States. Not even three days into 2026, President Trump attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising grave concerns for further escalation of human rights violations in Venezuela and the entire region. This followed months of U.S. air strikes on boats that killed more than 100 people off the Venezuelan coast and in the Pacific.

Furthermore, the administration has significantly altered critical global human rights agreements and bodies, cruelly and chaotically zeroed out foreign assistance, and modeled a disregard for human rights and global norms. In short, President Trump’s actions on the international stage are a dangerous wrecking ball to accountability and justice – and lethal to life and liberty.

After a year, a clear pattern has emerged: systematic erosion of human rights, and open disregard for the systems meant to protect human rights. The Trump administration has violated international law, punished protesters, silenced journalists, militarized communities and sidelined the courts.

The question now is not whether more rights will be eroded, but whose will be next. The future of human rights in the United States and beyond depends on whether we confront this crisis now or allow it to deepen unchecked.

This moment demands action from all of us. We must call on lawmakers to hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. We must demand that colleges and universities safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment.

We must demand that the United States reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems. Courts must continue to serve as a check on executive abuses. We must not turn away or normalize attacks on freedom of expression and protest. We must not accept this.

We all have the human right to live freely, equally and in dignity. Together, we must move forward on the path of accountability, courage and collective action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88103821007-usatsi-27965893.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x0,y310&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 06:59:24.874419

After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.
ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities.
By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.
In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.""","Just 10 years ago, the annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, was less than $6 billion — notably smaller than other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.

The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.

""With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,"" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.

ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.

A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission

ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.

In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.

Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.

When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.

Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.

To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.

The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.

As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000."" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)

According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.

The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.

What else will the new funds be spent on?

With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.

ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost "" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.""

""ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,"" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.

The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.

O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.

""All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,"" she said. ""It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2F22%2F55db3f65464c9460c780ae2cf733%2Fap25330456653535.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:58:26.246797

The survey, shared with Salon by the Public Policy Polling, found that 53% of Americans believe that “ICE agents are going too far” with their immigration raids, while half, 50%, say that ICE tactics are making communities “less safe.” In contrast, around 40% of respondents said that they did not believe ICE was going too far and 42% said that ICE tactics were making communities “more safe.”

55% of responders supported the idea that the Trump administration was focusing “too much” on immigration and not enough on “on fixing the economy, inflation and the rising cost of living,” and 57% said that ICE officers “should be required to adopt police officer standards like working without a mask and displaying a visible badge number.” Just 37% disagreed that the Trump administration was focusing too much on immigration and 33% disagreed that ICE officers should be held to the standards of police.

The survey also found that 76% of Americans had heard “a lot” about Ross’s killing of Good, while just 16% had heard either “just a little” or “nothing at all.”

Half of the respondents said that they agree that “the ICE officer shot and murdered Renee Nicole Good when she tried to drive away” while 42% said that they believed the administration’s line, that Ross killed Good in “self-defense.”

More broadly, 52% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump’s handling of immigration, while 45% approved of his performance on the issue. Another 50% agreed that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “should be fired,” and 53% said that they believe Congress should exercise more restrictions on the behavior of ICE officers before agreeing to fund the agency. Just 31% said they did not think ICE should face more restrictions.

Temperance, a sophomore at Taft, expressed her concerns, saying, ""ICE should not be in our communities and terrorizing families that don't deserve it."" She emphasized that her focus should be on schoolwork, not on the fear of losing friends and loved ones.

Mars Segovia, who created flyers for the walkout, was surprised by the turnout.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of an American mother during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. However, those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there's mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations in an ongoing funding debate.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under President Joe Biden helped return Trump to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Renée Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared to 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to AP-NORC polling, from 49% last March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there's a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fc638c1-e064-4748-99ad-ac736c1f6f0f/wirestory_1108b6228c0f088aa85d4c6d8ce744ba_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:04.722854

It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.
Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.
A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot.
Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said.","About 50 people gathered in rural Baker County Sunday along the side of the highway in opposition to Florida’s second immigration detention facility Sunday.

The state-run immigration detention center, “Deportation Depot,” is located at the former Baker Correctional Institution in Sanderson and opened in 2025 to hold up to 1,300 detainees. It serves as a counterpart to Alligator Alcatraz, an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades that has attracted controversy due to instances of abuse and negligence toward its detainees.

The crowd was made up of members of north Florida organizations including the Party for Socialism & Liberation, Baker Interfaith Friends, Jacksonville Immigrant Rights Alliance and Florida Immigrant Coalition. Bundled up to fight the cold, rainy day, protesters were holding signs reading, “No ICE detention in Florida,” “Abolish ICE” and “Justice for immigrants.”

The protest’s goal was to promote human rights and discourage the cruelty occurring in the detention center, according to Andrea Mason, a member of North Central Florida Indivisible Group, a left-wing advocacy group. Mason said she decided to protest Deportation Depot because she thinks immigration policies have reached an extreme.

“There’s the right way to do things, and right now, this is just about being as cruel as possible and harming people,” she said.

Mason said she has heard stories about suspected immigrants being abused and mistreated in detention centers that have stuck with her and motivate her to advocate for them. These people deserve to be treated better, she said.

Mason said the one way she could make her voice heard and incite change was peaceful protest. Her goal, she said, was to raise awareness and inspire others.

A Mexican woman living in Florida, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said she speaks with inmates at Deportation Depot. She said they receive contaminated water, solitary confinement and can go up to a week without sunlight.

Her friend and inmate at the center, Jose Antonio Martinez Marino, is depressed and frustrated, she said. Marino, who is from Cuba, has been in detainment for over a year and has no hope of being released. Many are in the same condition, she said.

She said she feels anxious in her everyday life and was nervous to be protesting, as she is still in the citizenship process. She feels America is not a home for her, she said, but she is also scared of going back to Mexico after President Donald Trump suggested military action.

“I don’t feel at all that this can be a place where I can feel safe right now, or worthy,” she said.

Vilerka Bilbao, an attorney for Bilbao Law Firm in Jacksonville and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said this detention center is one of the facilities the association is monitoring.

Bilbao said she has nine clients being detained at Deportation Depot. Her clients come from all over the world, she said, such as Mexico, Vietnam and Venezuela. The majority of them do not have criminal records worthy of detention, she said.

Since November 2025, Bilbao’s caseload has been increasing. There were 200 arrests last week in Jacksonville, she said.

Deportation Depot doesn’t have the same problems that other detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz have, Bilbao said. Her clients have access to regular sunlight, meetings with an attorney and a law library.

However, her clients said detainees are not getting adequate medical help. She said she has clients who need specialists or X-rays, but are getting refused those services. She’s also heard complaints about the air conditioning being turned off and the flu being spread around the center.

Bilbao said many immigrants get deported to third-party countries, meaning countries that agree to take deported individuals if their native country refuses to take them back. She has one client who immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 2021 and is being deported to Ecuador, she added.

There is a false narrative that every detainee is a criminal illegal alien, she said, and that is not the reality. The reality she sees are business owners, nurses, teachers, mothers and fathers being detained sometimes through illegal arrest, she said.

“Businesses are suffering, families are suffering,” Bilbao said.

Miles Gibbs, a 27-year-old Gainesville resident, said he was protesting ICE facilities after hearing about killings and disappearances of suspected immigrants. Though he doesn’t personally feel endangered by ICE, he said he’s worried for people in Minnesota, where a U.S. citizen was recently shot and killed by an agent.

Gibbs has a personal connection to the cause — his family members were arrested in a Chicago ICE protest.

“ICE is out in full force. They’re taking people, they’re heckling protestors. They’re making life hell for people,” he said.

Rebecca Hutman, the pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Gainesville, said she came to protest as a person of faith.

“Jesus tells us to love our neighbours. I don't know — I don’t feel like putting our neighbors into cages is anyone’s definition of love,” she said.

She said she thinks the “rampant cruelty of centers like this” motivates her to figure out how to speak against it.

Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.
Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.
The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.","The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday subpoenaed the offices of Minnesota’s governor and attorney general, and mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as it weighed whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities amounts to a crime.

One of the jury subpoenas, shared with the media by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office’s custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to “cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities.”

The federal grand jury subpoenas were served on six offices of state and local Democrats, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

“Whether it’s a public official, whether it’s a law enforcement officer, no one is above the law in this state or in this country, and people will be held accountable,” U.S. Attorney Pam Bondi said in a Fox News interview after arriving in Minnesota on Friday.

“Our men and women in law enforcement deserve to be safe, and that’s what we’re going to do in Minnesota,” Bondi added, without explicitly addressing the newly issued subpoenas.

Walz, Frey say public at risk

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks to conduct deportation roundups, unprecedented in scale, that have led to numerous violent confrontations with residents.

The agents have carried rifles through the city’s snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage, tactical gear and masks, drawing loud but mostly peaceful protests from residents.

Walz and Frey have denounced the ICE operations as reckless political theater that was putting the public at risk and was designed to provoke chaos that Trump would use as a pretext to exert an even greater show of force.

Although he has urged protesters to remain orderly, Walz also has openly encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public to create a database for potential “future prosecution” of wrongdoing by federal law enforcement.

Trump administration officials have accused Walz and Frey of deliberately stoking interference with ICE operations in “collusion” with anti-government agitators, which the governor denies. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.

The hostility of many residents to the ICE crackdown has only deepened since one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago.

Federal officers have used tear gas and other chemical irritants against protesters, and have drawn outrage for racially profiling Black, Latino and Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said officers who broke down the man’s door with gun’s drawn were seeking two “criminal illegal aliens” from Laos who are subject to deportation orders.

One of those men, who ICE officials pictured on “Wanted” posters and described on Tuesday as still at large, was actually in a prison south of Minneapolis serving a four-year term he received in late 2024 for kidnapping, according to public court records and the state online inmate locator.

The man who was wrongly detained, and later released, ChongLy “Scott” Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said the agents who arrested him presented no warrant.

Government agents are forbidden under the U.S. Constitution from forcing their way into homes and other private property without a warrant signed by a judge, or to arrest someone without “probable cause” that a crime was committed.

The grand jury subpoenas were delivered a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation of Walz, Frey and other Democrats who have criticized Trump’s deportation drive in Minnesota.

Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump’s political adversaries.

He has pointed to investigations opened in recent weeks against such figures as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to lower interest rates, and several U.S. military veterans serving in Congress who issued a video statement urging members of the armed forces to resist illegal orders.

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Justice Department has struggled in some cases to secure indictments, an unusual rebuke from grand juries given that prosecutors alone present evidence to those panels and need only show probable cause that a crime was committed, a lower legal standard than it takes to obtain a conviction at trial.

Grand juries twice rejected the DOJ’s attempts to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James after a judge threw out a criminal case against her and also refused to sign off on several cases connected to Trump’s law enforcement surge in Washington last summer.

Democrats have called for calm

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have also sued the Trump administration, asking a judge to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minnesota barred immigration agents deployed en masse in the Minneapolis area from arresting, detaining or using pepper spray and other crowd-control munitions against peaceful protesters or individuals who were merely observing ICE activities.

The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit brought on behalf of a group of citizens who said their constitutional rights had been infringed by federal agents.

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” Walz said in a statement on Friday.

Frey said separately that the federal government was trying “to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs” and that “every American should be concerned.”",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2026/01/ICE-Minnesota-Reuters-w-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:08.678440

Thousands of union members, religious faithful and ordinary citizens are expected to participate in a massive statewide economic strike on Friday that organizers are hoping will bring an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Minnesota.

The event, called “A Day of Truth and Freedom,” is being organized by union representatives, faith leaders and community members. They are urging Minnesotans not to go to work, school or go shopping in response to the ongoing federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

Officials from the Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state’s federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions, said Tuesday that they voted to endorse the event to protest “against ICE’s occupation of our communities and the unconstitutional detention of countless innocent Minnesotans, including a significant number of union members.”

“They are indiscriminately targeting Minnesotans of color, regardless of citizenship or immigration status,” Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham said. “Many people are fearful of daily activities like going to work, shopping for groceries and sending their children to school.”

She said union members on Friday would join fellow Minnesotans “to call for ICE to leave our state, no additional funding for ICE, legal accountability for ICE’s killing of Renee Good and for Minnesota’s large corporations to stop cooperating with ICE.”

Good, 37, of Minneapolis, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. The shooting was recorded on several phones, including one held by Ross.

ICE enforcement in the state has intensified since the shooting, causing many workers to fear for their lives, said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation of the AFL-CIO, which represents more than 175 local unions and 80,000 union members.

Some workers represented by the union have been detained or are afraid to go to work, Gabiou said at a press conference on Monday. “They’ve had to make gut-wrenching, life-altering choices about whether or not they’re going to go to work, so they can put food on the table, or whether they’re going to stay home, and stay safe, and stay alive,” she said.

Stores closing

Businesses and stores across the metro area have announced plans to be closed on Friday. Among them is Mississippi Market Co-op, which has three stores in St. Paul, joining forces with the two Wedge Community Co-ops in Minneapolis, Eastside Food Co-op in Minneapolis, the Seward Community Co-op locations in Minneapolis and River Market Co-op in Stillwater.

“As a cooperative, we believe our shared labor, time, and economic participation are powerful tools,” Mississippi Market officials wrote in a statement shared on social media. “This coordinated statewide pause reflects our commitment to democratic action, mutual responsibility, and concern for our communities. Acting together is one way we live our cooperative values. We stand with those calling for justice and demand ICE leave Minnesota now.”

Dozens of St. Paul restaurants and bars also are planning to close Friday in support of the strike, including 620 Club, the Black Hart of St. Paul, Caydence Records and Coffee, Claddagh Coffee, Emerald Lounge, Estelle, Hyacinth, J. Selby’s, Lost Fox, Marc Heu Patisserie, Mucci’s Italian, Quixotic Coffee and others.

Craft stores Wet Paint and the Yarnery also plan to close for the day.

Some businesses are modifying their approach: Catzen Coffee, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, plans to pause its regular business model to open for the day as a community space with free drip coffee.

Holly Weinkauf, the owner of the Red Balloon Bookshop on Grand Avenue, called the decision to shutter her shop on Friday “complex.”

“The biggest thing for us is wanting to be in solidarity with our community, with our neighbors who are being significantly impacted.”

Weinkauf said her employees were unanimous in their support of the closure. “Everyone felt that this was the best way to show up for our community,” she said. “They felt strongly that, whether they were paid or not, we should be closed. I made the choice that people will be paid for that day.”

The whole situation already is taking a financial toll on the Twin Cities, she said, but she thinks Friday’s strike will send a message if enough people participate.

“I do struggle with the financial impact to our cities that are already struggling with so much,” Weinkauf said. “It is important. It is beyond not normal.”

“We need to suspend the normal order of business and demand the immediate end of ICE actions in our state,” said Lisa Erbes, a co-leader for Indivisible Twin Cities, which is helping organize the event. “We demand that the federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to many Minnesota residents be held accountable, and we call for Congress to intervene immediately.”

ICE activity is “violating the constitutional and human rights of Americans and our neighbors,” Erbes said, and businesses must “do their part in getting ICE out of Minnesota.”

Somali business owners were planning their own news conference Wednesday in Minneapolis to endorse the Friday shutdown.

Reflection, prayer, solidarity

Clergy from around the country are expected to come to Minnesota on Friday to participate in the economic strike.

Asad Zaman, executive director and imam with the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, spoke at a press conference Tuesday morning at Redeemer Lutheran Church in St. Paul that was organized by St. Paul-based nonprofit ISAIAH.

“Over the last few weeks, Minnesotans have witnessed scenes we imagined do not happen in our country,” Zaman said. “We have witnessed elderly people dragged out of their homes in their underwear. We have witnessed workers being assaulted and kidnapped when they are at work trying to take the garbage out. We have witnessed people being beaten up for the simple act of videotaping and photographing activities. And we have witnessed a mother being murdered moments after she dropped off her child,” in reference to Good.

While the “heavy-handed tactics” appear to be designed to spread fear, Minnesotans “have responded with calm … and peaceful protests, and we intend to continue to do so,” he said.

Clergy are asking for Friday to be a “day of reflection, of prayer, of invocation, and a day of solidarity,” he said. “We ask for all Minnesotans to stay home or to protest peacefully as they are called to do so. We call upon all employers to take the day off so the people can spend a day in solidarity and in quiet prayer and reflection.”

The Minnesota Nurses Association supports participation in the economic strike, but is not calling for a work stoppage or walkout.

“Nurses hold a unique and essential role as caregivers and patient advocates, and MNA encourages members to honor the no-strike provisions of their contracts and report to work as scheduled,” officials said in a statement. “Continuing to provide care is not an absence from this moment — it is an act of solidarity. By showing up for patients while standing together, nurses are protecting Minnesota’s most vulnerable community members in the ways only nurses can.”

The union represents nurses and health care workers, including many who are immigrants or have immigrant loved ones directly impacted by ICE enforcement, officials said.

The University of St. Thomas will continue with normal operations on Friday “to serve its students,” according to a statement from the university. “However, employees who wish to participate in this, or any other peaceful demonstration, can work with their managers and request time off to attend.”

A spokesman for Macalester College in St. Paul declined to comment.

A rally, march — and plea

“A Day of Truth and Freedom” will culminate in a 2 p.m. rally and march through downtown Minneapolis. The rally will start at the Commons, at 425 Portland Ave. S., organizers say.

While the work stoppage will be hard on small businesses, business owners “recognize that this is an emergency,” said Kate Havelin, a spokeswoman for Indivisible Twin Cities. “We have to stop ICE. This is an emergency, and we have to deal with it.”

Organizers of the economic strike are particularly calling on officials at Target, Home Depot, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Hilton and Delta Airlines to “speak out and demand ICE leave Minnesota,” according to Havelin.

Two employees who were working at the Target in Richfield were arrested inside the store by ICE agents. Both young men were U.S. citizens, she said, and Target officials did not intervene.

“Target and other businesses could post signs saying ICE is not allowed in unless they have a signed warrant,” Havelin said. “There is something businesses can do to protect their workers and to protect their customers because when you are letting ICE wander into your store or hang out or stage in your parking lot, you are not protecting your staff, and you’re not protecting your customers. And that doesn’t seem like good business sense.”

Target officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It’s a state led by Democrats — including Gov. Tim Walz, who ran on the ticket against Trump in 2024. It has a large immigrant population, including Somalis, who Trump has described as “garbage.” It became a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment and civil unrest after George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in 2020. Allegations of fraud in federally funded programs have given Trump an opening to assert control.

“There’s really nowhere else in the country that ticks all of those boxes,” said Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, who added that the White House’s push in Minnesota comes with a strategic benefit: the federal appeals court that would review legal challenges to Trump’s actions in the state is dominated by Republican appointees.

The administration and its allies see Minnesota as uniquely recalcitrant and forceful in its pushback to the Trump administration’s agenda on almost every front. Though other Democratic-led cities and states and have resisted Trump’s deportation push and have battled his policies in court, they say the across-the-board opposition in Minnesota — and the uniquely aggravating factor of a burgeoning fraud scandal — has led to the culmination of legal and political battles in the state.

Here’s a look at the legal battles playing out in Minnesota, a microcosm of the nation:

Mass detention of deportation targets

Trump’s most visible assertion of power in Minnesota is the infusion of federal officers and agents — dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” — into Minneapolis, St. Paul and the surrounding region. Courts estimate that as many as 3,000 federal officials have descended on the state to carry out immigration operations,which have drawn protests and inflamed tensions with local residents and elected officials.

Those efforts have resulted in a corresponding surge of litigation, particularly by detained immigrants targeted for deportation, who say they’re being held illegally without the opportunity for bond.

Judges across the country have almost uniformly rejected the administration’s position in similar cases. Cases in Minnesota have been skyrocketing since Operation Metro Surge began, with dozens of new petitions filed each day. And the results have been consistent: Judges, even those appointed by Trump, have called the mass detention illegal and ordered the administration to provide bond hearings or release detainees outright.

Force against protesters

Protesters in Minnesota are challenging the use of force by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and others involved in Operation Metro Surge as well, mirroring litigation that followed deportation operations in Los Angeles and Chicago.

That led to a ruling Friday by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez barring ICE and other federal agents involved in the surge from using certain crowd control tactics, arresting peaceful protesters and conducting vehicle stops in ways intended to chill free speech. Menendez found that ICE agents had repeatedly used retaliatory force against peaceful protesters, a dynamic that became even more fraught after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good.

Appeals courts blocked or narrowed rulings curtailing Trump’s actions in Chicago and Los Angeles, and the administration is betting the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals will follow suit and block Menendez’ ruling.

Protected status for Somali immigrants

Trump has repeatedly railed against Somali immigrants in the wake of allegations of pervasive fraud in federally funded programs. And last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to revoke “temporary protected status” from several thousand Somalis living in the U.S. after fleeing war and strife in their homeland.

That move mirrored similar cancellations of protected status for Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and others. Lower-court judges sought to block those cancellations, saying they were authorized on false or discriminatory pretenses — only for appellate courts and the Supreme Court to allow the administration to proceed.

Threat to invoke the Insurrection Act

Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon over the wishes of state and local officials to shore up what he characterized as immigration operations besieged by violent resistance. And in each case, federal courts found the deployments exceeded Trump’s authority.

The Supreme Court agreed last month, finding that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops — typically controlled by governors — into American cities without first determining the “regular forces” of the military were unable to control the unrest. That leaves Trump with an option he’s long flirted with: Invoking the Insurrection Act to send the military directly into U.S. cities.

Trump made his threat to Minnesota explicit last week, noting that other presidents had invoked the Act to quell unrest. But state and local leaders say the presence of uniformed military on the streets of an American city would further inflame tensions and violate historical norms about turning the military on civilians.

Targeting political adversaries

Trump has been increasingly overt about his desire to turn the machinery of the Justice Department against those he sees as political foes, pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to move quickly even when career prosecutors view his preferred cases as weak or meritless.

Now, the Justice Department has signaled it is investigating Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats, and two of the state’s most outspoken critics of ICE’s actions — for impeding immigration officials. Little is known about the status of the investigation, but the probe appears rooted in the officials’ public opposition to the federal government’s aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota and ICE’s tactics in the Twin Cities.

Walz and Frey have rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing and argued they’re being targeted for their opposition to federal policy and views.

Unilateral funding cuts

Trump has also vowed to yank billions in funding from Minnesota over allegations that Somali fraudsters had bilked federally funded programs. The administration has already sought to pull funds from so-called “sanctuary” cities and states, where local leaders decline to assist with federal immigration enforcement, and has targeted nutrition assistance funding in Minnesota and elsewhere.

Last week, a federal judge in Minnesota, Laura Provinzino, blocked the Department of Agriculture from slashing funding to Minnesota for administering the SNAP program, saying that the state had fully complied with legal requirements for verifying eligible recipients. Instead, the judge said USDA had “pulled the rug out from under Minnesota without offering any reasoned explanation” by making new, onerous demands that were virtually impossible to satisfy.

Judges have blocked the administration from nixing disaster relief fund over “sanctuary city” policies, but Trump has recently vowed to pull all federal funds out of Minnesota over what he has characterized as rampant, unchecked fraud in federally funded programs.

Suing over the voter rolls

Minnesota is also one of 22 states the Justice Department is suing to gain access to voter registration files, a nationwide push that has begun to meet resistance in courts as well.

A federal judge in California last week shot down DOJ’s effort in the state, calling it a thinly veiled effort to disenfranchise legal voters.

“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the Executive without action from Congress and public debate,” wrote U.S. District Judge David Carter, a Clinton appointee to the federal bench in Santa Ana. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections our country promises and the franchise that civil rights leaders fought and died for.”

In Minnesota, the battle is taking place before Menendez, who has a hearing scheduled on the issue for early March.

Blocking lawmakers from ICE oversight

A day after the Good shooting rocked Minneapolis, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy blocking members of Congress from visiting ICE detention facilities without one week’s notice. That policy echoed a similar one that had been blocked by a federal judge last month.

Noem didn’t publicly announce the updated policy, and three Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota were turned away when they sought to enter an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis — one of them even carrying a printout of the December ruling in their favor.

The earlier, blocked policy was rooted in an effort by DHS to keep Democratic lawmakers from making unannounced visits to ICE facilities to spotlight what they have described as abuses or unsafe conditions — but visits that DHS officials have described as publicity stunts. But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found that the policy violated federal appropriations law that prohibits the use of certain funds from being used to interfere with congressional oversight visits.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fee%2Ffe%2F87aa85994340a3792e6501ff6777%2Ftrump-one-year-photo-gallery-23593.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:57:05.540381

ICE and Border Patrol officers have used aggressive tactics during the recent crackdown, including breaking down the door of a family's home without a judicial warrant and pulling people from vehicles.

Immigration officers' tactics are ""born of necessity,"" Bovino said, and ""well-grounded in law.""

""Everything we do is legal, ethical and moral,"" he said.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, expressed frustration that advocates have no way of knowing whether the government's arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.

Meanwhile, federal prosecutors served grand jury subpoenas Tuesday to Minnesota officials as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded law enforcement during a sweeping immigration operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a person familiar with the matter said.

The subpoenas, which seek records, were sent to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, the person said.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements they made, two people familiar with the matter said Friday. They said then that it was focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Walz and Frey, both Democrats, have called the probe a bullying tactic meant to quell political opposition. Frey's office released a subpoena, which requires a long list of documents for a grand jury on Feb. 3, including ""any records tending to show a refusal to come to the aid of immigration officials.""

The Justice Department called the state's lawsuit, filed soon after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer, ""legally frivolous.""

Good, 37, was killed on Jan. 7 as she was moving her vehicle, which had been blocking a Minneapolis street where ICE officers were operating. Trump administration officials say the officer, Jonathan Ross, shot her in self-defense, although videos of the encounter show the Honda Pilot slowly turning away from him.

Since then, the public has repeatedly confronted officers, blowing whistles and yelling insults at ICE and Border Patrol. They, in turn, have used tear gas and chemical irritants against protesters.

These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.","One year into President Trump’s second term, federal immigration policies are systematically dismantling the right to due process. From the early days of his administration, Trump has launched a widespread crackdown on immigrants, enacting a series of policies that have vastly expanded detention, deportation, and enforcement while gutting long-standing protections for due process—the right to fair treatment under the law. Due process is a fundamental right guaranteed to everyone in the United States by the U.S. Constitution and underpins democratic governance. Yet in just one year, Trump has turned the U.S. immigration system into a weaponized force of exclusion, harming community members, sidelining values core to the functioning of a healthy democracy, and posing grave threats to noncitizens and citizens alike.

At the one-year mark of this administration’s efforts to dismantle due process, here are some of the core policy measures that have curtailed immigrants’ rights, separated families, destabilized communities, and undermined our democratic values.

The Trump administration has vastly expanded immigration detention, subjecting hundreds of thousands of people to unnecessary and prolonged detention.

As a presidential candidate in 2024, Trump promised “the largest deportation program” in the country’s history. Since returning to office, he has made good on that promise, making mass deportation a core component of his administration’s agenda. Thanks to Congress’s passage of an unprecedented $170 billion spending package for immigration enforcement and detention, the president has the tools to carry out this cruel promise, including $45 billion explicitly for expanding civil immigration detention.

This colossal allocation of funds—coupled with policies to restrict bond, expand mandatory detention, and use racial profiling as a basis for arrest—has funneled more people into immigration detention than ever before. People in detention experience grave health risks and difficulties accessing essential services, with predictable results; 2025 holds the grim distinction of having the most people die in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in decades. Even analysis of the government’s own data shows that detention is unnecessary to deter immigration or ensure people show up for their immigration proceedings.

Nevertheless, the administration has widened its net and targeted more and more people for detention, including new mothers appearing at scheduled immigration appointments, foreign students targeted for their speech, and even U.S. citizens. According to an analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice, more than 290,000 people have been detained since the start of Trump’s second term through mid-October 2025, a 19 percent increase compared to the same period the year prior.

Needing the infrastructure to facilitate this mass detention agenda, the administration has co-opted county jails, federal and state prisons, and military bases for immigration purposes. It has also designated Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for deportations, sent people to a notorious prison in El Salvador, and facilitated deportations to third countries where immigrants have no ties, threatening to create legal black holes where U.S. protections—including due process rights—may be impossible to enforce.

Beyond the obvious denial of liberty, these policies treat detention as the default, pressuring people to lose hope, abandon valid legal claims, and accept deportation orders simply to escape indefinite confinement. Those who stay to fight their case face harsh detention conditions and a high likelihood of being transferred to facilities across the country, far from their families and attorneys. Collectively, these efforts make it more difficult to find increasingly limited legal representation, significantly reducing people’s chances of getting a fair day in court.

The Trump administration has turned courthouses and routine immigration appointments into enforcement zones, punishing people for following the law.

People fulfilling their legal obligations by attending hearings and mandated check-ins with ICE are now being targeted for arrest when they appear at what used to be routine immigration appointments. These arrests funnel people actively following the legal process into immigration detention, where they are either quickly deported without the chance to defend their legal rights or forced to continue their immigration case behind bars, away from their families and communities. This undermines due process by punishing people for complying with the law and sends a dangerous message that participation in the legal system carries the risk of detention and deportation—making communities less safe.

VIDEO:

The Trump administration has militarized immigration enforcement, deploying armed forces to occupy U.S. cities and empowering ICE to implement violent tactics.

The administration has falsely and harmfully equated immigration with crime and “invasion” to justify its agenda, including the deployment of more than 35,000 federal troops nationwide, in part to aid ICE operations and quell anti-ICE protests. The deployments, which have often gone against the wishes of the states’ governors, have been met repeatedly with legal challenges and court rulings against the federal government. Aggressively militarized immigration enforcement efforts undermine public safety, community trust, and civil liberties—recently resulting in the tragic killing of a Minnesota woman, Renee Good, by an ICE officer in January. These actions divert resources from state and local governments to vastly expand the federal government’s enforcement apparatus, place millions under military occupation, and erode the constitutionally protected rights of noncitizens and citizens alike.

By conducting massive operations that treat cities as war zones and use the cover of “Kavanaugh stops” to conduct door-to-door enforcement and other stops in immigrant neighborhoods on the basis of “apparent race” and other factors, the administration is manufacturing a crisis to do away with due process rights.

The Trump administration has bypassed immigration courts, denying people the right to fair hearings.

The president and vice president have both decried the existence of immigration courts as barriers to enacting their mass deportation agenda, even going so far as to call immigration court a “fake legal process.”

The administration has sidestepped the courts and the ability of people to defend their rights wherever it can. It has dramatically expanded the use of “expedited removal,” a process that authorizes immigration officers to deport people who meet certain (and rapidly multiplying) criteria without a hearing. This fast-tracked process makes it nearly impossible for people to consult with counsel, present evidence, or otherwise contest the case being made against them before a judge—all essential components of due process.

Without access to the courts, there are few safeguards preventing the government from permanently expelling anyone deemed undesirable, noncitizens and citizens alike. The result has been wrongful deportations of people with valid legal claims, including asylum seekers fleeing persecution and long-term residents with deep family and community ties. By stripping away access to the courts, this policy dismantles one of the most fundamental protections of due process: the right to a fair and just hearing.

The Trump administration has weaponized the courts and undermined judicial independence to new extremes.

An essential component of due process is the ability not only to have one’s case heard before a judge, but to have an impartial judge. Immigration courts, however, have never been independent judicial bodies, as they are administered not by the judicial branch but by the executive. As a component of the U.S. Department of Justice, they are overseen by the attorney general—who is appointed by and executes the policies of the president.

This fact, which has long hindered the impartiality of the immigration legal system, has been fully exploited by this administration. Despite more than 3 million currently pending cases, the administration has fired more than 100 experienced immigration judges, many of whom have backgrounds in immigration legal defense, and eliminated nearly half of the body responsible for reviewing appeals. Attorney General Pam Bondi, using her authority to refer cases to herself due to the courts’ position in the executive branch, has further vacated judges’ decisions with which she disagrees.

To fill the gap created by their own firings, the administration has loosened the requirements and training needed to be an immigration judge. The government is also turning to unqualified military lawyers without any experience in immigration law to serve as what have been referred to as “deportation judges.” Immigration law is notoriously complex; it is unfathomable that someone without experience and little training would preside over cases that can often mean the difference between life and death. These unprecedented moves weaponize what should be an impartial judiciary and instead seek to make it a component of the immigration enforcement apparatus.

The Trump administration has sought to eliminate federal funding for legal access and representation programs for people facing deportation.

Unlike in the criminal justice system, there is no right to government-appointed representation in immigration court for people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Yet it is nearly impossible for someone to understand the complexity of immigration law without a lawyer. Research consistently indicates that immigrants represented by a lawyer are significantly more likely to successfully defend against deportation and obtain legal relief. People in detention face even more challenging circumstances, with limited access to a small pool of volunteer attorneys and difficulty obtaining evidence to use in their defense from within the confines of detention.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has slashed federal funding to help people access legal information and representation. It has sought to eliminate funding for virtually all immigrant legal service programs, including those for children and people with mental health disorders unable to represent themselves. While cuts to some programs, like the Unaccompanied Children Program and the National Qualified Representation Program, have been paused while litigation is pending, the administration has continued its attempts to undermine their efficacy and independence through other actions. These efforts leave millions of immigrants, including children, asylum seekers, and families, without meaningful access to counsel.

Without the support of an attorney, people of all ages face a system drastically stacked against them, forced to argue their case alone against a trained government lawyer—a massive undermining of the fairness of immigration proceedings.

The Trump administration has threatened citizenship and revoked legal status from people in the country lawfully—subjecting more people to detention and deportation in a system increasingly devoid of due process.

The administration is seeking to curtail the very act of immigration itself by limiting legal immigration pathways—both preventing the arrival of newcomers and stripping people lawfully in the country of status. The administration has stripped visa holders of their legal status for political speech with which they disagree, revoked temporary protected status from migrants from certain countries, and reduced refugee admissions to historic lows—with priority given to white South Africans. And in November 2025, the administration announced it would halt all asylum decisions, placing thousands in legal limbo. It has even planned to denaturalize certain U.S. citizens—setting a quota of up to 200 people per month in 2026—and sought to eliminate constitutionally protected birthright citizenship.

These actions actively criminalize people who are fleeing violence in their home countries and push them into increasingly dangerous and desperate situations. But immigrants are central to our culture, our families, our economy, and our communities in the United States. Welcoming newcomers and providing ample legal pathways to citizenship, security, and stability promotes our collective well-being and prosperity. Americans agree: polling shows that a record-high 79 percent consider immigration to be good for the country.

Yet the administration is acting against public sentiment and is instead attacking both noncitizens and citizens—whose legal status and citizenship were thought to be inviolable—vastly expanding the number of people who can be targeted by its dangerous detention and deportation enforcement tactics.

The bottom line: due process is essential to our democracy and cannot be taken for granted.

Despite these attacks, people across the political spectrum in the United States are increasingly opposing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and mass detention efforts.

More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the administration for its immigration policies. Federal courts have already reaffirmed the right to bond hearings for many people facing deportation; challenged the government’s position that it can indefinitely detain people it seeks to deport to a third country; and rejected the use of detention in retaliation for exercising constitutionally protected speech. They have further upheld New York State’s ban on warrantless arrests in state and local courts and barred warrantless arrests in Chicago and Washington, DC, absent a demonstration of probable cause. Many more cases remain pending. Members of Congress have also introduced legislation to protect people appearing for routine legal hearings and appointments in immigration court. Despite these wins, litigation will continue to be dynamic, with appeals and new filings certain to continue to impact the rights and legal options of people at risk of deportation for as long as the administration pushes its hardline agenda.

In addition, local and state governments are supporting community members targeted by the administration. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, in the past year, jurisdictions like Massachusetts, California, Baltimore, and nearly 30 others—including many of those in Vera’s Safety & Fairness for Everyone (SAFE) Network—have stepped up to increase or initiate legal defense funds for immigrants. They join the more than 70 jurisdictions nationwide that have invested in deportation defense programs since 2014 to keep families together, stabilize communities, and safeguard due process. Yet with millions still facing deportation alone without the support of legal counsel under incredibly challenging circumstances, more must be urgently done.

The right to due process and fair treatment under the law is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to all people in the United States, regardless of where they were born. The systematic erosion of these rights poses grave threats to the safety of immigrant community members and to everyone in the United States. As the Trump administration acts to dismantle a basic tenet of our democracy, leaders at all levels of government and community members alike must continue to push back to safeguard our democracy and advance immigration policies that respect fairness, family unity, and human dignity.",https://vera-institute.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Special-Reports/inside-the-massive-jail-that-doubles-as-chicagos-largest-mental-health-facility/additional_reading/One_Year_of_Trump_Explainer_Blog_XGraphic_1200x630.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1768586579&s=fe757c4b3b8084dfccdb4300f5375b9f,N,,2026-01-20 23:58:39.143443

PAUL, Minn. -- Federal immigration agents bashed open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy ""Scott"" Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law alerted him on Sunday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS later released the names and photos of two people it described as ""violent illegal alien sexual offenders"" that it was seeking to detain in St. Paul. Thao said he had never seen these men before and they did not live with him.

DHS did not respond to an earlier request from The Associated Press asking why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend, whose first name matches that of one of the men DHS said it was seeking. Chris Thao said he did not know the boyfriend's last name.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

""I don't feel safe at all,"" Thao said. ""What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.""

District of Columbia federal Judge Jia Cobb issued an order denying a request from a dozen Democratic lawmakers on the technical grounds that an amended complaint or a supplemental brief must be made to challenge a seven-day notice policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this month for oversight visits.

“The court emphasizes that it denies plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” according to Cobb’s order.

Earlier this month, Democrats brought an emergency request to Cobb after a handful of Minnesota lawmakers were denied an unannounced oversight visit to a federal facility that holds immigrants following the deadly shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer.

Under a 2019 appropriations law, any member of Congress can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants, but in June, multiple Democrats were denied visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Those 12 Democrats sued over the policy that required a week’s notice, and in December, Cobb granted the request to stay Noem’s policy, finding it violated the 2019 law.

Noem has now argued that the January incident does not violate Cobb’s stay from December because the ICE facilities are using funds through the Republican spending and tax cuts law, known as the “One, Big Beautiful Bill,” and not the DHS appropriations bill. Noem argued that those facilities are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress.

At least 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE through October of 2025, according to a ProPublica investigation that was denied by Noem.

Zoom in: DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that encounters shown in videos posted online are not ""racially based"" and said ""there's a lot of fear-mongering going on by the media.""

Noem said Thursday that officers are acting appropriately and ""in every situation, were doing targeted enforcement.""

""If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they're there and having them validate their identity,"" Noem said at the White House.

But immigration attorney Allen Orr told Axios that ""at her level, there is no way that [Noem] can tell you about Minnesota, or anywhere else, that every one of her officers are acting appropriately.""

The big picture: A shadow-docket ruling from the Supreme Court last September allowed these immigration check stops to occur when there's a combination of suspicions — including appearance, language, accent and workplace — in response to litigation from last summer's Los Angeles immigration raids.

But this is not the final ruling in the case and the case continues to be argued through the lower courts.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the initial decision, saying it would eliminate ""judicial micromanagement.""

""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent on the ruling.

Between the lines: DHS is being sued in several cases for its arrest tactics used against citizens and noncitizens, alike. Many of the lawsuits argue that using a person's appearance for this kind of immigration enforcement in the country's interior does rely on race.

In Chicago, Colorado and Washington, D.C., lawsuits have stopped warrantless arrests and even led to the release of people who are undocumented but were arrested without warrants last year.

There have been long been issues with mistaken arrests and detentions. An investigation from NPR found that more than 800 citizens were detained by ICE from 2007 to 2016.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Minnesota filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging DHS arrest tactics in the Twin Cities and across the state, particularly stops and arrests made allegedly without reasonable suspicion, probable cause or warrants.

Questioning someone about their immigration status in roving patrols risks violating the Fourth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause, the lawsuit alleges.

The case claims that people of Somali-origin and Latinos have been particularly impacted.

Zoom in: One plaintiff in the case is Mubashir Khalif Hussen, 20, a U.S. citizen who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia. DHS agents arrested him in December while he was on his work lunch break in Minneapolis.

Hussen was grabbed and put in a headlock by agents, who then refused to let him show his ID or a photo of his passport card that he had on his phone, according to the suit.

Hussen repeatedly told the agents that he is a U.S. citizen. But the agents said they needed to scan his face or he'd be taken into custody.

""They ignored both his statements and his documentary proof that he is a U.S. citizen. And at no point did the officers ask Mr. Hussen about his ties to the community,"" the lawsuit says.

Nardine Saad

The US justice department has issued subpoenas to Democratic Minnesota officials, alleging they conspired to impede federal immigration officers in the state.

The offices of Governor Tim Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were among those served with legal summonses as US Attorney General Pam Bondi visited Minnesota following intense protests.

US President Donald Trump meanwhile said he ""felt horribly"" about an ICE agent fatally shooting protester Renee Good, 37, describing her death as a ""tragedy"".

Walz called the probe a ""partisan distraction"", saying the justice department ""does not seek justice"" in the killing Good, whose death sparked unrest.

In a statement to the BBC, Frey said the justice department was pursuing him for disagreeing with the Trump administration. Ellison accused Trump of weaponising the justice system.

The justice department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

Ellison, the state's top prosecutor, said on X that the justice department sent him a grand jury subpoena for records and documents related to his office's work with respect to federal immigration enforcement.

""Everything about this is highly irregular, especially the fact that this comes shortly after my office sued the Trump administration to challenge their illegal actions within Minnesota,"" he said.

A spokesman for Minneapolis city hall confirmed to the BBC that ""the Office of Mayor Jacob Frey was subpoenaed"".

""When the federal government weaponizes its power to try to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs, every American should be concerned,"" Frey said in a statement.

""We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with.""

Subpoenas were also sent to St Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and Mary Moriarty, the Hennepin County prosecutor.

Bondi threatened legal action against state leaders on Sunday if they refused to ""act responsibly to prevent lawlessness"" after a church was targeted during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Justice department officials, who accuse the activists of ""desecrating a house of worship"", have said they will investigate them for alleged civil rights violations.

Tensions have been rising in the state since ICE ramped up operations in Minneapolis this month as part of Trump's immigration crackdown, with federal officials saying they are targeting the ""worst of the worst"" there.

But unrest escalated after the fatal shooting on 7 January of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, but local officials argue the woman posed no danger.

Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks and 1,500 troops are reportedly on standby.

The US Department of Homeland Security says it has arrested 3,000 ""of some of the most dangerous offenders"" in the past six weeks under Operation Metro Surge.

At a news conference on Tuesday, officials for the Twin Cities - the Minneapolis–St Paul metropolitan area - accused federal agents of racial profiling.

They said off-duty officers had been stopped and asked for proof of citizenship.

""Every one of these individuals is a person of colour,"" said Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.

Walz and Frey have demanded that ICE leave the area and the state has sued the Trump administration to block the deployment of immigration agents.

Last week, Trump raised the prospect that he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city.

The disorder erupted after an agent was allegedly attacked with a shovel by three Venezuelan migrants and he shot one of them in the leg.

During a press briefing on Tuesday, the president spoke sympathetically about Good and, having learnt that her parents were Trump supporters, he said he hoped they would still vote for him.

He also doubled down on his criticism of the protesters, calling them ""professional agitators and professional people that want to see our country do badly"".

Trump has repeatedly linked the ICE surge in Minnesota to fraud cases that the justice department says involve mostly defendants from the state's large Somali community.

On Tuesday, Trump said Somalia is ""a backward country, probably the worst country"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3d32/live/998ada90-f63c-11f0-a4ca-f58d1380f71c.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:57:41.543738

The strategy is tailor-designed to win bipartisan support for the DHS bill and prevent a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30, when funding is set to expire.
“I think ICE has — its usefulness as an organization, because of what it’s become, has expired.” Liberals aren’t expected to take issue with only the DHS bill.
The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the minibus and the DHS bill.
And several House Democrats have been on record saying they would want their Senate colleagues to withhold their support for spending bills if the issue remains unresolved.","House Democrats are pushing a contentious Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending bill that would allow tens of billions of dollars to flow to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), drawing fire from liberals.

In endorsing a bill that would carry forward a huge spike in funding to ICE, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, acknowledged it excludes most of the ICE reforms Democrats have demanded since the Jan. 7 shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis. But a shutdown or a short-term spending patch, she argued, would be worse.

“A continuing resolution will jettison the guardrails we have secured while ceding authority to President Trump, Stephen Miller, and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem,” she said Tuesday morning.

The strategy is tailor-designed to win bipartisan support for the DHS bill and prevent a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30, when funding is set to expire.

But the outcry from progressives in both chambers is inevitable given the uproar over the Minnesota shooting, and it was already becoming public.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said in a video statement on the social platform X he will vote no on the bill and will help lead the opposition against it.

“It’s a moral disgrace. It has an $18 billion dollar plus up for the ICE agency. That’s right. They are tripling ICE’s budget at a time that ICE is ripping American citizens out of their cars and arresting and shooting American citizens,” he said.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said on X that she “will not vote to give ICE a single cent.”

“No more blank checks for a rogue agency that operates above the law, escalates violence, and erodes our most basic freedoms,” she added.

The DHS bill includes a few targeted reforms aimed at appeasing Democrats, including a $115 million reduction in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations, a decrease of 5,500 ICE detention beds and a $1.8 billion cut in Border Patrol funding. It also strengthens oversight of ICE through the Office of the Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

But those figures are a drop in the bucket relative to the funding increases for immigration enforcement included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And liberals had wanted party leaders to go much further by slashing ICE’s budget and installing new rules governing the conduct of ICE officers, including a ban on face masks and explicit warrant requirements prior to arrests.

Those Democrats say the death of Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen and mother of three, at the hands of an ICE officer in Minnesota is evidence Congress needs to rein in an out-of-control agency.

They likely don’t have the numbers to block the bill, given the support of leadership in both parties, but their resistance could create headaches for Democratic leaders, who have faced outside criticism that they haven’t fought back fiercely enough against Trump’s norm-breaking return to office, including on immigration enforcement.

“I think ICE should be abolished, to be honest with you,” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said last week. “This is like Trump’s secret police that is armed en masse, wandering the streets going door to door.”

“It’s got to be a new iteration of immigration enforcement,” echoed Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas). “I think ICE has — its usefulness as an organization, because of what it’s become, has expired.”

Liberals aren’t expected to take issue with only the DHS bill.

The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday rolled out three other spending bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies. The bills are bundled into a single package, known as a minibus, that the House will vote on later this week.

The House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to consider the minibus and the DHS bill.

Notably absent from the minibus, however, is an extension of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, long sought by Democrats. It also doesn’t address Trump’s threats toward Venezuela and Greenland.

The health care issue is what precipitated last year’s 43-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month.
Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.
The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.
As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.” The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE.","A 23-year-old Iowa man who has lived in the United States since he was a year old was detained by federal immigration agents and jailed in Muscatine County while being unlawfully denied a bond hearing, a federal judge has ruled.

The ruling comes in a civil case where the federal government’s efforts to hire “deportation judges” — normally referred to as immigration judges — is alleged by the plaintiff to be part of an effort to hire judges whose views align with President Donald Trump’s political goals.

The case involves Giovanni Uribe-Gonzalez, 23, of Hawkeye, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November 2025 after a drunken driving arrest and then placed in the Muscatine County Jail pending possible deportation.

According to court filings by Uribe-Gonzalez’s attorney, Amy Cummings, he was brought to the United States by his mother when he was 1 year old.

“As toddler, he took his first steps on Iowa soil, and he learned to read and write in Iowa classrooms where he was always liked by his peers and teachers. He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month. “His every recollection and dream starts and ends in the Hawkeye state, and his identity, values and culture were forged here shaping him into a quintessential American Midwesterner.”

Cummings told the court that in 2021 Uribe-Gonzalez’s family had saved enough money to pay his $495 filing fee for citizenship under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA). While the government accepted the fee, Cummings alleged, it never fully processed his application and that matter is still pending with no final action taken.

After graduating from West Central High School in Maynard, Uribe-Gonzalez enrolled in a training program for railroad welders, earned his certification, applied for jobs and was then rejected due to his citizenship status. In 2025, he was twice arrested for drunken driving, with both arrests resulting in a conviction on a charge of first-offense drunken driving.

Court records show that after his second arrest in November, he was detained Chickasaw County, where ICE placed a hold on him, preventing his release although an Iowa judge had allowed him to post bond.

According to the court records, David Bindert, an Iowa-based deportation officer with ICE, noted in his written report of the detention that Uribe-Gonzalez had a DACA application pending, but added that Uribe-Gonzalez had “no legal presence in the United States” and was subject to being detained by ICE.

Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.

Attorney cites ad for ‘deportation judges’

As with thousands of other ICE detainees across the country in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice took the position that the federal law providing for the mandatory detention of detainees applies not just to people who apprehended at the border — which is how the law has been interpreted and applied for decades — but also to people who may have entered the country illegally months or years earlier.

The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.

Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.

Despite those rulings, ICE and county jails in Iowa and the rest of the country have continued to hold individuals for indefinite periods without affording them the opportunity to argue for their release on bond. The cases where those practices have been rejected are those in which the detainees have taken their case to U.S. District Court and argued their due process rights are being violated.

On Dec. 16, 2025, Cummings filed such a lawsuit on behalf of Uribe-Gonzalez in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, naming President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and others as the respondents.

As part of her petition seeking a bond hearing for her client, Cummings noted that the federal government has fired dozens of immigration judges and then advertised for “deportation judges” that Cummings argues are intended to “better align” with Trump’s political goals.

As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.”

The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America. Apply today to become a deportation judge and you may be entitled to these benefits: $159,951 to $207,500 per year… DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher ruled in Uribe-Gonzalez’s favor on the bond-hearing issue, noting that district courts across the nation have ruled that such detainees are entitled to a hearing at which they can argue for their release.

The available court records don’t indicate whether such a hearing has been held.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ad-Gavel2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:59:27.450653

Mr. Bovino described a highly organized opposition to federal agents in Minnesota, beyond what he had seen in other places, that had made it challenging to carry out their work.
“We demand more from our federal government — more professionalism, more accountability, more humanity,” said Sheriff Witt, who said she was especially concerned about claims of racial profiling by federal agents.","Three top Minnesota police officials on Tuesday criticized the tactics that federal agents have used during their immigration crackdown and described a region where residents, including those with legal status, were scared to venture outside.

Two of the officials said they knew of United States citizens, including a police officer and city workers, who had been stopped and questioned by immigration agents. And they expressed concern that the Trump administration’s surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota was undermining residents’ trust in law enforcement and disrupting daily life.

“Can we find a way to make sure that we can do these things without scaring the hell out of our community members and freaking everyone out?” Chief Axel Henry of the St. Paul Police Department asked at a news conference on Tuesday. He added that many people in his city “are scared to death” and “afraid to go outside.”

Federal officials responded by criticizing state and local politicians and defending agents’ actions.

“Our operations are lawful. They’re targeted and they’re focused on individuals who pose a serious threat to this community,” Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official, said in a separate news conference in the Minneapolis area.

The local officials’ news conference, which also included Sheriff Dawanna S. Witt of Hennepin County and Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park police, revealed the escalating tensions between federal officials and Minnesota law enforcement leaders.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly criticized state and local policies that limit coordination with immigration agents. On Tuesday, the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the offices of at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota — including Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul — related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mr. Walz dismissed the investigation in a statement as a “partisan distraction.”

“Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace than baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,” the governor said in a statement.

Elected leaders in Minnesota have repeatedly called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to leave the state, and a lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul claims that the surge is unconstitutional.

The Trump administration has defended its work in Minnesota as necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and root out fraud in state social service programs. In a court filing on Monday, the administration said that more than 3,000 people who were in the country illegally had been arrested during the campaign. Many of those people, federal officials said, had been convicted of serious crimes.

Mr. Bovino described a highly organized opposition to federal agents in Minnesota, beyond what he had seen in other places, that had made it challenging to carry out their work. Responding to local officials’ criticism of federal tactics, Mr. Bovino said that “those tactics are born of necessity” and that “what we do is legal, ethical and moral.”

But in their news conference, the local police officials criticized what they described as a heavy-handed federal approach.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.","Community members continue to take precautions amid sightings of federal immigration agents in Maine, though an increase in operations is unclear as the Trump administration remains mum.

Multiple sightings throughout Southern Maine on Tuesday, beginning during the morning commute with five armed agents in three unmarked vehicles in Portland, have been confirmed by volunteer verifying teams working with a community watch hotline.

Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the hotline has received increased calls in recent days, from roughly one per day to now one to three calls per minute.

“The calls are a mix of people having questions about safety and what’s going on, people needing to be connected to resources, a big number of bad faith callers and the potential sightings,” Torres told Maine Morning Star.

These sightings come after the mayors of Portland and Lewiston announced last week that they were expecting an increase in federal immigration enforcement in their communities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not confirmed nor denied a forthcoming escalation in Maine and did not respond to requests for comment on the recent sightings.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said Tuesday there was an “increased presence” of ICE agents but did not respond to questions about how he made his determination. It’s unclear at this time whether recent sightings amount to an uptick. Immigration arrests have been occurring across Maine, with an acceleration beginning in June as President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda got underway.

The hotline, organized by MIRC and the People’s Coalition for Safety, is built for the purpose of identifying federal activity — with more than 300 people trained as verifiers. Organizers are now working to gather details about people who have been detained. They’ve also raised alarm about AI-generated images and the importance of thoroughly investigating each tip before sharing it publicly.

Portland, Lewiston prep for potential uptick in federal immigration operations

As this work ramps up, communities are taking precautions. Immigrants are staying home. More school absences are being reported.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School in Portland were in a brief lock out, meaning external doors were closed to people entering or leaving, because of potential immigration enforcement activity on Brighton Avenue, district communications coordinator Tess Nacelewicz said.

Chief of the Penobscot Nation Kirk Francis told tribal citizens to carry their identification when traveling, especially near border regions or transportation hubs. Francis had encouraged this at the start of Trump’s second term, too. Citizens of other tribes have been picked up by ICE elsewhere in the country.

Undercover license plates

The Trump administration has begun relying on unmarked vehicles in immigration enforcement, raising concern about people being able to keep track of those taken by authorities and file legal actions without knowing the agency involved.

After receiving a request last week from U.S. Customs and Border patrol for undercover license plates, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows paused the issuance of such plates.

State law permits the use of unmarked vehicles for law enforcement when authorized by the secretary of state. The law also makes it so records for all unmarked vehicle registrations are confidential, therefore Bellows declined to share how many plates were requested. This is the first time Bellows, a Democrat, has paused these plates for federal authorities during her tenure.

Federal agencies can still request general government plates — which in their case would read “U.S. government.” Those plates are generally identifiable as government vehicles, and in the public registration database, they link back to the place of business for that agency.

DHS and ICE declined to say how many undercover plates they requested in Maine.

“DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers’ backs,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

There have been numerous instances captured on video showing agents in plain clothes not immediately identifying themselves, while arresting people who have no gang association nor criminal history. As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

There have also been cases where federal immigration agents detained U.S. citizens. On Sunday in Minnesota, for example, a U.S. citizen said agents raided his home at gunpoint without a warrant, forcing him outside wearing only shorts in below freezing conditions before detaining him and returning him home later that day without explanation. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that they aim to strip more foreign-born Americans of their citizenship.

McLaughlin claimed their officers are facing a “1300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks against them including domestic terrorists following our officers and ramming them with vehicles.”

DHS didn’t provide evidence to support those figures, or for similar claims it has made in the past. The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.

“There are legitimate reasons for unmarked plates. Law enforcement in Maine use them routinely for undercover, confidential operations,” Bellows said. “Given what’s happening in Minnesota, and what had taken place in Illinois, we paused issuance of those plates until we can get some assurances that Maine plates won’t be used for lawless purposes.”

In Minnesota, observers have reported ICE and DHS agents switching out and removing license plates on the vehicles they’re using for immigration operations, which is generally against state law. The state has since sued ICE and DHS over that practice, among others.

Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued federal authorities over this practice, after the state launched a plate watch hotline to give residents a way to report suspected license plate tampering.

When asked what type of assurance would satisfy lifting the pause in Maine, Bellows said her department would need more information from the federal agencies about why they are needed and what they’d be used for.

Bellows, who is currently running for governor, said on Monday she was doxxed for her decision. She said she received more than two dozen threatening phone calls after her cell phone and home address were posted online.

Emphasis on nonviolence comes from all corners

Since local officials announced the suspected uptick in immigration operations, Mainers have peacefully gathered to protest around the state. But, the district’s chief federal prosecutor is still calling for protestors to heed to his warning about violence. At the same time, a so-called militia group with a rallying cry to stop “left-wing violence” is trying to build its ranks.

In Portland, hundreds denounced ICE during a protest on Sunday in Monument Square. In Wells, about 130 people stood out near Route 1 demanding the federal agency leave Maine, an action that corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Local organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive, emphasizing that their efforts to verify activity and provide mutual aid are rooted in non-violence and focused on de-escalation tactics.

“I think there’s a narrative right now that there’s a desire to agitate, but our work really is rooted in non-violence and showing up for community and keeping loving and steady and calming presence,” said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine.

Despite that, on Sunday a group called the “Pine Guard” announced it would be forming to counteract “far-left socialist” ICE critics, including by sending people undercover to anti-ICE actions.

“It is not the role of the Pine Guard to physically confront the far-left Socialists, but instead to expose them,” the group wrote on social media.

Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

Benson, who was nominated by Trump in September and formerly served as a Maine District Court Judge and homicide prosecutor, wrote, “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is also running for U.S. Senate, has also called for protests to be peaceful — “to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.”

Without pointing to specifics, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition issued a statement Saturday in response to what the group categorized “inﬂammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives.”

“Recent portrayals suggesting sudden or extraordinary activity are inaccurate and contribute to unnecessary alarm,” the coalition wrote about federal law enforcement actions. “Political spin and sensational media coverage distract from facts and place officers and community members at greater risk.”

Increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents have been documented under the Trump administration: smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, and spraying chemical agents. In some cases, immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing.

On Friday, a federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters, granting a preliminary injunction preventing federal officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day.","Donald Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 has been a nightmare for immigrants and for the country. The administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda brought forth an onslaught of cruel, violent policies intended to sow fear, suppress dissent, and vilify immigrants. Taking stock of all of Trump’s actions on immigration in 2025 is nearly impossible. This is, of course, by design. The Trump administration’s goal was to “flood the zone” with a flurry of policy changes to overwhelm us. But in spite of its efforts to quash any opposition, activists, organizers, lawyers, journalists, and ordinary people across the country have mounted an incredible resistance to the mass deportation agenda.

A year into Trump’s second term, the White House’s blanket defense of the brutal murder of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis has rattled the nation. Conditions inside detention have deteriorated so much that at least six people have died while in ICE custody since January 3, 2026. (In comparison in 2024 a total of 11 people died in detention). Calls to abolish ICE are once again gaining steam. The years ahead will no doubt continue to be violent (and deadly) for immigrants and those who support them. But this moment presents an opening to build toward dismantling the enforcement apparatus. Reflecting on 2025 through an abolitionist lens is critical as we develop strategies to combat the ongoing mass deportation agenda.

Although Trump 2.0 has inaugurated a new era in state and vigilante violence against immigrants, the administration’s actions build on a long history of anti-Black racism, criminalization, and U.S. militarism that have fueled the detention and deportation machine’s growth over time.

In the first half of 2025, a radical new order for the U.S. deportation regime appeared to be on the horizon. A series of stark new policy departures sowed widespread panic and threw affected communities and political opponents into disarray. Terrifying as the administration’s draconian actions were, many of its early measures were defeated by resistance, rejected by the courts, or collapsed due to poor planning.

An early trial balloon occurred in March when ICE began arresting international student activists, such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who had been involved in Palestine solidarity efforts. In their cases the guise of immigration enforcement was used to detain and punish immigrant students for what were essentially thought crimes, sending a chilling message about the limits of free speech. These pretextual detentions dwindled after being challenged in the courts and eliciting ferocious public disapproval.

The Trump administration also rapidly moved to start detaining immigrants outside the country. At first, interest focused on Guantánamo Bay, where detention capacity would be raised to 30,000, and in an echo of the war on terror, “high-priority criminal aliens” were to be held.

When this plan largely fell through, the offshore experiment continued when Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in the spring to justify transferring over 200 immigrants to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison in El Salvador. The administration emphasized false allegations that those sent to CECOT, who were mostly Venezuelan, were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, using innocuous tattoos as supposed evidence.

The unlawful detentions at CECOT were paired with a right-wing media campaign featuring Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Republicans in photo ops that evoked the images of U.S. soldiers posing with people tortured at the Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War.

The transfers to CECOT represented another sensational action used to scare immigrant communities and vilify Venezuelans who have, like Palestinians, been on the receiving end of U.S. foreign policy. Yet the threat of mass deportations to El Salvador and the prospect of incarcerating U.S. citizens at the prison have been stalled by multiple layers of resistance.

Despite this, the administration has doubled down on third country deportations, where immigrants are sent to countries to which they have no ties and where they are often subject to detention or other forms of punishment upon their arrival. The Trump administration and State Department have reached out to at least 58 countries, the vast majority of which are on the African continent, to establish transfer agreements for these deportations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is intentional: “The farther away from America the better, so they can’t come back across the border.”

The small numbers of individuals sent to South Sudan or elsewhere have been vitriolically branded “barbaric criminal illegal aliens.” Yet Orville Etoria, a 63-year-old Jamaican immigrant who had lived in the U.S. for nearly 50 years, poignantly described the experience of being expelled to Eswatini in an interview with The New Yorker: “To be honest, it helped me imagine how the slaves might have felt, going to another land in shackles and chains — that loneliness, that disconnect, that sense of loss.”

Although the absolute number of people being detained offshore or deported to other countries is relatively small, it is important that we challenge these practices for what they portend.

While the Trump administration excels in creating terrifying spectacles, the most significant development of this last year, and one that builds on decades of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement, was the passage of the massive funding bill in July. Congress’s budget reconciliation bill, which allocated an additional $170 billion for immigration enforcement over four years, was an ominous milestone in the history of U.S. immigration policy and the Trump administration’s aspiring fascism. This funding makes ICE the largest law enforcement agency in the country, with a bigger budget than the Bureau of Prisons, FBI, and most militaries in the world. If ICE’s expansion plans are realized, the immigration detention system will triple in size — detaining 120,000-150,000 people at any given time, mirroring the scale of Japanese American internment during WWII.

For years, ICE’s ability to arrest and detain immigrants depended heavily on local police collaborations. Sheriffs’ departments rounded up immigrants, making county jails a gateway to the deportation process. This local dimension was key to building up the immigration enforcement machine. Conversely, sanctuary policy effectively curtailed ICE’s use of local law enforcement in some parts of the country, bringing deportations down.

Now Trump is attempting to create his own occupying army for resistant localities. Initially this took the form of National Guard troops that — along with ICE agents — descended on Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, carrying out military-style raids utilizing tear gas and stun grenades. But after the bill passed, ICE had more resources. In a matter of months, the number of ICE agents doubled from 10,000 to 22,000.

Now, as we are seeing in Minneapolis, where anti-Black racism and bogus fraud charges against the Somali community have driven right-wing attacks, ICE is using indiscriminate force against immigrants, their supporters, and even uninvolved onlookers. Renee Nicole Good’s murder was a preview of what’s to come if ICE continues to lay siege to our communities.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. As Harvard professor Theda Skocpol put it regarding ICE’s expansion and its potential to become a more centralized federal police force: “The Miller-Trumpites are not interested only in rounding up undocumented immigrants. They will step up using ICE and DOJ enforcements use to harass Democrats, citizen critics, and subvert future elections if they can.”

But it’s worth remembering that the Democrats have long enabled this spiraling enforcement agenda. Last time there was a major effort toward comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 under Obama, the proposed Senate bill only passed after a $46 billion border surge amendment was added at the last minute. With citizenship on the table, the Democrats were willing to make any deal, no matter how harmful it was. Their devil’s bargain of accepting more border militarization and more criminalization only served to further dehumanize immigrant communities. The pre-Trump tradition of bipartisan support for immigration enforcement and the Democrats’ failure to challenge the scapegoating and demonization of immigrants has opened the door to the paramilitarization of American life.

The growing infrastructure for detention and deportation remains the greatest threat to immigrant communities. Detention facilitates deportation, and having more bed capacity means ICE can arrest and deport more people. Since Trump took office, immigration detention has expanded by 83 percent with 73,000 people currently detained each day. ICE has increased the use of private prisons and county jails, converted federal and state prisons and military bases into camps, and is proposing to lock up another 80,000 people using warehouses. Another prison boom is taking place, and as we’ve seen with the rise in mass incarceration over time, it is much harder to bring down these systems once they are built.

It has been a terrifying start to the year. Yet the resistance to the mass deportation agenda is palpable. Roughly 1,000 actions took place across the country the weekend after Good’s death. Local communities are building neighborhood defense networks. From California to Florida, activists are challenging detention expansion through local and state level strategies: blocking zoning permits, filing environmental justice litigation, pushing state legislators, and organizing locally. In small towns in Georgia and New Hampshire, residents have resisted proposed warehouses for detention. A coalition of grassroots and national groups secured a victory when Avelo Airlines decided to end its contract with ICE. Support for ICE has gone down considerably. In a recent YouGov poll, 52 percent of people said they disapprove of how the agency is operating.

The momentum against ICE presents an opportunity for building abolitionist power against the system. It could also help open space for making the case against the broader prison-industrial complex that helped grow the detention and deportation system in the first place.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2239258674-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:58:35.259245

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.
A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.
The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.
In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.","President Donald Trump's first year in office has been characterised by sweeping changes to international aid, human rights policies, immigration and U.S. governance at home and abroad.

He signed a record number of executive orders in his first 100 days, many of which targeted transgender and non-binary rights, access to gender-affirming care and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the United States.

But LGBTQ+ people have been affected across the world, with gaps in humanitarian funding, an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, fewer discrimination protections and cuts to refugee programmes.

Here's what you need to know.

What did Trump do in his first year of office?

On his first day as president, Trump declared that the government would only recognise two genders and that federal funds would not be used to ""promote gender identity.""

He then ordered the removal of online government guidance documents on trans issues, an end to DEI programmes and that trans female inmates be sent to men's prisons.

Trump also sought to undo multiple executive orders by his predecessor Joe Biden, including directives to advance LGBTQ+ equality and combat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

He reinstated a ban on trans people serving in the military, ended federal support for gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19 and vowed to defund schools teaching ""gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.""

Another executive order barred trans women from competing in women's categories of sport.

He also dismantled the U.S. Agency for Development, hitting HIV services and rights groups around the globe. The administration's review of funding in March confirmed 83% of the aid programmes had been terminated.

The administration later cut funding for a suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ+ youth when it slashed the Health and Human Services Department's budget.

The secretary of health in December moved to cut children's access to gender-affirming care by barring hospitals from delivering such care under government health insurance programmes.

Rainbow crosswalks were removed in Florida and Texas - including a memorial to the 49 people shot dead at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016 - to comply with the transportation secretary's instructions to make roadway markings ""free from distractions.""

What impact have the policies had in the U.S.?

A record number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced across the country in 2025, including more than 1,000 targeting trans rights, according to the research organisation Trans Legislation Tracker.

Nearly one in 10 trans adults and 5% of all LGBTQ+ adults surveyed between November 2024 and June 2025 said they had moved to a different state due to LGBTQ-related laws or politics, according to the think tank Movement Advancement Project.

In July, Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk jailed in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn marriage equality across the United States. The Supreme Court rejected the bid in November.

A fresh lawsuit was submitted to federal courts by Texas judge Dianne Hensley, who has previously refused to wed same-sex couples, in December.

More than 200 former employees of the Justice Department who quit their roles under Trump said the administration was ""largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights"" and warned that the rights of all Americans were at risk.

Corporations including Mastercard, Boeing, Deloitte, Target and Walmart scaled back their sponsorships and donations to LGBTQ+ groups in 2025, with Pride organisers stating that funds for their events were cut.

Have people been impacted internationally?

The Trump administration's cuts to global humanitarian programmes and foreign aid have led to 2.5 million people losing access to HIV medication and thrown rights organisations into a funding crisis.

The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a landmark U.S. initiative from 2003 to fight HIV around the world, stopped HIV prevention for most groups at a higher risk of an infection, including gay and bisexual men.

Activists in Africa shared how Trump's rhetoric had emboldened anti-LGBTQ+ actors. For example, support for the Ghana's harsh Family Values bill has grown.

Trump reduced refugee admissions by 94%, leaving tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ people in limbo in places like Kenya and South Sudan.

The State Department's annual human rights report, published in August, had sections on LGBTQ+ rights reduced or removed, as well as on discrimination based on gender or race.

In November, a senior State Department official said U.S. officials would record DEI policies and gender-affirming care for minors in other countries as human rights infringements.

Pride organisers across Europe also lost corporate sponsorships in countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Denmark, Britain and Estonia due to the ""Trump effect.""

Roul held a news conference on Tuesday, marking one year into President Donald Trump's second term in office.

Over the past 365 days, Illinois has filed more than 50 lawsuits.

The attorney general said the state is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration challenging everything from federal funding freezes to ""aggressive and unconstitutional"" immigration enforcement tactics.

Raoul said his office has been trying to combat what they deem unlawful actions in Trump's first year of his second term.

SEE ALSO | 1 year into Trump's 2nd term, here are some of the seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policies

This includes Customs and Border Patrol tactics and National Guard deployment.

President Trump has signed many executive orders the past year aimed at reducing federal bureaucracy, expanding immigration enforcement that's lowered illegal border crossings, and signed major tax legislation, which proponents argue, has lowered taxes for many Americans.

Raoul spoke about the strain the legal battles are putting on his staff.

""Just one day after the inauguration, together with my fellow attorneys general, we filed our first lawsuit during the administration to protect birthright citizenship,"" he said. ""As a proud son of Haitian immigrants born at the time that my mother was not yet naturalized, I am a birthright citizen. So, our first action could not have been more personal for me. As a survivor of the cancer that took my father and both my grandfathers, protecting funding for cancer research could not be more personal for me.""

Raoul said the AG's office has fought to protect voter registration requirements, public health programs, like infectious disease labs, birthright citizenship from being terminated, and funding for critical medical care.

In total, the AG's office says it's protected over $6.6 billion dollars in state funding.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18437855_kwame-trump-split-ap-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-20 19:58:32.590155

“The Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles received a request for confidential, undercover Maine license plates from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in a statement.

“We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” she added.

Maine is a sanctuary state, meaning it limits local authorities’ compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) has strongly encouraged residents to stay vigilant amid the surge in immigration enforcement activity launched by the Trump administration.

“To the federal government I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said in a video statement last week.

“To the people of Maine: I know you care deeply about protecting your neighbors, as do I. And I know that many of you are angry about the potential for any enhanced federal law enforcement presence in Maine. I feel that too,” she added.

The Democratic governor encouraged residents to meet hostility with “reserve and resolve.”

Her push for safety comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are expected to arrive in Portland, Maine, and Lewiston, Maine, in the coming days. Mills words follow the death of Minnesota mother Renee Good, who was killed by an ICE officer. Agents told her to step out of the vehicle, but she instead tried to drive away, and an officer fired shots into the car.

The Trump administration has described her as a “domestic terrorist” who used her vehicle as a “deadly weapon” to evade law enforcement.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/ice_immigration_01272025_AP25027710583865.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 20:58:22.657803

5 p.m.: Kennedy Park soccer games suspended amid ICE worries

A group that coordinates pickup soccer games in Portland’s Kennedy Park has indefinitely paused operations as concerns of heightened immigration enforcement have its members on edge.

Anthony Fiori, a leader from the Kennedy Park Pickup Soccer group, said organizers canceled a game planned for last week amid rumors of upcoming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Fiori said he worried ICE could target the games and members who participate, noting that several of players have already been detained.

He did not know when the games might be able to resume. The group last hosted games earlier in January.

“We’re pretty nervous about the players, of course. And the players themselves are just very scared,” Fiori said on a Friday phone call. “We just really have no clue. We kind of feel like we’re working in the dark here.”

In the meantime, team members are coordinating with each other to collect details, like names and immigration statuses, of players who may be at risk, he said.

“We learned a lot of lessons from when Joel Andre got detained,” Fiori said. “If someone goes missing … we can at least search the ICE database to see if they’ve been detained and see where they are.”

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline confirmed an “increased presence” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the city Tuesday afternoon.

“I know, given the national news, this may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” Sheline said in a written statement. “In moments like this, what matters most is how we show up for one another and that we remember who we are and what we stand for as Mainers: the rule of law, the right to peacefully protest, and compassion for our neighbors.”

Sheline asked that residents remain calm and peaceful and rely only on verified information. He also cautioned residents to check in on their neighbors and know their constitutional rights, and said anyone encountering ICE agents should remain calm.

“Lewiston is a city shaped by people from many places and many stories,” Sheline said. “Our differences are not a fault line. They are the strong foundation of who we are. Every person deserves to feel safe, respected, and treated with dignity.”

1:30 p.m.: Absences higher than normal at South Portland schools

There were an “unusually higher” number of absences Tuesday at South Portland schools as rumors of immigration enforcement spread, Superintendent George Entwistle said.

While no immigration enforcement officers have shown up on or near South Portland school grounds to his knowledge, staff and students have been on edge, he said.

The district, in partnership with the University Maine Law School’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, will host two training sessions related to immigration issues in the coming weeks. Those have been in the works for months, Entwistle said, but they take on new urgency in the current moment.

Advertisement

The first is an in-person training on Jan. 28 for all school clerks, presenting practical responses and discussion about immigration enforcement to the front-line personnel should immigration enforcement officers present themselves at schools. The second training, scheduled for Feb. 24, is virtually available to all staff members, and it will discuss current issues in immigration and schools.

“Things are very upsetting,” Entwistle said. “These trainings are a good way to feel like they can manage anything they have to manage to protect our students.”

Entwistle said his district is considering additional training for specific people, such as social workers, school psychologists and coaches.

1:15 p.m.: Penobscot Nation chief urges tribal members to carry tribal ID

Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis on Tuesday issued a statement on Facebook urging members to carry identification cards issued by the tribe.

Francis said he was not aware of any ICE activity on Penobscot lands or any interactions between agents and tribal members. However, he said, members of federally recognized tribes in other states have been arrested by ICE, and tribal identification has not always proved to be sufficient proof of citizenship.

“We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,” Francis wrote. “News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands. The Tribal government has verified that some of these reports are true, and some are false.”

Francis said ICE agents are inadequately trained on the use of tribal identification and documentation to prove citizenship, but that a former tribal chairman who advises U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is working to resolve the issue.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, tribal documents can fall into the same category as a U.S. Citizen I.D card.

Francis encouraged tribal citizens to review guidelines issued by the Native American Rights Fund in the event a tribal member is approached by ICE.

“Our Penobscot Nation has endured many challenges throughout our history, and we continue to stand strong together,” he wrote. “The Tribal Council remains committed to protecting the rights, safety, and sovereignty of our people. We will continue to monitor ICE activities and keep you informed.”

1 p.m.: South Portland schools’ plans if ICE arrives

South Portland schools’ policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and to direct agents towards the main office should they enter private property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

Should immigration officers appear on or near South Portland school grounds, staff members are instructed to stay calm, direct the officer to the front office and not answer any questions about students or families’ status, according to the school department’s policy.

Front office clerks should contact the principal while asking the officer to remain in the main office. The principal should then contact the superintendent’s office to review legal documents and warrants.

The policy also reminds staff that administrative immigration warrants authorizing federal officers to arrest someone for an immigration violation do not function as judicial warrants, allowing officers to access and search nonpublic spaces. The school department’s plan instructs front line staff to collect these documents and contact their principal, who would then contact the superintendent’s office for legal review.

Staff members are instructed to not physically interfere with officers should they try to move into nonpublic spaces. They should instead protect students by keeping them in the classroom when instructed, calling the principal and moving students away from officers.

If there are officers visibly near school grounds or at bus stops, administrators may opt to increase adult presence at arrival and dismissal.

The department may host information sessions for families about “rights, preparedness and available support” in partnership with legal and community organizations, according to the plan. Offerings would include a virtual option and translated materials as needed to support vulnerable members of the community.

Social workers, counselors, clerks will receive training from legal partners about what they can do or discuss and when to connect a family to an attorney.

12:45 p.m.: 2 Portland schools briefly go on ‘lockout’ amid report of nearby ICE arrest

Portland Public Schools administrators initiated a brief lockout at two campuses — Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School, both on Stevens Avenue — shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday morning after learning about potential immigration enforcement activity on nearby Brighton Avenue, district spokesperson Tess Nacelewicz said.

The lockouts involved closing external doors to people entering or leaving the schools, Nacelewicz said, but administrators determined there was no threat to the schools, and the lockouts were lifted within minutes.

“This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” Nacelewicz said. “The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning.”

A video of ICE agents at a Cumberland Farms gas station on Brighton, less than half a mile from the high school, was widely circulated on social media Tuesday morning.

Nacelewicz did not respond immediately to questions about how the district was notified about the possible enforcement activity.

Subpoenas target Minnesota leaders opposing Trump's immigration enforcement

Federal agents' actions in Minneapolis have sparked protests

Minnesota Democrats call investigation politically motivated

Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to ""cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities."" Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED FOR CALM

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation ""a partisan distraction"" that ""does not seek justice.""

""Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community,"" his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying ""to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs"" and that ""every American should be concerned."" ""We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,"" he said.

The statement comes as reports of an increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine began intensifying Tuesday, especially in greater Portland, days after officials began to warn of a potential surge of federal immigration enforcement.

Local officials in Portland, Lewiston and Biddeford, home to many of the state’s immigrant residents, have spoke of an anticipated spike in ICE activity — even as the Department of Homeland Security refuses to confirm any such plans.

Below is Sheline’s complete statement:

As of today, January 20, 2026, there is an increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Lewiston.

I know, given the national news, this may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community. In moments like this, what matters most is how we show up for one another and that we remember who we are and what we stand for as Mainers: the rule of law, the right to peacefully protest, and compassion for our neighbors.

For more accomplishments, read the press release: Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the Department of Homeland Security Has Historic Year.","Secretary Noem Keeps America Safe, Transforms DHS

WASHINGTON – On November 5, 2024, the American people gave President Donald Trump a clear mandate to secure our borders, end illegal immigration, take criminal aliens off our streets, protect the American taxpayer, and Make America Safe Again. Since taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump has delivered on this mandate from the American people in historic fashion thanks to the hardworking men and women the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Under the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s leadership this past year, DHS has been hard at work restoring the rule of law, delivering the most secure border ever, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, creating safer communities, strengthening cyber defense, fixing disaster response, launching initiatives that are reshaping American travel and national security, and making America safe for generations to come.

DHS has set the stage to break even more records and make even more history in President Trump’s second year.

“In President Trump’s first year back in office, nearly 3 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, including an estimated 2.2 million self-deportations and more than 675,000 deportations.”

“In the last year, fentanyl trafficking at the southern border has also been cut by more than half compared to the same period in 2024,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “The U.S. Coast Guard alone seized enough cocaine to kill more than 177 million Americans.”

“Meanwhile, we have saved taxpayers more than $13.2 billion here at DHS. Countless lives have been saved, communities have been strengthened, and the American people have been put first again.”

Securing the Border to Historic Levels

President Trump ran on securing the border and fixing the border crisis that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden. In his first year in his office, President Trump delivered the most secure border in U.S. history.

Since May, the United States Border Patrol has released zero illegal aliens into the country. Apprehensions at the southern border have reached historic lows.

In fact, total U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions along the southwest border in the first year of the current administration (90,084) were less than the average month during the Biden administration (155,485). USBP apprehensions over the last 12 months were the lowest ever recorded in CBP history (i.e., both Jan. 20-Jan.20 and Jan-Dec.)

In President Trump’s first year, USBP recorded 95% fewer encounters per day along the southwest border than during the Biden administration, with daily average encounters along the southwest border 1,936% higher during the Biden administration than during the first year of the current administration.

Currently, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the current administration to date are 251. Meanwhile, USBP’s daily average southwest border encounters under the Biden administration were 5,110.

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 9,000 per month since President Trump took office – a level of sustained deterrence unmatched in modern border history. USBP had never previously recorded a single month below 10,000 nationwide apprehensions dating back to 1992.

In January 2026, the border received additional reinforcement when CBP commenced installation of the first waterborne barriers funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the Rio Grande Valley Sector.

During the first year of the current administration, CBP also implemented 42 Presidential Actions on trade, addressing illicit drugs, public safety threats, and critical imports.

Through the end of December, CBP collected $297 billion from all tariffs, taxes, and fees (total customs revenue).

CBP will continue to play a central role in executing the President’s tariff policy as trade enforcement and revenue collection authorities and will continue working closely with DHS and other partner agencies to deliver a world-class, seamless, and secure experience for all travelers and participants at the FIFA World Cup 2026. These efforts will include implementing robust security measures while ensuring efficient facilitation, utilizing advanced technologies, strengthening strategic partnerships, and executing extensive operational planning across all U.S. host cities and key ports of entry.

The border wall will also be receiving reinforcement in 2026, with CBP moving quickly to obligate funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July 2025, with over $11 billion of the $46.5 billion in funds obligated to date, for border wall construction.

In 2026, CBP will continue to deliver the most secure border ever and continue to support ICE operations by arresting and removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our nation’s interior.

Ending the Scourge of Illegal Immigration

President Donald Trump promised to end the scourge of illegal immigration and deport illegal aliens.

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers, thanks to the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), CBP, and other law enforcement immigration enforcement agencies. Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are criminal illegal aliens who have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.

Nearly 3 million illegal aliens are out of the country, as DHS has removed more than 675,000 illegal aliens and estimated 2.2 million illegal aliens have self-deported.

ICE and CBP have conducted operations in cities nationwide, resulting in hundreds of thousands of arrests.

In late December, for example, ICE announced the successful conclusion of Operation Angel’s Honor, a 14-day operation named in honor of Laken Riley, during which the agency arrested more than 1,030 criminal illegal aliens under the authority of the Laken Riley Act — a law signed by President Trump in 2025 that mandates that any illegal alien who has been accused of a violent crime such as theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, or any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury must be placed under arrest.

Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are convicted criminals or have criminal charges. During President Trump’s first year, ICE arrested 43,305 potential national security risks. ICE has arrested 1,416 known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) and has removed 1,392 KSTs, and more than 7,000 gang arrests.

Now, in 2026, ICE has the ground running with 120% more officers and agents after hiring 12,000 Americans to help President Trump deliver on his signature promise.

In 2025, DHS paved the way for state and local law enforcement to arrests criminal illegal aliens off our streets in President Trump’s second year.

In President Trump’s first year, DHS secured more than 1,255 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g).

Thanks to the 287(g) program, DHS partnered with the State of Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, the State of Indiana on the Speedway Slammer, the state of Nebraska on Cornhusker Clink, and the State of Louisiana on Louisiana Lockup to expand detention space by the thousands.

This tremendous enforcement of the law has resulted in safer cities, plummeting fentanyl overdoses, cheaper rents, higher wages, and a better quality of life for millions of Americans.

Finding 132,000 Children Biden’s Lost

Under President Trump, DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services have located 132,720 unaccompanied children that the Biden administration lost. Too many of these children were exploited and abused before, during, and after being trafficked over our borders. All told, the Biden administration lost more than 450,000 children because of its open border policies. We will continue to ramp up efforts and will not stop until every last child is found

Putting the U.S. Citizen First in America’s Immigration System

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is restoring integrity to our nation’s immigration policies and has instituted dynamic changes to ensure that only individuals who love America, align with our culture, and share our values, are welcomed into the country. Most importantly, Secretary Noem and President Trump are making sure that any form of legal immigration will benefit the U.S. citizen and does not pose harm to our well-bring and way of life.

In President Trump’s first year, USCIS made history with its fraud investigation, Operation Twin Shield, the agency’s largest enforcement operation to date. Launched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USCIS focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, attempted over 2,000 site visits to homes and workplaces, and completed nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with aliens during the operation. USCIS found evidence of fraud, non-compliance with immigration law, or public safety or national security concerns in more than 500 of cases.

In year two, USCIS is implementing the Department of Homeland Security’s new rule to prioritize the allocation of H-1B visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, which will better American protect wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers.

Last week, USCIS announced a new rule that reduces wait times for thousands of religious organizations and their communities—including priests, nuns, and rabbis—who previously were required to remain outside the United States before returning to resume their essential services. This rule protects and preserves freedom and expression of religion while easing burdens on those who shape the social and moral fabric of the country.

Under an updated policy confirming USCIS’ role as an immigration enforcement agency, agency officers are once again empowered to enforce immigration law by issuing Notices to Appear. So far, they have done so in historic numbers. Since January 20, USCIS officers have issued approximately 196,600 Notices to Appear to place aliens in removal proceedings.

USCIS has begun recruiting Homeland Defenders, who will better support the agency’s mission and bolster efforts to combat fraud and other threats.

Since launching the hiring campaign on September 30, USCIS has received more than 50,000 applications — the highest in agency history. The first Homeland Defenders began reporting for duty in early December 2025.

Within hours of the November 26 attack where an Afghan national murdered one National Guard member and severely wounded another, Secretary Noem directed USCIS to put asylum processing on hold for aliens from every country, implemented a full-scale reexamination of every green card for aliens from every presidentially designated high-risk country, and placed a hold on the processing of immigration applications and petitions for all Afghan nationals and aliens from those countries of concern.

USCIS is advancing the administration’s and Secretary Noem’s goal of ending the abuse and exploitation in certain immigration programs. This includes stopping broad abuse of humanitarian parole authority and terminating the family reunification and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Venezuela.

Revitalizing the Coast Guard for the 21st Century

President Trump’s plan was simple when he became President of the United States. He wanted to revitalize the Coast Guard, equip it with the best technology, ships, and aircraft available, and then recruit the men and women that were necessary to run it all.

Secretary Noem put his plan into action, and now the Coast Guard is better positioned today than at any point in history to control, secure, and defend the U.S. southern border and maritime approaches; facilitate the uninterrupted flow of commerce; and rapidly respond to national and global contingencies.

In President Trump’s first year, the Coast Guard stopped drugs before they reached our shores, kept illegal aliens out of the country, rescued Americans, made the economy work, and saw a recruitment surge:

Record-Setting Counter-Drug Operations:

Since January 20th, 2025, the U.S. Coast Guard seized nearly 470,000 pounds of cocaine — enough to kill up to 177 million Americans at a 1.2g lethal dose.

Controlling, Securing, and Defending U.S. Borders and Maritime Approaches:

Coast Guard operations such as Operation Border Trident and Operation River Wall increased interdictions of illegal aliens by 44% in key regions and secured over 100,000 miles of U.S. border. Advanced unmanned systems and intelligence-driven patrols have strengthened America’s maritime domain dominance.

Facilitating Commerce and Rapid Crisis Response:

The Coast Guard enabled the safe movement of 1.8 billion tons of cargo, an increase of 13% from the previous year, supporting an economic engine projected to move $5.4 trillion in goods in 2026.

Coast Guard crews also saved nearly 5,000 lives and protected nearly $1 billion in property through thousands of search and rescue missions and rapid responses to major contingencies.

Transforming Workforce Readiness and Recruitment:

Force Design 2028 drove record-setting recruitment, exceeding 110% of active-duty enlisted goals and accessing over 5,200 new members, the highest since 1991.

The Coast Guard is on track to expand the force by 15,000 members, ensuring a healthier, more resilient, and mission-ready workforce to meet evolving demands.

Accelerating Modernization and Future Capabilities:

Looking ahead to 2026, the Coast Guard will implement major structural reforms, including the establishment of a Deployable Specialized Forces Command, expansion of training capacity, and rapid acquisition of next-generation assets.

Investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will further accelerate capability delivery, ensuring the Coast Guard remains the world’s most agile, capable, and responsive maritime fighting force.

These historic accomplishments are further illustrated in the Force Design 2028 Initial Update, which the Coast Guard released on January 15.

The report details the reforms the service has implemented under President Trump and Secretary Noem’s leadership, and it highlights the significant, measurable impacts these changes have delivered for the American people—including the historic 6-to-1 return on investment these efforts provided to the taxpayer.

Improved Federal Law Enforcement Training

Thanks to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and Secretary Noem’s vision, the American people provided Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) with $750 million in taxpayer funding, more than doubling its annual resources, to enhance the training and readiness of U.S. Border Patrol, CBP, and ICE personnel.

As a result, FLETC provided federal law enforcement with the skills, leadership, and training necessary to tackle the threats of tomorrow and to keep the peace.

President Trump’s first year in office saw FLETC focus on:

Expanding nationwide law enforcement collaboration by facilitating ICE’s 287(g) Training Program.

To date, approximately 18,500 officers across 50 states and five territories have registered and over 12,500 have completed the training, strengthening partnerships between federal and local law enforcement agencies.

Training over 73,000 law enforcement personnel, the second highest number in FLETC’s 55-year history.

That includes thousands of personnel from state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus law enforcement personnel from 51 states and five territories.

FLETC achieved record-breaking training—the highest attendance levels since 2007—by supporting over 1,000 USBP trainees daily at FLETC in Artesia, New Mexico, and demonstrating a commitment to scaling operations to meet growing security demands.

Producing America’s frontline during the 43-day lapse in appropriations – the longest in United States history – sustaining the safety and security of the nation at a time when uninterrupted law enforcement capability was essential.

Enhancing maritime training by developing and piloting the U.S. Coast Guard Opposing Force Vessel Program.

Now, FLETC projects to train approximately 90,000 law enforcement personnel over the course of President Trump’s second year in office, fulfilling the operational requirements and expectations of our training partners within DHS and across other federal agencies.

Ushering in the Golden Age of Travel

The Transportation Security Administration is ushering in the Golden Age of Travel and will continue to thrive in President Trump’s second year.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

TSA ended the Obama-era “Quiet Skies” program, which was used to spy on Americans, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as members of Congress.

TSA launched the “Shoes On” Campaign, allowing travelers to keep their shoes on while passing through security screening at TSA checkpoints.

TSA successfully implemented REAL ID on May 7 and achieved 94% compliance, which continues to steadily increase.

TSA launched two targeted campaigns including the “Serve with Honor, Travel with Ease” campaign and the “Families on the Fly” campaign, and the first-ever TSA PreCheck® Buy One, Get One.

TSA screened a record 3.1 million individuals screened on November 30.

8 of TSA’s 10 highest screening days were in 2025.

2.5 billion checked and carry-on bags screened in President Trump’s first year.

Fixing Federal Disaster Response

For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was bloated by waste, fraud, and abuse. Now, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, FEMA is being transformed, empowering disaster response that is federally supported, state led, and locally executed:

At Secretary Noem’s direction, FEMA has conducted a critical evaluation of all grant programs and recipients to root out waste, fraud, and abuse and deliver accountability for the American taxpayer.

As a result, FEMA has achieved:

Radical Transparency and Contract Management FEMA’s rigorous contract reviews led to the termination of 118 contracts, generating $31.2 million in savings and $82 million in total cost avoidance, ensuring mission alignment and cost-effectiveness.

Historic Recovery of Excess Funds FEMA recovered $8 billion in excess funds—the largest in agency history—rechanneling resources into high-priority operations and setting a new standard for fiscal responsibility.

Fraud Prevention and Investigations FEMA conducted 2,092 fraud investigations, safeguarding up to $1.2 billion from external fraud and identifying 27 internal cases totaling $250,000, protecting taxpayer resources and disaster assistance funds.

Accelerated State-Led Recovery Funding FEMA expedited 106 Public Assistance projects across 9 states, delivering $762 million in upfront funding—empowering states to lead and streamline their own recovery.

Record Disaster Assistance to Communities and Individuals FEMA approved nearly $2.2 billion in Individual Assistance to households and obligated $15.3 billion in Public Assistance for communities and critical infrastructure, ensuring resources reach those most in need.

Modernized Survivor Assistance Tools FEMA improved the disaster assistance process by launching new digital tools—including an application status tracker, clearer help text, guided videos, simplified letters, and expanded payment options. The digitized payment system accelerated delivery of assistance from 2–3 weeks to 1–2 days.

In President Trump’s second year, FEMA will empower states to lead disaster response and recovery while ensuring responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Continued improvement will strengthen local resilience when natural disasters strike, and deliver efficient, accountable support to communities across the nation to protect the American people when its needed most.

Bringing Back “The Best of the Best” to the Secret Service

President Trump and Secretary Noem made it a priority to restore the American people’s confidence in the Secret Service by demanding excellence from the Secret Service, recruiting the best of the best, and giving them the training necessary to carry out their mission.

As a result of that focus, which led to a roughly 46% increase in applications compared to the year before. From January 20 to December 18, 2025, the U.S. Secret Service received 91,273 applications, versus 62,160 applications during the same period in 2024.

Likewise, the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center delivered the highest number of trainings and briefings in the agency’s history - more than 364 trainings and briefings to more than 56,713 participants. NTAC training recipients included law enforcement agencies, schools, mental health providers, faith-based organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities.

Time and time again, the Secret Service made sure our nation’s biggest sports and cultural events were safe and secure.

In President Trump’s first year in office, the Secret Service:

Successfully developed and executed the security plan for four National Special Security Events:

The 2025 Inauguration of President Trump, President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress, the 2025 UN General Assembly (UNGA, 80th Session), and the Army’s 250th Birthday Celebration.

Provided Presidential protection during multiple major events, including:

Super Bowl LIX (New Orleans, LA), Daytona 500 (Daytona Beach, FL), Charlie Kirk’s Funeral (Glendale, AZ), Ryder Cup (Farmingdale, NY), Washington Commanders Game (Salute to Service) (Landover, MD), and the 126th Army-Navy Game (Baltimore, MD).

Completed 22 anti-card skimming and electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations in various locations around the United States. These outreach operations prevented an estimated $428 million in fraud loss.

In President Trump’s second year, the U.S. Secret Service will expand its electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations around the country, beginning with a 10-day, five city operation this winter.

The Service will continue to aggressively recruit and hire the best of the best in order to meet our goal of hiring 4,000 new employees by 2028, for a total of 6,800 law enforcement personnel and 10,000 total employees on board by the end of President Trump’s first year.

And it will design and execute security plans for multiple National Special Security events:

2025 State of the Union, UN General Assembly, G20 Summit, and support security efforts for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Restoring American Air Superiority

On January 12, DHS announced the launch of a new office dedicated to rapidly procuring and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies, marking a major step forward in restoring American airspace sovereignty – a top priority for the Trump administration.

Drones are transforming industries nationwide, but they are also increasingly exploited by malicious actors. The new DHS Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems will oversee strategic investments in drone and counter-drone technologies that can outpace evolving threats and tactics.

The Program Executive Office has already begun its work and will soon finalize a $115 million investment in counter-drone technologies that will be critical in securing America250 and 2026 FIFA World Cup venues, underscoring the historic responsibility of protecting events that commemorate 250 years of American independence and welcome the world for the largest World Cup in history.

President Trump has championed the protection of the country from drone threats, initially signing the law in 2018 that gave DHS Components the authority to detect and mitigate drones. Since then, the Department has conducted over 1,500 missions to protect the United States from illicit drone activities.

The new Program Executive Office will be taking the threat of hostile drones head-on and innovating ways drones can keep us safe from other threats on the ground, equipping the Department with the technology and expertise we need to keep us Americans safe.

Restoring Cyber Security

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, CISA returned back to its mission and remains steadfast in safeguarding the systems Americans rely on every day in the first year.

In year two, as our nation commemorates America’s 250th anniversary and global communities come together for the FIFA World Cup, CISA has released a new guide to empower stadium and arena owners to fortify operations, mitigate vulnerabilities, and elevate emergency preparedness.

The agency also issued three guides to help venue owners and law enforcement safeguard against risks from drones near their events and continues to support pre-World Cup 2026 exercises in host cities around the country.

Already in 2026, CISA started off the new year by retiring ten Emergency Directives, marking a significant milestone in federal cybersecurity. This is the highest number of Emergency Directives retired, after CISA determined that required actions have been successfully implemented or are now encompassed elsewhere.

CISA has co-sealed 38 joint cybersecurity advisories that continually demonstrate operational collaboration in action. By sharing timely, actionable threat intelligence and driving resilience, we help ensure our collective security.

Protecting Americans from Weapons of Mass Destruction

In its first year under President Trump and Secretary Noem, DHS’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office protected Americans throughout the country from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.

CWMD conducted a total of 1,020 operations, engagements, trainings, and exercises across 48 states and territories, including operations to protect high-profile events, including the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, and the Club World Cup.

In the coming year, CWMD will deploy to protect the FIFA World Cup across eleven host cities, the largest deployment in CWMD history, as well as other major events like America 250.

Maximizing Intelligence & Analytics to Keep Americans Safe

President Trump and Secretary Noem are using DHS’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis like never before to coordinate a robust defense of the Homeland.

In 2025, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) nominated over 4,600 people to the terrorist watchlist in 2025, working with DHS components, federal partners, and state and local law enforcement to ensure the Worst of the Worst are removed from America’s communities.

Last year, following encounters with CBP at various ports of entry, I&A successfully discovered derogatory information on 80 percent of the devices encountered from persons of interest seeking entry into the U.S.

This includes Rasha Alawieh, the Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University who attended Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral.

I&A discovered that Alawieh had numerous contacts with known or suspected terrorists, affirming CBP’s decision to deny entry and the State Department’s decision to revoke her visa.

In coordination with fusion center partners, I&A identified and watchlisted Rawy Javier Mogolon Morillo—one of the first known members of the gang Tren de Aragua in Orange County, California.

As a result, the Homeland Security Task Force arrested this cartel associate on September 15, 2025.

Increasing Transparency, Direct Communication to the Public

President Trump and Secretary Noem understand have worked to provide historic levels of transparency and open communication to the American people U.S. citizens.

To that extent, DHS’s Office of Public Affairs delivered timely, accurate, and accessible information to the American through traditional media and social media.

In President Trump’s first year, OPA sent nearly 650 press releases and released more than 2,550 press statements to thousands of press inquiries.

OPA also harnessed the power of social media to speak directly to the American people without legacy media’s bias and fake news getting in the way.

On X alone, @DHSGov made a whopping 1.9 billion impressions in President Trump’s first term. @Sec_Noearm earned more than half a billion with 527.4 million. On Facebook and Instagram, Secretary Noem’s official account had more than 83 million views combined. DHS’ official Facebook and Instagram account had 716.8 million views combined

In President Trump’s first year, DHS also launched the critically acclaimed, groundbreaking new web page, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens arrested during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump administration.

The Best Is Yet to Come

These accomplishments helped usher in a historic first year in President Trump’s return to office. The work, however, is just getting started. Under Secretary Noem’s guidance, vision, and leadership, DHS will continue to deliver monumental victories to the American people.

Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide.
Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.","On his first day back in office, President Trump signed dozens of executive orders on Inauguration Day in 2025, many of them related to immigration.

What followed was an unprecedented year for newcomers and the Americans that support them. Lawful pathways were shuttered, critical assistance was ended, and protections were revoked. Many of these actions were framed as temporary reviews or suspensions. However, they went far beyond good-faith reviews—solidifying over the months as lasting steps to dismantle vital systems that protect and support refugees and others in the United States and around the world.

Refugee Resettlement

Most refugees remain blocked from seeking safety in the United States.

Executive Order 14163 called for “realigning the U.S. refugee admissions program (USRAP),” the system that interviews, resettles, admits, and supports refugees in the United States. This executive order included a suspension of arrivals, beginning on January 27, 2025, and called for reviews every 90 days on whether to lift the suspension on arrivals.

Refugee arrivals were suspended within 48 hours of the executive order. Families that were weeks or even days away from resettlement had their flights to the United States abruptly cancelled.

A year later, this program-wide suspension remains largely in place, with only a few dozen previously approved refugees arriving under ongoing litigation in Washington State. The Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions for this fiscal year capped annual refugee admissions at 7,500—their lowest in the program’s history, down from 125,000 in the prior fiscal year—and reserved these slots primarily for Afrikaners from South Africa.

Actions framed as a temporary suspension have become a de facto shutdown of the refugee program for new arrivals, with minimal exceptions.

Travel Restrictions

Individuals from 39 countries are now fully or partially banned from coming to the United States, and many of those already here now face delays in getting green cards, work permits, and more.

Executive Order 14161 called for a comprehensive review of countries with insufficient vetting and screening of their nationals.

This review of vetting standards was supposed to take 90 days, inspiring fear among advocates and service providers that travel restrictions based on the review would begin in the spring. A travel ban went into effect in June, placing full or partial travel restrictions on the citizens of 19 countries.

The administration has recently expanded these sweeping travel restrictions. Under a December 2025 proclamation, an additional 20 countries are now included on full or partial travel bans. Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders were also newly barred from arriving. Additionally, processing for green cards and other requests has been suspended for individuals from these 39 countries—including those already living in the United States, regardless of when they entered.

Rather than careful individualized decisions on visas and other applications, these policies amount to blanket bans on entire populations.

Humanitarian Aid

The vast majority of humanitarian aid from the United States has been abruptly shuttered, endangering millions across the world.

All United States foreign aid was also subject to a 90-day review under Executive Order 14163. Like other actions, the EO went far beyond a mere review.

Vital humanitarian assistance funding and programs around the world were quickly halted. The world’s largest donor, the U.S. Agency for International Development, was largely dismantled, with its few remaining staff and operations folded into the State Department. Assistance to refugees already in the United States through the domestic Reception & Placement program was cut off.

While some of this programming came back online later in 2025, U.S. humanitarian assistance remains drastically reduced—to the detriment of millions in need.

Asylum

Seeking asylum remains restricted, and many people who had arrived safely in the U.S. are now at risk for removal.

Executive Order 14165 ended the ability of asylum seekers at the U.S. border to schedule an asylum interview with the CBP One App. The order directed federal agencies to facilitate “safe third country” agreements, which require individuals to pursue asylum claims in the first country they traveled through after leaving their homes.

Reports indicate that the administration is designating people for transfer to third countries in order to refuse to consider (or “pretermit”) their asylum applications—putting those seeking protection without a pathway to safety and at risk of detention or removal.

Parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The administration continues to narrow or eliminate legal pathways to safety, putting those who lawfully entered the U.S. at risk of detention and deportation.

Executive Order 14165 also called for the termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes—which allowed nationals of those countries to seek temporary status and work authorization in the United States. Despite litigation up to the Supreme Court, the decision to end CHNV has moved forward, ending protection for an estimated 530,000 people.

Executive Order 14159 directed review of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations, work authorization, and parole. Since January 2025, the administration has taken steps to terminate or signal termination for 12 TPS designations, including Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Haiti, and Venezuela. Many of these decisions appear at odds with harmful conditions continuing in designated countries. Afghanistan’s designation, for example, has been terminated despite ongoing repression of Afghan allies and a state of gender apartheid for Afghan women and girls.

Additionally, the administration has made it harder for people to remain authorized to work to support themselves and their families. A policy change ended automatic work authorization extensions, and there are potential plans to pause work permits for asylum seekers—a move that could negatively impact many individuals seeking protection. Global Refuge continues to monitor these policy developments closely.

Citizenship

Litigation has blocked the end of birthright citizenship for now, but the government remains poised to implement the change.

Executive Order 14160 sought to prohibit all U.S. government departments and agencies from issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship for babies in certain circumstances, despite their having been born in the United States. Due to ongoing litigation, the citizenship executive order remains blocked from going into effect nationwide. Despite the litigation, however, USCIS has issued an implementation plan to take effect if the executive order is allowed to move forward.

On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case that will determine the constitutionality of this executive order. Oral arguments are expected for spring 2026, and the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

The California law focuses on employer preparation for and responses to onsite immigration enforcement actions (e.g., an “ICE raid”), while Illinois’ new law creates employer obligations regarding the employment authorization process.

Specifically, on December 12, 2025, Illinois amended its Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act by enacting Senate Bill 2339. The amendment took effect immediately and applies to both public and private employers statewide. Under the amendment, employers may not:

Impose stricter employment authorization or re-verification standards than those required under federal law

Take adverse employment actions (like suspension or termination) based solely on notifications from federal agencies not responsible for immigration enforcement notifications (like Social Security Administration “no-match” letters)

Take adverse employment actions based solely on notifications from outside vendors indicating discrepancies in employee identification documents

Required Notice

Employers must now notify any affected employee in writing within five business days of receipt of an agency or third-party notification of discrepancy. The notice must include at least:

An explanation that the federal agency or outside vendor has notified the employer that the identification documents presented by the employee do not appear to match

The time period the employee has to contest the disputed information, if such a period is required by federal law

Any action the employer is requiring the employee to take

Notice should be delivered in person and by hand; if personal notice is not feasible, it must be sent via both regular mail and email. The notice must also be provided to the employee’s “authorized representative,” if applicable. If the employee or their authorized representative requests the original notice, it must be provided.

Penalties

Civil penalties range from $100 to $1,000 per violation, with additional remedies in cases of job loss including reinstatement, back pay, and up to $10,000 in civil penalties. Repeat offenses can result in civil penalties of $1,000 to $5,000 per violation. No penalties will be imposed against an employer found to have acted in good faith after consulting with the Illinois Department of Labor or the Department of Homeland Security, or if an honest administrative mistake did not affect an employee’s pay or job status. Successful claimants may also receive attorneys’ fees and related expenses.

Relatedly, SB 2339 enhances enforcement by enabling labor unions and certain nonprofit organizations to initiate civil lawsuits as “interested parties.” Individual employees, job applicants, or their representatives may also file lawsuits directly in Illinois courts.

More States To Follow?

Massachusetts and Washington are currently considering, but have not yet enacted, comparable measures. Massachusetts Senate Bill 2665, modeled in part on Illinois’ Right to Privacy in the Workplace Act, would impose an obligation to notify employees of Form I-9 inspections and documentation discrepancies within 72 hours of an employer receiving related notice from a government agency.

Washington House Bill 2105 and identical Senate Bill 5852, collectively called the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, would require employers to notify employees when federal immigration agents are conducting inspections of employment authorization or related audits. Under the proposal, employers would have to alert workers about the results of the audit within 72 hours of receiving notice and could face penalties for noncompliance. The act was introduced by legislators on December 8, 2025, following the proposal of Washington Attorney General Nick Brown.

Perkins Coie will continue to monitor these bills—as well as any additional states’ efforts affecting immigration-related employer responsibilities.

Mary Cavanagh(D-Redford Twp.), Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), and Jeremy Moss(D-Bloomfield) uplifted their legislation to protect the safety of Michiganders, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, from the dangerous immigration enforcement tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) that are endorsed by D.C. Republicans. As the Legislature has begun its 2026 work, the Senators reiterated how critical this legislation is to protect our communities.

Unethical, terrorizing immigration enforcement tactics have been increasing across the nation under the second Trump administration. Most alarmingly, the killing of Renee Nicole Good and continued violence by ICE agents in Minneapolis have exemplified the malicious nature of ICE operations and is only one of the latest on a growing list of incidents that have happened during ICE and CBP operations.

“As the proud daughter of a Mexican immigrant and chair of the Michigan Legislative Latino Caucus, I will always stand with Michigan’s vibrant immigrant communities that have long shaped the very fabric of our state and nation. Every resident in our state, no matter their citizenship status, deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and basic human decency,” said Sen. Cavanagh. “The federal administration’s immigrant enforcement tactics are creating panic, not protection! ICE agents do not — and should never — have the authority to intimidate, kidnap, or bring harm to our communities. I’ll continue fighting to ensure everyone is afforded the fundamental right to safety and security in their neighborhoods, workplaces, and places of worship.”

“Everyone, regardless of immigration status, deserves to feel safe and welcome in their own homes, dropping their kids off at school, at courthouses, and getting help as a victim of a crime,” said Sen. Chang. “We must do better to protect the safety and rights of every Michigander. No one deserves to have their privacy rights violated or to be ripped away from their family because of out-of-control ICE and CBP tactics.

Spain is among few EU countries touting economic benefits of migration

Migrant irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42% last year

Rights groups criticise Spain's deals with West Africa

MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Spain opposes a push by some European Union countries to control migration by opening camps for asylum-seekers outside the bloc, calling instead to focus on curbing irregular migration at the source, its interior minister said.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania, were ""no magic solution"" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways, while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests ""in safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights"" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.

An Oklahoma warehouse in southwest Oklahoma City may soon be converted into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center, part of a larger federal plan to detain thousands of immigrants across the country.

ICE Targets 16 Cities Nationwide

Oklahoma City is reportedly one of 16 cities under consideration by ICE for processing and detention sites. The plan, first reported by The Washington Post, would convert warehouses into one large detention center and 16 smaller processing facilities to speed up deportations.

State Senator Raises Concerns About Lack of Transparency

State Senator Carri Hicks (D–Oklahoma City) says she recently learned about the plan and is alarmed by the lack of transparency at both the local and state levels.

“This is not a rumor. It is a developed plan and it’s being executed,” she said. “And there has been no transparency and no accountability either at the local level, municipal level or the state level. And I think that should concern every Oklahoman.”

Proposed Site Near Residential Neighborhood

A letter from the Department of Homeland Security to the city’s planning commission reportedly outlines plans to convert a more than 400,000 square foot warehouse at 2800 South Council into a 1,500-bed ICE processing center.

The site is less than two miles from Western Heights Public School, raising concerns among residents and lawmakers.

Community Impact: Fear and Safety Concerns

Senator Hicks says the proposed facility could create fear and anxiety among families in the nearby community.

“It brings a lot of fear to the students and to the families… because we’ve seen bold actions that are profiling folks based on their skin color.” She also warns that a processing center could strain local resources such as public safety.

What Would the Facility Include?

If approved, the building would be redesigned to include:

Detention Space

Offices

Restrooms

Cafeteria

Medical space

Visitor areas

Lawmaker Calls for Public Action

Senator Hicks has taken to TikTok and public forums to encourage citizens to speak out and contact lawmakers.

“We need to continue to put people over politics and tell Washington that this unilateral decision will not be tolerated in our community.”

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.
By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.
Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.
Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.","At least 31 people died in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high, as President Trump's mass-detention surge strains a system already under fire for dangerous conditions.

Why it matters: Immigrants rights groups warn deaths will keep rising as the administration floods ICE with more cash — and that the agency's facilities may not be equipped to handle the influx of detained people.

The Trump administration's policy of limiting congressional oversight visits to ICE facilities has exacerbated those fears, fueling an impeachment push against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

By the numbers: The 2025 death toll nearly tripled from the 11 deaths in 2024, according to an Axios review of ICE news releases.

The next closest peak was 20 deaths in 2020, when COVID-19 raced through tightly packed detention centers.

By comparison, ICE reported 26 deaths during all four years of former President Biden's term.

Flashback: Deaths similarly jumped during President George W. Bush's immigration crackdown in 2004, resulting in 32 deaths.

The big picture: Outrage at ICE hit a new peak after an agent shot and killed a 37-year-old mother in Minneapolis earlier this month, intensifying alarm among lawmakers and protesters who were already demanding answers about deteriorating conditions inside detention centers.

""We've been warning about this for over a year, that conditions have been deteriorating, that deaths are climbing, and now we're seeing that,"" Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the Detention Watch Network tells Axios.

""We will likely see many more deaths if things continue as they have.""

Zoom in: Amnesty International reported in December that people held at one center described ""poor quality food, extreme temperatures, permanent lighting, and limited access to clean water.""

At another facility, the ACLU says people reported being denied insulin and disability accommodations, blocked from seeing lawyers and forced to use bathrooms with sewage bubbling up from drains.

What they're saying: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told Axios that there was ""no spike in deaths"" in ICE custody in 2025, arguing the death rate per person has remained stable.

""Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. All detainees are receiving three meals a day that are certified by dietitians,"" they said.

DHS says it screens everyone for medical, dental and mental health needs within 12 hours of arrival, and conducts a full health assessment within two weeks. Detained people also have access access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

What we're watching: Congress requires ICE to publish death reports within 90 days, but ICE has not published one since the end of September, according to an Axios review of agency press releases.

DHS did not answer Axios' questions about when it would update the tracker.

In one of his last acts as New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy on Monday signed one of three bills designed to protect immigrants from federal immigration raids. Murphy declined to sign two other measures, including one that would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, first implemented by then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in 2018.

Murphy declines to codify Immigrant Trust Directive and sign Privacy Protection Act

Murphy said he was concerned that codifying the Immigrant Trust Directive would open up the Garden State to a new court challenge that would go before judges who may not render the same decision as when Grewal’s original directive survived court challenges.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop,” he said in a statement. “Re-opening the door to judiciary scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger.”

Murphy said his administration found “a drafting oversight” on the Privacy Protection Act that “could create significant complications when it comes to advancing our shared goal of protecting New Jersey’s immigrant communities.”

“I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session,” he said in a statement. Murphy is leaving the Legislature with recommended amendments to the bill, hoping that the measures would be reintroduced in the new session.

Murphy did not veto the two bills outright. He declined to sign them into law, allowing them to expire because they were passed within the last 10 days of the legislative session, known as a “pocket veto.”

Immigrant advocates say they are disappointed

The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice said in a statement Tuesday that Murphy “walked away from his promise to protect immigrant families across the state.”

“He does so amid an intensification of immigration enforcement and detention in New Jersey,” the group said.

There have been reports of ICE raids taking place in Atlantic City and Camden within the last month.

“At a moment that demanded courage, Gov. Murphy chose caution,” said Viri Martinez, deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.

She added that “fear of the Trump administration” is the only way to describe why Murphy declined to sign the legislation.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said the pocket vetoes have left New Jersey “without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities.”

“These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy,” he said, in a statement. “We call on Gov.-elect Sherrill, her administration and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement.”

Murphy signs Safe Communities Act

The governor said the state was reaffirming “our longstanding commitment to ensuring the people of New Jersey — particularly our immigrant families — are safe, secure, and supported in navigating their daily lives easily and confidently.”

“Public spaces such as houses of worship, schools, hospitals, and courthouses are places of trust that should welcome and safeguard every member of society,” he said in a statement. “Whether you’re praying in a church, studying in school, receiving medical care at a hospital, or seeking legal relief, no one should live in fear or uncertainty or be deterred from seeking essential services due to their immigration status.”

The Safe Communities Act, which takes effect immediately, requires the attorney general to propose policies on how to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they visit sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and places of worship.

The law also requires certain government departments and agencies to adopt the policies within 180 days of being issued. Policies must be equal to the attorney general’s model or provide greater protections.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gov-murphy-ap-2026-01-08.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:58:33.795449

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding.
The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.
California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month.
Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data.","In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.

The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.

Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.

The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.

The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.

But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.

Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.

But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.

Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”

“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.

Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.

In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.

“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.

“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”

An about-face

Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.

Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.

The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.

“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”

That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.

The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.

ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”

Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.

California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.

Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.

She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”

States step up

In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.

For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.

Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.

“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”

In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.

In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

“We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy.","Washington, D.C. – One year into the second administration of Donald Trump, the courts have served as a critical guardrail against the harmful excesses of the Trump-Vance administration according to a new analysis released by leading pro-democracy legal organization Democracy Forward today.

The Trump-Vance administration has faced more than 600 lawsuits from people and communities across the nation and has lost in court more than 70% of the time. The administration has faced losses in front of courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, and President Trump himself, with less than 5% of these cases going to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“Over the past year, the nation has been reminded of the resilience and determination of the American people. As powerful institutions have stayed silent or, worse, collaborated in what is an autocratic power grab unfolding in our nation, the people have stepped forward, including in the courts where the people have filed–and won–hundreds of legal cases. At Democracy Forward, we are proud to be shoulder to shoulder with people and communities across the country, as well as with the nation’s legal community, in defending people and the rule of law against what are existential threats to the wellbeing of people and our nation’s present and future,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the devastation and pain that the Trump-Vance administration continues to cause is immoral and unjustifiable, we find hope in the people’s determination to resist this autocratic powergrab.”

Critical pro-democracy court victories that have been achieved by public interest organizations, civil rights and civil liberties advocates, state attorneys general, private practice lawyers, and cities and counties over the past year – and that remain in place – include:

Blocking the administration’s nationwide freeze on federal funding and essential services;

Blocking the administration’s deployment of the National Guard in states and cities across the nation;

Blocking the administration’s retaliation against law firms, civic institutions, associations, and non-profit organizations;

Blocking the administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deprive people of due process;

Blocking the administration’s attempt to defund educational institutions that do not align with the White House’s views;

Blocking a number of the administration’s anti-Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility initiatives;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to reverse the Constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship;

Blocking key provisions of the administration’s so-called “election integrity” Executive Order;

Blocking the administration’s efforts to deprive 42 million Americans of supplemental nutritional assistance (SNAP);

Blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive 2.2 million people of health care, raise costs for working families, and undermine the Affordable Care Act’s core protections; and

Blocking attempts to undermine the free press –whether through court orders that blocked attempts to decimate the Voice of America or blocking the administration’s attempts to deprive press of access to public spaces.

Many of these victories have been achieved through a broad coalition of public interest organizations and pro-democracy state attorneys general. Democracy 2025, the strategic legal network of 675+ organizations housed at Democracy Forward, has been credited with coordinating the largest and most effective legal strategy against unlawful administrative action in modern history. Democracy 2025 is the strategic hub to protect people and their rights against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to unlawfully strip away freedoms and prosperity. The effort has been credited with filling the gap that was left when a number of large elite law firms pulled back from their pro-bono work and/or capitulated to the White House’s demands.

Democracy Forward in the past year alone has taken more than 400 legal actions to stop executive branch excesses, including through filing more than 150 lawsuits, initiating more than 250 public records investigations, and filing numerous supportive friend-of-the court briefs. Democracy Forward has also submitted more than 1,700 Freedom of Information Act requests and other demands since January 2025.

In addition to Democracy 2025, Democracy Forward has launched a number of additional collaborative projects to build further support for the pro-democracy movement – both inside and outside of the courts. Those include:

Civil Service Strong, a collaborative effort by civil society, non-partisan good government and watchdog organizations, lawyers, and unions to ensure our nation’s civil service is able to continue to serve the American people and our Constitution, deliver for our nation, and support our communities.

Democracy Works 250, an innovative and collaborative effort to reimagine and build foundations for a people-centered government and democracy, including through a nationwide listening project to catalogue the expectations and experiences of the American people and through optimizing the expertise of former civil servants and fired federal workers to contribute to plans to rebuild government.

We Hold These Truths, a nationwide campaign dedicated to promoting unity and cross-ideological support for the five non-negotiables of American Democracy: voting and elections, personal freedom, equality, due process, and the rule of law.

Together for Democracy, an initiative to build community and encourage courageous action across the nation.

“As the threats from the Trump-Vance regime continue to accelerate, we are continuing to expand our efforts to protect people, the Constitution, and our nation. We are proud of the historic, peaceful, and direct actions that people and communities have taken over the last year to protect themselves, their neighbors, and our democracy – both inside the courts and outside of the courtroom. Courage is the new currency. Whether it’s Day 1, Day 365, or Day 1,000, we will continue to meet this administration in court to protect our communities and our democracy,” Perryman added. “We call on everyone, including powerful institutions who have stayed on the sidelines, to commit to promoting democracy and resisting autocracy. It is not too late to choose the right side of history.”",https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:56.276148

Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House:

Job growth slowed, and the unemployment rate crept upward. Job-seekers now outnumber job openings.

Price increases slowed according to the most commonly watched number. But they worsened according to the measure preferred by the Federal Reserve.

Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Real weekly earnings of private-sector workers rose 1.4%.

Economists estimate the economy grew 1.8%.

Consumer sentiment declined.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4%, while refugee admissions declined 98%.

The international trade deficit decreased only slightly, by 0.9%.

The stock market continued to set new records.

The number of people receiving federal food assistance went down by about 1.2 million.

Oil production went up 2.5%, while oil imports dropped 6.9%. Carbon emissions increased slightly.

The number of murders nationwide continued to decline, a trend that began in 2022.

The federal debt held by the public rose about 6.7%.

Analysis

Now that Trump has been back in office for one year, we’re publishing our first “Trump’s Numbers” article of his second term. That’s the schedule we have followed for these reports, which we launched in 2012. We wait a year when a new president is inaugurated to allow for the accumulation of some data on most of these metrics.

Going forward, we’ll provide quarterly updates throughout Trump’s term, as we did for his predecessors, and we’ll be able to include statistics that are missing from this report — household income, poverty and health insurance — once the data are released.

In a Jan. 13 speech, Trump himself cited “the numbers” for his economic record, making a healthy, and incorrect, use of superlatives. “By almost every metric, we have quickly gone from the worst numbers on record to the best and strongest numbers,” he said. “Just based on the numbers.”

While that’s clearly not accurate for “almost every metric,” the idea behind these articles isn’t to fact-check specific claims; rather, we simply provide the numbers. They may be expected or surprising, good or bad, depending on one’s point of view. We leave those opinions to readers, and we make no judgments as to how much credit or blame a president deserves for these measures.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed and unemployment crept up during Trump’s second term. The number of unemployed now exceeds the number of job openings.

Employment — Employment continued growing during Trump’s first 11 months in office, but much more slowly than it had in the previous 11 months.

The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show an increase of 473,000 in total nonfarm employment between January and December 2025. That’s barely more than one-quarter of the 1,782,000 jobs added between February 2024 and January 2025, when Trump began his current term.

(A note of caution: BLS has announced it will revise its monthly job figures substantially downward for March because its annual “benchmarking” study indicated its monthly survey had overcounted the number of jobs that month by 911,000. Updated figures going back to March 2024 are scheduled to be released in February along with the regular monthly employment report.)

Much of the sluggishness under Trump is due to the president’s deliberate slashing of the federal workforce. Federal government employment has fallen by 277,000, or 9.2%, since he took office.

Looking only at the private sector — excluding federal, state and local government workers — 654,000 jobs were added during Trump’s term so far. But that’s still less than half the 1,414,000 added in the preceding 11 months.

Back in August, Trump reacted to disappointing job-growth figures by calling them “rigged” and “phony” even though we found no evidence of that and the White House offered none. Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated as her replacement E.J. Antoni, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump withdrew that nomination amid much criticism at the end of September and has yet to name a permanent replacement.

Meanwhile BLS reported a gain of only 50,000 jobs in the month of December. That’s even lower than the initial report of a 73,000 gain in July that prompted Trump to fire the BLS chief. The July gain has since been revised downward to 72,000.

Manufacturing Jobs — The economy continued to lose manufacturing jobs. During Trump’s first 11 months the loss was 63,000. That followed a loss of 98,000 in the preceding 11 months.

Labor Force Participation — The labor force participation rate declined a bit in Trump’s second term, dropping from 62.6% to 62.4%.

The rate is the portion of the population over age 16 that is working or seeking work. It generally has been in a long decline as the population ages and people retire.

Unemployment — The unemployment rate has remained well below the historical norm under Trump, but has gone up slightly since he took office. It was 4.0% in January 2025, and most recently was 4.4% in December.

The median rate for all months since 1948 is 5.5%.

Job Openings — The number of people officially listed as unemployed rose by 638,000 during Trump’s first 11 months, while the number of job openings declined by 616,000. There are now 7.5 million unemployed and seeking work, but only 7.1 million openings. When Trump took office, job opportunities outnumbered job-seekers.

Wages and Inflation

CPI — Trump campaigned on a promise to reduce inflation, and since he took office it has slowed little. Or maybe not. By one important measure it has worsened.

In the 12 months before Trump took office the Consumer Price Index, the most commonly cited measure of inflation, rose 3.0%. And in the most recent BLS report, the 12-month increase was 2.7%.

Over Trump’s first 11 months in office, the CPI went up 2.18%.

One particularly bright spot: The often volatile price of gasoline has eased. The national average price for regular gasoline at the pump was $3.11 the week Trump was sworn in for the second time, and had dropped to $2.78 by the week ending Jan. 12, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Inflation was much worse in 2022, when the 12-month CPI increase spiked at 9.1% in June. That was the largest 12-month increase in over 40 years. But inflation had slowed markedly by the time Trump came in.

Still, inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve would like, and it’s going in the wrong direction as measured by the Fed’s preferred metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The central bank’s target is a 2% annual increase in the PCE. When Trump took office, the 12-month increase in the PCE was 2.5%. But the most recent report put the 12-month increase at 2.8%.

That was for the period ending in September. Not only do the PCE figures take longer to gather than the CPI, they have been delayed by the recent government shutdown. The next PCE release is now scheduled for Jan. 22 and will cover both October and November.

Wages — Wage increases accelerated under Trump, even adjusted for inflation.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.4% during Trump’s first 11 months. They were rising when he took office, but had only gone up 0.5% in the preceding 11 months.

Those figures include professionals, executives and supervisory employees, whose pay is normally higher. But rank-and-file wage earners are seeing gains just as rapid as those of their bosses. For private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees, real average earnings also rose 1.4% under Trump, after a 1.0% rise in the preceding period.

Economic Growth

After a weak first quarter, the economy showed surprising resilience in Trump’s first year back in office – largely on the strength of substantial artificial intelligence investments and household spending.

Although the first official annual estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis isn’t due to be released until Feb. 20, BEA data available so far show that real gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6% in the first three months of 2025 but then grew by 3.8% in the second quarter and 4.3% in the third quarter.

The reported third-quarter growth was the largest in two years, when the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.7%. Fourth quarter growth, which also won’t be released until Feb. 20, may be even higher. As of Jan. 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model was projecting growth of 5.3%.

“This strong growth came despite the adverse trade and immigration shocks the economy has absorbed over the past year,” resulting in a “soft labor market,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, wrote in December after the third-quarter figures were released. “That interplay — a surging economy and a soft labor market — is likely to be the major economic narrative next year.”

Brusuelas described the economy as a “resilient beast.” He attributed the third-quarter growth to “[h]ousehold consumption driven by higher-income consumers and AI-related investment,” which he wrote “accounted for just under 70% of total growth during the [third] quarter.”

For the full year, Federal Reserve Board members and bank presidents expect growth to come in at between 1.5% and 2%, according to estimates released Dec. 10. Their median projection was 1.7%. Similarly, economists surveyed in October by the National Association for Business Economics estimated 1.8% growth in 2025.

Consumer Sentiment

When Trump took office, consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expressed concern about unemployment and inflation and uncertainty about the potential impact of Trump’s economic agenda.

“Concerns over the future trajectory of inflation were visible throughout the interviews and were tied to beliefs about anticipated policies like tariffs,” Joanne W. Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers, said in a press release last January, adding that “consumers of all political leanings will continue to refine their views as Trump’s policies are clarified and implemented.”

A year ago, the university’s survey showed that the consumer sentiment was 71.7. Since then, consumer confidence has precipitously declined in subsequent surveys and remains stubbornly low.

The university’s preliminary Index of Consumer Sentiment for January was 54 – 17.7 points lower than it was when Trump took office. By contrast, consumer sentiment never dropped below 71.8 in Trump’s first term, despite the economic turmoil caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Although those surveyed perceived some “modest improvement” in the economy in the last two months, consumer sentiment “remains nearly 25% below last January’s reading,” Hsu said. Consumers “continue to be focused primarily on kitchen table issues, like high prices and softening labor markets.”

In its most recent Consumer Confidence Survey, the Conference Board — a research organization with more than 2,000 member companies — also reported that consumer confidence declined for the fifth straight month in December.

“Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the [government] shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year’s January peak,” Dana M. Peterson, chief economist of the Conference Board, said in a Dec. 23 press release.

Home Prices & Homeownership

Homeownership — Homeownership rates have declined slightly since Trump became president.

The homeownership rate, which the Census Bureau measures as the percentage of “occupied housing units that are owner-occupied,” was 65.3% in the third quarter of 2025 — 0.4 points below the 65.7% rate during Biden’s last quarter in office.

Although mortgage rates eased in 2025, the homeownership rate in the third quarter “remained below last year’s pace because of ongoing affordability pressures,” according to Realtor.com.

“Persistent affordability challenges and a shortage of reasonably priced homes have kept the rate from rising more meaningfully, though recent inventory gains, softer prices, and easing mortgage rates appear to be helping some previously sidelined households enter the market,” Realtor.com Senior Economic Research Analyst Hannah Jones said in a Dec. 12 article on the company’s website.

The highest homeownership rate on record was 69.2% in 2004, when George W. Bush was president. But millions of Americans lost their homes during the Great Recession, a financial crisis triggered by a housing market crash.

“Following record-high homeownership rates before the 2008 housing and financial crisis, homeownership rates have remained relatively static at the current rate of 65 percent,” HUD’s policy and research arm wrote in a July report on the history of homeownership in the U.S.

Home Prices — Home prices, which soared to new highs under Biden, slowed in Trump’s first year, as mortgage rates continued to fall.

The national median price of an existing, single-family home sold in December was $409,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was 2.9% higher than it was in January, when Biden left office.

Looked at another way: The median sales price in December was only 0.24% higher year-over-year.

“2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release. “However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.”

The Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates three times in 2024. After a pause, the Fed cut rates three more times in 2025 – lowering rates last year by a full percentage point since September. While that’s not directly tied to mortgage rates, it can affect how banks set their loan rates.

As of Jan. 8, the average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.16% — down from 6.96% for the week ending Jan. 23, 2025, according to Freddie Mac. Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025.

Immigration

In his first year in office, Trump has followed through on his signature campaign promise to — as he puts it — “close the border,” with numerous executive actions that have dramatically reshaped immigration policy and enforcement.

“The border is totally secure,” Trump told reporters on Jan. 11.

The number of apprehensions at the U.S. border with Mexico decreased 91.4% during Trump’s first full 11 months in office, compared with the same period in 2024, according to the most recent figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The monthly average (7,255) was at a low not seen since the early 1960s.

Calculating the change in border apprehensions is the method we’ve used as a proxy to measure illegal border crossings for our Numbers stories going back to President Barack Obama. But in Trump’s case, that dramatic drop tells only part of the story of the sweeping immigration policy changes that the Migration Policy Institute describes as “unprecedented in their breadth and reach.”

“While some efforts have stalled or not yet met the White House’s lofty goals, the administration has dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants in the country, deter unauthorized border arrivals, make the status of many legally resident immigrants more tenuous, and impose obstacles for lawful entry of large swaths of international travelers and would-be immigrants,” MPI’s Muzaffar Chishti, Kathleen Bush-Joseph and Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh wrote in their Jan. 13 article, “Unleashing Power in New Ways: Immigration in the First Year of Trump 2.0.” The “net change,” the authors wrote, “has been dizzying in its scope and speed.”

The Trump administration has “dismantled longstanding norms,” the authors wrote, invoking “archaic statutes,” enlisting “support from state and local law enforcement as well as federal agencies that historically had no immigration enforcement role,” and pressuring “foreign governments to receive deportees,” the MPI report stated. “Perhaps most visibly, it militarized immigration enforcement.”

Trump has achieved his policy mostly through executive actions, rather than with legislative help, something he has boasted about repeatedly.

“Remember Biden, he said I have to get approval from Congress,” Trump said in a speech in Detroit on Jan. 13. “Had nothing to do with Congress, had to do with respect.”

In one of his first actions upon taking office in January 2025, Trump issued a proclamation that “the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States.” He mostly blocked migrants’ ability to request asylum. He canceled humanitarian parole programs that the Biden administration extended to Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. And he reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy, so that asylum seekers were sent to Mexico to await their court appearances in the U.S.

In December, Trump paused all asylum decisions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And on Jan. 14, the president indefinitely paused the processing of immigrant visas for 75 nations, including Afghanistan, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria, Russia, Thailand, Somalia and Yemen. He had previously issued a full or partial ban on travel from 39 countries.

MPI estimated that in the first year of his second term, Trump has taken more than 500 actions on immigration including 38 executive orders and “hundreds of other actions via presidential proclamations and policy guidance.” That’s more actions than in all four years of Trump’s first term, MPI said.

But Congress has provided some help. In July, Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included more than $170 billion to ramp up immigration enforcement, detention and deportation.

Increasingly, the administration has turned its attention to interior enforcement. According to MPI, “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled.”

In December, the Department of Homeland Security reported that its enforcement operations have resulted in more than 622,000 deportations since January 2025 (short of the stated goal of at least 1 million per year). And, DHS said, another “1.9 million illegal aliens have voluntarily self-deported,” some of whom were lured by government incentives — a free flight home and $1,000. MPI said the Trump administration hasn’t provided any data to back up that self-deportation claim.

A New York Times analysis of federal data disputed the administration’s figures, with its Jan. 17 analysis, covering Trump’s first year, estimating the number of deportations at 540,000, including 230,000 people who were detained inside the country, 270,000 deported at the border and 40,000 who signed up for the government incentives to self-deport. The Times speculated that the administration’s 622,000 figure “likely includes all repatriations carried out by various homeland security subagencies,” such as ship crews that are barred from disembarking.

Both the Times and MPI noted that DHS hasn’t released detailed, public reports on these statistics, as it has in the past.

In any case, the Times noted the number of deportations lagged the number in Biden’s last two years in office: 590,000 total deportations in 2023 and 650,000 in 2024, when border apprehensions were much higher than they are now. The number of people Trump has deported from inside the country, 230,000, is far higher than the 50,000 deported from inside the country in 2024.

Refugees

In his first term, Trump sharply reduced refugee admissions. But now they have nearly stopped entirely.

As we wrote last year, Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office that called for a “realignment” of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, including an indefinite suspension of all admissions until the program “aligns with the interests of the United States.”

There have been few exceptions to the new refugee policy – notably for refugees from South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner ethnic group. In making an exception for Afrikaners, Trump claimed there was “a genocide that’s taking place” against white farmers in the country – which, as we wrote, distorts the facts.

Beginning in February, the U.S. has admitted only 1,226 refugees in Trump’s first full 11 months in office – including 1,059 refugees from South Africa, according to State Department data.

By contrast, the U.S. admitted 70,033 during the same 11-month period, from February 2024 through December 2024, under Biden. That’s a staggering 98% decline.

For fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1, 2025, Trump placed a cap of 7,500 on refugee admissions – which is far fewer than the 125,000 cap Biden instituted for fiscal year 2025. It’s also much less than the 45,000 cap that Trump placed on refugees in fiscal year 2018, which was his first full fiscal year as president during his first term.

Other than refugees from South Africa, Trump was forced by a court ruling to admit some refugees who had plans to resettle in the U.S. when he suspended the program.

As we wrote, an appeals court ruled (in a clarifying opinion issued April 21) that refugees who had an “approved refugee application” and “had arranged and confirmable travel plans” on or before Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order can enter the country. About 160 refugees were affected by that decision, a spokesman for the International Refugee Assistance Project told us for an article in September.

Most of the non-South Africans admitted last year came from Afghanistan. The U.S. admitted 100 Afghan refugees in the past 11 months, the State Department data show.

In addition to suspending the refugee program, Trump more recently has threatened to deport refugees who settled in Minnesota, citing an ongoing fraud investigation in that city.

In a Jan. 9 statement, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “reexamining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims,” beginning with “Minnesota’s 5,600 refugees who have not yet been given lawful permanent resident status (Green Cards).”

Trade

The international trade deficit, which Trump criticized for reaching record levels under Biden, decreased only slightly in the months since Trump took office for his second term.

Through his first full nine months in office, the U.S. imported $654 billion more in goods and services than it exported, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s about 0.9% less than the $659.7 billion gap between U.S. imports and exports during the same period in 2024.

The full impact of Trump’s new tariff policies on the trade imbalance is still to be determined. The New York Times noted that “because of a surge in imports earlier this year,” to avoid import tariffs that later went into effect, “the overall trade deficit from January to October was still up 7.7 percent from the previous year.”

Also, when the goods and services trade deficit for the month of October went down 60% year-over-year to $29.4 billion, the lowest monthly total since June 2009, the Times said that some economists attributed the decrease to “temporary fluctuations in trade in certain products, like gold and pharmaceuticals.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told the newspaper: “Cutting through the noise and getting to the underlying signal in the data, it suggests to me that the deficit is as large as its ever been.”

Corporate Profits

Corporate profits set records each year under Biden, but dipped in the first quarter under Trump before rebounding slightly in the second quarter and recovering fully in the third quarter.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that after-tax corporate profits at an annual rate were $3.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025 – about $91 billion, or 2.6%, higher than the full-year figure for 2024.

The fourth quarter and annual figures for last year won’t be released until March, so it is still unclear if after-tax corporate profits for the full year will be up or down.

Under Biden, the annual average growth was 31% in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, 7.8% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024, according to BEA data.

Stock Market

The stock market, which set records during Biden’s presidency, reached new heights again under Trump.

The S&P 500, which is made up of 500 large-cap companies, closed at 15.7% higher on Jan. 16 than it was three days before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 13.5% over that same period.

And the Nasdaq composite index, comprising more than 3,000 companies, many in the technology sector, surged by almost 19.8% in that time frame.

These gains followed ample market increases during the Biden administration, when the S&P rose 57.8%, the Dow Jones went up 40.6%, and the Nasdaq increased by almost half.

Food Stamps

After a slight increase in enrollment during Biden’s presidency, the latest data from the Department of Agriculture show that under Trump fewer people are accessing benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

About 41.6 million people were receiving federal food assistance in September, according to preliminary USDA figures published last month. The number has gone down by about 1.2 million participants, or 2.8%, since Trump took office.

The number of individuals benefiting from SNAP is expected to decline further because of the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which changed eligibility requirements for SNAP and is estimated to reduce federal spending on the program. For example, the law extends work requirements to include “able-bodied adults without dependents” aged 55 to 64, who were previously exempt.

In August, the Congressional Budget Office said that provisions in the law “will reduce participation in SNAP by roughly 2.4 million people in an average month over the 2025-2034 period.”

Crime

We won’t have annual 2025 crime data from the FBI until the fall. But other reports on part of the year show violent crime has continued to drop, a trend that began in 2022 after a spike in crime, particularly murders, in 2020.

AH Datalytics, an independent criminal justice data analysis group, produces a Real-Time Crime Index, an aggregation of crime data collected from 570 law enforcement agencies. That index shows a 19.8% decline in the number of murders for January to October 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. Longer term, the index shows the number of murders jumped in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, then leveled off and has been dropping since 2022.

The latest report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which compares Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2025, to the same period in the prior year, similarly found a 19.1% decline in the number of murders for 67 law enforcement agencies. The number of rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults also went down, with the latter decreasing by 10%.

A midyear 2025 report by the Council on Criminal Justice on 42 cities, which consistently published data since 2019, found the same trend, with crime levels now mostly below pre-pandemic levels. “Examining trends over a longer timeframe, violent crimes are below levels seen in the first half of 2019, the year prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020,” the CCJ report said. It noted, though, that the drop in murders has been concentrated in a few cities.

“Much of the decline in the national homicide rate, which began in late 2022, has been driven by large drops in a few sample cities with high homicide levels, such as Baltimore and St. Louis,” CCJ said in a press release about its findings. “The most recent data show that all of the sample cities are now below the general peak of 2020 to 2021, but more than 60% continue to experience homicide levels above pre-2020 rates.”

Gun Sales

After reaching a record high in 2020, estimated gun sales declined every year that Biden was president. That downward trend continued during Trump’s first year back in office.

The government doesn’t collect data on gun sales. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — estimates gun sales by tracking the number of background checks for firearm sales based on the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NSSF-adjusted figures exclude background checks unrelated to sales, such as those required for concealed-carry permits.

According to NSSF, the number of background checks for gun purchases in 2025 was roughly 14.6 million – down 4.1% from about 15.2 million in 2024. But the 2025 total was still higher than the almost 13.2 million estimated sales in 2019, before the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to publish its annual manufacturing figures, so we don’t know whether firearm production, specifically of handguns, increased or decreased in 2025.

Debt and Deficits

Trump’s campaign pledge that “we’re going to actually start paying off debt” hasn’t happened yet. The publicly held debt increased by about one-third on Biden’s watch and continued to rise during the first year of Trump’s second term.

As of Jan. 14, the debt held by the public, which excludes money the federal government owes to itself, was almost $30.8 trillion – up about 6.7% from more than $28.8 trillion on Jan. 17, 2025, three days before he took office.

Another annual deficit – close to $1.8 trillion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 – was a key factor. It was the fourth highest fiscal deficit of all time (behind FY 2020, FY 2021 and FY 2024) and the sixth consecutive budget gap of more than $1 trillion.

Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency had promised to cut federal spending by at least $1 trillion, a goal it did not achieve. Instead, federal spending went up a bit in fiscal 2025.

And, so far, the U.S. appears headed for another debt-increasing deficit in FY 2026 – although perhaps a smaller one. From October through December, the first quarter of the current fiscal cycle, the CBO said that federal outlays exceeded revenues by $601 billion. That’s about $110 billion less than the deficit in the same quarter of fiscal 2025.

Oil Production and Imports

Trump campaigned on a promise that the U.S. would “drill, baby, drill” during a second Trump term, and on his first day back in office, he signed an executive order with a stated goal of “unleashing American energy.”

As of October, U.S. crude oil production had increased to an average of 13.6 million barrels per day in Trump’s first full nine months in the White House, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s up almost 2.5% from the same nine-month period in 2024.

Before Trump was inaugurated, and before any of his policies were in place, the EIA had already projected in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook that average daily production would increase to a record 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.

U.S. crude oil imports are trending in the opposite direction.

Imports were down to an average of about 6.1 million barrels per day during Trump’s first full nine months — a decrease of 6.9% from nearly 6.6 million barrels per day during the comparable period a year earlier. During the Biden years, average imports increased annually.

Carbon Emissions

EIA data also show a small increase in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption under Trump

There were approaching 3.2 billion metric tons of emissions from the consumption of coal, natural gas and various petroleum products in his first full eight months in office. That was roughly 1.4% more than the over 3.1 billion metric tons that were emitted from consuming those energy sources during the same stretch in 2024.

In early January 2025, the EIA projected that CO2 emissions would increase slightly in 2025, but remain in the ballpark of 4.8 billion metric tons emitted in 2024. The agency said it expected emissions growth due to the increased consumption of petroleum products across multiple sectors, particularly the use of diesel fuel and jet fuel.

Emissions had declined in 2023 and 2024 after increasing in Biden’s first two years as president.

Health Insurance

We don’t yet have data on how health insurance coverage has changed so far under Trump’s second term. Typically, the National Health Interview Survey has released quarterly preliminary reports on the insurance status of Americans. But the NHIS’ website now says that as of 2025, the data will only be released biannually.

The latest report, posted in June 2025, covers calendar year 2024. The NHIS is a project of the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A report on estimates from the survey for January to June 2025 is scheduled to be released on Jan. 30.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, is expected to prompt a rise in the number of people who lack health insurance, starting next year. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the uninsured would increase by 10 million people over 10 years, with most of the increase due to the law’s changes to Medicaid. For 2026, the rise was estimated at 1.3 million people. (See the link to estimated changes in people without health insurance.)

In 2024, the last year of Biden’s term, 8.2% of the population, or 27.2 million people, were uninsured, according to the NHIS’ estimates, which measure those uninsured at the time they were interviewed. A Census Bureau report, released in September and measuring those who were uninsured for the entire calendar year, similarly put the uninsured rate at 8%.

Under Biden’s full term, the percentage and number of Americans who are uninsured declined, as we explained in our “Biden’s Final Numbers” report.

Judiciary Appointments

In his first term, Trump filled one-third of the Supreme Court, nearly 30% of the appeals court seats and nearly 26% of District Court seats. So far in his second term, the judiciary confirmation numbers lag a bit behind those in Biden’s first year.

Supreme Court — There hasn’t been a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the first year of Trump’s second term, just as there wasn’t a vacancy in Biden’s first year.

Court of Appeals — As of Jan. 16, Trump has won confirmation for six U.S. Court of Appeals judges. At the same point in his term, Biden had won confirmation for 12.

District Court — Twenty-one Trump nominees to be District Court judges have been confirmed, while 29 were confirmed at the same point in Biden’s first year.

Two U.S. Court of Federal Claims judges also were confirmed in Biden’s first year. None have been confirmed so far under Trump, and there are no vacancies for such positions.

As of Jan. 16, there were no vacancies for Court of Appeals judges, 39 for District Court judges with five nominees pending, and one vacancy for the international trade court.

LeTennier, the Appellate Division, Third Department issued a significant published decision that not only affirms the challenged orders, leaving the foreclosure judgment in favor of the lender in place, but also constitutes the first appellate‑level case in New York to address sanctions arising from the misuse of generative AI in legal submissions.

Hinshaw partners Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey represented the lender in this appeal.

Background

The underlying foreclosure action had already been the subject of extensive motion practice, including numerous post‑judgment attempts by the borrower to vacate or relitigate issues that had long been resolved.

The borrower continued to challenge the lender’s standing despite the Appellate Division’s prior ruling in 2020 affirming summary judgment in the lender’s favor.

When the borrower later appealed several subsequent orders—including the denial of his motion to vacate the judgment—the Appellate Division held that these challenges were either meritless or abandoned.

The Court Identifies Extensive Use of Fabricated, AI‑Generated Case Law

What distinguishes this decision is the court’s detailed examination of the borrower’s and his counsel’s reliance on fabricated legal authorities. Across multiple appellate filings, counsel submitted more than 20 non‑existent case citations generated by AI, as well as misstatements of law drawn from real cases. The court found that this conduct was frivolous under 22 NYCRR 130‑1.1.

Although the decision acknowledges that generative AI tools can have legitimate uses in legal practice, it warns that attorneys remain responsible for verifying the accuracy of any material included in court submissions. The court emphasized that reliance on generative AI does not relieve counsel of their professional and ethical duties, particularly the obligation to ensure that all authorities cited actually exist and accurately reflect the law.

Sanctions Imposed

Given the seriousness and persistence of the misconduct, the court imposed:

$7,500 sanction on the borrower’s counsel, and

$2,500 sanction on the borrower himself.

Notably, the court observed that counsel increased his use of fake, AI-generated legal authorities even after being placed on notice about the problem, which the court found particularly concerning.

Why This Decision Matters

This opinion places New York squarely within the growing national dialogue on the responsible use of generative AI in litigation. As the first appellate‑level decision in the state to address sanctions for misuse of AI‑generated content, it provides important guidance to litigants and practitioners.

The ruling aligns with the emerging expectation across jurisdictions that generative AI may be used by litigants, but only with appropriate human oversight, verification, and accountability.

For lenders, servicers, and financial institutions, the decision also reaffirms the stability of prior standing determinations, prevents continued re-litigation of settled issues, and reinforces courts’ willingness to sanction frivolous foreclosure‑related tactics.

Conclusion

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. LeTennier establishes a meaningful precedent in New York’s appellate jurisprudence, both in the foreclosure context and in the rapidly evolving area of AI‑related legal ethics. Hinshaw attorneys Ellis Oster and Robert Bailey were pleased to secure this result on behalf of their lender client.

They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens.
However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.
There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad.
And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it.","Exactly a year ago today, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. He took over a nation with strong imperialistic tendencies and a democratic polity but with widespread illiberal features throughout its history and, in less than a year, succeeded in establishing a 21st-century US variant of fascism while espousing a lawless world order.

The successful transition of the United States from an imperial republic to what could be best described as imperial proto-fascism was achieved due to the ease with which the Trump administration weakened the country’s institutions meant to restrain power and the massive support that it received, and continues to receive, from the nation’s oligarchy. There are thus eerie similarities between Trump’s United States and the rise of Italian fascism and German Nazism, and none more so than those between Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and Mussolini’s Squadristi and Hitler’s Sturmabteilung (SA), respectively.

Fascism, the most reactionary regime of oligopolistic and decaying capitalism, has always relied on violent paramilitary groups to intimidate political opponents and spread fear across society. In Italy, in 1919, Benito Mussolini formed a paramilitary squad of war veterans called Blackshirts (or squadristi) whose primary goal was to terrorize fascism’s political opponents, mainly the socialists and the communists. By the early 1920s, the squadristi had wiped out the Italian left and destroyed Italian democracy. In Germany, in 1921, Adolf Hitler established the SA, known as the Brownshirts due to their brown uniforms. They were street thugs who used violent intimidation against opponents of National Socialism and assaulted non-Aryan citizens, particularly Jewish citizens. Blackshirts and Brownshirts acted with impunity as the regular uniformed police in both Italy and Germany turned a blind eye to their thuggish tactics.

Violent paramilitary groups were seen by fascists as essential tools in the struggle to uproot the previous sociopolitical and cultural order and pave the way for the success of fascism’s ultimate goals and objectives, which are to promote extreme nationalism and do away with democratic liberties and implement policies without legal or political restraints while dehumanizing those labeled as “the enemy.” Under fascism, propaganda and violence work in unity in order to secure conformity and subdue the opposition.

Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside.

Enter the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). ICE was created in 2003 pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The US Congress has granted ICE “a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities,” which make it a very powerful federal law enforcement agency. The primary mission of ICE is to enforce immigration laws. It has the power to search, arrest, and deport undocumented immigrants. It can also detain and try to deport green card holders by claiming that they represent a threat to US national security.

On December 19, DHS announced that it had deported more than 620,000 noncitizens while 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have “self-deported” since Trump took office. If these figures are true and haven’t been exaggerated for propaganda purposes, we’re looking at the largest forced relocation of immigrants in a single year in the history of the United States. Immigration detention has also expanded dramatically in Trump's second term.

ICE immigration raids have been accused of excessive-use-of-force tactics and violating US citizens’ constitutional rights. Unshockingly enough given that the Trump administration relies on terror to push its inhuman agenda, DHS has used a variety of loathsome names for ICE immigration raids, ranging from “Operation Midway Blitz” (“Blitz” is a German word for lightning and was used to describe the bombing campaign undertaken by Nazi Germany on British cities, ports, and industrial sites in 1940) to “Operation Dirtbag.”

ICE has always been a notorious agency, even from the time it was designed to fight terrorism, and “the subject of numerous allegation of abuses and violations,” as has been pointed out by Brazilian professor and expert in international migration Gustavo Dias. ICE became especially aggressive during the Obama administration, when US liberals like to forget that it was responsible for over 3 million deportations. However, under Trump 2.0, ICE has been transformed into a fascist paramilitary squad, into a “virtual state police,” as Jamelle Bouie put it.

There are terrifying reasons for ICE’s transformation from an aggressive, rogue agency into Trump’s personal paramilitary squad. Trump’s domestic policy agenda revolves around the reshaping of US political culture, from liberal to illiberal through rollbacks in civil and human rights, putting an end to rising population diversity and creating (or fantasizing) in turn a white paradise, and advancing the interests of corporate oligarchs and digital feudal lords. Hence the attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); hence the violent immigration crackdown and banning citizens of “shithole countries” from vising the US; hence the erasing of non-white history; and hence the war against organized labor.

The successful implementation of all of the above policies demand loyalty to Trump’s actions from servants in the administrative state, conformity from major institutional actors, and a subdued civil society. No regime, however oppressive, can implement its policies without having a large network of allies, influential entities willing to conform, and citizen control and popular acquiescence. Trump has succeeded in securing loyalty by offering key federal positions to allies and supporters and replacing public servants with political loyalists. He has forced elite institutions to bend to his will with threats and intimidation tactics while tech billionaires and other members of the oligarchy kissed his ring because they feared retribution.

However, keeping the public subdued is trickier for any regime than cowing elite institutions and members of the economic elite into subservience. This is where ICE comes into play. ICE tactics are designed to instill fear in people and create chaos in communities as part of an overarching strategy aimed to silence opposition to Trump’s overall domestic agenda and let citizens know that this is the dawn of a new era for the United States. Dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0, and undesirable elements, the “radical left,” and all those deemed unpatriotic will be weeded out.

US citizens are an intended target as much as the immigrant communities across the nation by Trump’s lawlessness. ICE agents wearing masks and decked out in military-style gear reflects the militarization of law enforcement, which is a trademark of fascist regimes and brutal dictatorships. And the message intended by the unleashing of a paramilitary force, Trump’s own goon squad, throughout the nation’s communities is to let people know that you are either with us or against us. This was indeed the intended message behind the murder of Renee Nicole Good. ICE agents stopping US citizens, at random, and going from door to door demanding proof of citizenship, as has been happening in Minneapolis-St. Paul and other places, are scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany and speak volumes to the sociopolitical order envisioned by the Trump administration.

ICE is already acting in a similar way to how the Blackshirts (Italy) and the Brownshirts (Germany) functioned under Mussolini and Hitler, respectively. Fascism is not knocking at US’s door. It is already inside. And Minneapolis has emerged as the “new epicenter of resistance to Trump,” as France’s leading newspaper Le Monde aptly put it. The only question now is whether citizens throughout the land will resist to the end, until fascism is fully defeated, or surrender to fear and intimidation and, in turn, find themselves being deprived not only of their basic rights but also stripped of their dignity, which is what fascism ultimately does to human beings.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62704197&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C414%2C0%2C415,N,,2026-01-20 16:57:58.574257

(WPRI) — In his first executive order of the year, Mayor Brett Smiley has unveiled an executive order aimed at making it more difficult for federal immigration authorities to conduct enforcement operations in Providence.

The move comes on the one year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and just months after Smiley signed an executive order reaffirming that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

The executive order titled, “Prohibiting the Use of City Property for Civil Immigration Enforcement Activities,” states that city-owned parking lots, garages, parks, or buildings can’t be used as a “staging area, processing location, operations base, or other support for civil immigration enforcement,” unless authorities are executing “lawful judicial warrants.”

“The federal actions we are seeing across the nation are threatening immigrant communities and causing fear and uncertainty for all of our neighbors,” Smiley said Monday. “Providence’s strength comes from our diverse immigrant communities, and we will continue to do everything we can to protect families and maintain trust across our neighborhoods.”

The order also stated that city property can’t be used to assemble, mobilize or deploy vehicles, equipment, materials or personnel for the purpose of carrying out civil immigration enforcement operations.

The city will also install signage on properties that would fall under the executive order, stating that they may not be used for civil immigration enforcement.

The directive also says the city will also provide “standardized signage templates” to private landowners and leaseholders, “if they choose, for display to identify the nonpublic areas of the property in which the landowner or lease holder wishes to restrict activities related to civil immigration enforcement.”

Private landowners and leaseholders can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith,” according to the executive order.

In his last executive order, Smiley reaffirmed that the city is meant to be a “safe and welcoming place for all,” and that Providence police are not allowed to assist federal immigration authorities.

Less than a week ago, President Trump announced his administration will strip federal funding from sanctuary cities and states.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions, including Rhode Island, that were deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws.

U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.
""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""
In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota.
The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.","The Department of Justice asked a federal judge in Minnesota to allow the Trump administration's immigration operations to continue as tensions simmer over the tactics used by federal officers throughout the state.

The Jan. 19 filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last week by Minnesota and the Twin Cities, which sought to stop the deployment of immigration agents, saying the intervention violated the state's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez declined to issue an immediate restraining order expelling some 3,000 federal agents from Minnesota.

""Any injunction here would unduly interfere with federal immigration enforcement,"" lawyers for the Trump administration said in a court filing, adding that such relief would ""effectively give Minnesota state and local officials veto power over federal immigration enforcement within the borders of Minnesota.""

The back and forth comes after nearly two weeks of protests in the state following the killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. The fatal shooting sparked demonstrations nationwide and has deepened fissures between federal and state officials.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021, is also presiding over a case brought in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists who said federal agents violated their constitutional rights and used excessive force against demonstrators.

In that case, Menendez barred agents from using tactics such as pepper spray and arrest against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. In her order, Menendez said the record indicates that agents engaged in ""chilling conduct,"" including the ""drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics.""

The Justice Department said on Jan. 18 that it would appeal the injunction.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

In Minneapolis, skirmishes have increasingly broken out between protesters and federal officers across the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators interrupted a church service, claiming that one of the church's pastors is an ICE agent.

The Justice Department, which has said there is no basis to investigate the officer who fatally shot Good, launched a probe into the protest, citing potential civil rights violations. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy troops to Minnesota, on Jan. 20 called for the arrests and potential deportation of those involved in the demonstration.

The facility would be operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of what the Trump administration describes as a ramped-up enforcement effort targeting people living in the country illegally.

According to reporting from The Oklahoman, the plan involves converting an empty warehouse near Interstate 40 and Council Road into a detention and processing center, and federal officials did not notify city or state leaders beforehand because federal law does not require it.

State Sen. Carri Hicks, whose district includes parts of Oklahoma City, said the lack of notice immediately raised concerns.

“It really caused me a lot of concern,” Hicks said.

Hicks said neither city nor state officials were informed before plans were already well underway.

“I’m an elected official and lots of people have questions and are justly concerned that this could be already developed and in plans for implementation,” Hicks said.

Discussion of a possible detention center at the warehouse began last month after The Washington Post reported ICE planned to purchase warehouses nationwide to detain as many as 80,000 people.

On Sunday, The Oklahoman reported the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to city officials outlining plans for a small-scale processing center that could hold up to 1,500 detainees arrested by ICE.

Within a day of that report, anti-ICE signs appeared outside the building.

“Folks weren’t notified. Community didn’t even have awareness that this was undergoing plans,” Hicks said. “It’s not a rumor. We’ve seen the developed plans and we know that this is coming to that particular location.”

Hicks said her concerns center on what she describes as a lack of accountability and due process in ICE’s recent enforcement actions.

“At the heart of it, we have a federal immigration policy—and what we’re currently seeing is not an extension of what we know to be the processes in which folks can come here legally and receive their immigration status and become citizens of the United States of America,” Hicks said.

News 4 previously reported on an ICE raid in Oklahoma City last April in which agents searched a home public records showed their suspect had already sold and moved out of, leaving the new family living there traumatized.

“There are some terrible and very troubling stories that continue to occur,” Hicks said, “Particularly in the south side.”

The proposed detention center would sit in a commercial district along a busy roadway and was not originally designed to house detainees.

“It’s less than two miles from Western Heights School District, where about 50% of the students are Hispanic,” Hicks said. “So as I’m thinking about those students and I’m thinking about the parents and I’m thinking about the impact to that local community, it is appalling.”

Hicks said she wants federal officials to abandon the plan altogether.

“We don’t want your detention facility,” Hicks said. “If there are specific individuals that have warrants who absolutely need to be apprehended to protect public safety, then continue to do things through our normal way of operations, continue to make sure that these are targeted operations and not community-wide sweeps that throw everything into turmoil, because when the federal government leaves, our city will be left holding the price tag of diverting public services or public safety resources, and the fallout will be immense, and we, as the local residents, will be left with that fallout.”

Because of the federal holiday, News 4 has been unable to reach anyone with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment.

The Oklahoman also reported the phone number listed for the DHS official overseeing the project has been disconnected since Friday.",https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/A-sign-along-South-Council-Road-outside-a-planned-ICE-dtention-facility-in-Oklahoma-City-.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:37.574371

There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,"" he said. “They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a “targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao's family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.”

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping US

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's “Secret War” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don't feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.”

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies.
So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions.
“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said.
Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.","As outrage grew over the Trump administration’s immigration raids and the shooting death of a Minnesota woman at the hands of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., had had enough.

After consulting with key Democratic colleagues, she began pushing for impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in early January.

The decision drew mixed reactions. Two sources familiar with the response among Democratic lawmakers told MS NOW that, in a private meeting of top Democrats in early January, Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev., blasted the move, saying it poses a problem for “frontliners” — members in swing seats — who must appeal to more than just Democratic voters.

As battleground leadership, Lee is responsible for voicing the perspective of the party’s most politically vulnerable members.

“It got really intense,” one of the sources said, speaking anonymously with MS NOW to discuss the sensitive moment. “People are trying to figure out how to handle it right now.”

The private moment is emblematic of a larger public problem vexing Democrats: Their base wants action amid a deluge of controversial actions from President Donald Trump and his administration, and Democratic leaders in Washington — charged with winning elections and appealing to as many Americans as possible — are trying not to alienate potential swing voters by being anti-Trump or pro-impeachment.

Not that Democrats could impeach anyone on their own right now, anyway.

Republicans control the House and Senate, albeit by slim margins, and not all Democrats are aligned on impeachment strategies. Even now, multiple Democratic members — including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who quipped that he was “no mathematician” but knew the numbers — told MS NOW the votes aren’t there to move on impeachment against any Trump officials.

But Jeffries also told reporters last week that Democrats “haven’t ruled anything in and … haven’t ruled anything out.”

“Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” he said.

As Democratic leaders consider their stance, they’ve asked members to coordinate with ranking members of key committees on any potential pushes against administration officials, both to avoid surprising colleagues and to work to build consensus.

So far in this Congress, a handful of Democratic House members have filed impeachment resolutions. There’s one against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., on top of the new effort against Noem. Two members also tried to launch proceedings against Trump, who was impeached by the House twice in his first term — once for an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine and then for his actions to foment an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Republicans in the Senate acquitted him on both charges. And the latest resolutions died on the legislative vine last year.

Still, the threat against the president looms — including in Trump’s mind ahead of the midterms.

In remarks to House Republicans during their policy retreat earlier this month, Trump implored them to stay focused on winning the November midterm elections, because if they lose control of Congress, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the question of accountability — how to do it and what it means — is central in this Trump era, forced into greater focus given that Democrats are in the minority with few levers of power to pull.

Do they shut down the government to oppose the “most lawless Department of Homeland Security,” as Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has left open as a possibility? Do they offer articles of impeachment against Cabinet members? Would war powers resolutions, meant to restrain what the administration can do militarily, halt a march toward wars in Venezuela, Cuba and Greenland — even if Democrats could get Republicans on board to pass them?

At each new inflection point, there’s a dissonant response among Democrats.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MS NOW in December that Trump “crossed the line” for impeachment in his first term, but suggested the actions of his second term so far don’t warrant the same reaction.

“There’s only one person responsible for the impeachment of Donald Trump, and that’s Donald Trump,” Pelosi said. “He gave us no choice, he crossed the line here and there.”

“The fact is,” she continued, “what we’re here to do is meet the needs of the American people. If he goes to a place, that’s a different story, but it isn’t something you go looking for.”

Recommended

Asked for his view on the same question a few weeks later, Murphy declined to advocate for the House starting an impeachment inquiry on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But he said he has “common sense.”

“I know this president has committed 10 times more impeachable offenses in his second term as he did in his first term,” Murphy said.

On Capitol Hill, after Kelly’s impeachment resolution was announced, he dismissed questions from MS NOW about whether he supported the tactic.

Other Democrats, meanwhile, are convinced that now is the time to look into impeachment — whether it’s destined to fail or not.

“These individual actions are impeachable offenses in their own right, but their ever-mounting cumulative impact on our country’s stability and health puts everything in a new light,” Rep. April Delaney, D-Md., said in a statement after the U.S.’ military operation in Venezuela.

“I now believe that our Democratic caucus must imminently consider impeachment proceedings,” she added.

Beyond discussing whether impeachment would be an effort worth their time, some lawmakers also worry such a push — even a merited one — could backfire politically.

One House Democrat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, said an impeachment push could be a “political distraction” from the top issues during this election cycle, including affordability and the cost of living.

“There are just some exuberant Democrats that are anxious to pull the trigger on impeachment, and there are many more of us who agree that a lot of impeachable stuff is happening on a weekly basis around here,” this Democratic lawmaker told MS NOW. “But it is futile to pretend that you’re actually going to do an impeachment in this Congress, and it could actually be counterproductive because it raises expectations among Democratic base voters that this is something we can actually deliver.”

“Two things can be true at the same time,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told MS NOW last week.

She said Trump had “absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt” committed impeachable offenses. And she said “accountability needs to be a core part of our governance.”

But she also noted that she personally doesn’t run campaigns as “purely anti-Trump.”

“I’ve personally never run to represent my district on grounds of impeachment or not,” she said.

“I run for health care. My community wants to hear about raising the minimum wage, expanding unions, health, strengthening health care, and I think it’s important that we have an affirmative, positive vision for the country. But that doesn’t mean that we shy away from what needs to be done in terms of having accountability.”",https://www.ms.now/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260119_Trump-Year-One-Impeachment-bk.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-20 13:58:24.307937

Three cardinals in the US Catholic church have criticized the Trump administration’s foreign policy, saying its push to obtain or otherwise seize Greenland, recent military action in Venezuela, and cuts to humanitarian aid risk “destroying international relations and plunging the world into incalculable suffering”.

“Our country’s moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,” said a joint statement from Blase Cupich, Robert McElroy and Joseph Tobin, respectively the archbishops of Chicago, Washington DC, and Newark, New Jersey.

“And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity’s wellbeing now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies,” it added.

Without naming Donald Trump, the statement on Monday continued: “We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.”

Supreme court does not issue decision on legality of Trump's global tariffs

The supreme court did not issue a decision today on the legality of Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs.

It’s not immediately clear the next date the court will issue opinions.

Share

Two boxes have been brought out at the supreme court, which means there could be up to four decisions released today.

Share

As we wait on today’s opinions from the supreme court, it’s worth remembering that justices on the bench appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments justifying the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to slap duties on dozens of countries, citing a national emergency. A reminder that the ability to institute taxes is a power normally only afforded to Congress.

Per my last post, my colleagues Jakub Krupa and Yohannes Lowe are reporting the latest developments out of Europe at our dedicate live blog. While Graeme Wearden is providing updates from Davos on our business blog.

Graeme notes that at an earlier press conference today, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that there are four “fantastic candidates” for Federal Reserve chair. He expects the Trump administration to make an announcement “maybe as early as next week”.

In a spree of Truth Social posts overnight, Donald Trump posted an altered image of himself, planting a US flag in Greenland, alongside JD Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

In another post, also featuring a doctored photo, it shows Trump behind the resolute desk speaking to European leaders while he shows off a map that shows an American flag covering the US, Canada and Greenland.

Trump’s campaign to acquire the autonomous territory, that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, has reached fever pitch in recent days after he threatened tariffs against allied countries who have spoken out against his moves on Greenland. We can expect more friction as the president heads to Davos today.

Earlier, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen repeatedly criticized Trump for his levy threats, saying they would be “a mistake” and could send the relations into “a downward spiral” that benefits geopolitical rivals. She also pledged her solidarity and support with Denmark and Greenland.

Second man dies at Texas ICE detention facility in two weeks

Victoria Bekiempis

A second man being held at a US immigration detention facility in Texas has died in two weeks, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said on Monday.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole.

On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him. The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso …

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him. His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide.

Judge refuses to block new DHS policy limiting Congress members’ access to ICE facilities

Yohannes Lowe

In other news, a federal judge has refused to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit – and thereby inspect – immigration detention facilities.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities (you can read her judgment here).

Judge Cobb, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden, had blocked a virtually identical policy by the DHS last month, citing a clause in the appropriations law that funds the department and requires facilities to be open to congressional scrutiny.

However, ICE reestablished the visitation policy on 8 January 2026, with the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, ordering the DHS to re-impose the seven-day notice requirement – but “exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),” not regular appropriations, effectively bypassing the previous court order.

The background to this is that last June, a dozen House Democrats who were blocked from visiting immigration detention facilities sued the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully obstructing their efforts to visit federal immigration detention centers.

Members of Congress had tried to visit the facilities amid reports of inhumane and unsanitary conditions. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody so far this year.

In her ruling on Monday, Judge Cobb said the plaintiffs’ attorneys representing Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge the new policy and said the lawmakers would need to revise their complaint. She did not rule on the legality of the policy.

US supreme court to hear challenge to Hawaii’s strict gun law

Eric Berger

Hawaii, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States, will see its regulations challenged before the supreme court on Tuesday.

The court will consider the legality of the state’s law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public unless they have permission from the property owner.

The case, Wolford v Lopez, was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group.

US supreme court ruling on Trump's tariffs could come as early as Tuesday

Yohannes Lowe

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics. The much-anticipated US supreme court ruling on the legality of Donald Trump’s tariffs is expected in the coming weeks, and possibly as early as Tuesday, according to the Reuters news agency.

Those challenging the tariffs, which include some small businesses and US states, argue the president exceeded his authority when imposing the sweeping levies last year.

Two lower courts have already found that the president did not have the authority to impose global tariffs, which were brought in using emergency powers allowing the president to issue immediate orders and bypass Congress.

The supreme court, which is dominated by conservative justices, could throw out the tariffs – the cornerstone of Trump’s economic agenda – and force the president to send refunds to the US importers that paid them.

But if the supreme court does rule Trump overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs, the White House has other ways it can bring in import taxes.

In a 15 January interview with the NY Times published on Monday, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said the administration would “start the next day” to replace the tariffs with other levies if the ruling went against Trump.

“The reality is the president is going to have tariffs as part of his trade policy going forward,” Greer said. Last week, Trump said it would be “a complete mess” if the court were to strike down his trade tariffs, which he said would be difficult to reverse because businesses and countries could claim refunds.

Hiring bonuses of $50,000. Swelling ranks of ICE officers, to 22,000, in an expanding national force bigger than most police departments in America.

President Donald Trump promised the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history, but achieving his goal wouldn't have been possible without funding from the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Republicans in Congress, and it's fueling unprecedented immigration enforcement actions in cities like Minneapolis and beyond.

The GOP's big bill is ""supercharging ICE,"" one budget expert said, in ways that Americans may not fully realize — and that have only just begun.

""I just don't think people have a sense of the scale,"" said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress and a former adviser to the Biden administration's Office of Management and Budget.

""We're looking at ICE in a way we've never seen before,"" he said.

Trump's big bill creates massive law enforcement force

As the Republican president marks the first year of his second term, the immigration enforcement and removal operation that has been a cornerstone of his domestic and foreign policy agenda is rapidly transforming into something else — a national law enforcement presence with billions upon billions of dollars in new spending from U.S. taxpayers.

The shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis showed the alarming reach of the new federalized force, sparking unrelenting protests against the military-styled officers seen going door to door to find and detain immigrants. Amid the outpouring of opposition, Trump revived threats to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the demonstrations and the U.S. Army has 1,500 soldiers ready to deploy.

But Trump's own public approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has slipped since he took office, according to an AP-NORC poll.

""Public sentiment is everything,"" said Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez, D-N.Y., at a press conference at the Capitol with lawmakers supporting legislation to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Americans, she said, are upset at what they are seeing. ""They didn't sign on for this,"" she said.

Border crossings down, but Americans confront new ICE enforcements

To be sure, illegal crossings into the U.S. at the Mexico border have fallen to historic lows under Trump, a remarkable shift from just a few years ago when President Joe Biden's Democratic administration allowed millions of people to temporarily enter the U.S. as they adjudicated their claims to stay.

Yet as enforcement moves away from the border, the newly hired army of immigration officers swarming city streets with aggressive tactics — in Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere — is something not normally seen in the U.S.

Armed and masked law enforcement officers are being witnessed smashing car windows, yanking people from vehicles and chasing and wrestling others to the ground and hauling them away — images playing out in endless loops on TVs and other screens.

And it's not just ICE. A long list of supporting agencies, including federal, state and local police and sheriff's offices, are entering into contract partnerships with Homeland Security to conduct immigration enforcement operations in communities around the nation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has warned Democrats that this is ""no time to be playing games"" by stirring up the opposition to immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis and other places.

""They need to get out of the way and allow federal law enforcement to do its duty,"" Johnson said at the Capitol.

Noem has said the immigration enforcement officers are acting lawfully. The department insists it's targeting criminals in the actions, what officials call the worst of the worst immigrants.

However, reports show that non-criminals and U.S. citizens are also being forcibly detained by immigration officers. The Supreme Court last year lifted a ban on using race alone in the immigration stops.

Trump last month called Somali immigrants ""garbage,"" comments that echoed his past objections to immigrants from certain countries.

The Trump administration has set a goal of 100,000 detentions a day, about three times what's typical, with 1 million deportations a year.

Money from the big bill flows with few restraints

With Republican control of Congress, the impeachment of Noem or any other Trump official is not a viable political option for Democrats, who would not appear to have the vote tally even among their own ranks.

In fact, even if Congress wanted to curtail Trump's immigration operations — by threatening to shut down the government, for example — it would be difficult to stop the spend.

What Trump called the ""big, beautiful bill"" is essentially on autopilot through 2029, the year he's scheduled to finish his term and leave office.

The legislation essentially doubled annual Homeland Security funding, adding $170 billion to be used over four years. Of that, ICE, which typically receives about $10 billion a year, was provided $30 billion for operations and $45 billion for detention facilities.

""The first thing that comes to mind is spending on this level is typically done on the military,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Trump is militarizing immigration enforcement.""

Ahead, Congress will need to consider routine funding for Homeland Security by Jan. 30 or risk a partial shutdown in some operations. The GOP's version of the annual bill would provide about $92 billion for the agency, including $10 billion for ICE. A growing group of Democratic senators and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have had enough. They say they won't support additional funds without significant changes.

Lawmakers are considering various restrictions on ICE operations, including limiting arrests around hospitals, courthouses, churches and other sensitive locations and ensuring that officers display proper identification and refrain from wearing face masks.

""I think ICE needs to be totally torn down,"" said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on CNN over the weekend.

""People want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals,"" he said. And not what he called this ""goon squad.""

Big spending underway, but Trump falls short of goals

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has begun tapping the new money at its disposal. The department informed Congress it has obligated roughly $58 billion — most of that, some $37 billion, for border wall construction, according to a person familiar with the private assessment but unauthorized to discuss it.

The Department of Homeland Security said its massive recruitment campaign blew past its 10,000-person target to bring in 12,000 new hires, more than doubling the force to 22,000 officers, in a matter of months.

""The good news is that thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill that President Trump signed, we have an additional 12,000 ICE officers and agents on the ground across the country,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a December statement.

The department also announced it had arrested and deported about 600,000 people. It also said 1.9 million other people had ""voluntarily self-deported"" since January 2025, when Trump took office.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-minneapolis-immigration-mn-0945-00ab0e.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:01:13.387295

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said.
Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.
Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.
But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.","Frustrated with the way the country was headed, Pablo Payan cast a ballot for Donald Trump in 2024, mainly drawn to the Republican presidential candidate’s pledge to bring economic strength to the nation as well as an America First mindset.

The father of four from Merrillville usually favored Democrats in the past but was hoping for a nationwide change of direction. Less foreign aid. More border security. Lower inflation. Greater economic growth.

Yet roughly a year into Trump’s second presidency, Payan has buyer’s remorse.

“I did vote for Trump. But now I regret it,” Payan said. “He’s contradicting everything he said he would do. And now it’s extremism. And immigration. And racial profiling. And sending money to foreign countries.”

As the one-year milestone of the second Trump administration approaches, various polls indicate waning approval for the president compared with the higher ratings he had at the start of his second term.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month showed 42% of Americans approved of Trump’s job overall. This was up slightly from lower percentages throughout most of the fall and winter but still down from the 47% approval rating around the time Trump took office in January 2025.

While the president has kept his MAGA base largely intact, the Tribune interviewed several Trump voters who have expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of his leadership during the first year of his second term.

Although they favored the president over Democrat Kamala Harris during the campaign, they now share grave concerns over the Trump administration’s handling of everything from economic strategies to foreign policy to domestic problems.

Aggressive immigration enforcement was a repeated complaint from those who backed the president during the election but now have doubts about his leadership. Chicago was the epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation policy this fall, an effort that relied heavily upon racial profiling and largely failed to target the “worst of the worst” criminals as promised.

One man from Skokie grew incensed after witnessing Border Patrol agents question U.S. citizens who were working on his property during an immigration enforcement onslaught across the Chicago area on Halloween.

A Navy combat veteran was angered after immigration officials detained his wife — a foreign-born green card holder — at O’Hare International Airport over the summer.

Payan, a 41-year-old general contractor whose parents were born in Mexico, said he believed campaign rhetoric that the administration would target felons and violent criminals who were here without legal permission, a mission he supported.

But the reality of immigration enforcement — which has included turbulent protests, detained U.S. citizens and the violent arrests of both residents who are legally in the U.S. and those without legal permission — has been a stark contrast to those promises.

“Going door to door, just asking people at the gas stations or at Home Depot, ‘Hey, what’s your status?’ That’s racial profiling at its best,” Payan said.

While there isn’t evidence of a mass exodus of Trump supporters, there are signs of weakening favor among those who cast a ballot for the president, said Alexander Theodoridis, associate professor and co-director of the UMass Poll at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Of Trump voters polled in July, 69% expressed confidence in their choice and only 1% said they regretted their vote; 2% said they had some regrets and might make a different choice if they could go back, according to the UMass Poll.

Another 3% said they wished they hadn’t voted at all and 6% had mixed feelings, the survey found.

But 19% responded that they had some concerns about his presidency — a contingent the Trump administration and other Republicans might find troubling later this year in the midterm elections, which can reshape control of Congress, Theodoridis said.

Historically, the midterms often go against the incumbent party, he noted.

“We’re very likely to see it this time around too,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean lots of people are regretful of their Trump vote in an open or even self-aware way. But they might just not be enthusiastic enough to turn out and vote for … the Republican running for Congress in their district.”

The dip in support comes as some high-profile cracks are emerging among Trump’s often-lockstep base.

Once a loyal champion of the president, former U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has severely criticized Trump over his handling of files related to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as foreign policy and health care issues.

The feud intensified with Trump calling Greene a “traitor” and “wacky,” while pledging to endorse a challenger if she sought reelection. Amid the public fallout, Greene announced her resignation in November and stepped down earlier this month.

Elon Musk, a top donor during the 2024 election and former leader of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, has posted a flurry of attacks on his X social media platform targeting the president’s handling of the Epstein files as well as spending and tariffs. He and the president seem to be on better terms now, as Musk recently shared a picture of them dining at Mar-a-Lago on social media.

And despite intense pressure from the White House, a group of Republican state senators from Indiana helped defeat a Trump-backed redistricting plan that would have favored their party.

Among them was northwest Indiana Republican state Sen. Michael Bohacek, 8th District, who threatened to vote against the redrawn congressional map after Trump used a slur for people with intellectual abilities in reference to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Bohacek, whose daughter has Down syndrome, rebuked the president’s offensive language and encouraged him to “use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”

As for Payan, he’s worried about the nation’s increasingly hawkish foreign policy, climaxing earlier this month with the U.S. capture of then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s increasing desire to control Greenland.

“It’s the dictator blueprint,” he said.

Payan said he’s faced backlash from Democrats because he voted for Trump. He’s also been castigated by Republicans for opposing the president.

But he believes it’s everyone’s civic duty to criticize leaders when they’re wrong, even if it’s a candidate they supported during the election.

“Be vocal and express your voice,” he said. “A lot of people are scared to talk because they might get fired from work or their friends might unfriend them. And I think, what’s more important? Your voice or your relationship with your co-worker or friend?”

‘Poor choices’

While voting in person on Election Day in November 2020, Morgan Krupinski spent about five minutes holding his pen and grappling with the final decision at the top of his nearly completed ballot: The options for president, as Trump faced Democrat Joe Biden.

“I couldn’t do it,” he recalled. “I voted. But I abstained from the presidential choice. It’s kind of a reflection of where our leaders are. We have a lot of poor choices, many times.”

The 30-year-old who works in technology had voted for Trump in 2016 but grew disappointed by the end of his first term, as unrest gripped the country amid the COVID pandemic and protests following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Neither Trump nor Biden seemed equipped to lead at the time, he recounted.

Afterward, the Jan. 6, 2020, insurrection in the U.S. Capitol deeply upset Krupinski.

As the 2024 election approached, he highly favored another Republican candidate, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

He saw her as a strong leader who could help quell two major wars plaguing the globe — the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war — while uniting a largely fragmented United States.

But Haley, the last significant Republican challenger to Trump, withdrew her longshot candidacy in March 2024.

Then the July assassination attempt on Trump marked a turning point for Krupinski, who was moved by the candidate’s speech a few days later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

“Together, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump told the crowd. “The discord and division in our society must be healed.”

That moment held echoes of President George W. Bush’s address following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and President Barack Obama’s words after the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden, two historical messages that had seemed to bring the nation together, Krupinski recalled.

So in 2024, he returned to his polling place and cast a hopeful vote for Trump.

Krupinski was gratified by some of the president’s international accomplishments, including a Trump-led plan for peace in Gaza in early October and release of the Israeli hostages by Hamas.

There were also concerns. Krupiniski criticized the administration’s steep tariffs, which “are not really a traditional Republican free-market issue.”

The self-described Reagan-style conservative grew troubled by “hyper-nationalistic rhetoric” among some in the MAGA contingent, which he believes Trump has an obligation to condemn.

But his worries for the new administration culminated on Halloween, when Trump’s often-combative immigration crackdown touched Krupinski’s home in Skokie.

While working inside his house, several Border Patrol vehicles suddenly pulled up on his quiet north suburban street.

Led by Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, a swarm of armed immigration agents filled the scene, demanding documents from two workers from an American company who were providing flood control on Krupinski’s front lawn.

They were able to provide proof that they were U.S. citizens. But the encounter disturbed Krupinski.

“I believe we need to have a strong border and we need to get rid of people who are committing crimes and who are doing the wrong thing,” he said. “But for that to happen in such a way that’s so indiscriminate: Going down residential streets and stopping people based on their appearance and what they’re doing, without a true, reasonable cause?”

Immigration officials had no reason to stop and question those workers, Krupinski added.

“If you’re going to do immigration enforcement you have to do it legally and constitutionally,” Krupinski said. “Now what I think is going on is a very strained and expansive view of the authority that they have. And it’s very unsettling.”

Many Chicago residents agree with him in the wake of the Trump administration’s local ramped-up immigration enforcement, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. Asked if immigration enforcement has gone too far, 65% of Chicagoans said it has, according to a recent survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. Almost 13% of those polled supported enforcement activities and more than 8% said they have not gone far enough; 14% of those surveyed were unsure.

Krupinski believes he made the best decision he could on Election Day in November.

Yet he’s been speaking out against the administration’s immigration enforcement methods, particularly to fellow conservatives and others who voted for Trump.

Amid a highly polarized and divided political climate, they might be more inclined to listen to him than a staunch Democrat or more liberal voice, Krupinski reasoned.

“So I feel like I have a unique opportunity to speak to the people on my side of things,” he added. “I hope I can change people’s minds to say no one is above criticism and no one is above being called out when they do something bad, particularly in the government. This is the right we have as citizens.”

Partisan strife

The Missouri couple were returning home from a trip to Ireland for a family memorial when they were stopped by federal authorities at O’Hare International Airport in July.

Donna Hughes-Brown, an Irish citizen and legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by immigration authorities.

Although she’s been a green card holder for decades, Hughes-Brown said the officials cited two misdemeanor offenses against her for writing bad checks in 2012 and 2015.

The 58-year-old grandmother was held at O’Hare for several days and then transferred to a facility in Campbell County, Kentucky, where she was detained for more than four months.

Her husband, Jim Brown, a Navy veteran who fought in Operation Desert Storm, had cast a ballot for Trump in 2024. But this wasn’t the kind of immigration enforcement the campaign had promised, he said.

“What they were doing to my wife was wrong,” said Brown. They live in northeastern Missouri about 20 miles from the Illinois border.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to Tribune requests for comment.

The case made international headlines and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers, including Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, advocated for Hughes-Brown’s release.

During a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee hearing in December, U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island grilled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the matter.

Brown attended the hearing as well.

“She did not come here illegally and she has never committed any crime other than writing two bad checks, totaling $80, 10 years ago. She is currently in prison and facing deportation,” Magaziner said during the hearing. “Ms. Noem, will you thank Mr. Brown for his service to our country?”

“Thank you, Mr. Brown, for your service to our country,” Noem responded.

The Homeland Security secretary added that it’s not her job to pick and choose which laws get enforced, though Noem did pledge to review the case.

In mid-December, Hughes-Brown was released and returned to her Missouri home. The couple are now working on the process for her to become a naturalized citizen.

“I’m relieved that Donna is finally back home with her family and look forward to supporting her in her naturalization journey, but she never should have been detained in the first place,” Duckworth said in a written statement.

During a recent interview with the Tribune, Brown had harsh words for the Trump administration.

“They sold a whole different idea than what’s actually happening. The cruelty and the nonsense that’s going on right now is just wrong,” he said. “If you watched between the first Trump presidency and now, it’s completely different. We’re trying to bully other countries and do things we shouldn’t be doing.”

Yet he stressed several times that he didn’t want to “get partisan,” noting that some immigration laws the administration’s enforcing have been on the books for years. Former President Obama, a Democrat, had been dubbed “the deporter-in-chief,” by immigration advocates, Brown correctly noted.

Since his wife’s story went viral, Brown said he’s been lambasted by liberals for voting for Trump and admonished by conservatives for criticizing the administration.

The only way to improve the country is “to stop being partisan,” Brown said, adding that he blames much of the nation’s strife on the two-party political system.

“It’s the fomentation,” he said. “When you fight with each other instead of coming up with a solution.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-trump-voters-year10.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:17.343274

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system.","Since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Congress has assigned primary responsibility for adjudicating federal employment disputes to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The board consists of three members appointed by the president, removable “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” To promote impartiality, no more than two members may belong to the same political party, and the board may act only with a two-member quorum.

Because the CSRA provides a comprehensive adjudicatory regime for employment disputes, employees generally must exhaust their claims before the MSPB prior to seeking judicial review in federal court. Claims submitted to the MSPB are adjudicated initially by an administrative judge. Either the government or the employee may appeal the administrative judge’s decision to the board. Then, only after the board issues a final decision may a federal employee seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

The MSPB is a shell of its former self. Since President Trump’s inauguration, three developments have eroded any confidence that federal employees may have had in the MSPB’s independence and impartiality. First, in Harris v. Bessent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress may not prohibit the president from removing the MSPB’s board members, thereby upholding Trump’s removal of Chair Cathy Harris. Second, the MSPB lacked a quorum to review appeals from March to October 2025, leaving employees in procedural limbo and foreclosing the possibility of judicial review. Third, and finally, the Justice Department has argued that the MSPB is legally obligated to follow interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). If accepted, that position would permit the OLC to exert control over the MSPB’s interpretations of civil service law.

On Jan. 9, the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear Harris v. Bessent. The decision may represent the final nail in the coffin for the MSPB’s independence. Courts should no longer pretend that the MSPB operates as Congress intended. If Congress wishes to preserve independence in the adjudication of federal employment disputes, it must act legislatively—either by creating a court dedicated to civil service law or by permitting existing courts to hear such claims.

The President’s Removal Power

At the core of the MSPB’s unraveling lies a more fundamental shift in constitutional law: the steady expansion of the presidential power over administrative agencies. For much of the modern administrative state, Congress relied on for-cause removal protections to insulate adjudicatory agencies from direct presidential control. That settlement has been under pressure for more than a decade, as the Supreme Court cast increasing doubts on Congress’s authority to limit the president’s ability to remove principal officers.

Article II of the Constitution provides that “the executive power shall be vested in a President.” In Seila Law v. CFPB, the Supreme Court held that the president must have authority to remove principal officers who wield significant executive power, so that those officers “remain accountable to the President, whose authority they wield.” At the same time, the Supreme Court preserved a limited exception for officers serving on multimember commissions that exercise quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power, consistent with its earlier decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, however, indicated that the Court is poised to overturn—or at least substantially limit—Humphrey’s Executor.

The respective removals of Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger and MSPB Chair Harris have brought these issues squarely to the forefront for agencies that govern the civil service. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision to stay an injunction restoring Dellinger’s position, Dellinger ended his lawsuit because he believed that his “odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.” Meanwhile, in Trump v. Wilcox¸ the Supreme Court stayed an order enjoining Harris’s removal, concluding that the government was likely to show that the MSPB “exercise[s] considerable executive power.” The Court declined, however, to address whether the MSPB falls within the exception for multimember commissions.

Following the Supreme Court’s order, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit held in Harris v. Bessent that removal protections for MSPB members violate Article II. Writing for the majority, Judge Gregory Katsas held that the MSPB exercises “substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers that Humphrey’s Executor deemed to be merely quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.” The panel stitched together several different precedents to narrow sharply—if not effectively hollow out—Humphrey’s Executor. In its view, Congress may delegate neither judicial nor legislative power, and, therefore, any power exercised by agencies within the executive branch must be executive in nature. Even so-called quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, the court reasoned, are executive in nature. Accordingly, the president must have the authority to remove any principal officer exercising significant quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power because these powers are executive in nature. On this logic, the majority speculated that “Humphrey’s Executor thus governs only agencies with purely advisory functions—like, say, the United States Commission on Civil Rights.” At the same time, the majority acknowledged that—unless and until the Supreme Court finally overturns it—Humphrey’s Executor still supports Congress’s power to impose removal protections on agencies that exercise the narrowest forms of quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial power.

The panel adopted an exceptionally narrow understanding of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers. Under its reasoning, only the limited and historically contingent functions expressly identified in Humphrey’s Executor—such as advising Congress or acting as a judge-like adjudicator without policymaking authority—can fall within those categories. Modern forms of administrative adjudication and rule implementation, even when long understood as quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative, are recharacterized as exercises of executive power simply because they occur within the executive branch.

Applying that framework, the D.C. Circuit panel concluded that the MSPB’s authority could not be described as plausibly quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. Emphasizing the board’s power to regulate the removal of its administrative law judges, issue final decisions, award reinstatement and back pay, and to represent itself in litigation, the court reasoned that the MSPB exercises significant executive power that places it squarely outside the Humphrey’s Executor exception. On this view, the board’s adjudicatory function is not analogous to the restrained model contemplated in 1935 but instead reflects modern administrative governance in which adjudication is inseparable from policymaking and enforcement.

The D.C. Circuit panel’s myopic conception of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power dramatically constrains Congress’s ability to insulate agencies from presidential control. By anchoring the constitutional analysis to a limited account of the Federal Trade Commission’s power in 1935, the decision ignores that the categories of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power predated Humphrey’s Executor and were understood more broadly at the time. Although the D.C. Circuit declined to “decide whether Congress may restrict the President’s ability to remove officers with solely adjudicatory functions,” its cramped understanding of what qualifies as quasi-judicial effectively resolves the question. Modern administrative adjudication—because it involves finality, remedial discretion, and the application of broad statutory standards—will almost always be reclassified as executive power, leaving Congress with little practical ability to design independent adjudicatory bodies within the administrative state. The decision by the full D.C. Circuit not to rehear Trump v. Bessent means that any effort to restore removal protections for the MSPB must come from the Supreme Court.

Some possibility remains that the Supreme Court may ultimately retain an exception from the president’s removal power for principal officers within adjudicatory agencies. During oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, several justices pressed the government on whether Congress retains authority to structure agencies that primarily adjudicate disputes, invoking historical examples of claims courts and other adjudicatory institutions designed to operate with independence. Those exchanges point toward a narrower—and more historically grounded—path: The Court could reject the D.C. Circuit’s efforts to collapse quasi-judicial power into the executive power, reaffirm that adjudication has long occupied a distinct constitutional space, and preserve Congress’s authority to protect principal officers who perform predominantly adjudicatory functions. Whether the Court is willing to take that path remains uncertain. But if it does not, the MSPB’s fate will stand as a warning that adjudication of federal employment disputes within the executive branch may no longer be constitutionally sustainable.

The OLC’s Efforts to Control MSPB Interpretations

The erosion of the MSPB’s independence has not occurred solely through structural attacks on removal protections for the board. It has also unfolded through a subtle campaign to subordinate the board’s legal interpretations to the Department of Justice, and ultimately to the president.

The Trump administration has advanced an expansive conception of the attorney general’s authority over legal interpretation. Although OLC opinions are binding on Cabinet departments, the OLC would not issue decisions binding independent agencies without their consent. President Trump, however, has ordered that “[t]he President and the Attorney General’s opinions of questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties,” including employees within independent agencies.

In recent filings, the Department of Justice has argued that the MSPB must obey the OLC’s precedents. In Jackler v. Department of Justice, the Justice Department argued that an OLC opinion issued in September 2025 “provides binding legal advice within the Executive Branch” and therefore must control the MSPB’s handling of constitutional questions in removal cases. The OLC’s opinion purports to overturn the MSPB’s decision in Davis-Clewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs. By the department’s account, because the OLC speaks for the executive branch, any MSPB decision inconsistent with the OLC’s interpretation “does not represent the legal position of the Executive Branch” and must be vacated or remanded. This is a striking claim. The MSPB is not a litigating component of the Justice Department, nor is it an executive department subject to the attorney general’s supervisory authority. Congress instead designed the board as an adjudicatory body meant to resolve disputes between agencies and employees—including the Justice Department itself—according to law. Treating the OLC’s views as binding on the MSPB collapses that adjudicatory function into the very chain of command whose actions the board is supposed to review.

If accepted, this model fundamentally alters the nature of MSPB adjudication. The CSRA presupposes that the MSPB will apply statutes and precedent neutrally, subject to judicial review—not that it will take direction from the OLC when the executive branch dislikes the board’s answers. Allowing the OLC to dictate legal interpretation of civil service laws deprives the MSPB of its independence and enables the OLC to construct precedents that are more favorable to agency employers. Structural removal protections matter little if the board’s legal reasoning is overridden through the Justice Department’s “guidance.” In that sense, the OLC’s asserted authority over MSPB interpretation completes the transformation already begun by attacks on removal protections: the conversion of an adjudicatory body into an instrument of presidential control.

The MSPB’s Quorum Problems

The removal power and the asserted authority to control the MSPB’s legal interpretations matter only if the board is permitted to function at all. With the expansion of the removal power, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—designed as a safeguard for deliberation and impartiality—has become a point of leverage to assert presidential control.

The MSPB can act only with a quorum of two members. When the president possesses at-will removal authority, that quorum requirement becomes fragile. By removing at least two members from the board, the president can break the agency’s quorum and halt its ability to issue decisions. As recent events illustrate, the president need not remove the entire board to paralyze it; selective removals or the refusal to fill vacancies can suffice. This dynamic converts the quorum rule from a protection of collective decision-making into a tool for preventing adjudication altogether.

The consequences for federal employees are severe. During periods without a quorum, employees can receive initial decisions from administrative judges, but if either party seeks board review, those cases stall indefinitely. In Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit treated the absence of a quorum as a temporary procedural defect rather than a structural denial of adjudication, leaving employees trapped in limbo.

This problem is not hypothetical. The MSPB has a long and troubling history of lacking a quorum. From January 2017 until March 2022, the board lacked a quorum for more than five years. During that period, the MSPB was unable to issue final decisions on petitions for review, producing a roughly 3,800 case backlog and leaving thousands of employees without timely resolution of claims involving removals, suspensions, and whistleblower retaliation. Although the MSPB adopted rules in 2024 to allow limited internal actions to proceed without a quorum, those measures did not—and could not—solve the core problem. The board still may not issue final, precedential decisions on petitions for review without two members and thus cannot perform its central function during quorum lapses.

The Senate confirmed a new MSPB member in October 2025, restoring its quorum. The relatively quick restoration prevented a similar backlog that resulted from 2017 to 2022, but the quorum’s restoration underscores a deeper structural vulnerability rather than resolving it. Because the president can now remove board members at will, party-balancing requirements offer little protection. A president might remove members of the opposing party, replace them with loyalists, or leave seats vacant long enough to prevent the board from acting. Even when a quorum technically exists, the threat of removal hangs over members, and the ease with which quorums are broken ensures that the MSPB’s capacity to function depends on presidential forbearance rather than statutory design.

In short, the MSPB’s quorum requirement—once a structural feature meant to safeguard neutral, bipartisan adjudication—has become another point of presidential control. Removal authority means quorums can be destroyed at will; the exhaustion doctrine prevents employees from escaping to federal court; and repeated historical failures show that these are not isolated or accidental breakdowns. Even when quorums are restored, the combination of removal power and partisan manipulation means that the MSPB’s ability to act remains contingent and fragile. Congress designed the MSPB to be an independent adjudicator. In practice, quorum fragility has converted it into an agency that can be silenced whenever its decisions become inconvenient.

The MSPB No Longer Functions as Congress Intended

The CSRA’s channeling and exhaustion regime rests on a specific legislative bargain: Congress would strip district courts of jurisdiction over most federal employment disputes and, instead, create a separate, independent adjudicator to decide those disputes before judicial review. Congress did not simply assign cases to “an agency.” It deliberately split the original agency tasked with personnel management—the Civil Service Commission—to separate the task of managing personnel from the task of adjudicating employment disputes. It created the independent MSPB precisely to eliminate the inherent conflict of having the government’s chief personnel office also serve as the appellate review in adverse actions.

In establishing the MSPB, the Senate Committee Report framed this independence as a “cornerstone” of civil service reform responsible for safeguarding the merit system. Independence was necessary to ensure that “the Board should be insulated from the kinds of political pressures that have led to violations of merit principles in the past.” Indeed, “[a]bsent the mandate for independence of the Merit Systems Protection Board, it is unlikely that the committee would have granted the Office of Personnel Management the power it has or the latitude to delegate personnel authority to the agencies.” In other words, without the MSPB’s independence, Congress would not have created the civil service system that we have today.

Those design choices are now eviscerated. If the president can remove MSPB members at will, then the statutory features Congress had treated as safeguards—partisan balancing, staggered terms, and decisional independence—become discretionary norms that survive only as long as the White House tolerates them. The same is true of the CSRA’s broader architecture.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently underscored that Congress’s decision to channel claims away from district courts was “predicated on the existence of a functioning and independent MSPB and Special Counsel,” and remanded for fact finding on whether that premise has been undermined. Contrary to the Federal Circuit’s decision in Rodriguez, the Fourth Circuit suggested that the MSPB no longer functioned as intended because it lacked a quorum and that the government had argued that the board’s removal protections violated the separation of powers. The Fourth Circuit explained that Congress’s jurisdiction-stripping design presupposes not just a process, but one capable of “adequate and independent review,” such that if key Senate-confirmed positions “go unfilled” or if the MSPB and special counsel cannot perform their duties, “the framework of the CSRA would be thwarted” and congressional intent “defeat[ed].” In other words, exhaustion and channeling make sense only if the adjudicatory institutions Congress created actually exist as Congress designed them.

If the MSPB is no longer structurally independent—or can be disabled through at-will removals and partisan restructuring—then the CSRA’s exhaustion regime risks becoming a one-way ratchet: Employees are barred from federal court on the theory that Congress provided an adequate substitute, even when that substitute no longer provides the neutral, functioning review Congress intended. At that point, Congress faces an unavoidable choice. One option is to take adjudication out of the executive branch entirely by creating an Article I court for civil service disputes. The other is more modest but immediate: Amend the CSRA to permit covered employees to proceed directly to federal district court (or to a specialized appellate path) when the MSPB lacks a quorum, cannot act in a timely fashion, or otherwise fails to provide the independent adjudication Congress designed. This all assumes that the civil service avoids the darkest possibility: a decision from the Supreme Court that the CSRA is wholly unconstitutional. Provided the administrative state weathers that possibility, Congress will need to restore the basic bargain that animated the CSRA.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/united-states-court-of-appeals-for-the-federal-circuit-washington-dc.jpg?sfvrsn=a99fcf49_5,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:13.728713

In today’s issue:

▪ 1 year of Trump 2.0

▪ Trump’s Greenland letter sparks blowback

▪ Cassidy charts path after presidential snub

▪ Putin gets Trump invite to join Gaza board

President Trump is taking a broad view of executive authority and showing no signs of slowing down on testing his own power as he enters his second year back in office.

Trump has faced off with Congress, the courts and various states as he pushes for a stronger presidential hand in his second term. He’s also increasingly focused on exerting his influence on the world stage.

The president will mark Tuesday’s anniversary of returning to office with an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich on “Katie Pavlich Tonight” airing at 10 p.m. EST, before jetting to Davos, Switzerland, to meet with world leaders and press his foreign agenda at the World Economic Forum.

Greenland and blowback to Trump’s campaign to secure the Danish territory will be top of mind for leaders at the forum, along with the president’s push to have countries join his “Board of Peace” to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

▪ The Hill: Trump starts year with Greenland tumult.

Trump’s foreign policy moves have captured much of the attention heading into the second year of his term, with the stunning U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro jumpstarting 2026 and surprising many people, including congressional leaders.

Democrats and some Republicans pushed back against the administration’s unilateral action and Trump’s initial suggestions the U.S. would take over Venezuela with Maduro ousted. Trump has seemingly backed off on the idea the U.S. would directly control Caracas, instead focusing more on ensuring a strong U.S.-Venezuelan relationship to gain access to the country’s large oil reserves.

But an effort for Congress to reassert its authority failed in the Senate after the White House pressured enough Republicans to back off a war powers resolution that aimed to prevent the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela. Even if it passed the Senate, it was likely dead on arrival in the House, making the resolution only symbolic.

And its failure raised more doubts about the potential for success of other war powers resolutions concerning Greenland, Colombia and Iran that some Democrats have floated.

At home, immigration enforcement is a priority for the president, and the most recent front in that battle has been Minnesota, particularly after the killing of a woman earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

Trump has in recent days threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to respond to ongoing protests following the killing, just the latest time he’s threatened to use the centuries-old law. And multiple reports indicate the Pentagon has ordered 1,500 active-duty troops to be ready for deployment in Minnesota.

If Trump goes through with invoking the law, it would almost certainly face legal challenges questioning his authority.

The Hill’s Rebecca Beitsch reports Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration with the most visible enforcement effort seen in the country’s history.

The administration has also targeted many who have legal status in the country, seeking to curtail ways to lawfully enter the U.S. Democrats have argued many of these actions have been unlawful, including the administration’s deportation of some migrants without allowing them an opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of gang ties.

But Beitsch notes much of the administration’s immigration push is just beginning, as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave ICE a major boost in funding to expand detention capacity.

▪ The Hill: Immigration crackdown gets poor marks from voters.

▪ The Hill: Trump’s suspension of naturalization ceremonies leaves citizens in limbo.

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigations into high-profile figures are also further fueling allegations Trump is pushing his administration to go after his opponents for political reasons.

The DOJ has historically had independence and a certain amount of distance from the White House to ensure legal integrity, but Trump has at times sidelined that to specifically call for certain political opponents to face charges.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell became the latest figure to be under investigation from the DOJ, apparently concerning his congressional testimony about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters.

The DOJ is meanwhile still pursuing a case against former national security adviser John Bolton and challenging the dismissal of its cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Other top Democrats such as Sen. Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) have been referred to the DOJ for prosecution.

Trump has sought to distance himself from these probes while continuing to attack the subjects of them. But the announcement of an investigation into Powell adds to the trend of another high-profile Trump critic facing possible legal action.

The administration has also battled Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds over a video they made last year in which they urged U.S. service members to disobey unlawful orders. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), a former CIA officer, said last week she’s under federal investigation while Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has vowed to fight the Pentagon’s efforts to demote his military rank over the video.

Smart Take with Blake Burman

Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act to send the U.S. military to Minnesota. Ronald Vitiello, a senior adviser to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told me Monday night any action would be “conditions based.” I also asked about how long ICE could be on the ground in Minnesota. Vitiello said it could be months.

“It could be a long time. Look, this could get better immediately, if the state and local officials put their hand out and ask ICE to come into these institutions to help identify the criminal element that’s also in the country illegally and work directly with ICE to get them removed,” he said.

What’s clear is the focus on Minnesota isn’t going away anytime soon. ICE could be on the ground in a large capacity for a while, and Trump is calling for a renewed focus on the fraud in the state.

Leading the Day

GREENLAND BLOWBACK: International leaders, Democrats and some Republicans are slamming the president’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre tying the Nobel committee’s decision not to award him the 2025 peace prize to his ongoing push for the U.S. to acquire Greenland.

Trump in the letter questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over the mineral-rich island territory. The letter was shared with multiple European ambassadors.

“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump said, according to NewsNation, The Hill’s partner outlet.

Democrats denounced Trump’s comments. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called the letter the “ramblings of a man who has lost touch with reality” and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said the U.S. is becoming the “enemy of the free world because a pathetic man got his feelings hurt.”

Some Republicans who are more willing to criticize Trump also chimed in.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) called the letter “very embarrassing conduct.”

Former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), a sharp critic of Trump, said on the social platform X that the time has come to “move Gramps into a home” and let the “adults govern again.”

The physician to the late former Vice President Dick Cheney called for a congressional inquiry into Trump’s fitness for office in light of the letter.

Trump openly campaigned to receive the peace prize throughout last year, but the Nobel committee awarded it to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado instead.

Machado gave her prize to Trump when the two met at the White House last week, though the Nobel committee has said the award can’t be formally transferred.

Støre clarified in a statement to Bloomberg that the Norwegian government doesn’t award the Nobel Prizes.

Trump told reporters late Monday that he doesn’t care about the prize but rejected the idea that Norway doesn’t control the board.

“A very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize,” he said. “If anybody doesn’t think that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize, they’re just getting — they have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway.”

Trump also said he doesn’t expect pushback over Greenland from European leaders heading into the World Economic Forum this week in Switzerland.

“We have to have it. They have to have this done. They can’t protect it,” he said.

Trump was active on Truth Social overnight, posting multiple notes from foreign leaders, including NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron said he and Trump are in line on Syria and can “do great things” in Iran but questioned his intentions in Greenland, according to the Trump-posted message. He offered to meet with Trump in Davos and for the two to have dinner in Paris before Trump returns to the U.S.

Rutte, meanwhile, said he would use his media engagements to highlight Trump’s work in Syria, Gaza and Ukraine and is committed to “finding a way forward” on Greenland, according to the message posted overnight.

The president also posted a mock image showing Canada, Venezuela and Greenland as part of the U.S.

Trump has ramped up his rhetoric about the U.S. acquiring Greenland in recent weeks, refusing to rule out taking it by force. He threatened several European countries, including Denmark and Norway, with a 10 percent tariff beginning Feb. 1 if Greenland isn’t ceded to the U.S.

Those tariffs would rise to 25 percent if a deal still hasn’t happened by June 1.

International officials have taken Trump’s threats seriously and have rejected the idea of the U.S. taking Greenland.

The NATO secretary-general met with Danish and Greenlandic officials Monday to discuss “collective security,” while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with members of Congress to discuss various issues, including Trump’s rhetoric on the subject.

On Monday, amid rising tensions in the region, the Colorado-based North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) clarified that activities it is conducting at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland have been long-planned and coordinated with Denmark. NORAD noted that the government of Greenland was also aware of the activities.

SHUTDOWN WATCH: Lawmakers have two weeks left to avoid a partial government shutdown but face a contentious battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Congress has passed six of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government before funding runs out Jan. 30. The House has approved an additional two-bill package to fund the State and Treasury departments, which the Senate will take up when it returns next week.

But that leaves four bills for the House to clear, and the one for DHS is expected to be heated as critics push back over ICE’s tactics. Some Democrats have signaled they wouldn’t support a bill to fund the department without reforms requiring tougher oversight of ICE.

Lawmakers could pass another continuing resolution to fund the government until they can reach a deal and stave off the second shutdown in just a few months. But timing is tight, as the Senate is out of town this week and the House will be out next week, The Hill’s Sudiksha Kochi reports.

CASSIDY PLOWS ON: Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R) is vowing to continue with his reelection bid but is facing the toughest challenge to his political career after Trump weighed in to encourage a primary opponent to run against him.

Trump backed Rep. Julia Letlow (R-La.) for the seat in a post on Truth Social over the weekend, calling her a “total winner” and saying she would continue to deliver for Louisiana in the Senate as she has in the House. Letlow hasn’t announced a Senate candidacy but signaled after the endorsement that she may jump in the race.

“I’m honored to have President Trump’s endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,” she wrote in a post on X. “This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.”

The endorsement comes years after Cassidy was one of a handful of Republicans who broke with their party to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for his conduct leading up to and during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Since then, Cassidy has toed a line between criticizing and defending Trump and his administration.

Despite having cast a key vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services last year, Cassidy has become increasingly vocal criticizing Kennedy’s decisions in the role.

Cassidy already had picked up a few primary challengers, including state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. But Trump’s endorsement would be a critical boost for Letlow if she runs and would present an even larger obstacle for Cassidy, whose reelection chances already seemed in doubt.

Still, Cassidy expressed confidence in his ability to win.

“I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win,” he wrote on X.

Letlow has until Feb. 13 to file her candidacy if she wants to run.

DOJ WEIGHS GUN POLICY SHIFT: The DOJ is considering loosening gun regulations as it tries to boost support from Second Amendment advocates, The Washington Post reports.

Some of the changes include easing restrictions on the private sale of guns and loosening regulations around shipping firearms, people familiar with the changes told the Post. Other changes could affect the types of firearms that can be imported and making licensing fees refundable.

The exact changes and the timing of the announcement are still being finalized, according to the report.

The Post reported the back-and-forth emphasizes the DOJ’s challenges as it tries to satisfy members of Trump’s base who believe the administration hasn’t been strong enough in rolling back gun restrictions while also protecting the law enforcement abilities of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

TILLIS ‘UNTETHERED’: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) has increasingly become a leading voice within the GOP opposing Trump’s actions after having announced he won’t run for reelection this year.

Tillis announced last summer, amid the battle over the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that he wouldn’t run for another term. The announcement came as Trump repeatedly attacked Tillis’s opposition to the legislation, which the senator ultimately voted against.

But the past few weeks have given Tillis several opportunities to speak his mind, including on Trump’s rhetoric on Greenland, the DOJ investigation into Powell and how White House aides are advising Trump, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports.

Tillis told Bolton in an interview that his outspokenness isn’t a conscious choice but is a result of the administration’s actions.

“The sheer volume of things that are on the threat matrix,” Tillis said. “It sort of ramped up, but you’ve got to respond when the opportunities come up.”

But Tillis’s decision has given him an amount of freedom that few others can have.

“He’s untethered,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.

PUTIN INVITED: Russian President Vladimir Putin is among the world leaders invited to join the “Board of Peace” led by Trump to oversee the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Putin received an invitation to join the board, and officials are studying the details of the proposal. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia hopes to contact the U.S. to clarify “all the nuances,” according to the state-run news outlet RIA Novosti.

Other countries invited to join the board include the United Kingdom, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and India. France was invited, but French President Emmanuel Macron rejected Trump’s offer to join over the charter’s language.

The invitation for Putin comes nearly four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been trying to reach a peace agreement to propose to Putin, a deal has remained elusive.

The Trump administration signaled last week that it is launching the second phase of the Gaza peace deal after the near-completion of the first phase. The second phase includes Hamas giving up power in Gaza and agreeing to disarm, though the militant group has given mixed messages as to whether it will follow through.

The White House announced the founding members of the board Friday. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, billionaire investor Marc Rowan and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.

The board will become official after three member states approve the charter.

The Closer

And finally … Sen. Ashley Moody (R-Fla.) is set to provide Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) with cafecitos after the Indiana Hoosiers defeated the University of Miami Hurricanes in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday.

Ahead of the game, Moody posted a video saying she would wager her congressional team showing up to Banks’s office with cafecitos, a Cuban espresso beverage and South Florida staple, if her Hurricanes lost. Banks responded that he would provide Moody’s office with gummy bears if the Hoosiers lost.

The bet is far from the first time members of Congress engaged in friendly wagers over their sports teams. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey on the Senate floor last year, in a bet with the two Pennsylvania senators, after his Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl.

Trump attended the game along with a few members of the administration and his family.

Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.

The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.

Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.

“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”

Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.

The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.

Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.

Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.

“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.

In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.

In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.

The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.

Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”

The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”

“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.

Coughlin’s office did not comment on Murphy’s veto. Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0JS13095_1-2048x1329.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:02:32.255425

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency.","The United States Postal Inspection Service sometimes claims to be the oldest federal law-enforcement agency, arguing that its origin dates to 1775 when Benjamin Franklin, in his capacity as colonial postmaster general, first appointed a surveyor to audit the mail. Then in 1789, the country established both the U.S. Marshals as part of the original Judiciary Act and also a U.S. Customs Service to enforce the tariff laws that, at the time, provided the bulk of revenue.

Then in 1791, George Washington created the Park Watchmen to provide security for the under-construction capital of Washington, D.C.

The watchmen evolved into what is today the U.S. Park Police, who do not police America’s national parks (that would be the National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers) but rather urban parks that are under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. That means the National Mall and a bunch of other parks in D.C., but also some facilities in New York and San Francisco.

After the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln created the U.S. Secret Service to combat the rising problem of counterfeiting. After William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Congress decided that presidents needed protection, and they assigned that duty to the Secret Service.

Because the original mission of the Secret Service was to combat counterfeiting, it was housed in the Treasury Department. The Customs Service was also in the Treasury Department because its core mission was collecting taxes. And when the Justice Department decided in the early 20th century to beef up federal investigative capabilities, they chose not to expand existing federal law-enforcement agencies and instead spun up their own Bureau of Investigation, which evolved into today’s F.B.I.

We don’t need to go through the entire history of every law-enforcement agency. The point is that it is a tangled web. The different agencies have narrow scopes and are also gerrymandered in weird ways. Bank robbery is handled by the same agency as counterterrorism but a different agency from counterfeiting, which is the same agency that does presidential protection, which is a different agency from protecting federal buildings.

I don’t think this makes a ton of sense compared to the setup they have in, say, Germany where the Bundeskriminalamt does detective-type stuff and the Bundespolizei does “guys in uniforms”-type stuff and that’s it.

And I’ve always felt it would make a lot of sense to reorganize the entire federal law-enforcement apparatus into either a single U.S. Police Service or else a dual structure with a German-style split. I first wrote about this back in 2012, prompted by an unrelated federal-government-reorganization proposal.

Which is just to say that my longstanding view is that we should, in fact, abolish ICE.

A federal judge refused to block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring members of Congress to give a week’s notice before visiting immigration detention facilities.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., comes after Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said she and other Minnesota lawmakers were kicked out of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Minneapolis on Saturday, Jan. 10. They were asked to leave the facility after being informed about the Trump administration rule governing lawmaker visits.

Plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress asked Cobb to intervene, but the judge ruled Monday that they used the wrong ""procedural vehicle"" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new Department of Homeland Security action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.

""The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026, memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,"" Cobb wrote.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK JUDGE TO BLOCK NOEM'S REVIVED ICE VISIT RULE, SAY DHS DEFIED COURT ORDER

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement, according to The Associated Press.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after Reps. Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.

""We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

ILHAN OMAR KICKED OUT OF ICE FACILITY AFTER DHS REQUIRES WEEK'S ADVANCE NOTICE

House Democrats asked the judge earlier this month to block the new directive from Noem requiring advance notice for congressional oversight visits to ICE detention facilities, arguing in a court filing that the policy is politically motivated and violates federal spending law and a prior court stay.

Last year, Democrats had sued to block the seven-day notice requirement, arguing that the restrictions on ICE detention centers violate Section 527, a federal spending law provision that prohibits DHS from using appropriated funds to prevent congressional access to these facilities.

In December, Cobb temporarily stayed the DHS restrictions from taking force ""[u]nless and until Defendants show that no Section 527 funds are being used for these purposes.""

Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

""I was shaking,"" he said. ""They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.""

Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

""ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,"" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. ""They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.""

Encounter caught on video

Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.

Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.

Thao said agents drove him ""to the middle of nowhere"" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

DHS defends operation

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a ""targeted operation"" seeking two convicted sex offenders.

""The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,"" DHS said. ""The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.""

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

Thao's family said in a statement that it ""categorically disputes"" the DHS account and ""strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.""

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the ""two convicted sex offenders"" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.

Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

Family fled Laos after helping U.S.

The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's ""Secret War"" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, ""treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,"" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

Here are the themes that have shaped his first 365 days in office.

Slashing the federal workforce and agencies

Elon Musk was initially the face of the president's vow to cut waste, fraud and abuse in government. He and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took a chainsaw to the federal workforce through buyouts, reductions in force and shuttering offices. Those efforts resulted in the loss of more than 317,000 federal employees by November, although that was offset by 68,000 hires, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some jobs were reinstated after court challenges.

DOGE also claimed to have cut billions in federal spending, although CBS News' analysis found the savings were a fraction of what was claimed.

Agencies that didn't align with Mr. Trump's mission were targeted for cuts or elimination, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The president is also trying to fire nearly every employee of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing it has overstepped its mission. ""RIP CFPB,"" Musk posted on X in February. In December, a judge blocked the White House from defunding the agency.

The Trump administration is currently trying to dismantle the Education Department and transfer many of its programs to other departments, arguing that doing so will help return education decisions to states.

The attorney general has also gutted the Justice Department office that prosecuted public corruption cases.

The Trump administration announced it would eliminate 20,000 jobs from the Health and Human Services Department, about a quarter of its workforce. The cuts included 1,300 who were fired from the National Institutes of Health, as well as $2 billion in funding. Public health agencies have also slashed funding for vaccine development and mental health and addiction programs, although some cuts were reversed. The president also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization.

Nonetheless, overall federal spending has not decreased under Mr. Trump. According to federal data analyzed by the Peterson Foundation, outlays in December 2025 were $5 billion higher than in December 2024. The national debt continues to climb.

Settling scores with political foes, targeting rivals — and rewarding allies

The Trump-era Justice Department has targeted the president's political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.

Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.

The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow ""illegal orders."" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is a retired Navy captain.

The Federal Reserve has also fallen into the administration's crosshairs, after the president has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower interest rates. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, said the Federal Reserve was recently served subpoenas over his testimony about renovations at the central bank's headquarters, and said the move was part of a pressure campaign. The president has also sought to fire Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging her ouster, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week. Powell is expected to attend.

Over the summer, the Justice Department fired dozens of employees who worked on special counsel Jack Smith's dual investigations into Mr. Trump.

The White House also revoked the security clearances of many officials, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Biden's national security team, Bolton and other current and former national security figures.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power to wipe away criminal charges from allies and political figures of his choosing.. He pardoned nearly everybody charged or convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on his first day in office, and he granted clemency to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former GOP Rep. George Santos, former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojavich and former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Carrying out mass deportations and immigration enforcement

Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.

The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.

Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.

In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.

Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.

Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.

The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.

Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told ""60 Minutes"" in November the immigration raids ""haven't gone far enough.""

Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy

Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.

In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called ""Operation Midnight Hammer."" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.

Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.

In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.

Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's ""Donroe Doctrine,"" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.

But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts — telling several countries he no longer feels ""an obligation to think purely of Peace"" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.

The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.

Reshaping economic policy, focusing on trade and a love for tariffs

Mr. Trump calls himself ""the tariff king,"" and his love for tariffs — what he's called his ""favorite word"" — has reshaped international trade and international relations. Mr. Trump insists tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars for the country, although economists say U.S. consumers will ultimately pay higher prices. Studies show that U.S. importers generally pay the tariffs, not the foreign countries.

The stock market has continued to climb under Mr. Trump, although inflation, unemployment, hiring and layoff data are a mixed bag. Nearly three in four Americans say the president isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, and just over three in four Americans say their income isn't keeping up with inflation, according to the latest CBS/YouGov poll.

New U.S tariffs on Chinese goods set the stage for a trade war between the world's largest economies over everything from computer chips and rare earth metals to soybeans and TikTok, briefly sending both countries' tariffs on each other to over 100%. Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.

The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the ""big, beautiful bill,"" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.

Pushing the limits of presidential power

Despite Republican control of both chambers of Congress, Washington has passed few pieces of major legislation, with Mr. Trump relying heavily on executive actions to accomplish his objectives. He signed 228 executive orders — not including other types of executive actions — in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.

The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.

The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela — and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities — have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power. The Supreme Court blocked a Guard deployment to Chicago last month.

After an impasse in Congress led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the White House tested the limits of its power to unilaterally move money around. It kept sending out paychecks to members of the military and FBI agents, sought to lay off thousands of idled government workers and threatened to pause food stamp payments, drawing legal challenges.

Bending institutions to his will

Another theme of Mr. Trump's presidency continues to be pushing institutions to bend to his will. The president has terminated government contracts and revoked security clearances with major law firms that represented political opponents. The American Bar Association sued over the approach, calling it a ""law firm intimidation policy."" Some firms, under pressure, reached agreements with the administration to spend millions of dollars on pro bono work.

Mr. Trump has pressed both federal agencies and private employers to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and his administration has targeted what it views as ""woke"" initiatives in the military, business, education and other aspects of American society.

The Trump administration threatened to sue or otherwise pressured universities over their diversity and inclusion practices, pro-Palestinian campus protests or granting of in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, cutting off funding to some schools. Columbia University settled with the administration to avoid further investigations, and Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern University and UPenn all reached some type of agreement with the administration.

The president has also personally sued multiple news organizations over their coverage. Ahead of the inauguration, ABC News parent Disney agreed to pay $16 million to settle a defamation suit Mr. Trump brought. CBS News was also among those the president sued, and then Paramount, CBS News' parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a suit over a 2024 ""60 Minutes"" interview with Kamala Harris. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.

Dealmaking with companies and countries

Rather than imposing uniform policy through legislation, the president prides himself on making deals — the more deals the better — with individual companies and nations. The tariff negotiations with different rates for various countries are a prime example of that.

The president has sought to broker individual deals with pharmaceutical companies to bring down the prices of drugs for Americans. Among the medications that could be sold direct-to-consumer at lower costs are GLP-1 weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound.

The president has also unveiled deals to invest in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure with tech giants like Apple, Meta and OpenAI as well as trading partners like South Korea and Japan — though some of the corporate investments predated Mr. Trump.

The administration sought to broker a deal for TikTok's China-based parent company to sell its American operations to U.S. investors, avoiding a legally mandated nationwide ban on the social network. It's not yet clear if the deal will be approved by Chinese officials.

Mr. Trump let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, but with a ""golden share"" that allows the president to review some major corporate decisions.

Putting his stamp on the White House and Washington, D.C.

The president has moved to make his imprint on the White House itself and Washington, D.C., as a whole, forging ahead with plans to build a large ballroom on the grounds of the executive mansion and construct a new triumphal arch to match other major monuments.

Mr. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House in October with little warning, paving the way for his ballroom project. Architects working on the ballroom presented plans to a board that oversees construction on federal land earlier this month. The president has said the cost of the project, which has ballooned to roughly $400 million, will be covered by private donations. Some of those donations have come from firms and individuals with extensive business before the federal government.

Mr. Trump has renovated other parts of the White House, including by building a patio in the Rose Garden, installing massive new flagpoles on the grounds, redecorating the Oval Office with gold-colored furnishings and installing a ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" with photos of his predecessors — except former President Joe Biden, who is represented by an image of an autopen.

Mr. Trump has also touted plans for the construction of a triumphal arch across the Potomac River in Virginia. Mockups of the arch the president showcased in October bore the title ""Independence Arch.""

The president has also worked to affix his name to institutions around the capital. Mr. Trump's handpicked board of the Kennedy Center, Washington's premier arts venue, voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, a change that would require Congress to become official.

The administration also added Mr. Trump's name to the U.S. Institute of Peace in December. The State Department said the change was meant to ""reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/19/68da839b-011c-4506-8f0b-d4d737921bad/thumbnail/1200x630/0255f385cde8db0f2e3a9132d7381bc4/ap26016654582380.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:45.573183

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts.
Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding.
A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.
Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.","After the fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month, congressional Democrats have demanded that any new DHS funding come with conditions to crack down on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, even as many Democratic voters call for defunding the agency.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that ends in September, while reducing the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would mandate that DHS use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on diffusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, acknowledged that the legislation does not include some of the “broader reforms Democrats proposed,” such as preventing DHS from detaining and deporting U.S. citizens or blocking the department from using other agencies’ personnel for immigration enforcement.

“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” DeLauro said in a statement, adding that House Republicans have committed to holding a separate vote on DHS funding in the package. “I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency.”

Democrats note that federal cash would stop flowing to other agencies, including TSA and FEMA, if Congress allows DHS funding to lapse, while the Trump administration could continue funding ICE with the pot of $75 billion Republicans enacted for immigration enforcement through the party-line tax and spending package they enacted last summer. The other alternative — running DHS on a stopgap funding patch — would maintain the status quo for money and policy while giving the Trump administration more discretion in how to use DHS cash.

Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have wanted to limit the Trump administration’s ability to shift DHS funding between accounts. To accomplish that, the bill reduces the amount of money the department can transfer and suspends DHS power to shift money if the department doesn’t comply with transparency requirements.

The legislation rejects many of the funding cuts the Trump administration sought but does not substantially increase the budgets of major domestic agencies besides the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The bill includes $84.3 billion for HUD, a $7.2 billion boost that amounts to about 9 percent over the department’s current budget.

Under the package, the Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

A cut is in store for the Department of Transportation, which would be funded at $25.1 billion, a $111 million reduction.

Tacked on to the funding package is bipartisan health care legislation that includes a crackdown on drug intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers, renewals of several public health programs and $4.6 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for community health centers.

The deal does not address the Obamacare subsidies that lapsed on Jan. 1, nor does it address most of the proposals in a White House health framework released last week. Most parts of the deal had a shot at becoming law in December 2024 but were torpedoed by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

Congress has 10 days to clear the package for Trump’s signature before federal funding is set to lapse for the programs it covers, which account for more than 70 percent of the cash lawmakers approve each year to keep federal agencies running.

Because the Senate is in recess this week, the chamber will need to pass the legislation when senators return the last week of January if Congress is going to head off another funding lapse.

Within the stopgap funding patch enacted in November, lawmakers approved a full year of funding for the departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, as well as the operations of Congress and the FDA. Then last week the Senate cleared a package funding the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the EPA, water programs and federal science initiatives.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5a%2Fc2%2F1ab7a3074a46b263b0fbfd2c0be7%2Fu-s-congress-28265.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:01:49.418115

An Open Letter to Tech Companies

To the executives and board members of United States tech companies,

We have seen how the current administration is pressuring tech companies to limit efforts to fight the spread of mis- and disinformation, to forgo critical AI safeguards in favor of moving quickly, and to ignore the potential negative impacts your products, tools and services may have on the civil rights of your users. On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 240 organizations dedicated to protecting the rights of all people in the United States, and our Center for Civil Rights and Technology we implore you: do not capitulate to this pressure, and stay true to the values that your customers and users count on.

People are looking to you for leadership. We call on you to take this opportunity to be on the right side of history and to do what is best for not only your users, but also for the business interests that drive innovation and result in products and services that we all can trust.

Our recommendations:

As leaders shaping the future of technology, you are facing a defining moment: the rise of AI is an opportunity for the industry to flex its muscle and build new, innovative products that work for everyone. Proactively promoting principles around equity, fairness, and efficiency will help guarantee success:

Prioritize user experience: Engage in content moderation. Content moderation allows you to improve user experiences and retain advertisers. If your technology enables violence, threats, harassment, defamation, doxxing, and toxicity, your users can and will seek out alternatives to your product, and advertiser spending will follow. Likewise, if your technology empowers disinformation, deepfakes, voter suppression, and other anti-democratic and unpatriotic efforts, your users will cease to trust you and your product.

In order to be trustworthy, content moderation needs to be transparent: moderated content should always be coupled with a specific rationale. It needs to be responsive to reality, which requires an understanding of context beyond the current capabilities of AI. In order to be trustworthy, it must be done with human oversight. These humans should be employees, not contractors, and should be granted all of the respect and protections awarded to any other employee. Outsourcing content moderation to your users through crowdsourced models like Community Notes is not enough. As private companies, you have a legal right and a responsibility to your users to decide what is published on your platforms.

Prioritize user safety: Implement AI with care. Developing and deploying AI should be done thoughtfully, safely, transparently, and equitably. Adhering to these principles means monitoring AI for bias, making AI tools accessible to researchers, disclosing training data, and other reasonable efforts to minimize the black box effect. Our recently published Innovation Framework: A Civil Rights Approach to AI offers a step-by-step guide for implementing these values throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.

There are already countless instances of AI causing harm: biased AI systems in essential sectors – like banking, healthcare, housing, education, and justice – have resulted in people being denied mortgages, being pushed out of housing, being passed over for educational opportunities, and being wrongfully arrested. You have the power to say “no more.”

Prioritize user civil rights: Show us with actions, not words.

It may feel expedient to cooperate with the current administration to avoid retribution, but our communities have long memories, and we will remember what you do right now. Your employees will remember. Consumers will remember. Making the right decisions today will build lasting trust with your users.

Show us you’re with us with your actions, not only your words. One clear action you can take is this: Do not give this administration, or any future administration, technology or consumer data that can be weaponized against our communities. Nowhere is this clearer than with immigration enforcement, where the administration is relying on surveillance technology and consolidation of our most personal data to target and disappear our family members, friends, and neighbors. This is only possible with the proactive collaboration of companies like yours.

We also urge you to be true partners in supporting comprehensive data privacy measures that protect consumers from unwarranted intrusion and harms from companies and government alike. These actions are not only the right things to do; they are the best long-term business decisions.

Civil rights are not a constraint; they are a catalyst for sustainable growth, innovation, and widespread beneficial impact. As leaders of major tech companies, you have the power – and the opportunity – to make products that change the world for the better.

Our rationale:

The Trump administration’s push to centralize authority under the banner of “efficiency” raises serious questions about its long term intentions. With significant influence now exerted over regulatory bodies, including previously independent agencies, Congress, and the judiciary, it is not surprising that it has now turned its attention to the private sector – particularly the tech industry, which holds immense sway over public discourse, innovation, and our daily activities.

The administration’s attempts to exert authority over the tech industry is a significant development, especially since it is leveraging federal agencies like the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission to attempt to shape industry behavior in ways that harm people.

However, regulatory pressure appears to be only part of the strategy. Another dynamic is emerging, one in which companies are encouraged to seek approval or favor from the administration to avoid potential consequences and obtain federal contracts. This creates a climate of uncertainty, where alignment with political interests is becoming a prerequisite for stability. Some companies have capitulated to this pressure – not necessarily out of agreement, but out of caution. This dynamic has not been lost on the public.

It is vital that companies recognize this pattern and consider its implications in both the short and long terms. Your choices today about how your products adhere to civil rights will affect not only your users’ trust in technology, but the long-term viability of your businesses and the technology industry as a whole. You must consider the consequences, not just for your business and your autonomy, but for the broader health of the societal norms that allow your business to thrive.

For these reasons, civil rights must be a strategic priority:

Trust is the foundation of user engagement. Technology is facing heightened scrutiny as users want more transparency, fairness, and respect. The Leadership Conference’s Civil Rights Monitor and a recent Pew survey found that people are increasingly worried about AI. Safeguards around privacy, speech, and equity show users that your company is taking their concerns seriously, which builds loyalty, reduces churn, and strengthens brand reputation across diverse US communities.

Innovation depends on inclusion. Practices like minimizing risks, making equitable platforms, considering AI’s impact on marginalized communities, building representative workforces, and ensuring the technology works for all do not hinder innovation; they unlock it. Inclusion and diversity foster creative and safe environments, help to identify and mitigate harmful risks, and simply put, enable companies to build better products.

Proactive leadership drives business success. Building products that respect the rights of individuals, families, and society is not only the right thing – it is the smart thing. By embedding safeguards now, your companies will stay ahead of governments around the world that are shifting compliance standards to protect their citizens. You will avoid costly litigation and position yourselves and the United States as global leaders who set standards for others to follow. By making careful decisions on who you do business with now – and who you prioritize in divisive times – you will show your users where you stand and foster long-term success.

Let us ensure that your technologies and the way we use them reflect the values we all stand for. A better world is possible, and it is your responsibility to help humanity get there. We would welcome further discussion: please email techcenter@civilrights.org.

In this first year, the ACLU-D.C. along with our partners and brave clients, filed twelve lawsuits to defend our rights and liberties from the Trump administration. We’ve sued to stop unlawful immigration arrests because no one should live in fear of being targeted and abducted every time they walk their kids to school, head to work, or go see a doctor. We've filed lawsuits to stop other egregious abuses of power against immigrants’ rights as well. We sued to stop the administration from detaining people in inhumane conditions at the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison and deporting people without a fair process – and even with no process, as was the case for hundreds of people shipped off to a Salvadoran torture prison. We've also sued to protect the right to free speech, the right to vote, and the right to be free from discrimination.

This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses.","Labor unions, community leaders and faith groups are calling for an economic blackout in Minnesota on Friday to protest the surge of federal immigration agents in the state and mourn Renee Good.

Organizers are urging Minnesotans not to work, shop or go to school. The Trump administration has dispatched some 3,000 federal agents to the state, in what it claims amounts to its largest enforcement operation thus far, amid a broader crackdown on immigration.

More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot Good, 37, in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“There is an unprecedented and outrageous attack being waged against the people of Minnesota. I have never seen anything like it in my life,” said Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 in Minneapolis. “This is just an outrageous acceleration and escalation of violence toward working-class people.”

The CWA, which represents workers in the state at companies including AT&T, Activision and DirecTV, is one of several local unions organizing and supporting the planned economic blackout.

Others include Unite Here Local 17, Saint Paul Federation of Educators and Minneapolis Federation of Educators Local 59.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said: “Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families. Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.”

“I think what generated the idea for this action comes out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” said Knutson. “The government in the state of Minnesota has not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”

Knutson expressed hope that “the CEOs of all these corporations that are based in Minnesota take notice”.

Large US corporations headquartered in Minnesota include Target, Best Buy, United Healthcare and General Mills. None immediately returned requests for comment.

As the administration continues to send ICE agents to the Minnesota region, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey has complained in recent days that the city’s police are outmanned and outgunned.

“Can our cops arrest them? From a legal perspective, yes,” he said during an interview on the Bulwark podcast. “From a practical perspective, to state the reality, it does get kind of hard when they drastically outnumber us, and they have bigger guns than we do. We don’t want to create warfare in the street.”

A blackout by workers can send a message, Knutson said. “Those of us in the trade union movement understand the leverage and power that our labor has, and we are going to try and use that, because really there’s nothing else left,” he told the Guardian. “The idea is that we use our collective power to show those that rule this country and those that profit off of our labor that there’s a cost to attacking our communities this way.”

Organizers held a press conference last Tuesday, outside of the Hennepin county government center in Minneapolis, to announce that the event, which will also include a march and rally in the city’s downtown at 2pm local time.

“On Friday, January 23, we are calling for a day of truth and freedom,” said JaNaé Bates Imari, a minister and co-executive director of the multi-faith non-profit Isaiah. “It is a day where every single Minnesotan who loves this state and this notion of truth and freedom will refuse to work, to shop, and to go to school. What we have experienced and are experiencing in the state of Minnesota is not normal.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the planned economic blackout.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said: “The fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.”

The spokesperson reiterated the administration’s claim that Good “weaponized” her car before the shooting. This account of the incident has been disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota, as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

The DHS spokesperson added that “if these community and faith leaders wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable”, they would stand with federal law enforcement officers, whom the spokesperson claimed have faced a sharp increase in assaults and vehicle attacks. They did not provide evidence for this allegation.

“These men and women are moms and dads who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from the dangerous criminal illegal aliens in their communities,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0a5229a0c721430b47dc7f4031d75e65e30aabd/244_0_5200_4160/master/5200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945ba541da6da6c21d4b97d27780a047",N,,2026-01-20 12:00:01.274990

We mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing.

The strategy paid off. We’re not just challenging the Trump administration’s policies — at the national and local level we're successfully thwarting their plans.

On day one, when Trump issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, we filed a case within two hours.

When the government began arresting non-citizen students and scholars for their speech, we moved quickly to challenge their detention and secure their release.

As Congress made multiple attempts to block access to critical health care for trans people, we worked relentlessly on the Hill to block these provisions from becoming law.

Here at NorCal, our efforts to interrupt the incessant abuse of power by the administration have also paid off. Here are just two examples.

We filed a class action lawsuit challenging Trump policy that allowed ICE to arrest immigrants when they show up for mandatory court hearings. A federal district court in San Francisco has blocked these arrests while our lawsuit proceeds. With this ruling, people can pursue their asylum and immigration cases without fear of detention.

We filed a lawsuit against Meta (a.k.a. Facebook) to prevent turning over personal information of our client who documented ICE raids in Los Angeles.

A YEAR OF ATTACKS AND RESILIENCE

(New York, NY) – Today marks one year since the second inauguration of President Trump, a year defined by the dramatic escalation of abusive attacks on immigrants and the rule of law. Civil society organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) have been at the forefront of the pushback to protect immigrant communities in the United States, recognizing that attacks on immigrants are attacks on all of us and indeed on democracy itself.

This year, IRAP has challenged in court the unlawful suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), the transfer to and detention of immigrants at Guantánamo Bay, the total abandonment of Afghan allies, and the attempted termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syria and Burma. IRAP’s advocacy prevented thousands of TPS holders from being stripped of their ability to live and work legally in the United States, and secured the entry and resettlement of many already-approved refugees left in limbo by the suspension of USRAP.

The following is a statement from Sharif Aly, President of IRAP:

“A year ago today, President Trump signed an Executive Order indefinitely suspending the United States refugee program. While we have been in court ever since fighting to restore this critical lifeline for refugees fleeing violence and persecution, the government has only intensified its brutal assault on immigrants and those who support them.

The Trump administration is now subjecting refugees and immigrants living in the United States and their communities to the same kind of abuses many refugees once fled. Guided by xenophobia and racism, the Trump administration is targeting all immigrants, regardless of their legal status, deep community connections, or criminal record. This is not just an attack on immigrants; it is an attack on American communities and ideals that makes everyone less safe.

In just the last two weeks, we have been horrified to see armed ICE agents arrest and detain refugees with absolutely no claim that they have broken any law. These are dangerous times full of immense challenges, but we will not back down. IRAP will continue to fight every day for the right of every person to live in peace, safety, and dignity. Increasingly, our democracy depends on it.”

But the celebration for the achievements of the slain 60s civil rights leader was tempered by contemporary anxieties over racial and social equality and Trump administration’s crackdown in Minneapolis.

At a rally in Harlem, the Rev Al Sharpton referred to Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother of three who was killed by an immigration officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.

“If she cursed them out does that give them the right to shoot her?” he asked. “Now they’re talking about sending in the national guards, sending in more ICE agents. We are in a state that Dr King would have been fighting against this country going this far.”

Sharpton called for a broad sense of unity, saying that “if people are on our side, we can disagree without being disagreeable because we have folks that are adversarial to the interests of our community.

“We need to make a pledge on King Day that we gonna fight and make what should happen to preserve the dream of Dr King,” he added.

Zohran Mamdani, the newly installed New York City mayor, framed inequality as an economic issue at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s annual MLK Day celebration.

“While the city is wealthy beyond measure, it is also deeply unequal,” he said. “Some New Yorkers sleep in penthouses. Others sleep on the sidewalk below.

“We cannot only speak of Dr King’s legacy as if it is a legacy of rights that can be given to people,” he said. “It must also be a legacy of rights that those people can exercise themselves.”

In Washington, hundreds of people marched along Martin Luther King Jr Avenue to honor the civil rights leader.

“We got to continue to do this because not just of Dr King, but of what he stood for,” said Sam Ford, a retired broadcaster and member of the Martin Luther King Jr Day Parade Committee. “The struggle continues.”

Parade participant Harold Hunter echoed that sentiment. “It’s not just a white thing or Black thing. This is a people thing,” he said.

Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy, said elevated fears within racially diverse and immigrant communities meant that King Day observances were forced to take a more urgent tone. “We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” he said.

The Movement for Black Lives said it had planned events in Atlanta, Chicago, Oakland and other cities under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action”.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

At the National Civil Rights museum in Memphis, Tennessee, located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on 4 April 1968, was opened and offering free admission, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” the museum president, Russell Wigginton, told the Associated Press.

But some typical MLK Day events were cancelled, including a dinner at Indiana University in Indianapolis. In a social media post, the school’s Black Student Union said the event was officially cancelled because of “budget constraints”, but the group expressed concern that the cancellation was “connected to broader political pressures”.

A church in Westbrook, Maine, cancelled an MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances”, according to the parish website. A member of the congregation’s “social justice and peace committee” told the local news site NewsCenterMaine.com that the service was cancelled because agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were in the area.

This year’s Dr King celebration comes a year since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term.

Trump’s inauguration ushered in an administration opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, whether in government agencies, schools, universities or cultural institutions.

The justice department’s civil rights division, which under previous administrations has been charged with rooting out discrimination against minority groups, has shifted focus.

In comments to the New York Times this month, Trump said civil rights protections and affirmative action programs had hurt white people. “White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college,” he said.

Meanwhile, the administration has launched aggressive anti-immigration operations in several Democratic-led cities.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, told the Associated Press that the Trump administration’s priorities made clear it is actively trying to erase the movement for social justice.

Citing healthcare access, affordable housing, good-paying jobs and union representation, Wiley said, “things Dr King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture”.

Last month, the National Park Service said it would no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but would instead offer free admission on Flag Day – 14 June. That day is also Trump’s birthday.

At Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, where Dr King preached, there were calls on Monday to unite against injustice. Senator Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Ebenezer’s senior pastor, said the administration was “trying to weaponize despair and convince us that we are at war with one another”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b3c03f813d72e3416f8b7c33bd615ad0ca7fd8/0_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72ef2ffbcef3243e228749ea953b3a28",N,,2026-01-20 11:59:09.291631

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GREENLAND

In a late-night flurry of posts to his Truth Social account, President Donald Trump doubled down on his threats to take Greenland and said he would meet with European leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland to talk about the spiraling crisis. He is expected to arrive at the Forum on Wednesday. In one of his posts, he said he’d told NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, “Greenland is imperative for National and World security. There can be no going back.” Trump also posted at 12:58 a.m. an AI-generated image of himself in the Oval Office with European leaders and displaying a map where the United States, Canada, and Greenland are covered in the American flag. The Financial Times reports; Michel Rose and Stine Jacobsen report for Reuters.

During his social media spree, Trump also posted screenshots of private messages he’d received from world leaders over Greenland, including one from French President Emmanuel Macron that read, “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” CNN reports.

Trump also criticized the United Kingdom’s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a deal his administration previously supported, calling it an act of “great stupidity.” He said it was another reason the United States needed to acquire Greenland. Haley Ott for ABC News.

Over the weekend, Trump continued to push for American control of Greenland, risking damaging relations with Europe beyond the point of repair. Following Trump’s threats of economic coercion and military invasion of a NATO ally, “Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered,” Michael D. Shear reports for the New York Times.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that if the United States did not get a deal to buy Greenland, he would first impose a 10 percent tariff “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America,” from a certain group of European countries in February. He threatened to raise the rate to 25 percent in June. The threats upended months of trade negotiations between the United States and Europe. Adam Gabbatt, Robert Mackey, and Callum Jones for The Guardian.

In response, European capitals are considering hitting the United States with €93 billion in tariffs. “The retaliation measures are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, officials involved in the preparations said.” Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl report for the Financial Times.

In a text message to Norway’s prime minister Trump said that because he was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” and therefore was pursuing the “Complete and Total Control of Greenland” in the interests of the United States. The text was forwarded by the White House to multiple European ambassadors in Washington. Geir Moulson and Jill Lawless report for the Associated Press.

Following a weekend of escalating U.S. threats, Denmark deployed additional troops to Greenland on Monday. Richard Milne, Henry Foy, Barbara Moens, and George Parker report for the Financial Times.

Over the weekend, thousands of people marched in Copenhagen to protest Trump’s escalating threats. “The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted ‘Greenland is not for sale.’ Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump’s own ‘Make America great again’ fashion that read, ‘Make America go away.’” Barbara Sprunt for NPR.

A small European troop deployment to Greenland last week for an Arctic security exercise was viewed by some European officials as having been misread in Washington and as helping spur Trump’s retaliatory rhetoric and tariff threats, the Financial Times reported, citing officials and diplomats. The move was framed as a show of solidarity with Denmark and an “Arctic security” signal, but some diplomats said the messaging was too subtle or too easily misconstrued, while others doubted any reframing would have changed Trump’s response. Charles Clover, Richard Milne, and Amy Kazmin report.

TRUMP’S “BOARD OF PEACE”

When it brokered a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the Trump administration announced that a “Board of Peace” would oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, but it became clear over the weekend that Trump intends it to have a more ambitious mandate, “potentially rivaling the United Nations in what would be a major upheaval to the post-World War II international order,” reports Matthew Lee for the Associated Press.

The Times of Israel published the full text of the board’s charter, which it says “was attached to the invitations sent out to dozens of world leaders who were asked to join Trump on the panel tasked with overseeing the postwar management of Gaza.”

Trump has named himself chair of the international organization and given himself veto power. He has invited world leaders to join the board, telling them if they pay $1 billion, they can secure a permanent seat while those countries that do not pay will have a three-year membership. “On Friday, Trump announced seven members on a founding executive board, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair. Three others include World Bank President Ajay Banga, deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel and billionaire private equity chief Marc Rowan.” Lauren Kaori Gurley and Michael Birnbaum report for the Washington Post.

France rejected Trump’s offer to join the “Board of Peace” and Trump responded on Monday by threatening a 200 percent tariff on French wine. The statement from the office of French President Emmanuel Macron said the board’s charter “goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.” Clea Caulcutt for POLITICO.

Trump invited Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping to join the Board of Peace. “Later on Monday, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said President Alexander Lukashenko also received an invitation to join the board.” Ivana Kottasová and Anna Chernova for CNN; Bloomberg reports.

Israel has also been invited, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters, though it was not immediately clear whether Israel has accepted. Reuters reports.

Trump wants to hold a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace this week at Davos, which, along with the crisis over Greenland, is “transforming this week’s annual gathering of the global elite into an emergency diplomatic summit.” Cat Zakrzewski and Emily Davies report for the Washington Post.

MINNESOTA

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz mobilized the state’s National Guard on Saturday to support local law enforcement and emergency agencies as protests continue in Minneapolis over federal immigration enforcement, though troops have not been deployed to city streets and remain “staged and ready to respond.” Guard units have been pictured preparing equipment and are expected to assist with public safety and protection of peaceful assembly should conditions deteriorate. Holly Yan, Hanna Park, Sydney Bishop, Zoe Sottile report for CNN.

Up to 1,500 active-duty U.S. soldiers, primarily from two infantry battalions of the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division, have been placed on prepare-to-deploy orders for a possible mission to Minnesota, the Pentagon confirmed to reporters, though no decision has been made on whether the troops will actually be sent. Konstantin Toropin reports for the Associated Press.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over whether their public statements unlawfully impeded federal immigration enforcement, with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of the probe but not yet received by either office, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials said the investigation is proceeding under a rarely used Civil War–era obstruction statute, based on a theory that state and local leaders conspired to interfere with federal agents. NBC News reported the statute was highlighted in a recent memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that outlined legal tools prosecutors could use to pursue cases against individuals the administration has described as domestic extremists. Ryan J. Reilly and Peter Alexander report for NBC News.

On Friday, a federal judge in Minneapolis ordered ICE agents and other immigration officials to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city. The judge’s order included detailed accounts of how ICE agents are treating people in the city: “A protester detained, her bra removed and wedding ring cut off, and some of her clothes never returned. The ‘gratuitous deployment’ of pepper spray. A couple’s car surrounded by agents, who pointed semiautomatic weapons at them at close range.” Stephanie Saul reports for the New York Times.

On Monday, the Trump administration said it was appealing the judge’s preliminary injunction. Mitch Smith for the New York Times.

The Justice Department is also asking the court to allow its surge of ICE agents in Minnesota to continue after a lawsuit was filed last week by state and local officials claiming that the deployment was unconstitutional. Minnesota had pushed for the federal judge to immediately block the deployment of 3,000 federal agents but she made no rulings last week. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Multiple attorneys say people being detained during ICE operations in Minnesota are being denied the constitutional right to see an attorney by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “Four attorneys told ABC News they have been denied access to their clients at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where they are being held,” Matt Rivers, Janice McDonald, and Armando Garcia report.

The FBI determined shortly after Renée Good’s killing that “sufficient grounds existed to open a civil rights probe into the actions of Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good.” The Justice Department says no such investigation exists. Perry Stein reports for the Washington Post.

Protesters interrupted a church service in St. Paul, MN, on Sunday. Protesters chanted outside a church where one of its pastors appears to also be the acting director of ICE’s field office for enforcement and removal operations in St. Paul, Lauren McCarthy, Maia Coleman, and Emily Cochrane report for the New York Times.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate Sunday’s church protest, officials said. Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon cited violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Andy Rose and Elise Hammond report for CNN.

IRAN

Iran’s judiciary signaled Sunday that some people involved in the recent unrest could still face execution, despite Trump’s suggestion otherwise. Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said certain protest-linked conduct is being treated as “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” an offense that can carry the death penalty, and warned the cases would be “quickly prosecuted and punished.” He also said anyone who “collaborates with the enemy” during unrest would be punished under “clear” legal provisions. Billy Stockwell reports for CNN.

SYRIA

After several days of clashes, Syria’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) reached a ceasefire agreement on Sunday, with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi agreeing that the SDF would pull back from key Arab-majority areas including Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. The deal also contemplates the SDF’s integration into Syria’s armed forces and the handover to Damascus of oil and gas sites, border crossings, and detention facilities holding Islamic State suspects. The Associated Press reports.

Turkish officials said Monday that the agreement’s terms to cede territory to Damascus could clear Ankara’s main impediment to restarting Turkey’s stalled peace process with the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group. Reuters.

An unknown number of Islamic State (IS) detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison in Syria’s Hasaka region amid renewed fighting around the detention facilities in the northeast and a security breakdown that left control of the site contested, with Damascus and the SDF trading blame over how control was lost. The SDF said the prison—one of three the SDF controls in the Hasakah region—came under repeated assault by “Damascus factions” and that its forces repelled the attackers several times before temporarily losing control, adding that several of its fighters were killed and more than a dozen others wounded. Ghaith Alsayed for the Associated Press.

Syrian authorities said around 120 IS detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison, adding that government forces moved into the area after the breakout and had recaptured 81 during sweep operations, with searches ongoing. Kurdish outlet Rudaw, citing an SDF spokesperson, put the number far higher—around 1,500 escapees. Reuters.

The SDF said it made repeated appeals to a nearby U.S.-led coalition base for assistance during the assault on Shaddadi prison by “Damascus factions,” but that the coalition did not intervene. The SDF added that dozens of its fighters were killed or wounded while defending the facility. Reuters.

U.S. Central Command said a U.S. strike in northwest Syria on Friday killed an Al Qaeda affiliate leader, Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, whom it described as “an experienced terrorist leader.” CENTCOM said al-Jasim helped plan attacks and was directly linked to the ISIS gunman who carried out the Dec. 13 ambush near Palmyra that killed two U.S. service members and an American interpreter and wounded other U.S. and Syrian personnel. ​​Marlene Lenthang reports for NBC News.

TARIFFS AND OTHER U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

If the Supreme Court rejects the legal foundation for Trump’s tariff program, the administration would move “the next day” to reimpose similar levies under other authorities, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. In a Jan. 15 interview, Greer said the White House has “a lot of different options.” Ana Swanson for the New York Times.

U.S. consumers and importers paid about 96 per cent of the cost of last year’s U.S. tariff increases, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4 per cent through lower prices, new research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy found—cutting against Trump’s repeated claim that foreigners are footing the bill. Using roughly $4 trillion in shipment data from between Jan. 2024 and Nov. 2025, the researchers also found that after surprise tariff hikes on Brazil and India in August 2025, exporters largely did not cut unit prices to offset the tariffs, instead shipping less to the United States, pointing to higher U.S. prices over time and reduced export volumes rather than “foreign-paid” tariffs. Tom Fairless reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The National Guard will remain deployed in Washington, D.C., through 2026. About 2,400 troops are currently stationed in the city and they are mostly from Republican-controlled states. Steven Beynon reports for ABC News.

The three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said Monday that recent U.S. actions on Venezuela, Ukraine, and Greenland raise “basic questions about the use of military force” and have put America’s moral role “under examination.” Michelle Boorstein and Anthony Faiola report for the Washington Post.

Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley emailed immigration judges instructing them that they are not bound by federal court rulings requiring bond-hearing eligibility for many detainees, according to documents the ACLU of Massachusetts filed with a Boston federal court Friday. The ACLU said the directive shows a deliberate effort to disregard those rulings, with a hearing scheduled for today. Reuters reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A D.C. federal judge declined to pause the administration’s new seven-day notice requirement for congressional visits to ICE detention facilities, explaining in a Monday order that the policy constitutes a new agency action not covered by her prior ruling and that the lawmakers raised the challenge through the wrong procedural mechanism. Michael Kunzelman reports for the Associated Press.

According to an international coalition of lawyers’ groups, it is now dangerous to be a lawyer in the United States. “The Day of the Endangered Lawyer, an annual event to raise awareness of risks to members of the profession, has in recent years picked Belarus, Iran and Afghanistan as its subject. For 2026, it has chosen the US.” Kaye Wiggins for the Financial Times.

As the United States reaches the one-year mark in its increasingly dysfunctional and abuse-laden political marriage with Donald J. Trump, though, the President has made it clear that he will take almost any sort of gift—even, and maybe especially, someone else’s Nobel Peace Prize medal. The Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado offered hers up to him last week, in a large gold-colored frame, ready for hanging. Although something of a pathetic gesture, given that the Trump Administration seems to have cut a deal with the remnants of Nicolás Maduro’s government (while Maduro himself is in a Brooklyn jail), it did earn her an upgrade. After Maduro’s arrest, Trump said that Machado was “a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect”; post-medal bestowal, she was “a wonderful woman” and her gift “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” Those words might even get her somewhere, if only she had control over a lot of oil reserves. But clocks can make good gifts, too. After a group of Swiss businessmen arrived at the White House in November, bearing a desk clock in the form of an oversized Rolex, the country got a break on tariffs.

Those who aren’t trying to please the President might still keep clocks in mind this January 20th, because the country is in a countdown. Three hundred and sixty-five days of Trump means a thousand and ninety-six to go, including a leap year. (That’s not counting all the Trump first-term days, of course; this is a tragedy of remarriage.) We have aged so much in Trump years that the Biden Administration can feel much longer ago than it was. The brief era of Elon Musk running around the White House may now seem like a fever dream—he and Trump seem to have an off-and-on thing—but hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs in his wake or otherwise had their lives changed irrevocably, including recipients of U.S. aid around the world. On January 1st, millions of Americans lost their health-care subsidies. Immigrants, even legal ones, live with a new level of fear. So, too, do many academics, scientists, and even lawyers. There’s an undercurrent of political violence that wasn’t present in the same way a year ago.

Crucially, there are now only two hundred and eighty-seven days until the midterm elections, which have at least the potential to significantly change the balance of power in Washington. Republicans control both houses of Congress, but the margins are slim: 218–213 in the House of Representatives, giving the G.O.P. a hold so tenuous that the Majority Whip, Tom Emmer, has reportedly indicated that he won’t excuse absences for matters other than “life or death”; the margin in the Senate is 53–47. The entire House is up for reëlection, and it is more than plausible that the Democrats will prevail there; taking the Senate, where thirty-five seats will be contested, will be much tougher, though not impossible. Even before November, there will be special elections for four vacant House seats, including the one held, until recently, by the Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. Her spinning away from the Trump majority—spurred by, of all things, the Jeffery Epstein case—may be an indication that this Administration is decaying more quickly than the calendar alone would indicate.

For at least some other Republicans, at this one-year juncture, the breaking point may be Trump’s uncannily serious talk of buying or seizing Greenland, a territory of our NATO ally Denmark. Some MAGA types love the idea, but, as Politico reported, the Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said last week that there was “certainly not an appetite for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.” That statement came before Trump’s announcement, this past Saturday, that he will be imposing tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries “until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, has raised the possibility of invoking the War Powers Act, a tool that Congress has for reining in the President. Not incidentally, Tillis has said that he will not seek reëlection this year. His seat is open, and one of the top targets for Democrats, who have a strong candidate in former Governor Roy Cooper.

North Carolina matters a great deal, because fewer than a dozen Senate seats are in contention at all, and only a handful are close calls; the others are in states that are solidly red or blue. One is in Minnesota, where Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, has decided not to run again. That race, in that state, is a reminder that, though calendars are crucial, any calculation can be upset in the seconds it takes, for example, for an ICE agent to open fire into an S.U.V. The situation in Minneapolis is precarious, with Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act and put troops on the streets. “If I needed it, I’d use it,” he told reporters on Friday, on his way to Mar-a-Lago. “It’s very powerful.” His Justice Department is reportedly investigating Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz for impeding immigration enforcement, both of whom have described the move as an attempt to intimidate them. (This past year has certainly been very different for Walz, who was Kamala Harris’s running mate, than it would have been.)

Depending on what Trump does next, Minneapolis may become the scene not only of passing chaos but of a breakdown in the relationship between Americans and their government. Precisely because of those stakes, it is worrisome that two of the leading Democratic contenders for Smith’s seat—Representative Angie Craig, who has a reputation as a centrist, and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, who is more aligned with the Party’s progressive wing—have been quarrelling, in personal terms, about whose response to the ICE actions and to a social-service-fraud scandal involving the Somali community is better. The intraparty divisions that the two women represent are profound and will play out in primary races at every level. One question is which kind of Democrat has the best chance in November. The answer may differ state to state; one of the more endangered Democratic seats is that of Senator Jon Ossoff, in Georgia.

A judicial clock is running down alongside the electoral one. Trump has issued two hundred and twenty-eight executive orders—eight more than in his entire first term and sixty-six more than Joe Biden did in his four years—along with other dubious actions and pronouncements. These orders have been met by a stream of lawsuits—hundreds of them, by the A.P.’s count—which should keep coming. (Paper is a traditional first-anniversary gift, after all.) The A.P. even brought its own case, Associated Press v. Budowich, after it was barred from the White House press room for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. It’s hard, with Trump, to separate the absurd from the catastrophic. Between now and July, the Supreme Court will hear arguments or issue rulings on a number of the most significant cases occasioned by Trump’s actions, including his attempt to do away with birthright citizenship. On Wednesday, the day after Trump’s Inaugural anniversary, the Court will hear arguments in a case over his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors; Jerome Powell, the chair of the Fed, recently released a video statement saying that he was being criminally investigated in retaliation for not setting interest rates where the President wanted them.

When Trump was inaugurated, there were fears that he might get three or even four more chances to name a Justice to the Supreme Court. It’s a small blessing that, with a year down, he hasn’t had any yet. Still, one Justice, Clarence Thomas, may be counting days for his own reasons. Thomas is currently the fifth-longest-serving Justice ever, having taken his seat on October 23, 1991. By mid-May, he will have moved up three spots, to be the second-longest-serving. Will that be enough for him to decide to retire while Trump can still appoint his successor? (It would take until April, 2028, for him to pass William O. Douglas for the No. 1 spot. Trump, depending on the makeup of the Senate, may have fewer options to get a nominee confirmed by then.) And Thomas, who is seventy-seven years old, is one of four septuagenarians on the Court. The others are Samuel Alito, seventy-five; Sonia Sotomayor, seventy-one; and John Roberts, seventy.

There are other countdowns. On February 3rd, about three hundred and fifty thousand Haitians are due to lose their Temporary Protected Status, though some may be able to find a different route to stay in the U.S. legally. The Administration has also cancelled, or is trying to cancel, T.P.S. for hundreds of thousands of people from other countries, including Venezuela, Somalia, Nepal, and Nicaragua. There is ongoing litigation, but people with T.P.S., which is meant for migrants from countries in crisis, and a related immigration status, called humanitarian parole, are especially vulnerable, because both Biden and his predecessors relied on the discretion of the executive branch to extend them that relief in the first place. Trump is, in effect, attempting to make use of the same discretion, in reverse, but without regard to the fact that many of these migrants are well settled in their communities, with jobs, neighbors, and children who are citizens, or to the conditions in their home countries. One question is whether he’s done so in an illegitimately arbitrary way, but a majority of the Justices may back him up; they have already stayed certain lower-court attempts to put some of these cancellations on hold. Cruelty, sadly, is not necessarily unconstitutional, at least not in the eyes of the Court.

Indeed, if we’ve learned anything about our constitutional structure in the past year, it’s that the Presidency has, over time, been given too much power. The abdication of the other branches, particularly Congress, to the executive, on matters ranging from military action and surveillance to the economy and immigration, did not begin with Trump. The corollary is that, while Trump can break many things—he can seize a foreign leader, he can scuttle alliances, he can derail lives, and he can make Americans even angrier at one another—whoever comes next will have a lot of power to undo his damage and rebuild. Even he doesn’t have enough control over his party or the courts to keep the next elections from happening, even if having a fair election in every district will require vigilance. (It always does, to some degree.) By that same measure, a President J. D. Vance or Marco Rubio could make the hole we are in much deeper. The Democrats have only so much time to figure out who their own standard-bearer will be. That said, the Party should not move so quickly as to foreclose a truly contested primary, which would have been valuable in 2024.

But that election will be in 2028, and here we are, still in 2026, still with Trump—and still with time to mobilize for the midterms. What Congress has given to Presidents it can also begin to take away. It will take years and a galvanized counter-majority to truly restore the balance, but even just winning one of the chambers back would provide a significant brake on the MAGA vision of executive power. And people at every level, from parents without legal status to the governors of states, can keep bringing the Administration into court. 2026 will be the year for pushing back against Trump with a ballot in one hand and a lawsuit in the other. There is no going back to how things were before January 20, 2025, but there may yet be a better way forward. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/696e90abdc919c8e5d3aa225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Sorkin_SecondFirstYear_AP26012069870543.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 11:02:52.964286

WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb said she wasn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs’ favor.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Immigration_Enforcement_Minnesota_28866_17980f.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-20 11:59:05.447326

“Today we commemorate of course the legacy of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., a courageous defender of human dignity and civil rights,” Cruikshank said.
""We are calling on institutions and leaders to refuse policies that dehumanize and divide us.” The meeting came as protests continued in Minnesota after an immigration enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen.

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.","A priest, a rabbi, and ministers from a wide range of faith groups walked into Madison Place in Grand Rapids Monday, and called for more humane treatment of immigrants.

“We will not be judged by what we claim that we believe,” said the Rev. Karen Fitz La Barge with the group West Michigan Clergy Action. “We will be judged by what we are willing to risk, by whom we are willing to stand beside.”

The faith leaders gathered on a snowy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, sharing stories of local immigrant families who they say have been detained by federal immigration officials in recent months.

The Rev. Reggie Smith, with the Christian Reformed Church in North America, said his neighbors on the southwest side of Grand Rapids are too afraid to shop at the local grocery store because of reports of arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Something has changed about us,” Smith said. “And maybe on Martin Luther King’s Day — he taught us that we should recognize our own humanity — maybe our immigrant neighbors aren’t the one that need to be saved. Maybe it’s us.”

Father Mike Cruickshank, a catholic priest with Cathedral of Saint Andrew, told the story of a man who he said was arrested at a routine office visit as part of his asylum case. The arrest, Cruickshank said, came as the man’s wife was seven months pregnant. The family has been separated since, according to Cruickshank.

He cited a recent “Special Message” from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on immigration, which noted the government’s role in regulating immigration, but spoke out against conditions in detention centers.

“Today we commemorate of course the legacy of Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., a courageous defender of human dignity and civil rights,” Cruikshank said. “And his witness reminds us that silence in the face of injustice is not an option for people of faith.”

Rabbi Javier Cattapan of Temple Emanuel in Grand Rapids, himself an immigrant and naturalized citizen, called for elected officials to do more.

“We are calling for transparency, accountability, and due process,"" Cattapan said. ""We are calling on institutions and leaders to refuse policies that dehumanize and divide us.”

The meeting came as protests continued in Minnesota after an immigration enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen. Grand Rapidians organized protests in the wake of the killing. And since then, rumors of immigration enforcement actions have swirled on social media in West Michigan.

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand attended Monday’s meeting, and he said he’s been trying to confirm some of the online reports himself.

“It’s not as if I’m getting a daily report from ICE on what they’re doing anywhere,” LaGrand said. “Last week, I spent a chunk of my morning simply driving around a part of our town where I’d heard that ICE was out doing door-to-door encounters. And I didn’t see anything.” The mayor said he’s not sure which online reports are true, and which are not.

“We’re sort of operating in the dark,” LaGrand said. “We’re at a point where I think everyone has to be vigilant, but we don’t want to overreact.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/714cf24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fd2%2F4cac221a4af0b554a1db1850f2ee%2Fimg-8719.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 08:00:32.803909

In Minnesota, residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain on edge, as clashes between protesters and federal immigration officers continue into a third week.

It comes as the Department of Justice announced its plan to pursue charges against protesters in Minneapolis, while confirming it does not plan to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro has the latest.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Another weekend and another intense wave of immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities, as more than 2,000 federal officers continue a crackdown characterized by aggressive force and unyielding protests.

It comes as weary residents brace for the potential deployment of active duty troops after President Trump threatened late last week to invoke the Insurrection Act, something Mayor Jacob Frey said Sunday would be -- quote -- ""shocking.

Jacob Frey:

You got to understand how wild this is right now. In Minneapolis, crime is dramatically down. We don't need more federal agents to keep people safe. We are safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Frey himself, along with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, are now reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly impeding federal law enforcement officers.

Yesterday, the Justice Department announced a separate investigation into protesters who disrupted a church service where they believed a local pastor was also an ICE official from the St. Paul office. That same day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche again confirmed there would be no investigation into the altercation that has most roiled the city, the fatal shooting of Renee Good, killed by an ICE agent in her car on January 7.

Todd Blanche, U.S. Deputy Attorney General:

We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. And that is not the case here, it wasn't the case when it happened and it's not the case today.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

The Department of Homeland Security said its agents are facing -- quote -- ""rampant violence"" and have made 3,000 arrests in the last six weeks. The ""News Hour"" could not independently verify that number.

It all comes after a federal judge in Minnesota ruled agents could not arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring ICE operations.

Kristi Noem, DHS secretary, said on CBS' Face the Nation yesterday that the judge's ruling -- quote -- ""didn't change anything.""

Kristi Noem, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary:

That federal order was a little ridiculous, because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing.

We -- we are -- have not engaged in...

Margaret Brennan, Host, ""Face the Nation"": Well, we just saw video of chemical agents being used.

Kristi Noem:

... any -- we only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Nonetheless, the Justice Department said today it would appeal the court ruling. This weekend, a planned anti-Islam pro-ICE rally, which was set to feature a Koran burning, drew few supporters.

But its organizer, far right activist Jake Lang, had to be escorted from the scene, ironically by counterprotesters themselves, after he was swarmed and pelted with water balloons. Lang could be seen bleeding from his head and later claimed he had been stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report had been filed.

Even for Minnesota, weather here in recent days has been unusually cold, about the only indication that temperatures are turning down here.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

3rd detainee dies at Camp East Montana

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

Report: Death at Camp East Montana could be ruled a homicide

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

Camp East Montana detainee dies from ‘suspected natural causes’

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

Texas Immigration Law Council.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

Human rights groups detail abuse at Fort Bliss migrant camp, call for its closure

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”

“Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement,” the new filing by the Trump administration said, describing the lawsuit brought by state and local officials as an “absurdity” that “would render the supremacy of federal law an afterthought to local preferences.”

Officials in Minnesota filed the lawsuit last week in an effort to curb the administration’s ongoing crackdown in their state, equating the surge of federal immigration agents to the state to “a federal invasion” and citing violations of the 10th Amendment. The suit was filed shortly after Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security has terrorized residents in “organized bombardment.”

Reiner, a CNN medical analyst, cited Trump’s recent letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, in which he appeared to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his having not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

“This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness,” Reiner wrote on the social platform X.

Trump’s message, which was shared with multiple European ambassadors, questioned why Denmark has a “right of ownership” over Greenland, a semiautonomous Arctic territory rich in minerals and seen as key to security in the region.

“They just took me out there with no clothes on and then just covered with my grandson’s blanket. Yeah, they just took me out there, and I was like, ‘Man, this is, this is embarrassing,” Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, said from the home Monday while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Videos of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket spread on social media, further fueling public outrage from some about the tactics being used in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the Minneapolis area, where 3,000 agents have been deployed.

Louansee Moua, Thao’s sister-in-law, said it was frigid and snowing when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers took him from the house. “It was so heartbreaking seeing him in that image,” Moua said. “You can’t get it out of your head. He has no clothes, and it’s, like, 12 degrees and it’s snowing.”

Moua said her brother-in-law went willingly with the officers without knowing why he was being detained. “He went willingly because he was afraid,” she said, adding that Thao’s demeanor is very generous and laid-back.

The Department of Homeland Security said that officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

“He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

In a statement Monday, Thao's family said the agency's account did not reflect their firsthand knowledge of the events or the living situation at the residence.

""The only individuals residing at the home are Mr. Thao, his adult son, his daughter-in-law, and his young grandson. The family does not know the individuals referenced in DHS’s statement,"" the family said.

Thao's family said officials did not present a warrant or request ID before he was detained.

""Mr. Thao did not resist and went with agents voluntarily, despite the absence of an explanation for his detention at the time,"" the family said in its statement.

A U.S. district Judge in Minnesota issued an injunction Friday blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would “chill” an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest. The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said that his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was 4 and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During Sunday’s ordeal, he said, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his 4-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After they took his fingerprints and a photograph of him in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

Chris Thao, his son, said: “We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have to have a safe place to live. If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260120-Chongly-Scott-Thao-rs-dbeefb.jpg",N,,2026-01-20 04:58:52.162537

Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.
Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops.
Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA.
“Accordingly, “IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.","Where petitioners have requested habeas corpus relief, their petition should be granted because the respondents have violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by denying the petitioners bond hearings.

“Petitioners, although having no lawful immigration status, have resided in the United States for at least a decade, and for many of them, several decades. …

“Between August 9 and November 4, 2025, Petitioners were taken into immigration custody following routine traffic stops or targeted investigations. They have been detained ever since without a bond hearing pending removal proceedings. Petitioners are held at different facilities throughout Michigan. Their removal proceedings are being held before the Detroit Immigration Court.

“On November 10, 2025, Petitioners filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2241, claiming that their detention without a bond hearing violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (‘INA’) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. …

“The key issue here is which provision of the INA applies to the detention of individuals like Petitioners—i.e., non-U.S. citizens facing removal proceedings who were not taken into custody at the border or a port of entry but after living in the United States for some period of time. The choice is between the discretionary detention framework of §1226(a), as Petitioners argue, or the mandatory detention requirement in §1225(b)(2), as Respondents argue. …

“Numerous courts throughout the country have been presented with the issue since July of this year, when ICE issued its mandatory-detention directive, thereby departing from the government’s longstanding interpretation of the INA as providing for the discretionary detention of individuals like Petitioners. An overwhelming majority of those courts have concluded that §1226(a) is the appropriate statutory framework. … This Court is persuaded by these decisions. …

“According to the plain language of the statute, §1225(b)(2)(A) applies only when an alien is ‘seeking admission’ and the ‘examining immigration officer’ concludes that the alien ‘is not clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted.’ Petitioners were not in the process of seeking admission when they encountered federal officials who deemed them not entitled to be admitted. They were going about their everyday lives when they were stopped, arrested, and placed in ICE custody. The plain language of §1226, including the title of this section and its subsections, apply to their situation. …

“In short, §1226 provides the general rule for detention of noncitizens, while §1225 specifically covers noncitizens detained at a border or port of entry. Petitioners were not apprehended upon their arrival to the United States at a border or port of entry. Instead, they have lived in the United States for many, many years and were apprehended during traffic or controlled stops. Section 1226, therefore, governs their detention and each of them are entitled to a bond hearing under the statute’s discretionary framework. …

“The Court concludes that, with the exception of EOIR, the named individuals and agencies are proper Respondents in this case. The Court further concludes that Petitioners need not exhaust their administrative remedies to proceed with their request for habeas relief under §2241. Finally, the Court holds that by denying Petitioners bond hearings, Respondents have violated the INA. The Court therefore finds it unnecessary to address Petitioners’ due process claim at this time.

“Accordingly,

“IT IS ORDERED that Petitioners’ habeas corpus petition is GRANTED.

“IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each Petitioner shall be afforded a bond hearing under §1226(a) before an immigration judge on or before 5:00 p.m. on December 10, 2025, or be released.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2026-01-20 05:57:38.398384

DOJ says Minnesota wants a ‘state veto’

What they're saying:

Federal attorneys argue that Minnesota is ""effectively seeking a state veto over the enforcement of federal law"" which the DOJ refers to as an ""absurdity.""

In its complaint, the state argued that the federal operation has created uncertainty and danger. Federal officials say Minnesota's ""sanctuary"" policies have ""exacerbated dangers"" posed by undocumented immigrants in the Twin Cities.

The DOJ also claims it's their own federal offices who are facing danger as assaults against federal officers have increased in recent months.

""Federal officers and agents face violent attacks at federal buildings, at immigration processing facilities, and while in the field conducting enforcement operations,"" the DOJ's response states. ""Foreign criminal organizations have offered thousands of dollars as bounties for the murder of federal immigration enforcement officers and agents. Because federal immigration officers and agents have faced doxing, including revelation of their home addresses, these threats extend to their families.""

The DOJ adds: ""In and around Minneapolis, ICE officers operating out of the St. Paul Office have been confronted with increased threats, violence, aggression, attacks, vehicle block-ins, and obstruction of immigration enforcement operations. The increase in these types of incidents has obstructed enforcement operations, interfered with officers’ official duties, and posed significant safety risks to not only ICE officers but also the public. These incidents have further increased since Operation Metro Surge launched in early December 2025.""

Dig deeper:

Federal attorneys also say the state's legal basis is flawed, claiming Minnesota's view of the Tenth Amendment is not how the law has been applied.

""The Tenth Amendment does not give a state or a city a veto power over those federal activities,"" the DOJ writes, citing a 2023 case. ""Rather, ‘in our system of dual federal and state sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.’""

The DOJ also argues its operation hasn't infringed on Minnesota's core policing powers nor has it violated Minnesota's sovereignty.

Minnesota brings lawsuit against feds over ICE surge

The backstory:

Last week, the State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul announced a lawsuit against federal authorities aiming to end the ICE surge in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. At a court hearing last Wednesday, a judge denied the state's request to force an immediate end to the ICE operation but kept the lawsuit on the fast track.

What's next:

The judge ordered the DOJ to file its response to the temporary restraining order by Monday.

The state now has until Thursday to respond to these arguments.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1200/630/ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:01.023999

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all.
However, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the accusations of inhumane conditions at Camp East Montana, saying they were “fearmongering clickbait.”","EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — A coalition of Texas and New Mexico immigrant rights, legal advocacy, and faith-based organizations is demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana following the third in-custody death at the detention center, it was announced in a news release.

The coalition said it condemns the death of Victor Manuel Diaz — a 36-year-old undocumented migrant from Nicaragua — as it’s the third death connected to this detention center, “underscoring a deadly pattern of abuse, neglect, and impunity that has defined the facility since its opening.”

Diaz died on Wednesday, Jan. 14, at Camp East Montana. He was pronounced deceased at 4:09 p.m., and his death was a presumed suicide, according to ICE. However, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.

The announcement of Diaz’s death comes just days after The Washington Post reported last week that 55-year-old Geraldo Lunas Campos’ death — the second detainee who died at the detention center — could be ruled as a homicide.

The coalition said that Lunas Campos “died from asphyxiation after guards choked him to death, and that federal authorities subsequently are threatening to deport key witnesses to the incident, raising grave concerns about accountability and efforts to suppress evidence of abuse at the facility.”

Additionally, Francisco Gaspar Cristobal Andres was the first detainee held at the Fort Bliss immigration facility to die. The 48-year-old man from Guatemala was taken to the hospital on Nov. 16 and died on Dec. 3 of “suspected natural causes.”

The coalition is now calling on the Trump Administration to “immediately reverse course and demand that Congress act to end this cycle of abuse and impunity.”

“Camp East Montana must be closed without delay, and a full, independent investigation into all detention facilities must begin now. Failure to act will continue to cost lives,” read the news release.

Statements from representatives of these organizations read as follows:

Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center

“Camp East Montana was built to make people disappear, strip them of their rights, and warehouse human beings out of public view here in our border community. This is the third death at this facility, and each one shows the deadly cost of using detention as the default response to migration,” Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, said. “No one should die for seeking safety, dignity, or a future for their family. Camp East Montana is killing people, and it must be shut down immediately.”

Estrella del Paso

“We are outraged and heartbroken by the death of a third migrant at Camp East Montana. The three individuals who have died since August while detained were preventable deaths and reflect the dangerous and inhumane conditions migrants are being forced to endure. No one seeking safety, dignity, and opportunity should lose their life in government custody. Estrella del Paso calls for immediate accountability and transparency to ensure human rights violations and deaths at Camp East Montana cease immediately. Fort Bliss has a long and painful history of being used to carry out human rights atrocities – Japanese internment camps, the detention of unaccompanied children, and now immigrants. The Administration cannot continue to act with impunity and reckless disregard while people suffer and die behind locked gates. Every day that Camp East Montana remains open, thousands of parents, children, and individuals fleeing violence and poverty are placed at risk of losing their lives for seeking survival. We grieve the lives lost and stand in solidarity with their loved ones. Migrants are not disposable. They are human beings deserving of care, dignity, and protection. Camp East Montana should be shut down immediately. Anything less is a moral failure,” Melissa M. Lopez, executive director of Estrella del Paso, said

Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR)

“From the moment this makeshift mass detention camp opened, we warned that it would lead to grave abuse, neglect, and the systematic violation of fundamental human and civil rights. In recent weeks, our deepest fears have been realized through the unnecessary and preventable loss of human life,” Fernando García, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR), said. “The deaths of Víctor Manuel Díaz, Geraldo Díaz Campos, and Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés are not isolated incidents, they are the predictable outcome of a system that treats human beings as disposable in the name of an unaccountable and irrational enforcement strategy. This is a moral failure. We call on Congress to act with conscience, decency and humanity by fully investigating the conditions people are being forced to endure and by immediately shutting down Camp East Montana.”

Texas Civil Rights Project

“Three lives have now been lost at Camp East Montana in Fort Bliss due to irresponsible detention practices this year. They were sons, brothers, and fathers whose loved ones are never going to see them again. The federal government must be held accountable for these actions. As we see increased ICE and CBP enforcement continue to result in tragedy, the Texas Civil Rights Project calls on Congress to investigate the deaths of these men and immediately shut down Camp East Montana for the safety of all,” Rochelle M. Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said.

ACLU of Texas

“We grieve the three lives already lost at this ICE detention center located on a U.S. military base,” said Savannah Kumar, ACLU of Texas staff attorney. “For months, we have interviewed people detained at Camp East Montana, who bravely spoke on the dangers they have experienced: beatings by officials, the denial of medical care, housing areas flooded with excrement, and inedible food that caused illness. Our letter alerted the government to conditions at a breaking point. We continue to demand, urgently, that ICE and the Department of Defense stop this cruelty by ending the detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss before additional lives are lost.”

Contigo Immigrant Justice

“It is clear that Fort Bliss Camp East Montana is not a place of safety, justice, or due process. We mourn the lives lost in detention and hold their families and loved ones in our hearts, knowing these deaths were preventable. Instead of cages and deaths, we need community-based alternatives that honor human dignity, provide access to legal counsel, and keep families together. We call for the immediate closure of Fort Bliss Camp East Montana and an end to the expansion of punitive detention that endangers lives,” Miles Tokunow, executive director of Contigo Immigrant Justice, said.

New Mexico Immigrant Law Center

“Camp East Montana needs to be closed immediately, and the community members detained there given urgent medical and legal access,” Teague Gonzalez, co-executive director at the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, said. “The human rights abuses taking place in this center are widespread. We cannot continue to allow our neighbors to be treated inhumanely. How many of our brothers and sisters need to die?”

Texas Immigration Law Council.

“The third death at Camp East Montana is a tragedy that serves as an urgent warning to us all. When the government can haul anyone off the streets, anywhere in the country, and place them in a deadly detention camp, no one is safe. This should outrage anyone who values life, liberty, and human dignity and calls for immediate independent review, oversight and accountability,” Kristin Etter, director of policy and legal services of Texas Immigration Law Council, said.

As KTSM previously reported, human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials back in December, demanding an end to the immigration detention center at Camp East Montana.

The groups summarized in the letter account of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

Video captured ICE officers armed with assault rifles pushing through the private home on Nevada Avenue in St. Paul last Thursday, Jan. 15.

A neighbor told FOX 9 that family members told the agents had a warrant for the raid but never presented the documentation.

In the aftermath of the raid, loved ones filed a habeas petition in U.S. District Court, demanding the release of all six extended family members, including a 12-year-old boy.

In response to the habeas filing, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim issued an order directing DHS to respond and produce a judicial warrant by 5 p.m. on Monday.

The court said that in the absence of a warrant, their release would be granted.

Once the deadline passed, Tunheim ruled that DHS and its attorneys failed to respond, and the court granted the habeas corpus petition. He gave the department 72 hours to release all six of the detainees, who are believed to have been transferred out of Minnesota following their arrest.

Tunheim’s order states, they must be ""immediately returned,"" prior to being set free.

Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation.","SALT LAKE CITY — Immigration is a big focus of attention across the nation, and several proposals have emerged or are in the works for consideration when Utah's 2026 legislative session starts next week.

Most notably, Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, has put forward a proposal that would prevent immigrants in the country illegally from being able to tap into public benefits. The measure, HB88, would potentially make immunizations by public health officials, food at food banks and housing at homeless shelters off limits to the population. ""Benefits and welfare should go to citizens only,"" said Lee, an ardent critic of illegal immigration who also worries about the impact on U.S. culture of other classes of immigrants.

He's also considering legislation to eliminate the state program that lets Utah immigrants who are in the country illegally get driver privilege cards, which allow them to lawfully drive in the state. Another possibility, also in the works, would prohibit landlords and home sellers from renting or selling homes to those in the country illegally.

Other proposals from other lawmakers are in the works as well, including a measure put forward by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, that would add a 2% tax to international remittances by immigrants in the country illegally. Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, is proposing a measure to beef up the rules meant to prevent immigrants from voting in elections. Rep. Matt MacPerson, R-West Valley City, proposes new rules targeting those who drive without a license, which includes immigrants, among others.

Last year was a big year for legislation focused on immigration and immigrants in the country illegally, and it appears the issue is returning for 2026. With the new session starting next Tuesday, Jan. 20, here's a look at some of the measures in the works:

HB88: The measure is modeled after a bill passed by Idaho lawmakers last year, HB135, which, as Lee puts it, ""takes all benefits from illegal immigrants.""

It would require proof of legal residency in the country to access testing at public health facilities for communicable diseases and immunizations. It would also require similar proof for those seeking help at food banks, crisis counseling and lodging at homeless shelters, presumably if the services are provided by state entities.

A critic of the measure, Ciriac Alvarez, senior policy analyst at Voices for Utah Children, said it's not crystal clear exactly how far-reaching HB88 would be. Her group advocates for Utah children, including immigrant children.

Alvarez worries that food banks and homeless shelters that receive state funds could fall under its umbrella and fears its impact on the estimated 100,000 immigrants in the country illegally in Utah and their 59,000 U.S.-born kids. She also wonders whether it would apply to other classes of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and immigrants in the country under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

HB135, the Idaho measure used as a model for HB88, faces a legal challenge and, in the meantime, hasn't gone into effect, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Lee hasn't yet put forward a specific proposal to end access to driving privilege cards. But he's a critic and says he's working on it.

Access to such identification helps immigrants in the country illegally stay and work here, undermining federal laws, Lee said. ""It straight-up rewards breaking the law and costs taxpayers. Utah's one of the only red states doing this — totally clashes with our values. Repeal time!"" he said in an email.

Alvarez said the program also benefits other classes of immigrants, including those with legal parole in the United States. If it's eliminated, she warns that some will still drive.

Lee's idea of a bill to prohibit renting or selling of homes to immigrants in the country illegally is modeled after a measure passed by lawmakers in Tennessee last year, SB392, he said. That measure also faces a legal challenge.

HB141: The measure would require proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency to send money abroad. Lacking such identification, entities wiring the funds would be required to impose a 2% tax on the amount to be sent, money that would go into Utah's general fund.

The tax would potentially apply to the money that immigrants in the United States illegally send to family back in their home countries, known as international remittances. A provision in the bill allows those who have to pay the tax to get a credit for the amount when filing their income taxes.

Gricius, who didn't respond to a query seeking comment, pursued similar legislation last year, HB284, but it stalled as the session came to an end. Remittances by immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, among other countries, are a significant source of income for family and other recipients in their home countries.

HB209: The bill calls for increased steps when people are registering to vote to make sure they are U.S. citizens, not immigrants, who aren't allowed to vote in U.S. elections, whether here legally or illegally.

""As for noncitizens voting, Utah law already makes it illegal. This bill is about tightening safeguards and public confidence, not responding to widespread fraud,"" said Maloy, sponsor of the measure. ""Even rare or inadvertent registrations undermine trust in elections.""

The measure requires presentation of proof of U.S. citizenship when applying to register to vote. Utah's REAL ID state-issued driver's licenses specify whether holders are U.S. citizens or immigrants and could be used to demonstrate citizenship. Voters without Utah REAL ID identity cards, which feature a gold star, ""will have to provide proof of citizenship to the county clerks,"" Maloy said.

The measure also contains a provision allowing for ""targeted review"" of registered voters suspected of not being U.S. citizens.

Utah Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse, said earlier this year she was mulling such legislation. She cited at least two reports of noncitizens successfully registering to vote or actually voting in Utah. Maloy ended up as sponsor of the proposal.

HB136: The measure doesn't specifically single out immigrants but allows for seizure of cars operated by people without driver's licenses or driver privilege cards, which includes immigrants, among others.

MacPherson, the bill sponsor, noted 11 fatalities last year on Utah highways involving unlicensed drivers. Moreover, upward of 40% of ""vehicle interactions"" in West Valley City, where he lives, involve unlicensed drivers, he said. The pool of people without licenses includes kids, ""sovereign-citizen types"" and some immigrants, even though they are able to get driver privilege cards if not driver's licenses.

On encountering unlicensed drivers, police are ""stuck without tools to deal with it,"" MacPherson said. ""The best tool is to impound the vehicle. We already impound for DUI, reckless driving, expired registration and a host of other reasons. This gives this tool to law enforcement for this offense as well.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3140/314053/31405347.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2026-01-19 23:57:50.683576

ChongLy Thao, 56, a naturalized U.S. citizen who goes by the name Scott, was returned home later on Sunday without explanation or apology, he said.

""I was praying. I was like, God, please help me, I didn't do anything wrong. Why do they do this to me? Without my clothes on,"" Thao, a Hmong man born in Laos, told Reuters from his home on Monday, while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.

Pictures of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket taken by a Reuters photographer and bystanders spread on social media, further fueling concern that federal law enforcement officers were exceeding their authority as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen some 3,000 officers deployed in the Minneapolis area.

A statement published by the family called the incident ""unnecessary, degrading, and deeply traumatizing."" The highest temperature in Saint Paul on Sunday was 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius).

The Department of Homeland Security said officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was detained.

""He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

'WHY ARE WE HERE'

DHS published wanted posters for two men targeted in the investigation who were still at large, describing each as a ""criminal illegal alien"" from Laos who is subject to deportation orders. One of the men in the wanted posters previously lived at the house but moved out, according to relatives close to the situation, who described him as the ex-husband of a member of the Thao family.

A U.S. District Judge in Minnesota on Friday issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would ""chill"" an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest.

""That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics,"" Judge Katherine Menendez wrote.

The Trump administration is appealing her injunction.

Thao said his parents brought him from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was four-years-old and that he became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During the ordeal, he feared being sent back to Laos, where he has no relatives.

He said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said that he was trying to find his ID as officers escorted him out of the house.

Thao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his four-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.

After taking his fingerprints and a head shot in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.

""We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have a safe place to live,"" he said. ""If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?""

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""
""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.","WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ""will pursue charges"" related to a protest in a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said Monday, specifically calling out ex-CNN journalist Don Lemon for his coverage of the event.

In an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson, Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said journalism is not a ""shield"" from a ""criminal conspiracy.""

""Don Lemon himself has come out and said he knew exactly what was going to happen inside that facility,"" Dhillon said on “The Benny Show.” ""He went into the facility, and then he began — quote, unquote — 'committing journalism,' as if that’s sort of a shield from being a part, an embedded part, of a criminal conspiracy. It isn’t.""

Dhillon did not confirm whether the Justice Department would pursue charges against Lemon in particular. NBC News has asked the Justice Department and the place of worship, Cities Church, for comment.

Reached for a response to Dhillon's remarks, Lemon said in an email that ""it’s notable that I’ve been cast as the face of a protest I was covering as a journalist — especially since I wasn’t the only reporter there.""

""That framing is telling,"" he said. ""What’s even more telling is the barrage of violent threats, along with homophobic and racist slurs, directed at me online by MAGA supporters and amplified by parts of the right-wing press.""

Lemon said he stood by his reporting.

""If this much time and energy is going to be spent manufacturing outrage, it would be far better used investigating the tragic death of Renee Nicole Good — the very issue that brought people into the streets in the first place,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer this month.

Dhillon said in her interview that the Justice Department is ""putting the facts together,"" adding that it was ""a very serious matter.""

""Come next Sunday, nobody should think in the United States that they're going to be able to get away with this,"" she said. ""Everyone in the protest community needs to know that the fullest force of the federal government is going to come down and prevent this from happening and put people away for a long, long time.""

In a video posted on his digital talk show’s YouTube channel, Lemon stands outside with protesters while he explains that he is at an “operation that is a secret.”

Speaking to Lemon, one of the protesters, Nekima Levy Armstrong, refers to the protest as “Operation Pull Up."" She says the protesters are “demanding justice for Renee Good and letting them know that this will not stand.”

In a later clip of the protest inside the church, Lemon says, “We’re not part of the activists, but we’re here just reporting on them.”

Lemon reported that activists had gone to the church because, they alleged, one of its officials worked at the local ICE field office. NBC News has not verified a connection.

Dhillon said Sunday afternoon on X that the Justice Department was ""investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers,"" referring to the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The law, enacted in 1994, prohibits interfering with or obstructing people from seeking reproductive health services or exercising religious freedom at places of worship.

In her interview with Johnson, Dhillon also mentioned the possibility of invoking the Enforcement Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was passed during Reconstruction to protect Black Americans' civil rights.

""Whenever anyone conspires to violate the protected civil rights of American citizens, the Klan Act can be used to bring a conspiracy charge,"" she said.

Protesters can face restrictions on private property without the consent of the property owner.

A livestream posted on the Black Lives Matter Minnesota Facebook page showed protesters at the church Sunday chanting “ICE out” and “Renee Good.”

During the protest, Lemon reported from inside the church, interviewing a pastor who asked him to leave the building unless he was there to worship.

""This is what the First Amendment is about, about the freedom to protest,” Lemon said in his YouTube channel video.

Tensions and anti-ICE protests have grown in the aftermath of Good's killing in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. The administration has sided with Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot her, arguing that he acted in self-defense. Protesters and Minnesota officials have slammed ICE, calling on the administration to remove its personnel.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to the protests, which Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said would be ""a shocking step.""

""In Minneapolis, we’re not going to be intimidated,"" Frey said in an interview with NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""We’re not backing down.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260119-Don-Lemon-Harmeet-Dhillon-rs-79c13a.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 23:58:05.151035

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts.
It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility.
Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.","Central Florida officials and immigrant advocates on Monday criticized a possible new ICE detention facility here as the region sees a surge in undocumented immigrants arrests.

At a press conference at Hope CommUnity Center in Apopka, Executive Director Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet and Central Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost joined others condemning the potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at a warehouse in east Orlando.

“The people of Orange County, of Orlando and of Florida’s 10th congressional district do not want, and we reject, an ICE detention facility,” Frost said.

While there already is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a new processing facility could further ramp up immigration detention efforts. The facility may be part of a national plan, first reported last month by The Washington Post, to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country.

“Let’s be clear about what’s going on across the nation,” Frost said. “They’re shopping around warehouses. This is one of many they’re looking at opening.”

As of Monday morning, roughly 183 people were detained in the Orange County Jail on an ICE hold without any local charges, but that number is likely higher when those held on minor criminal violations like traffic stops are accounted for, Rep. Anna Eskamani said.

“It’s very high,” Eskamani said of the number of people arrested. “When I visited the jail a few months ago it was at most 40 people under just ICE holds, so that’s substantially more.”

The surge in local arrests comes amid the possible deployment of U.S. troops to Minneapolis to quell immigration protests there after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in a vehicle. Those at Monday’s news conference warned that Orlando could be the Trump administration’s next target in its immigration crackdown.

“We are seeing exactly what we have seen across the country,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “We have heard from U.S. citizens that have been followed for several miles on the highway.”

Sousa-Lazaballet said ICE operations have increased locally and his organization is receiving roughly 60 calls per day, up from five, from family members of those arrested.

On Friday, Hope CommUnity Center said in a statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours. A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total because about 300 people had been booked in December.

WKMG and WFTV reported that ICE representatives toured a 439,000-square-foot east Orlando warehouse on Friday. It is zoned for industrial use and may require a zoning change if it’s pursued as an immigration facility. The Orlando City Council may have to approve such a change, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Wilson said Monday she has already submitted a memo with potential draft language on how to block ICE from using the facility as a detention center under its zoning.

“This is a logistical issue as much as it’s a humanitarian issue,” Wilson said. “If local government based on the Florida constitution is where we look at that permitting, we look at that use and the underlying land use, and we scrutinize this.”

State Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis called everyone to peacefully protest ICE and said Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a day to remember what he stood for.

“If you are safe, you should be standing with those who are not,” Bracy Davis said. “Dr. King reminded us that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice, but it bends faster when the dissatisfied pick it up, put it to work.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOS-L-ICE-presser-01.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2026-01-19 19:57:53.337006

Victor Manuel Diaz dies in ICE custody

The backstory:

ICE says contract security staff found Victor Manuel Diaz unconscious in his room at Camp East Montana. Medical staff on site were immediately notified and began life-saving measures. El Paso EMS was called at 3:35 p.m. and arrived 10 minutes later to continue efforts. Diaz was pronounced dead at 4:09 p.m. on Jan. 14.

Diaz had been in ICE custody since Jan. 6 after being arrested in Minneapolis for an immigration violation. He had entered the United States illegally on March 26, 2024, and was ordered removed in absentia by an immigration judge in August if 2025.

Cause of death under investigation

What we know:

ICE says Diaz's death is presumed to be a suicide, though the official cause is still being investigated.

ICE has protocols in place to report in-custody deaths, which include notifying Congress, stakeholders and the media. Reports are also made available on ICE's public website within 90 days. Federal officials released the following statement:

""ICE emphasizes that all detainees receive comprehensive medical care, including screenings and access to emergency services. They assert that no detained individual is denied emergency care during their stay.""

Tina Smith, Jason Chavez react

What they're saying:

U.S. Senator Tina Smith and Jason Chavez of the Minneapolis City Council issued statements on the man's death via social media.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January.

Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, originally from Nicaragua, was found “unconscious and unresponsive in his room” on 14 January at the Camp East Montana detention facility in El Paso, ICE said in a press release.

“They immediately notified contract medical staff on site to conduct life saving measures,” it said, adding that emergency medical technicians arrived to the facility but could not revive Diaz, who was pronounced dead just after 4pm. ICE asserted that Diaz “died of a presumed suicide” but that the “official cause of his death remains under investigation”.

Diaz was detained on 6 January during the Trump administration’s controversial deportation blitz in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He initially entered the US through the Mexican border in March of 2024, when border patrol agents picked him up and he was given a court date with an immigration judge, then released on parole. On 26 August of last year an immigration judge ordered Diaz’s removal “in absentia”. ICE detained him on 12 January in order to deport him.

The extensive tent facility is located on the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso.

Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, the highest number of fatalities in two decades. At least five people have reportedly died in ICE custody this year.

Another man, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, who immigrated to the US from Cuba, died in the same detention camp on 3 January. ICE said Campos was “experiencing medical distress” and that staff provided emergency treatment in the hopes of saving him.

His death is potentially being investigated as a homicide. The local medical examiner determined the preliminary cause of death was “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression”, according to reports. ICE said he experienced a medical emergency after being “disruptive while in line for medication”.

Santos Jesus Flores, who was detained with him, told the Washington Post that he saw five guards choking him, and that he heard Lunas Campos repeatedly say in Spanish that he couldn’t breathe.

“He said, ‘I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe.’ After that, we don’t hear his voice anymore and that’s it,” the publication quoted Flores as saying.

After reports that Lunas Campos’ death might be investigated as a potential homicide, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Guardian that he had tried to kill himself and “violently resisted” officers who were trying to help him.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, also told the Washington Post after it published its article that Lunas Campos was trying to take his own life. The allegation was not part of ICE’s initial statement.

Another Camp East Montana inmate, Francisco Gaspar-Andres, died at a nearby hospital on 3 December. He was 48.

That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing.","Lawyers for the Trump administration said on Monday that they were appealing a judge’s injunction that imposed limits on immigration agents’ interactions with protesters in Minnesota.

In a short notice filed on Monday with the judge who issued the preliminary injunction last week, Justice Department lawyers said they would challenge those limits at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The lawsuit that led to the injunction claimed that federal law enforcement officers had repeatedly violated the rights of protesters who observed or recorded immigration enforcement actions or voiced opposition to those actions.

In her injunction, handed down on Friday, Judge Kate M. Menendez of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not give the plaintiffs everything they had sought in the injunction. She did not include specific protection for the recording of agents, nor did she impose rules about how agents issue dispersal orders.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the appeal. Though a notice of appeal was filed with the district court, the full text of the appeal was not immediately available from the Eighth Circuit.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on Friday in a statement responding to Judge Menendez’s injunction that “D.H.S. is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

She added that despite “grave threats,” agents had “followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public and federal property.”

A spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, which backed the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appeal.

The lawsuit described a “federal campaign to besiege cities across the United States in an unprecedented attack on civil liberties,” and described the case as an effort “to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document, and criticize defendants’ activities, safely and unburdened by the fear of retaliation.”

The suit is one of several filed in recent weeks related to the surge of some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota. The enforcement campaign has led to at least 2,400 arrests, as well as repeated clashes with protesters and two shootings, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a U.S. citizen who was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. In another incident in Minneapolis last week, a federal agent shot and injured a man who officials said was in the country illegally and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or broom.

Judge Menendez is weighing a separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. That case claims that the surge of immigration agents is unconstitutional, and asks for an order blocking the operation from continuing. The state asked Judge Menendez to issue an immediate ruling in that case, but she declined last week to do so.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv/19nat-minnesota-appeal-1-fwqv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:57:55.073250

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term.
Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.
The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook.
In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered.","The Supreme Court’s review this week of President Trump’s attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve was always going to pose a key test of how much leeway the justices would give the president to remake and control the central bank.

Then the Justice Department issued subpoenas this month as part of a criminal investigation into the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell.

Legal experts said that development threatened to complicate the Trump administration’s case, making a potentially difficult-to-win case even more challenging.

Mr. Trump’s solicitor general will argue to the court on Wednesday that the president had a valid reason to fire Lisa Cook, who has been a Fed governor since 2022, because she allegedly engaged in mortgage fraud. She sued after Mr. Trump tried to oust her in August, arguing that the law that established the Fed allowed presidents to dismiss members only “for cause.”

Ms. Cook, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, denies the allegations, which relate to loan documents she signed before joining the Fed.

Analysts say the Powell subpoenas could bolster the sense that the Trump administration ginned up a pretext to oust Ms. Cook as a way to force the central bank to lower borrowing costs.

The move against Mr. Powell “undermines the administration’s contention that this is all about Lisa Cook’s conduct and not about her votes on monetary policy,” said Lev Menand, a Columbia University law professor who is closely tracking the case.

“It all tends to suggest that the goal here is to take over the Fed,” he said.

Mr. Powell will attend Wednesday’s arguments, along with Ms. Cook, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Central bank governors serve staggered 14-year terms “unless sooner removed for cause by the president,” according to federal law. Congress put those protections in place in 1913 and renewed them in 1935 to ensure the independence of the institution and allow officials to set monetary policy without political interference from the president.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Powell misled Congress when questioned in June about extensive renovations of the Fed’s headquarters in Washington that are running hundreds of millions of dollars over budget.

Mr. Powell has aggressively pushed back, saying the investigation is a “consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”

That is the same argument Ms. Cook’s lawyers will make during Wednesday’s argument. In filings, they have said the mortgage fraud allegation is “paper-thin, unproven” and a “manufactured” pretext for policy disagreements.

Mr. Trump had repeatedly vented his frustration with the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and Mr. Powell, whom Mr. Trump promoted to chair during his first term. Mr. Powell, a registered Republican, was initially tapped to join the Fed as a governor by President Barack Obama.

Despite his complaints about Mr. Powell, the president moved to fire Ms. Cook, a nominee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., citing the allegations that she falsified bank documents to acquire more favorable loan terms.

Former top Fed and Treasury officials and Ms. Cook’s legal team have warned the Supreme Court that permitting Mr. Trump to fire her while her litigation is underway would spur economic turmoil and undermine public confidence in the central bank.

The Justice Department argues that Mr. Trump has cited a “cause” to fire Ms. Cook, and that the court cannot second-guess the specific reason the president has identified.

How much discretion presidents have to remove Fed officials, what counts as cause, and whether officials are entitled to notice and process before being ousted will be key questions for the justices at Wednesday’s argument.

The Trump administration is not challenging the constitutionality of the law requiring the president to have cause to fire Ms. Cook. That distinguishes the case from one the Supreme Court heard in December, in which the administration argued that laws requiring the president to identify a rationale before firing other independent regulators infringed on the president’s constitutional authority.

The Supreme Court has been overwhelmingly receptive to Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove regulators from other independent agencies. But the justices have repeatedly signaled that they view the Fed differently.

In cases involving the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Trade Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the justices allowed Mr. Trump to fire officials while their litigation was underway, despite congressionally imposed limits on the president’s removal power.

In contrast, the court said Ms. Cook may remain an active member of the board while her case is considered. The justices also went out of their way to suggest that the Fed may stand apart from other agencies, writing in an order in May that it is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity” with a distinct history.

The newly revealed subpoenas and investigation into Mr. Powell are not officially part of the record before the Supreme Court in Ms. Cook’s case, but experts said atmospherics can matter.

In April 2004, photographs showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib were published the same day the court heard a challenge to the Bush administration’s detention of “enemy combatants” at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The court ultimately ruled against the administration, saying those deemed enemy combatants must be able to challenge their detention before a judge or other “neutral decision maker.”

“That’s not what you want the justices reading about the morning of your argument,” Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William and Mary, said of the government’s lawyers in that case. “You want to be right on the law, but it certainly helps to have atmospherics on your side.”

Those atmospherics could play a role as the justices decide how much flexibility Mr. Trump has to get rid of Ms. Cook before her term expires.

Jennifer Nou, a University of Chicago law professor, said the court ordinarily gave broad discretion to such executive branch judgments. But she pointed to a case during Mr. Trump’s first term that showed that the justices would sometimes reject what they viewed as a made-up rationale by the president or his top advisers.

In 2019, the court rejected the administration’s justification for adding a question about citizenship status to the census. The court said the commerce secretary had not been upfront when he told Congress he acted “solely” in response to a Justice Department request. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the explanation “appears to have been contrived” and that the secretary “was determined” to add the question.

The census decision “can be broadly understood to stand for the proposition that the court does not take pretext lightly,” Ms. Nou said, and “can’t be blinded to the real world.”

The revelations about the U.S. attorney’s investigation into whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress could bolster Ms. Cook’s argument, experts said.",https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:58:04.149920

I am writing to express my concern over the recent resolution to discuss the possibility of the County Sheriff’s department cooperating with ICE by way of a 287(g) agreement. We are seeing a lot of opposition to ICE’s presence in our country. If ICE were pursuing and arresting immigrants with violent criminal records or proven gang affiliation, as was promised by the President, I don’t believe there would be such widespread opposition.

The fact that there is a quota set, and that people who have lived and worked here for years are being targeted, is the reason that citizens are forming groups to watch and even interfere with ICE agents performing their duties.

There is room for a debate over whether we should be deporting people who have no criminal record, but also no legal status. I think almost everyone agrees that our immigration system is badly in need of repair. However, my objection to ICE has much more to do with their tactics. They are masked and without visible ID in many if not all cases—as far as I know that is unacceptable for any law enforcement officer.

I assume that our county deputies will not be masked and will continue to have visible ID, but I’m trying to make a point here about the public sentiment ICE has generated. Their agents are being sent into selected cities in great numbers, outfitted with military gear and weaponry, and are generating an atmosphere, not of safety, but of fear. Incidents like the tragic death in Minneapolis and in other places are bound to happen, as citizens resist these tactics. They are provoking, not protecting.

There is currently a case pending in a state appellate court in Nassau County where the plaintiff is arguing that NY law prevents the police from arresting or detaining people for civil violations of federal immigration law. This is exactly the agreement that is being considered, the 287(g) agreement. My feeling is that the legislature should at the very least wait until this case is decided by the courts. Why put our county in jeopardy of lawsuits unnecessarily, or create the kind of division and anger we see elsewhere in our country?

I think most folks in St Lawrence County appreciate and respect the Sheriff’s department and think of its deputies as neighbors. This kind of cooperation with ICE will only be detrimental to that feeling.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear SEC vs. Sripetch, et al., a Ninth Circuit decision affirming a disgorgement award despite the SEC’s failure to demonstrate defrauded investors suffered pecuniary harm.1

The Supreme Court limited the SEC’s ability to claim disgorgement in the 2020 decision in Liu v. SEC, finding that disgorgement can be equitable relief if it is confined to the wrongdoer’s illicit net profits and is returned to victims.2 Following Liu, Courts split on pecuniary harm was needed to support a disgorgement award.3 For example, in SEC v. Govil, the Second Circuit concluded a showing of pecuniary harm was required given disgorgement’s equitable limitation that it be “awarded for victims.”4 In reaching the exact opposite conclusion, the First Circuit in SEC v. Navellier & Associates, Inc. held that disgorgement does not require a showing of pecuniary harm so long as disgorgement was “tethered to a wrongdoer’s net unlawful profits.”5 If that threshold is met, courts need not be concerned with a victim’s harm.6

The Court’s resolution in this matter will have wide implications for SEC enforcement, specifically the monetary penalties the SEC may seek both in negotiations and in litigation. If the Court finds pecuniary harm is required, it will further restrict the SEC’s powers.

Stacie Halpern, an attorney representing Palacios, told Eyewitness News that the allegations made against her client were investigated by law enforcement and the Department of Children and Family Services and said ""they were unable to find anything that corroborated the allegations and deemed them unfounded.""

She said Palacios acted in self-defense the night Porter was killed and said he was protecting the neighborhood.

The Department of Homeland Security has also not confirmed whether Palacios was involved in the shooting.

Porter was fatally shot the night of Dec. 31 in the 17700 block of Roscoe Boulevard.

According to a statement from DHS, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment.

""The suspected gunfire grew progressively louder, indicating to the officer that whoever was firing a gun was approaching his apartment,"" read a statement released by Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. ""The officer took his ICE authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate. He moved to the ground level and went outside, where he believed the suspected gunfire was coming from.""

DHS said the agent encountered Porter holding what appeared to be a long rifle and ordered him to put it down.

""The ICE officer identified himself as law enforcement,"" read the DHS statement. ""In response, the individual pointed his weapon at the ICE officer. The officer ordered the subject to put the weapon down. When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer.""

Porter's family, however, disputes that account, saying his gunfire was part of a New Year's celebration. They are asking for more information as they mourn his death.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18432363_011826-kabc-7a-DHS-northridge-shooting-STRINGER-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:03.228948

Justice department officials accuse the protesters of ""desecrating a house of worship"", and say they will investigate them for civil rights violations.

Anti-ICE protests continue in the state against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, and the Pentagon reportedly placed 1,500 soldiers on standby for possible deployment.

On Sunday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to exercise the ""full force of federal law"" against the demonstrators who interrupted the service at the Cities Church in St Paul, which neighbors Minneapolis.

Later on Monday, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said on X that the justice department ""will pursue federal charges in this case"".

Protesters say that one of the church's eight pastors, David Easterwood, is a local ICE official.

Easterwood was not leading the service on Sunday.

A person by the same name is identified in ACLU court filings as the acting director of the ICE St Paul field office, according to reporting by the Associated Press and the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

The AP also reported he appeared alongside Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in Minneapolis at a news conference last October.

The BBC has contacted the church for comment.

In a statement, DHS said it does not confirm or deny the identities of its agents as ""publicizing their identities puts their lives and the lives of their families at serious risk"".

Monique Cullars-Doty, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota and one of the protest organisers, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that ""we can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray"".

Elsewhere in the city, protests with occasional clashes have persisted at the Whipple building in Minneapolis where federal agents are headquartered.

A DHS spokesperson said on Monday that at least 3,000 people have been arrested in Minneapolis since the deployments.

On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.

Thousands of ICE agents are in Minnesota as part of a surge by the Trump administration after his election pledge for the biggest deportation operation of undocumented migrants in history.

On Sunday, CBS News reported that 1,500 active-duty soldiers have been placed on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, after President Trump said he may invoke the Insurrection Act to respond to protests.

The 19th-Century law allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.

Dozens of people rushed into Cities Church in St. Paul Sunday morning, interrupting the church service and leading to tense confrontations, videos posted by activists and content creators show.

“ICE out!” protesters shouted as they were confronted by the lead pastor and congregants.

The demonstrators said they were there to protest David Easterwood, who is listed as a pastor at the church and appears to be the same David Easterwood who is a top ICE official in the Twin Cities. He was recently named as a defendant in a case brought by protesters who allege immigration agents had violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights.

“David Easterwood, out now!” protesters yelled at one point.

None of the videos show Easterwood in the church, and it’s unclear if he was in the building on Sunday. In response to CNN’s inquiry about his connection to ICE, a DHS spokesperson responded, “DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers.”

Federal investigation promised

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon announced an investigation within hours, calling the protesters’ actions “desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

Dhillon cited the FACE Act, a federal law that “prohibits the use or threat of force and physical obstruction that injures, intimidates, or interferes with a person seeking to … exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.”

A surge in immigration enforcement around Minneapolis, known as Operation Metro Surge, brought thousands of additional federal agents to the area and prompted widespread protests, especially after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7.

The swift promise to investigate the demonstration stood in contrast to the administration’s response to Good’s death, as the Department of Justice quickly quashed an inquiry and refused to cooperate with local law enforcement agencies on their own investigation.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, a former president of the local NAACP chapter, told The Associated Press she considered the threat of an official investigation a sham.

“If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and they need to check their hearts,” she said.

Cities Church has not responded to CNN’s requests for comment. A St. Paul police vehicle was briefly seen parked outside the building Monday morning, and no one answered when a CNN crew rang the doorbell.

Who is David Easterwood?

The man targeted by protesters Sunday is the acting field office director in St. Paul for Enforcement and Removal Operations at ICE. In a declaration filed in this month’s lawsuit by protesters, Easterwood said he has worked for ICE since 2015.

Easterwood argued in his statement any order from the court would “further endanger the safety of law enforcement personnel and the public.”

Judge Katherine Menendez found ICE agents had been overzealous in pulling over some demonstrators who were following agents in vehicles.

“The Court has carefully considered and weighed Director Easterwood’s account of how vehicles have been used by observers to protest ICE activity in the Twin Cities,” Menendez wrote. “But, even crediting his statements about incidents of misconduct among other people following Operation Metro Surge, it simply does not establish reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop as to these particular plaintiffs.”

Despite Easterwood’s testimony, Menendez issued a largely symbolic injunction ordering agents not to detain people “who are engaging in unobtrusive protest activity, including observing the activities of Operation Metro Surge.”

Just days after taking his current position, Easterwood appeared alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news conference on immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities.

“Our officers demonstrate every day what it means to serve with honor and dedication,” Easterwood said in October.

Easterwood does not have a listed phone number, and requests for comment sent to his office were not immediately answered.

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. She also blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “for whipping these mobs into a frenzy and then allowing them to run rampant.”

With emotions running high and confrontational tactics escalating on both sides, Sunday’s protest highlights the growing tension between protecting free expression and silencing opposing voices.

“The question that we’re coming to is how law enforcement is going to protect the rights of protesters to engage in their First Amendment-protected activity, and at the same time not be intimidating other people for whatever rights they are engaged in,” CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero said.

WATCH: Twin Cities on edge as ICE raids ignite fear and protests

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said. ""We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.""

Can This Lawyer Change That?,"Michael Steinberger, www.nytimes.com, michael-steinberger",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/magazine/genocide-trial-human-right-international-law.html,"“It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says.
At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters.
Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world.
“We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.
He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose.","Despite the carnage in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and even in the face of the Trump administration’s apparent determination to dismantle what remains of the liberal international order, the human rights attorney Philippe Sands insists he is not giving in to despair. “It’s too early to write off the rules-based system, too early to write off the United States,” he says. “It’s a long game.” Coming from Sands, who has devoted most of his career to trying to contain the darkest human impulses, the cautious pessimism is almost encouraging. He concedes, however, that it does feel as if the lessons of the 20th century are being cast aside and that the same sinister spirits that led to Auschwitz, Rwanda and Srebrenica are enjoying a revival. “There is definitely something in the air.”

Sands, who is 65, is among the pre-eminent figures in his field and has taken part in a number of landmark cases. He was a lawyer for Croatia in the genocide claim that it brought against Serbia, helped lay the groundwork for the prosecution of the former Liberian president Charles Taylor and was a member of the legal team that sought to hold the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet accountable for torturing and murdering political opponents. More recently, he was the lead outside counsel in the successful campaign to get Britain to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and argued for Palestinian self-determination in a case before the International Court of Justice. He also played a key role in the establishment of a tribunal to investigate Russia for crimes of aggression against Ukraine. Over the last three decades, few people have done more to shape the direction of international criminal law than Sands.

His latest book, “38 Londres Street,” was recently released in the United States. It recounts the indictment of Pinochet in 1998, his arrest in London and the ultimately unsuccessful quest to make him stand trial. The book, which takes its name from the building in Santiago that housed one of Pinochet’s clandestine torture centers, is also about the relationship between Pinochet and Walter Rauff, a senior SS officer — he developed the mobile gas chambers that the Nazis used to murder around 100,000 people — who fled to Chilean Patagonia after World War II.

The book is well timed. Scenes in the United States of masked law enforcement officers grabbing people off the street have evoked comparisons to Pinochet’s Chile and to Argentina’s Dirty War. Sands, whose wife, Natalia Schiffrin, is American (his brother-in-law is the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz), says there is “at least the embryo of a parallel.” What especially troubles him is the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision granting presidents almost blanket immunity. As Sands asks: “If a president commits crimes against humanity, tortures or disappears people, is he going to be subject to examination by the courts? The answer appears to be no.” Sands fears that the Supreme Court, 80 years after the Nuremberg trials established that political and military leaders could be held accountable for atrocities against their own citizens, has ushered in what he calls a “new age of impunity.”

On the international front, certainly, the Trump administration feels unconstrained by existing laws and norms, a point demonstrated by the U.S. military incursion into Venezuela and acknowledged with disarming candor by the president himself in a subsequent interview with The Times. “I don’t need international law,” Trump said. Amid all this upheaval, Sands is currently arguing another major case before the I.C.J.: He is representing Gambia in the genocide claim that it filed against Myanmar over its treatment of the Rohingya people. The trial opened last week in The Hague and is scheduled to run through the end of the month. If Sands and his colleagues prevail, it will mark the first time that a state has been held responsible for genocide. The I.C.J. has no direct means of enforcing its judgments, however, and in the context of the current moment, the courtroom proceedings might seem like a forlorn attempt to add scaffolding to a collapsing edifice.

Last January, Sands delivered a Holocaust Remembrance Day lecture at the University of Cambridge, his alma mater. Although his work often immerses him in stories of appalling cruelty, he is by nature very cheerful, and he exuded warmth and affability as he reflected on his Cambridge education and talked about his career. He counseled the students against cynicism. He noted that international human rights law was still in its nascency and said he remained optimistic that its core values would ultimately triumph. “I firmly believe that the arc of history will follow the arc of justice,” he said.

But he acknowledged that history seemed to be taking an unfortunate detour. Donald Trump was back in the White House, and Elon Musk had given what many observers interpreted to be a Nazi salute at an inauguration event and had also told a far-right rally in Germany that it was time to move beyond the country’s past, and Sands conceded that it was hard not to feel a sense of foreboding. “This could end very badly,” he said.

He grew up in the shadow of bleak times. His mother, Ruth, is a Holocaust survivor; as a toddler, she was spirited out of Vienna by a Christian missionary named Elsie Tilney and spent several years in France in the care of a series of Catholic families who hid her Jewish identity. Sands was raised in London (he holds British and French citizenship). His father, Allan, was a dentist; Ruth owned a children’s secondhand bookstore. He has a younger brother, Marc, who recently retired as an executive at an art auction house.

Sands entered Cambridge in 1979 intent on studying economics. But he quickly soured on supply-and-demand curves and switched to law. He found that pretty stultifying too, except for the class he took on international law. Although the professor was, in Sands’s words, “a very dry Yorkshireman,” he was enthralled by the subject matter. He says that it was “about all these things that were not talked about at home but were very, very present.”

Upon graduating, he spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. In 1984, he returned to Cambridge to work as a fellow at the university’s Research Center for International Law, which was under the direction of Elihu Lauterpacht, Hersch Lauterpacht’s son, with whom he formed a close bond. At the time, international law was an extremely circumscribed niche, mainly involving border disputes and other technical matters. After the breakthroughs at Nuremberg, international criminal law had become largely moribund owing to the exigencies of the Cold War.

By contrast, international environmental law was an emerging subfield full of promise, and Sands became one of its pioneering figures. His foray into environmental law began with a paper that he wrote on transboundary pollution after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. He helped start the Alliance of Small Island States, which has been at the forefront of the battle against climate change, seeking to ensure that the interests of island nations, which are particularly threatened, are represented in negotiations over emissions reductions and other measures. In 1995, he helped write what remains a widely used textbook on international environmental law. Sands is now active in the movement to have ecocide — loosely defined as illegal or wanton acts committed in the knowledge that they are very likely to cause severe environmental damage — recognized as an international crime.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War created an opening to finally build on the legacy of Nuremberg, and the Balkan wars and the Rwandan genocide gave added impetus to that work. Pinochet’s arrest in 1998 in London appeared to mark a turning point in the fight for accountability: He was the first former head of state ever detained on foreign soil under the principle of “universal jurisdiction” — the idea that some crimes are so egregious that every nation has a right and a duty to seek to punish those responsible for them.

The British government released Pinochet in 2000, however, citing health concerns, and Sands says that after Sept. 11, the effort to make international criminal law more comprehensive and binding became significantly harder. According to Sands, “38 Londres Street” is in part an “elegy” for the time in the 1990s when the global human rights system seemed to take another step forward.

Still, even as progress slowed, Sands gained recognition for his deep knowledge of the law and for his litigating skills, and his expertise was sought not only by victims of human rights abuses but also by a few notorious oppressors. After Saddam Hussein was deposed and captured in 2003 by U.S.-led coalition forces, intermediaries reached out to see if Sands might be willing to provide legal advice to the Iraqi dictator if he was brought before an international tribunal (Sands wasn’t, and Hussein was convicted and sentenced to death by a special tribunal of Iraqi judges).

A few years later, at the request of the Syrian government, Sands traveled to Damascus to discuss with President Bashar al-Assad the legal jeopardy that he might face as a result of the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon. There was speculation that the Syrian government played a part in his killing, and al-Assad wished to know if he, as a head of state, could claim immunity from potential prosecution. Sands told him he could not. He says that he was offering “an independent opinion” to al-Assad and was never asked to represent him. He adds that upholding international law occasionally requires speaking to the bad guys too.

To Sands, the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib was a shocking betrayal of the values that the United States claimed to represent, and President Obama’s failure to hold those officials accountable remains a source of disappointment to him. Even so, he continued to regard the United States as generally a force for good in the world. The postwar global order was principally an American creation, and this extended to the advancement of human rights. “The United States was the architect, very largely, of the rules that I have been involved with my whole life,” Sands says. “We saw it as the mansion on the hill, the guardian of the idea of the international rule of law.” But a year into Trump’s second presidency, that no longer seems to be the case. “We are beginning to have to imagine doing the work we do without having the United States as a backstop,” he says.

In 2010, Sands was invited to give a lecture at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. He had never been to Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, close to the Polish border, but it was where his maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz, was born and raised. Buchholz, who eventually settled in Paris, rarely spoke of Lviv or of the family that he lost in the Holocaust, a conspicuous silence during Sands’s childhood. After accepting the invitation, Sands decided to research the family history that Buchholz had never shared. In short order, he discovered the tragic fate of Buchholz’s mother and dozens of other relatives, and he learned too that Raphael Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpacht had both attended law school in Lviv. Sands also became acquainted with the sons of two of the men responsible for the deaths of his family members: Niklas Frank, whose father, Hans, administered German-occupied Poland during World War II and who was among the Nazi officials convicted at Nuremberg and executed; and Horst von Wächter, whose father, Otto, was the Nazi official in charge of Galicia, which included Lviv.

Sands told the stories of Hans Frank and Otto von Wächter and of how their sons reckoned with their crimes in a compelling 2015 documentary, “My Nazi Legacy,” which he wrote and narrated. Niklas Frank, who became a journalist, renounced his father and wrote a book harshly condemning him. Horst von Wächter is a more complicated figure. Although he later opened his family’s archives to Sands, he could not bring himself to accept his father’s culpability. The film’s most poignant scene comes when Sands, Frank and von Wächter visit the field not far from Lviv where in 1943 around 3,500 Jews were executed and buried, including some of Sands’s relatives (as well as relatives of Hersh Lauterpacht). Troops under the command of von Wächter’s father took part in the massacre. As Frank and von Wächter stand before a memorial commemorating the atrocity, Frank says, “This our fathers did.” From von Wächter’s stricken look, it seems clear that he knows the truth, but even then, he refuses to admit it.

A year after the documentary was released, Sands published “East West Street.” Part of the book is about the Nuremberg trials and the behind-the-scenes jockeying between Lemkin and Lauterpacht over how the defendants were to be charged. Lemkin wanted them tried for what he called “genocide” — for murdering people because they were members of a particular group, for killing Jews because they were Jews. Lauterpacht didn’t dispute that Jews had been victimized because of their identity, but he pushed to have the defendants charged instead with what he called crimes against humanity — with killing people as individuals. He believed it was essential to try to steer humanity away from tribalism and hoped that international law could serve that purpose. As Sands writes in “East West Street”: “By focusing on the individual, not the group, Lauterpacht wanted to diminish the force of intergroup conflict. It was a rational, enlightened view, and also an idealistic one.”

Lauterpacht prevailed at Nuremberg: In October 1946, 18 Nazi leaders were convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity, but the judgments against them made no mention of genocide. Lemkin’s lobbying efforts did not go unrewarded, however. Two months after the verdicts in Nuremberg, the United Nations voted to designate genocide an international crime. And in the decades since, largely owing to the enduring resonance of the Holocaust, genocide has come to be regarded as the more consequential and damning accusation — the “crime of crimes,” as Sands puts it. He finds this regrettable; crimes against humanity are no less heinous than acts of genocide, and he believes they should carry just as much opprobrium. But the bigger problem, in his mind, is that because the word “genocide” has such powerful connotations, it is often used carelessly and as a cudgel.

The pitfalls of the genocide charge became apparent to Sands when he represented Croatia in the case that it brought against Serbia in 1999 (another lawyer on the team was Keir Starmer, now Britain’s prime minister). The allegation centered on the massacre in November 1991 of several hundred Croatian P.O.W.s and civilians by Serbian paramilitaries; the killings took place near Vukovar, a city in Croatia. When the I.C.J. finally issued a decision, in 2015 (the wheels of international justice are especially slow to turn), it declined to categorize the slaughter as genocide. The ruling infuriated Croats, and their outrage was compounded by the fact that the same court had earlier affirmed that the 1995 massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica, also by Serbian paramilitaries, did meet the definition. (The court ruled that those Serbian units committed genocide but concluded that the Serbian government itself could not be held responsible for the atrocities.)

Sands told me that this remains a source of resentment in Croatia. “Many people believe there will be another war because the Croats didn’t get their genocide. And their anger is against the Bosnians, who got a genocide. So you ask yourself the question: Why is that a socially useful outcome?” He says that Lauterpacht anticipated the danger in elevating genocide to a crime — that it would sharpen tribal instincts and make it more likely, not less, that eliminationist desires would be acted on — and that he has come to share this view. Intellectually, he stands with Lauterpacht.

At the same time, he admits that he is very sympathetic to Lemkin’s position. During a talk at the City University of New York last March, Sands recalled visiting the site near Lviv where his relatives were murdered. “Standing above that unmarked mass grave,” he told the audience, “it was impossible for me as someone who is Jewish not to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the people who were there simply because they were Jews who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.” They were unquestionably the victims of a genocide. So were the Tutsis in Rwanda and the Bosnian Muslims who were massacred in Srebrenica. And despite his frustration with how promiscuously the genocide charge is invoked, Sands is confident that he can make it stick in the case against Myanmar.

More than six years later, Gambia v. Myanmar has now gone to trial at the I.C.J. Under international law, genocide is difficult to prove. Sands and his colleagues must be able to show dolus specialis, or specific intent: They have to establish, through direct evidence or compelling circumstantial evidence, that the only reasonable inference the judges can draw is that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya were motivated wholly or partly by genocidal impulses. On the first day of the hearings, Sands told the court that his side would demonstrate that the violence inflicted on multiple villages by Myanmar’s military met that threshold. Just as in Srebrenica, he said, what occurred in those villages presents “the inescapable conclusion that the crimes against the Rohingya who lived there were perpetrated with genocidal intent.”

One reason the trial in The Hague is being closely watched is the implications that it might have for a case that the I.C.J. is expected to hear later this year: the genocide allegation that South Africa has brought against Israel over the war in Gaza. A determination that Myanmar committed genocide could foretell a similar judgment against Israel. If, on the other hand, the I.C.J. clears Myanmar, it would be interpreted as a positive sign for Israel. Many observers think the court would be reluctant to turn history on its head by making Israel the first nation found guilty of genocide.

What’s more, the judges will be under considerable pressure, because the case against Israel could have onerous consequences for them. The Trump administration has sanctioned a handful of judges and one prosecutor with the International Criminal Court over its 2024 decision to issue arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its former defense minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and it will undoubtedly seek to punish the I.C.J. if it rules against Israel. (The I.C.C. prosecutes individuals; the I.C.J. adjudicates disputes between countries.)

According to Sands, there is a simple explanation for his reticence: He hasn’t wanted to make any public statements that might prejudice the Myanmar case. What he is willing to say is that he thinks Lemkin would have regarded Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as genocidal, but so too the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack that prompted it. He also points out something else. In 2019, Time magazine published an article about Netanyahu that noted that he was reading “East West Street” and included a photo of him with the book in his hand. Sands’s son (he has three children) had the picture framed. “One thing we can say with certainty,” Sands says, “is that Benjamin Netanyahu is well aware of what Raphael Lemkin considered the crime of genocide and needs no lessons from anyone on the dangers he is likely to face on the basis of his actions.”

But even as he argues another case in The Hague, Sands has come to believe that the law isn’t the only avenue for establishing truth and accountability, or necessarily always the best one. Near the end of his talk in Cambridge, Sands took questions. One student suggested that as a condition for ending the war in Ukraine, Russia was likely to demand that any criminal charges against Vladimir Putin and other officials be dropped. (The recent peace plan endorsed by President Trump included full amnesty for all parties.) How, he asked, would Sands “balance the tension between stopping more violence and seeing justice for violence that has already happened?”

Sands said that in any situation in which a civilian population has been brutalized, the crimes must be acknowledged. “You have to find a way to address what happened,” he said. But he went on to tell the student that his work as a writer had broadened his view of how justice might be achieved. He mentioned, by way of example, the role that literature has played in helping Chile recover from the horrors of the Pinochet era. “It has had a profoundly important impact,” Sands said. He also cited Patrick Radden Keefe’s book “Say Nothing,” about sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/02/01/magazine/01mag-sands-HP-square/01mag-sands-HP-square-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:58:58.906844

While performing in his home state of New Jersey, Springsteen dedicated his 1978 song The Promised Land to Renee Good, the 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minnesota.

Springsteen told the crowd, which loudly cheered his remarks: “If you believe in democracy, in liberty, if you believe truth still matters, and it’s worth speaking out, and it’s worth fighting for; if you believe in the power of the law and that no-one stands above it; if you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens; if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president. As the mayor of that city has said: ICE should get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”

Springsteen, who has condemned Trump’s actions before, said the song was about “both the beautiful but flawed country that we are, and to the country that we could be”.

“This song is for you, and in the memory of a mother of three and an American citizen, Renee Good,” he added.

The musician, whose lyrics have been praised for depicting the struggles and triumphs of working-class Americans, had already criticized Trump’s authoritarian leanings.

At a show in May in the UK he said: “In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society.

""We're one of the only churches that are having in-person service. Most Latino churches don't have a service because even citizens and legal residents are afraid to come out or to go to the store,"" Pastor Sergio Amezcua said.

Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began Operation Metro Surge in December, Amezcua has been helping families who don't feel safe leaving their homes.

When he first asked his assistant to put out a call on social media, he thought they would receive a few requests.

""That was at 11 a.m. in the morning and by 7 p.m., my assistant called me and said, 'Pastor, a lot of people registered.' I was like, '20 families? 10?' 'No, 2,000,'"" Amezcua recalled.

According to Amezcua, so far they've been able to help approximately 14,000 families, but around 25,000 families are registered.

Right now, they're distributing anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 pounds of food per week with the help of hundreds of volunteers.

""It looks like they're responding to a hurricane catastrophe, but it is a mental catastrophe what the government is doing with us in Minnesota,"" Amezcua said.

DHH Church is helping families from not just the metro area but across the state. They also provide food to 20 churches, 10 schools and a refugee organization.

""Our refugees and our immigrant community... are going through hell and that's not the America... that we know,"" Amezcua said. ""I want to make clear... that from a conservative pastor, what Donald Trump and the White House is doing is horrible. We feel betrayed by him and his White House. That's the way we feel.""

Amezcua recalled getting a phone call from a mother who was reusing single-use diapers, saying, ""She was washing the diapers and I said, 'No, no, no'... I sent a text, if you can donate diapers. Our volunteer force showed up with what you see here.""

On the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, DHH Church was full of volunteers and people dropping off donations. Amezcua said once he realized food banks would be closed for the holiday, he started texting people. The community quickly mobilized. They plan to help 700-1,000 families on Monday alone.

""This is one way that takes no skill. Just takes showing up and I think we gotta keep showing up for stuff,"" said Brian McDermott, a volunteer who also dropped off food donations on Sunday.

Amezcua said with 25,000 families registered, they can't reach everyone. He's hoping to train more churches to do what they're doing.

Federal response to ICE lawsuit

The backstory:

A federal judge has fast-tracked a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government over increased ICE activities. The judge denied an immediate halt to the activities, and Attorney General Keith Ellison has since sent a letter to the judge requesting a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order, citing what he said were escalating harms from the federal government’s actions.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud, as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution. The lawsuit alleges the enforcement activities are impacting schools and businesses, with local leaders urging federal agents to stop using what they describe as excessive force and start wearing body-worn cameras.

Officials have emphasized the lawsuit is not an attempt to try and block immigration enforcement altogether, but rather to stop what they describe as unlawful federal enforcement.

The other side:

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has repeatedly criticized the state and Minneapolis leaders, accusing them of protecting criminals in their opposition to ICE.

What's next:

The judge ordered federal officials to submit their response to the lawsuit no later than Monday, Jan. 19. The plaintiffs will then have until Thursday, Jan. 22, to respond to those arguments.

Federal officials have not filed a response as of Monday morning.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.
In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal.","As communities across the country on Monday host parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon’s legacy.

In the year since Donald Trump’s second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has gone scorched earth against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized.

One year ago, Trump’s executive orders, “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” and “Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump’s birthday.

The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city’s Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for.

Still, the concerns have not chilled many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon’s plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, are vowing a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.

‘We’ve always strived to be a more perfect union’

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who “were very badly treated.” Politicians and advocates say Trump’s comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.

“I think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven’t always been perfect, but we’ve always strived to be this more perfect union, and that’s what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,” Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland’s first Black governor and only the nation’s third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.

Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration’s priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement.

“From health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,” Wiley said, “things Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The conservative Heritage Foundation think tank is encouraging the holiday’s focus to stay solely on King himself. Brenda Hafera, a foundation research fellow, urged people to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta or reread his “I have a dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington nearly 63 years ago.

But using the holiday as a platform to rally and speak about “anti-racism” and “critical race theory” actually rejects King’s ambition for the country, Hafera argued.

“I think efforts should be conducted in the spirit of what Martin Luther King actually believed and what he preached. And his vision was a colorblind society, right,” Hafera said. “He says very famously in his speech, don’t judge by the color of your skin, but the content of your character.”

Groups call for holiday of reclamation, education and rallying

The NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil right organization which had a myriad MLK Day events planned for Monday, asserted that the heightened fears among communities of color and in immigrant communities mean King Day observances must take a different tone. People will have to put their safety first, even if their government isn’t, said Wisdom Cole, NAACP senior national director of advocacy.

“As folks are using their constitutional right to protest and to speak out and stand up for what they believe in, we are being faced with violence. We are faced with increased police and state violence inflicted by the government,” Cole said.

The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, has planned its events under the banner “Reclaim MLK Day of Action.” Organizers planned demonstrations in Atlanta, Chicago and Oakland, California, among other cities, over the weekend and Monday.

“This year it is more important than ever to reclaim MLK’s radical legacy, letting his wisdom and fierce commitment to freedom move us into the action necessary to take care of one another, fight back, and free ourselves from this fascist regime,” Devonte Jackson, a national organizing director for the coalition, said in a statement.

Indiana school cancels historic MLK Day event

For the first time in its 60-year history, Indiana University in Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King dinner. Over the years, the event drew notable guest speakers including Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress, and activist Angela Davis.

The reasoning was “budget constraints,” according to a social media post by the school’s Black Student Union. However, the group said it was worried this was “connected to broader political pressures.” A few students have since organized smaller community dinners or “eat-ins” to fill the void, WTHR-TV in Indianapolis reported.

Meanwhile, the St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in Westbrook, Maine, canceled a MLK Day service due to “unforeseen circumstances,” according to the parish website. But a member of the church’s “social justice and peace committee” told NewsCenterMaine.com that the pastor was concerned about people’s safety amid rumors of ICE agents being in the area.

Overall, there have been few reports of King Day events being majorly scaled down or canceled altogether.

In Memphis, Tennessee, the National Civil Rights Museum is going about its annual King Day celebration as normal. The museum is located on the site of the former Lorraine Motel, where King was shot on April 4, 1968. The museum is offering free admission on the holiday, an annual tradition.

“This milestone year is not only about looking back at what Dr. King stood for, but also recognizing the people who continue to make his ideals real today,” museum President Russell Wigginton said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26017756118578.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-19 12:58:04.556951

The latest ICE Out! event drew protesters who outlined specific demands for Richmond and Virginia officials regarding immigration policy.

""We need to shut down all detention centers in Virginia. We need to ensure legal and financial support from the state and from the city for those detained. We must ensure that Richmond does not renegotiate any contract with Flock surveillance cameras or any other surveillance technology,"" one protester said.

Sunday's rally continued the momentum from last weekend's demonstration on Broad Street where around 300 people protested the deadly shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Richmond protesters demand justice after Renee Good killed in ICE shooting

Last Saturday's protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend, with demonstrators braving heavy rain as they assembled underneath the Maggie Walker statue to express frustration over Good's shooting.

""This is what that actually looks like, coming together for something good instead of violence and domination and terror,"" Te'Shaun Cleckley, one of last weekend's demonstrators, said.

Good, an Old Dominion University graduate and mother of three, was shot three times by the federal agent in an encounter captured on multiple cellphone videos that have sparked nationwide scrutiny.

The Trump Administration has defended the agent's actions, with President Trump stating Friday: ""We will always be protecting ICE and we will always be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.""

Cleckley urged fellow protesters to continue fighting for justice in Good's memory.

""Our mobilization to fight for justice and for liberation and for dignity and equity for everybody, isn't necessarily rooted in the reality that we're going to win,"" Cleckley said. ""It's rooted in the fact that we love the world around us, we love the people around us and we love the people that are gonna come after us. So my message would be, don't stop.""

Spanberger's policy reversal marks a sharp departure from Youngkin's approach, which included consistent support for ICE operations.

As a result, within the Fifth Circuit, providers cannot rely on the No Surprises Act (NSA) itself to enforce Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) awards in court and face a heightened standing bar for ERISA-based claims where patients are insulated from financial harm. And the persuasive effect of the Fifth Circuit’s holding is bolstered nationwide.

Background

As we explained previously, Guardian Flight arose out of efforts by air ambulance providers Guardian Flight and Med-Trans to collect payments awarded through the IDR process under the NSA. After prevailing in multiple “baseball-style” IDR proceedings against an insurer, the providers alleged that the insurer failed to pay the awards within the 30‑day deadline required by the NSA. They sued to enforce those awards, asserting: (1) direct claims under the NSA; (2) derivative ERISA claims based on assignments from plan beneficiaries; and (3) a Texas quantum meruit claim. The district court dismissed across the board, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the NSA does not create a private right of action for providers to enforce IDR awards, that the providers lacked ERISA standing because NSA‑protected beneficiaries suffered no concrete financial injury, and that the quasi‑contract claim failed because the services were rendered for the patients, not for the insurer.

Issues Presented in the Cert Petition

The certiorari petition asked the Supreme Court to review two issues with potentially far‑reaching consequences for NSA and ERISA litigation. First, it asked whether a breach of ERISA plan terms is itself an injury in fact to a plan beneficiary even where the beneficiary is insulated from out‑of‑pocket harm by the NSA’s balance‑billing protections, and therefore whether assignee‑providers can rely on that breach alone to establish Article III standing. Second, it asked whether, when Congress made NSA IDR awards “binding” and directed that insurers “shall” pay them within 30 days, it intended to permit providers to sue in court to enforce those awards, rather than leaving enforcement exclusively to administrative agencies. The petition argued that the Fifth Circuit’s answers to both questions deepen existing splits among the circuits on what constitutes a concrete injury under Spokeo and Ramirez, and on how to read statutory “binding” and “shall pay” language in the private-right-of-action context.

Practical Impact in the Fifth Circuit

With the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari, the Fifth Circuit’s analysis now firmly governs within Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and will be influential elsewhere. In practical terms, providers in the Fifth Circuit cannot bring standalone NSA claims to compel payment of IDR awards, and must instead look primarily to federal and state regulators (such as Health and Human Services) or to contract‑based remedies to address nonpayment. ERISA‑based claims will continue to face heightened standing scrutiny where patients are shielded from financial liability, as the Fifth Circuit treats the plan’s alleged failure to pay as a “technical” breach insufficient, by itself, to constitute a concrete injury to the beneficiary. And state‑law quasi‑contract theories remain constrained by the court’s view that services performed for patients do not satisfy Texas’s requirement that services be rendered for the defendant’s benefit.

Numerous other district courts throughout the United States have followed the Fifth Circuit’s lead in finding providers lack a private right of action to enforce IDR awards, and we expect the denial of certiorari will add further support for district courts considering the issue in the future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14355_0412.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:58:25.579400

Martin Luther King Jr., communities in the Bay Area will celebrate the legendary civil rights activist’s legacy by making their voices heard, amid the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deport historic numbers of immigrants.

“This year is not just about honoring history, it’s about practicing for the future,” said Gina Fromer, CEO of San Francisco social justice organization GLIDE. “I have no doubt that we need to march many times this year in defense of our rights. Dr. King said hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”

Fromer said GLIDE’s annual march, which gathers at the San Francisco Caltrain station at Fourth and King Streets and has been a local tradition for 41 years, is intended to mirror the Selma to Montgomery protest marches of 1965.

Across the Bay Area, activists are seizing the moment and transforming what is typically a yearly opportunity to give back through acts of service into a day of political action. Throughout the Bay Area, residents are honoring MLK’s desire to strengthen community and building local resilience through shoreline cleanups, food distributions and interfaith gatherings.

This year, Fromer said, Glide’s march will advocate for “radical inclusivity” at a time when the rights of LGBTQ+, unhoused and immigrant communities are threatened. She noted that the current administration’s attacks make the late leader’s message of “unconditional love” more important than ever.

In the East Bay, the Freedmen Federation and Faith In Action East Bay have organized a Unity Vigil at Richmond’s City Hall to address what they call “state-sanctioned violence.”

Kira Lee, a professor and organizer with the collective, said the recent death of Los Angeles resident and U.S. citizen Keith Porter Jr. in ICE custody and sightings of federal immigration agents in Richmond have made it impossible to separate the holiday from the current political moment.

Lee called the surge in enforcement an “exercise in othering” that targets residents across race and citizenship status. “I don’t view this as an immigration issue. I view this as a racial issue,” Lee said.

“I view it as slave catching, where state violence is being used to decide who belongs and who doesn’t. Black and brown families have been screaming for protection this entire time.”

In the tradition of giving back, South Berkeley high school students with the youth design nonprofit Girls Garage will unveil their renovation of a home for an older Black couple this weekend.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday will mark the culmination of a year-long project to repair damage done by an unlicensed contractor that had left the family home unlivable and them at risk of displacement.

Emily Pilloton-Lam, the nonprofit’s founder, said that community-led projects offer people realistic ways to take action during periods of national uncertainty. And encouraging young women and gender-expansive youth to lead the remodel, she said, sends a powerful message.

“It is a very, very difficult time to maintain hope when we see what’s going on all over the country,” Pilloton-Lam said. “Projects like this bring us back down to a really human scale of one family, one neighbor and local organizations. It’s a reminder that we still can make a really big difference in the lives of individuals in our immediate community.”

While President Donald Trump scrapped free entry to National Parks on MLK Day, adding his own birthday to the calendar, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Friday that visitors can enjoy free entry at more than 200 of California’s state parks for MLK Day.

“Dr. King’s legacy deserves to be honored, not erased,” Newsom said in a statement. “I’m encouraging all Californians to get outside on MLK Day, spend time in nature, reflect on Dr. King’s legacy, and reaffirm our commitment to advancing civil rights for all.”

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:11.862244

“Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting?","Advances Election Integrity Investigation with Legal Action

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia to compel the release of public records showing whether, and to what extent, it is guarding against voting by illegal aliens. The suit, filed in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on January 16, stems from the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles’ (DC DMV) failure to respond to FAIR’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on November 12, 2025.

This legal action is a direct follow-up to FAIR’s ongoing investigation, launched in November 2025, into jurisdictions with policies that pose a high risk of facilitating voting by illegal aliens. To date, the investigation has focused on states like California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington—all of which engage in automatic voter registration, universal mail-in voting, and the issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. FAIR’s investigation seeks to determine whether adequate measures are in place in these jurisdictions to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote, and to ensure compliance with federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and the REAL ID Act.

FAIR’s FOIA request to the DC DMV specifically sought records, policies, and communications detailing how the agency distinguishes between U.S. citizens and noncitizens during voter registration processes, verifies citizenship status before transmitting data to election officials, and handles data from non-REAL ID-compliant credential holders. Since FAIR submitted its request in early November 2025, the DC DMV has provided no substantive response, determination, or records—an egregious violation of DC FOIA’s mandatory timelines.

“American citizens deserve confidence that their elections are secure and free from interference by those who are not eligible to vote,” said Dale Wilcox, FAIR’s Executive Director and General Counsel. “The District of Columbia’s refusal to provide these basic records raises serious questions about whether safeguards exist to protect election integrity. FAIR is committed to holding governments accountable and ensuring transparency in how voter rolls are managed, especially in jurisdictions with policies that invite abuse.”

“The DC DMV’s stonewalling is unacceptable and undermines public trust in our democratic processes,” added Mateo Forero, FAIR’s Director of Investigations and counsel of record in the case. “Our investigation is about uncovering the truth: Are these agencies doing enough to prevent illegal aliens from voting? By forcing the release of these documents through litigation, we aim to expose any vulnerabilities and push for reforms that prioritize lawful participation in elections.”

That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”","Bruce Springsteen denounced the Trump administration’s deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in cities across the United States and dedicated a song to Renee Good, the woman recently killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, at a surprise performance in New Jersey on Saturday.

Appearing at the Light of Day Winterfest in Red Bank, N.J., Mr. Springsteen told the crowd: “We are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years is being tested as it has never been in modern times,” according to videos that circulated online.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?
Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney.","An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, on Jan. 7 when she attempted to drive away as agents tried to get her out of her vehicle. Two days later during a vehicle stop in Portland, Oregon, a Border Patrol agent shot and wounded two Venezuelans. One of them, Luis David Nino-Moncada, recently pleaded not guilty of aggravated assault against a federal officer and damaging federal property.

Soon after, protests erupted across the country in both blue states such as California and New York and red states like Texas — which saw large demonstrations in Houston, Austin, Dallas and other cities.

Trump, who made mass deportations a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, reiterated his administration's commitment to the policy in a press release on Wednesday, linking higher deportations to lower housing costs, higher wages and lower crime.

During his second term, Trump has shifted the government's focus from border enforcement to arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants from the nation's interior. Daily ICE arrests in Texas have jumped from an average of 85 per day during the final 18 months of the Biden Administration to 176 per day in the first six months under Trump, according to a Tribune analysis.

Undocumented immigrants in Texas have reported staying home as much as possible to avoid being targeted by immigration officers or police.

Meanwhile, ICE facilities in Texas and elsewhere have been targeted: In September, a 29-year-old man fired on an immigration enforcement office in Dallas, killing two detainees and wounding another. Just a few months earlier, a group of nearly a dozen people attacked a detention center in Alvaro with tactical gear and weapons, injuring a local law enforcement officer.

Here's what to know about how ICE is operating in Texas and what rights people have when approached by an agent.

How is ICE arresting people in Texas?

The most high-profile operations are street raids, where ICE agents, often accompanied by state troopers and local police, target a particular area or business and arrest groups of undocumented immigrants.

Some of the biggest raids have taken place in and around Houston: In May, ICE said it deported more than 500 people and arrested more than 400 suspected undocumented immigrants in and around the city in roughly one week. In October, ICE carried out another massive operation in Houston over the course of 10 days, in which they said they arrested more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.

ICE has focused mainly on the state's large urban areas, but earlier this year, according to Border Report, the head of the South Texas Builders Association said agents have been raiding construction sites along the border.

But the most common way ICE agents track down undocumented immigrants is through the local criminal justice system. Immigration agents can request that jails hold an undocumented person who has been jailed, then turn them over to ICE for deportation. The Harris County Jail leads the country for such immigration holds, also known as ICE detainers, according to a Tribune analysis.

ICE is also increasingly targeting immigrants when they arrive for court hearings or routine immigration appointments; ICE agents have arrested people at federal buildings in El Paso, immigration courts in San Antonio and probation offices in Dallas.

How and why does ICE work with local police departments?

Early in Trump's second administration, Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to support federal immigration enforcement operations in tracking down and deporting undocumented immigrants.

Some sheriffs in Texas have signed agreements to work closely with ICE to enforce immigration laws. A new state law passed in last year's legislative session requires sheriffs in all counties with a jail to enter into such agreements, also known as the 287(g) program, this year. Since Trump returned to the White House, more than half of ICE arrests in Texas have come from local jails, according to the Tribune analysis.

Even in Democrat-run Texas cities like Austin and San Antonio, where local leaders in the past have stated their police won't cooperate with immigration officers, the state requires local police departments to support ICE operations — a policy adopted by other states like Florida and Louisiana.

According to KUT, the Austin Police Department on Thursday announced that officers have ""general orders"" to work alongside federal immigration officers to execute immigration warrants. In March, Houston police were instructed to call federal immigration authorities if they come across a person who has deportation orders in the national crime database.

Are any places off limits to ICE agents?

The Trump administration, early in his second term, rescinded federal policies that limited arrests of immigrants in sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals.

But to enter private spaces such as homes and businesses, immigration agents and police still need a warrant signed by a judge to enter.

If ICE agents approach you in public, what are your rights?

Anyone confronted by an ICE agent has the right to remain silent and if the person is detained, they have the right to an attorney. If an agent doesn't have a signed warrant, people have the right to refuse them entry into their home and the right to refuse searches, regardless of their citizenship status. Agents have the right to pat a person down to check for weapons.

The American Civil Liberties Union advises people to stay calm and not resist or obstruct the agents. They also advise people not to lie to agents or give them fake documents.

They recommend that people memorize phone numbers of their family members and friends, and their lawyer. If they take medication, have a plan for another person to give those medications to agents if they are arrested.",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/19082548/0401-ICE-Raid-Minor-EG-26-1500x1001.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:12.088434

President

Arab American Institute

How did we get to the point where the president can say and do things that put our culture and democracy at risk, and it’s just shrugged off as if it were normal?

In social media posts and unscripted press comments he uses language that would have been unimaginable coming from a president in any other period of American history. In just the past few months, Mr. Trump: was photographed making an obscene gesture and mouthing a vulgarity at a demonstrator; demeaned a popular TV personality who had just been murdered; called a Somali American member of Congress garbage, adding that all Somalis were garbage; called the Governor of Minnesota “retarded,” an especially hurtful slur as that governor has a son with a disability; and insulted women reporters who asked him challenging questions, calling them “ugly,” “obnoxious,” and “stupid.”

Parents wouldn’t tolerate this from their children and yet here we have a president of the United States demeaning his office by speaking in such a deplorable manner.

It’s not just the president’s speech that has been so “unpresidential.” Mr. Trump’s need to gratify his ego has led him to make exaggerated false claims about his grievances and his successes. He claims that he has been attacked by media, Congress, and law enforcement agencies like no other president in history. At the same time, he boasts that he has improved the economy and made our cities safer than they have ever been. None of this is true.

In an effort to impose his will and worldview, he has surrounded himself with White House staff and Cabinet that not only heap praise upon him and carry out his every whim, but also support his efforts to silence and intimidate those whom he has denounced as critics.

Herein lies a fundamental difference between President Trump’s first and second terms. In the former, some senior members of his staff and Cabinet served as a check on his behavior. Many were fired and replaced. He began his second term with a detailed plan to transform government, and with a more compliant senior leadership (e.g., the Department of Justice and FBI are willing to order investigations of his critics).

This combination of unchecked power, the president’s need to have his every ambition fulfilled, and his disrespect for law and precedent has led to actions that are illegal. In the first few months, his administration put in place a program to remove over 300,000 government employees. He shuttered USAID, the Voice of America, and the US Institute for Peace—all illegal actions as these were congressionally created and funded entities. He later reopened the Institute for Peace as the Trump Institute for Peace; renamed the nation’s premier center for the arts The Donald J Trump, The John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts without any authorization; and had the White House’s East Wing torn down to be replaced by another vanity project—a massive ballroom—which no doubt will also bear his name in the near future.

Conceivably the most dangerous of President Trump’s moves have been the dramatic expansion of ICE—the immigration enforcement entity—and its unleashing in US cities, posing a direct threat to American democracy.

In recent weeks Mr. Trump sent a massive contingent of ICE agents to Minneapolis, Minnesota ostensibly to root out illegal immigrants, while attempting to embarrass that state’s Democratic governor and to target one of Mr. Trump’s new favorites, Minnesota’s large Somali community. As expected, ICE’s arrests have been indiscriminate, detaining many legal residents and citizens, and their behavior unacceptably brutal. As seen in other cities, ICE behaviors have provoked widespread protests. In one horrifying incident, a member of an observer team monitoring ICE behavior was shot and killed through an open car window by an ICE agent.

The shooting was filmed from multiple angles, establishing that the victim posed no threat to the ICE agent. That didn’t stop the president and other administration officials from propagating a lie about what had transpired. They called the murdered woman a domestic terrorist, saying she’d threatened the life of the ICE shooter. Unwrapping this murder is instructive on many levels.

First, with the enormous budget appropriated for ICE expansion, that entity now has over 10,000 armed agents. The rapidity of its growth has led to inadequate vetting and training. More dangerous still is how ICE has recruited agents: at gun shows and right-wing events, and targeted advertisements on right-wing radio shows. The White House appears to be forming an ideologically cohesive national police force that is anti-immigrant and violence-prone and has been told by the administration that they can act with impunity.

This incident also points out the extent to which the White House is capable of fabricating a storyline that will be echoed by other leaders and their supportive media outlets. The impact is clear. A recent poll showed that, by a wide margin, most Americans believe that the woman’s killing was wrong, but more than three-quarters of Republicans believe the president’s narrative that the murdered woman was a threat to the ICE agent and her killing was justified.

So, how did we get to this point? The answer is clear. A president who says whatever he needs to say to justify his position, officials around him and a supportive media who vociferously agree with him and threaten those who disagree, and a cult-like movement of partisans who will believe what they are told even when the facts speak to a different reality.

… [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.” The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced.
Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman.
In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents.
Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.","It was more than five years ago, but Democrats are still hurting from self-inflicted wounds caused by the slogan “Defund the Police.”

The right-wing media’s echo chamber keeps bellowing those words with delight. They aim to make all Democrats look like they foolishly want to open the door to criminals. Now, Trump-approved media has a new siren call: “Abolish ICE.” They want any whisper of those words to become a weight to sink Democratic candidates and blunt what is widely forecast to be a blue wave in November.

Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington, is warning about the political trap being set for Democrats: “The impulse is emotional. The slogan is simple. But politically, it is lethal,” cautions a recent memo. “Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want. … [The] smarter approach: abolish abuses, not ICE.”

The memo added: “Immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. And they can be enforced in ways that protect public safety…[voters] understand this. They responded strongly to what they saw as a lack of enforcement under President Biden. But they are also recoiling from Trump’s excessive force.”

Slogans aside, there are legitimate calls for Americans to take bold action. Outrage is widespread at ICE agents killing Renee Good, an unarmed Minnesota woman. At the White House, the press secretary publicly asked a reporter why Good died. “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably,” came the reply.

Under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE has undergone massive expansion — with funding now rivaling or exceeding that of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, making it one of the most heavily funded federal law enforcement forces in the country.

How did an immigration enforcement unit become the largest police force in the U.S.? The sad answer is that President Trump is using ICE’s growing presence in America’s cities to normalize the presence of armed federal agents on any street corner. Last week, he threatened to use the Insurrection Act to supplement ICE’s threatening presence with the U.S. military.

The president’s goal is to scare people into silence to halt rising dissent.

In response, Democrats on Capitol Hill need to support mayors and governors calling for an end to mass deployments of ICE agents. Local officials are plainly saying that these agents are making communities less safe.

What can congressional Democrats do about it?

Here is a to-do list.

First, impose congressional oversight.

Second, call Noem to the hearings and enlist Republicans to consider impeaching her if she does not reduce the budget and the size of this paramilitary force.

Third, call Vice President JD Vance to public hearings. Force him to defend his reckless political claim that ICE agents enjoy “absolute immunity” in a case where they kill a civilian.

Vance has a law degree and knows better. This is not a matter of “qualified immunity.” That doctrine protects state and local police from civil lawsuits for errors made as they properly protect the public.

Even with “qualified immunity,” it is important to codify its ICE limits and clear the way to apply accountability for egregious abuse of the public trust by armed agents of a democratic government.

The second Trump administration is barely a year old. He is ignoring legal limitations by unilaterally deciding to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to grab the country’s leader. Even before that act, he defied Congress by using U.S. military missile strikes to kill Venezuelan boat passengers he claimed were drug traffickers. That was way beyond appropriate action, including arrests and boat seizure, normally taken by the coast guard and customs officials.

Don’t forget that Trump’s officials have yet to offer evidence that the people on those bombed boats were drug dealers.

Now this imperious use of force by a president’s administration has come to the homeland, and an American woman lies dead at the hands of ICE.

This cannot go unanswered by Democrats in Congress.

They are in the minority in both the House and Senate. But Democrats have to reach for leverage, including using the threat of a government shutdown to express their outrage at the bloodshed in Minnesota.

Democrats will have a leverage point in two weeks, when the government runs out of funding.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was right to allow an end to last year’s budget shutdown and to let Republicans hang themselves by ending ObamaCare subsidies that gave health care to millions.

A shutdown is still a dubious idea. But murder by a federal agent demands a response.

As we approach the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States this year, the words of our second president, John Adams, ing with renewed urgency:

“Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Trump recently said the only limit on his power is “my morality.” Is that the explanation for his administration’s refusal to hold to the Constitution?

George Conway, the conservative lawyer now running for Congress in New York as a Democrat, put it bluntly: “The President of the United States is a criminal… He has no loyalty to the law or to the Constitution.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26016127809169.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:07.178946

But the killing of Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer, as well as the regular, often violent confrontations that ICE stages on US streets, show so much that is unravelling in plain sight. The rule of law, the freedom to protest, and even the right to walk or drive in the streets safely without being assaulted by the state, seems to exist no longer in the towns and cities where ICE has made its presence felt. The most disturbing aspect of all this is how quickly it has happened. But for a government agency such as ICE to become the powerful paramilitary force that it is, several factors need to be in play first. Only one of them is Donald Trump.

ICE may look as if it came out of nowhere, but the sort of authoritarianism that results in these crackdowns never does. It takes shape slowly, in plain sight, in a way that is clearly traceable over time. First, there needs to be a merging of immigration and security concerns, both institutionally and in the political culture. Established in the wake of 9/11, ICE was part of a government restructuring under President George W Bush. It was granted a large budget, wide investigative powers and a partnership with the FBI’s joint terrorism taskforce. The work of enforcing immigration law became inextricably linked to the business of keeping Americans safe after the largest attack on US soil. That then extended into a wider emphasis, under Barack Obama, beyond those who posed national security threats, and on to immigrants apprehended at the border, gang members and non-citizens convicted of felonies or misdemeanours.

The dragnet became wider, the budgets became bigger, and due process started to wither. Trump then grew ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country, with a budget surpassing most of the world’s militaries. And he imbued the agency with a supreme mandate of saving the US from existential threat, a sort of praetorian guard vested with his executive power.

To get where the US is today, you also need an unhinged rightwing media to do the work of scaremongering and priming the public, relentlessly banging the drum on illegal immigration and the threat of demographic overwhelm. And, relatedly, of course, the US immigration crackdowns are sustained by a culture of plain old racism. One that hides behind concerns for public safety, but is in fact a way to channel discontent about the reality of a country that is far less white than many would like.

Next up is a long history and engrained culture of military supremacy. The scenes of ICE officers entering neighbourhoods, heavily armed, looked almost indistinguishable from scenes of US soldiers abroad. So much of the mythology of the American soldier, who has infinite mandate to use violence overseas in defence of freedom and American values, can be seen in the propaganda around ICE. The merging of military and policing functions can be seen in the absurd arsenals of domestic police forces, with their drones, weapons, explosives, armoured personnel carriers and masked faces. And it can be seen in the personnel who move between overseas and domestic forces. The New York Times has reported that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good, served in Iraq.

I have been thinking about what it was about the ICE phenomenon that felt chillingly familiar to someone who grew up under repressive regimes. It wasn’t the deployment of huge numbers of forces, nor was it even the violence. It was the sense that anything could happen to anyone, not just those expressly identified as the legitimate targets of crackdown. The abiding experience of living with authoritarianism is the sense not of imminent assault, but of the constant possibility that suddenly, you could be in trouble. At a traffic incident where the officer didn’t like your tone, at a gathering that was deemed to violate a curfew and then forcibly dismantled, or even on social media where a mindless post could affect your ability to leave the country. It is a state of effacement of all civil rights, and a swelling of government into a volatile, capricious overlord, as safe or scary as the single enforcer in front of you who happens to be vested with its power.

The US has passed through that veil. But there are warning signs in the UK. The relentless portrayal of immigrants as a threat to safety and social cohesion. The same glamorisation of the imagery of crackdown, now a feature of government propaganda as ministers attend Home Office immigration raids. The same expansion of powers and discretion to the police to include ever wider definitions of what a public order infraction is, such as factoring in the “cumulative impact” of pro-Palestine rallies. The transformation of protest into dissidence. The empowerment of the UK Border Force, which now has the right to seize someone’s mobile phone even when they are not under arrest.

A group of protesters interrupted Sunday morning services at a St. Paul church because one of the pastors works with a federal immigration agency, according to police.

At approximately 10:40 a.m., officers were called to the Cities Church in the 1500 block of Summit Avenue after receiving reports that some 30 to 40 protesters had interrupted services, according to police spokesperson Nikki Muehlhausen.

By the time officers arrived, the group had left and was walking down the alley, she said.

In a Facebook post, protesters said they went to the church to ask for justice for Renee Good because they had identified a church pastor as the acting director for the St. Paul field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The church’s website lists David Easterwood as a pastor. Easterwood is listed as a defendant in a Jan. 12 lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota to halt the federal immigration crackdown that led to the fatal Jan. 7 confrontation between Good and an ICE agent. He also defended ICE tactics in an earlier filing on Jan. 5.

DOJ investigation

Later Sunday, Trump administration officials condemned the protest at the St. Paul church, which is is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, a conservative Protestant denomination headquartered in Nashville, Tenn.

The U.S. Department of Justice said it is investigating. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations “by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.”

“A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!” she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents’ actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

“When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,” said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. “If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.”

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood’s personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

Easterwood’s earlier statements

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE’s tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents “knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.”

“Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. “They’re going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.”

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ’s prosecution was misguided.

“If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?” Cullars-Doty said. “We can’t sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.”",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STP-L-CHURCH-0119.jpg?w=1024&h=567,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:15.838709

Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.
The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.
Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics.
Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond.","The arrival of thousands of federal immigration agents has altered life in Minneapolis and St. Paul in ways large and small, including in the corridors of hospitals serving the Twin Cities.

The sheer presence of the agents, sometimes in uniform, sometimes in plainclothes, has been enough to unnerve health care workers, who were already straining under conditions some have compared with those of the coronavirus pandemic.

In interviews, nurses, doctors and other health care workers said the crisis conditions brought on by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown are wearing down overworked and understaffed medical institutions, and deteriorating patients’ trust in what are supposed to be safe havens.

“Any medical center or hospital is supposed to be a place of healing,” said Dr. Brian Muthyala, a physician at the hospital systems Hennepin Healthcare and M Health Fairview. “It is a place where people go when they are at their most vulnerable, when they are hurt or scared or in need of care, and any presence that disrupts that environment is harmful.”

Officials with the Homeland Security Department said that they do not conduct operations in hospitals. “We go in if there is an active danger to public safety,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman.

Health care workers, however, describe a different reality, saying agents have broken hospital protocol, refused to provide documentation and, in some cases, gotten into shouting matches with doctors and nurses.

Over his 20 years as an emergency medicine physician, Dr. Robert LeFevere said, he had encountered law enforcement officers coming in with shooting victims and other patients.

“But federal agents barging into patient care areas trying to question or detain patients — I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Dr. LeFevere, who works at Regions Hospital, a few blocks from the State Capitol in St. Paul.

Health officials for three of the state’s major health systems, which oversee medical centers and clinics where agents have been spotted, declined to comment on federal activity in their hospitals, but stressed that they do not help enforce immigration laws and that federal officers are expected to follow the law and medical facilities’ safety protocols.

Federal immigration officers, like all law enforcement agents, are allowed to enter hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions if they are accompanying a patient in their custody and cannot be restricted from accessing public areas. But hospital officials said they do not allow immigration officers into private spaces, such as patient rooms and care units, without judicial warrants and that security officers escort them and limit their searches to the terms of those warrants.

“To be clear: We do not allow ICE to circulate in our facilities,” said Aimée Jordan, a spokeswoman with Fairview Health Services and M Health Fairview, which oversees about 10 hospitals in Minnesota. “Our clinics and hospitals remain places where people can seek care without fear. Even in uncertain times — especially in uncertain times — that commitment does not change.”

One health official said that over the past week, agents had brought in about two dozen patients to M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is the closest medical center to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a multiagency facility that includes a holding area for immigrant detainees. Whipple, located near the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, has become a key spot for clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss patient care, described witnessing a confrontation between health care workers and federal agents last weekend that devolved into a screaming match in a hallway at Hennepin Healthcare System in Minneapolis.

A crowd of nurses and physicians, many in scrubs and medical gear, tried to stop the agents from shackling a severely injured man to his bedside, they said. Acquaintances in the patient’s neighborhood said they knew little about the man, except that he was a roofer and did not have family in the United States.

Hennepin County lawyers have filed a legal petition on behalf of the patient contesting his confinement by ICE, according to documents filed in a Federal District Court in Minnesota. Jeanette Boerner, the director of Adult Representation Services at Hennepin County, declined to comment on the specifics of the pending litigation.

D.H.S. officials and a lawyer representing the agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the episode or the man’s immigration case. Homeland security officials have until Tuesday to respond to the man’s legal petition.

The patient remains in the hospital, and agents have been rotating in and out of the facility as they keep watch at his side, according to three health care workers who asked not to be named because they did not have permission from their employer to speak on the issue.

About 10 miles to the east, in St. Paul, Dr. LeFevere said there had been at least two instances at Regions Hospital when federal agents entered the emergency department, once through the ambulance bay and another through a back entrance reserved for law enforcement.

In both cases, it appeared that the agents had been trailing people with whom they had interacted with on the streets, but the individuals were not in their custody, Dr. LeFevere said. The agents became argumentative when health care workers requested to see their warrants, but they eventually left the hospital, he said.

Dr. Loren Cobb, a psychiatry resident physician at the University of Minnesota and M Health Fairview, said she has been receiving texts and emails alerting health care workers that federal agents have been attempting to enter facilities on their grounds, including a children’s hospital. In at least one instance, the agents entered with someone in their custody, but in another, they were searching for a patient, she said. Staff and health teams have been reminded to follow proper hospital protocols, including not give away patient information.

“I am just worried it is going to escalate even more,” she said, adding that sometimes it is only herself and a handful of doctors on staff who are responsible for overseeing entire floors. “What happens if they inappropriately try to push forward? What comes next?”

Jeffrey Lunde, who serves as a Hennepin County commissioner and chairman of the hospital board of the Hennepin Healthcare System, said there were recent instances at Hennepin Healthcare in which hospital staff had asked federal agents to produce documentation as to why they were present in a private area or in a patient’s private room. Agents were not able to provide it.

“And that is where things get murky and difficult,” he said.

Nurses, doctors and other health care professionals across the Twin Cities had prepared for precisely such situations as they watched immigration crackdowns unfold in other cities over the past six months.

Jamey Sharp, a health care worker who is also a community organizer with the nonprofit Unidos MN, said his organization had trained more than 300 health care workers since March on patient privacy and knowing their rights. The group, which advocates social justice, said it had also helped to connect health care workers through Signal chat groups in hopes of tracking the activity of federal agents inside their facilities and ensure that rules were being followed.

But the reality has gone beyond the scope of their training. Many said they have been shocked, both by the actions of agents inside their hospitals, as well as the injuries that have required treatment as a result of confrontations on the streets. Some health care workers are holding news conferences to denounce the tactics. Dozens flooded a Hennepin Healthcare board meeting this month demanding that local officials provide stronger oversight in their facilities.

Health officials say they are limited in how they can respond. Though hospital staff are obligated to protect the rights of their patients, federal officers can argue that the people they are monitoring or questioning inside hospitals are a danger to society. Who prevails in that back and forth has largely been untested in the courts.

The tension is unfolding at the same time that Homeland Security Department officials are also reviewing the citizenship and legal status of staff at some area hospitals and across the country.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt/18nat-minn-hospitals1-bgqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:58:29.056374

Speaking to Fox News on Sunday night, Blanche said the civil rights unit of the Justice Department would not bow to pressure to investigate the shooting death of Minneapolis resident and mother Good, 37, earlier this month.

“We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody,” said Blanche. “We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate.”

“So, no, we are not investigating. And if there comes a time when we need to, we will, but it’s not now,” Blanche added.

Increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers have erupted in Minneapolis since Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot behind the wheel of her car while protesting by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.

Blanche also said that footage of Good’s death has already “been reviewed by millions and millions of Americans because it was recorded on phones when it happened”.

However, analysis conducted by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) and APM Reports found that there still remain questions about the shooting, including why it allegedly took more than 10 minutes after Good was shot before she was given CPR.

According to the MPR and APM reports, ICE agents left Good “bleeding and alone in the car for almost three minutes” and “turned away a man identifying himself as a physician who offered to help”.

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that Ross, the ICE agent who shot Good up to four times, was acting in self-defence.

Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and White House adviser Stephen Miller, have also said that ICE officers have “absolute immunity” for their immigration enforcement actions.

Meanwhile, lawyers representing Good’s family said last week that they have launched their own “civil investigation” into her death.

“People in Minneapolis and across this country truly, truly care about what happened to Renee Good on January 7, 2026, and are committed to understanding how she could have been killed on the street after dropping her child off at school,” lawyer Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.

Top Minnesota Democrats under investigation

Blanche also separately confirmed reports that the DOJ has launched an investigation into Minnesota Governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as well as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, alleging the two Democratic leaders were “encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE”.

Blanche’s comments are the first time a member of the Trump administration has confirmed media reports that Walz and Frey are under investigation.

“No matter who you are, whether you’re a governor, a mayor or somebody out there on the streets assaulting ice, you cannot, under federal law, you cannot impede a federal officer doing their job, and that’s what we’re looking at,” said Blanche.

Responding to earlier media reports that the DOJ had launched its probe, Frey said he would “not be intimidated”.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey said in a post on X.

Walz, meanwhile, responded to the reports indirectly, saying in a statement: “Weaponising the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ap_696da9a40bdaa-1768794532.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:35.484365

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic.","Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan is about twenty paces wide, curb to curb. Front Street, the main business street in Nome, Alaska, about four thousand air miles to the northwest, is two paces narrower but feels just as wide. Usually, there aren’t a lot of cars or pedestrians on Front Street, and the buildings that line it, none of them tall, seem to lean back from it. More dust and sand and rain and snow blow down Front Street than vehicles drive on it. Standing in line in the cheery post office on West Front, Nome-ites talk and laugh and exchange news. On days when the sand is blowing, some have goggles hanging from their necks or pushed up on their foreheads.

Nome’s sand contains gold, and other minerals. The iron in it will turn white cars a dingy yellow over time. During drier periods, small sand ripples form in corners along the streets, like sand on the bottom of a lake. Since the discovery of gold here, in 1898, billions of dollars have been taken out of Nome’s beach and from the bottom of the Bering Sea, just offshore. With gold at more than four thousand dollars an ounce, the gold dredges move constantly back and forth on the water on calm days in early fall. Ungainly with their beams and pipes, the dredges look like tufts of Rust Belt infrastructure that have blown loose and drifted westward and finally tumbled onto this distant sea. Rainy days turn the sand and dust on Nome’s streets into a thin grayish silt. This is what a place looks like when its streets are paved with gold.

The city of thirty-seven hundred residents is almost as far west as you can go in North America. Front Street parallels the sea, whose storms and giant blocks of ice have sometimes beaten the business district flat. Gold’s current valuation is just one of many international factors to keep in mind here. The Russia-U.S. border, which follows the International Date Line, is less than a hundred and fifty miles away. Provideniya, a Russian town with a formerly large military base, is two hundred and thirty miles from Nome. Cruise ships from Europe that have travelled the Northeast Passage route over the top of the planet stop in Nome, as do ships that have followed the Northwest Passage across northernmost North America.

Along the Alaskan coastline, it’s about a hundred and ten miles from Nome to Wales, the continent’s westernmost point. From Wales, it’s twenty-five miles to the Russian island of Big Diomede, and fifty-two miles to the coast of Chukotka, as that easternmost district of Russia is called.

Starting in 1999, I used to come to Nome to do research on a book I was writing about Siberia. I wanted to go from Nome to Russia, a goal that involved complications and extra trips on this side. One morning, in a Nome café called Fat Freddie’s, I met Jim Stimpfle, Nome’s most famous citizen, a man of grand ideas. The card he gave me listed him as a director of the Interhemispheric Bering Strait Tunnel & Railroad Group, whose intention was to dig a tunnel from near Wales to the “Chukotka Nose,” the very tip of Russia and of Asia, and to build a railroad that would go up the coast of North America, pass through the tunnel (“Just forty-one miles longer than the Chunnel!” Stimpfle said), and connect to another yet-to-be-constructed railroad, in Russia.

Stimpfle became famous in this way: His father was a dentist in Washington, D.C., with patients and friends in the diplomatic corps. Stimpfle wanted to be a diplomat himself, but after he graduated from George Mason University, in 1970, he ended up in Alaska, where eventually he married a Native woman, Yaayuk Bernadette Alvanna, whose family came from King Island, which is off the coast north of Nome. He became a real-estate agent; he says he has been inside almost every building in Nome. Through his wife, he learned that Natives on this side—the Yupik and the Inupiat—remembered relatives on the Russian side whom they hadn’t seen since J. Edgar Hoover and the Soviet government shut down cross-border travel and communication, in 1948, creating what became known as the Ice Curtain.

In the nineteen-eighties, Stimpfle decided to devote his spare time and energies to breaching that curtain, reëstablishing Russian-American connections, and reuniting Native relatives. By September, 1987, his efforts to restart travel back and forth had got the attention of Alaska Airlines and Exploration Cruise Lines. The Wall Street Journal did a front-page article about this lesser-known border, and quoted Stimpfle. After that piece, more reporters wrote about him. They said that Jim Stimpfle, a local real-estate agent and a private citizen in Nome, was working to end the Cold War.

At the Alaska Aviation Museum, near the airport in Anchorage, a Boeing 737 with the logo of Alaska Airlines on its sides and the company’s emblem of a smiling, parka-wearing Native man on its tail sits with other mothballed airplanes outside a hangar. A plaque beside it reads “Historic Flights to Russian Far East: Friendship Flight, Nome-Provideniya; June 13, 1988.” On that day, Stimpfle and seventy-nine other officials, reporters, and ordinary Alaskans, including thirty Native people, flew in this plane for an inaugural visit.

Photos of the delegation show Stimpfle on board among other smiling folks leaning over the seat backs and talking and standing in the aisle. He had coined the term “Friendship Flight,” and as the president of the Nome Chamber of Commerce had been agitating for the idea tirelessly. Mead Treadwell, at the time a young Yale graduate who had already been involved in Alaskan politics for a decade, remembers Frank Murkowski, then a U.S. senator, saying to him, “Mead, I’ve been getting Stimpfle’s faxes every day for a year and a half.” Murkowski was just one of dozens of officials whom Stimpfle besieged.

After the Friendship Flight took off from Nome, it flew for about forty-five minutes and landed on the gravel runway at Provideniya’s airport. The cabin door opened, uniformed Russian officialdom entered, and a pattern began that would be repeated many times—the checking of documents, the standing in line, the triple-thump of passport stamping, the boarding onto not-new buses, the arrival at a dim official hall, the salty snacks, the sit-down banquets, the ryumki (shot glasses) standing in rows, the toasts being raised bezkonechno (without end), the mutual incomprehension, the unmoored good cheer.

I went up the boarding stairs to the plane and stepped into its open door. The passenger seats had been removed and benches installed along the walls. When you’re an airline passenger, knee to spine with your neighbors, you forget that what you’re in is just a big tube. The almost empty piece of aluminum echoed and creaked.

Stimpfle still lives in Nome and is still its most famous citizen. I went there in September, and he was the first person I called. Fat Freddie’s has closed, and Stimpfle now patronizes the Polar Cub Café, where he sits with friends at the same table almost every morning. Just beyond the café’s broad windows, the waves of the Bering Sea batter the granite riprap frontage. One morning, Stimpfle joined me at a corner table. I’d last seen him twenty-four years ago, an interval that has slowed us both. He wore a brown knit cap with a bill, a zippered jacket, loose knee-length blue shorts over gray sweatpants, and black running shoes. He is tall and strong-looking, and his blue eyes, which used to spark behind his spectacles and sharp nose, have grown mellow.

Looking across the expanse of sea, he talked about his first attempts to contact somebody—anybody—on the Russian side. He began by filling balloons with air or with exhaust from his car and writing messages on the balloons themselves. Then, on a strong east wind one day, he released a weather balloon that he had filled with helium. Attached was a capsule containing small gifts—tobacco, sugar, tea, and sewing supplies—and a message of friendship which a schoolteacher in Nome had translated into Russian. Stimpfle watched the balloon rise and move offshore. Then the balloon began to descend, landed on the sea, and bounced along the surface. A seal hunter who happened to be passing by saw it and took it into his boat. He opened the capsule, saw the notes in Cyrillic, and thought the balloon must have come from Russia.

By following the boat along the coast, Stimpfle tracked down the hunter, Tim Gologergen, and explained about the balloon. Soon afterward, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research ship, the Surveyor, docked in Nome. Its captain had received an invitation from the mayor of Provideniya, Oleg Kulinkin, to bring his ship to its harbor for a brief visit—something that had not happened in sixty years. Stimpfle gave the Surveyor’s captain a message to pass to Kulinkin. The captain did, and when the ship returned to Nome he brought a message from Kulinkin to Stimpfle. That was the first success Stimpfle had in reaching someone across the strait. When the Friendship Flight went to Provideniya, a year later, he met the mayor in person. Tim Gologergen was on the flight, too, and found relatives in town, to whom he spoke in Yupik.

Stimpfle added, “I heard that Kulinkin was later murdered by the Russian mafia in the Russian Far East city of Magadan, in a hotel where I had stayed myself.”

In 1991, Alaska Airlines began regular service to Magadan and Khabarovsk, a city well into Russia, on the Amur River. For a while, the Russian Far East seemed like an extension of North America’s West Coast. Aeroflot began to fly into Seattle and Anchorage. Once, in the mid-nineties, in the Seattle airport, when I was on my way from Montana to Los Angeles, I talked to a man from Orlando, Florida, who said he worked for a Saudi-owned oil company at a site on Sakhalin Island where he oversaw an operation involving supertankers and pipelines and underwater infrastructure maintained by teams of scuba divers, who also brought up delicious crabs that he ate. He said the fishing there was excellent, even right offshore. He then got in line for his Aeroflot flight to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, boarding on the same concourse as my flight to L.A.

Trans-strait connections multiplied. In the fall of 1988, a pod of gray whales became stranded in an iced-in pocket of the Beaufort Sea, off the city of Barrow, on Alaska’s North Slope, and a Soviet icebreaker arrived and opened the obstructed water and apparently freed them—they were seen no more. Between March and May, 1989, a combined expedition of Russian and U.S. sled-dog teams trekked from the city of Anadyr, in Chukotka, to the city of Kotzebue, on the Baldwin Peninsula, with an airlift from Nome for the last stretch. An Inuit Quaker evangelist named Robert Sheldon led a five-man Native expedition going in the other direction, from Alaska to Chukotka, by snowmobile. They needed a helicopter lift over the strait, which by then was no longer freezing all the way.

Provideniya and Nome agreed to declare themselves each other’s sister city. Bering Air, a prop-plane airline started in Nome by a couple from Michigan, began flights to Provideniya and Anadyr. Direct phone service was established; previously, calls from one side to the other had to go all the way around the world, via Moscow. A group of Soviet Young Pioneers visited the Nome Boy Scouts. Stores in Nome put up signs in Cyrillic and began to accept rubles from Russian tourists, who had started to come. Later, the stores were stuck with the rubles when the Russian government would not exchange them for dollars or let them be brought back into the country. The stores made gift packets of rubles and sold them as souvenirs.

A charitable group flew a Russian burn victim across the border for care in the U.S. Dancers from Provideniya performed in Nome, and there was a game between the cities’ youth basketball teams. The local paper, the Nome Nugget, reported that, with the border open, three Nome-ites had found spouses from Provideniya. The story said that the Alaskan men liked how the Russian women dressed, in skirts and high heels at ten below zero.

Hundreds of Russian students came to the University of Alaska campuses in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and exchange programs took Alaskan students to Russia. Sylvia Matson, whose ancestors were mostly Finns, had recently moved up from Sandstone, Minnesota, to join her husband, who had found a job as a mechanic at Bering Air. Not only is her husband also a Finn, but his name is also Matson—just by coincidence, because both families, when they arrived in the U.S., replaced their complicated Finnish last names with Matson, after a transoceanic shipping company. When she heard about the exchange program with Russia, she pushed to be accepted for it, even though she was a part-time student and not really qualified to apply. An exception was made, and in 1990 she and four other Alaskan students began the fall semester at the State Pedagogical Institute of Magadan, the public university in that city about twelve hundred miles west of Provideniya.

Magadan had a deadly reputation in the Stalin era, as a hub for Gulag mines where political prisoners slaved sometimes to death and produced gold and other minerals in the process. Matson arrived in September and moved in with a host family in which the father was a doctor and the mother an engineer. The entire district was rationing food, and people did not have a lot to eat. She thinks the family got extra food because she was staying with them. She ended up spending more of her time teaching than learning. Russians who speak English tend to have British accents, but as relations with the U.S. improved there was a vogue for speaking with an American accent. The students and teachers with whom Matson practiced English for many hours a day could not get enough of talking to her, and almost wore her out. They may have been surprised to learn afterward that other Americans they spoke to assumed they had learned their English in Minnesota.

With other students, she went on excursions into the forest, or taiga, saw abandoned and crumbling Gulag camps, rarely ate in the dining hall at the Pedagogical Institute (whose food was “really challenging”), and joined in the parade in early November honoring the glorious October Revolution. The school made clear that the American students were required to be a part of the event, which turned out to involve not marching but just kind of walking down Lenin Avenue to Lenin Square and buying stuff from street venders. She got the impression that the Russians who attended did not really want to be there.

In general, Matson and the other exchange students didn’t have much to do but be American. People invited them to dinner in their apartments. “There were families that asked me to come just because they wanted an American in their home,” Matson said. “It was humbling. To be treated to a lavish meal, and to have their children put on a special performance for you. And the little girls would give you their favorite doll—it was heartbreaking, and you couldn’t say no. Or they would just gaze at you and want to sit beside you on the couch. They dearly wanted to give to you because you had gifted them with your presence in their home. It was hard for me to know how to navigate that, at age twenty-four.

“When I left, in mid-December, my host family presented me with a lot of gifts, and a fur hat, and I knew there was an expectation that I invite them to visit me in Nome. But I couldn’t do that, for private reasons. I disappointed them, I know, and we did not keep in touch. Now my husband is retiring from Bering Air at the end of this year, and we’re moving back to Minnesota. We just sold our house and sent a container of our belongings on the container barge down to the Lower Forty-eight. As I was packing up and throwing out, I put aside the gifts the kids and grownups had given me in Magadan, and I’ve donated them to the historical museum here. The Russian women always said I didn’t dress up enough or use enough makeup. I still had the tin of pancake makeup they gave me. Now the museum has it, along with my students’ notes of appreciation, and the kids’ drawings, and a Russian Soviet Republic flag, and the dolls from the little girls. The museum says that at some point it will do a display about the years when Nome was in friendly contact with the Russians, and I’m glad these things will be in it.”

My own trip from Nome across the border happened in August, 1999. I flew Bering Air in a tour group consisting of two couples and me. Vladimir Bychkov, our guide, who met us in Provideniya, is a Russian Army kid from Chukotka, born when his father was stationed there. A mild and competent man, he would later become Provideniya’s mayor, occupying the same office once held by Jim Stimpfle’s first Russian contact, the apparently ill-fated Oleg Kulinkin. I had travelled a bit in western Russia by then, and Provideniya looked like other post-Soviet towns, except that large parts of it were ruins. After the Soviet Union ended, in 1991, remote places like this had been left on their own. The city’s population dropped drastically, and many of the high-rises were empty, with their windows smashed out and small waterfalls flowing down their front steps. After a few days in the town, we travelled by Army vehicle and boat to visit Native villages and stayed in fishing shacks or tents.

About a year later, the mood in the region had changed. People were talking about Roman Abramovich, the oil-and-aluminum billionaire, who was running for governor of Chukotka, mystifying everybody. Why would one of the world’s richest men want to be the governor of this abandoned, farthest-flung part of Russia? But he soon began to campaign throughout Chukotka and give money to local charities, and in December, 2000, he won the election, replacing the almost comically corrupt previous governor, Aleksandr Nazarov. Abramovich then opened new businesses in Anadyr and set about spending more of his own money on bettering the lives of local residents. He and his team rehabbed housing, repaired roads, reimbursed residents who had gone for years without receiving their salaries, brought in ships carrying food and supplies, and paid for talented kids from the region to study in Alaska. Chukotka residents hung portraits of Abramovich in their apartments the way Soviet citizens once hung portraits of Lenin.

I became friends with Ken and Tandy Wallack, whose company, Circumpolar Expeditions, had arranged my visit. They live in Anchorage, where many of Abramovich’s projects took him. The Wallacks have worked on all kinds of journeys on the other side of the strait. When an American adventurer with time and money wanted to go up the coast of Chukotka and across to the U.S. in a Native umiak, or walrus-skin boat, to show that humans could have come to North America by boat rather than on land—a kind of sub-Arctic Kon-Tiki—the Wallacks found Native people to make his boat for him and guide him. The Wallacks also helped Fiat, the Italian car company, negotiate the Russia-to-Alaska leg of a publicity trip around the world in special heavy-duty Iveco trucks, and handled logistical problems for Philippe Croizon, the French quadruple amputee and distance swimmer, when he swam between the Russian and American islands that Lynne Cox had linked in her famous cross-border swim in 1987. The Wallacks speak only English, but they have a gift for understanding the heavily accented English that different kinds of people speak, and then repeating it in English that interpreters can understand.

At the request of Abramovich, who had hired them, and whom they remember as pleasant and unassuming, they found places to stay for the hundred and fifty Chukotka high-school students he brought to Anchorage in groups of fifty at a time. The Wallacks set up visits to public schools, trips to McDonald’s, and other American activities. “For some reason, Abramovich wanted them all to go bowling,” Tandy Wallack said. “So we found a bowling alley for them and got them started—none of them had ever bowled—and they bowled.” The oligarch came and went in his private jet and kept a spare jet in Anchorage in case another might be needed at short notice.

In 2008, for reasons as opaque as his intentions in taking on the role, Abramovich resigned his governorship and went elsewhere in his extremely complicated and tiring-to-think-about billionaire’s world. The charities he set up for the people of Chukotka continued to exist, supposedly, but the interlude of benign mega-capitalist visitation in this part of the world was over.

“It all just kind of petered out,” Jim Stimpfle told me, in the Polar Cub Café. “The time of druzhba [friendship] across the border just ended. I went back to real estate full time. My wife had got tired of my spending so much effort with all this Russia business. And there was all the corruption, and the shakedowns, especially the landing fees that the Russian airports kept jacking up for Alaska Airlines and Bering Air, who both finally had to stop flying over there.” Alaska Airlines ended all its flights to the Russian Far East in 1998. Bering Air continued to operate an occasional charter flight until service to Russia entirely stopped with the war.

Part of the problem was that most people in the Russian Far East remained too poor to come to the U.S. or trade across the border in any meaningful way. Russia also began to be perceived as too dangerous. There were stories of American sailors beaten and robbed in Anadyr, of Japanese nature-documentary crews arrested and then released only after all their equipment had been confiscated. On one of the Wallacks’ trips to Chukotka, in the twenty-tens, when they were helping to make a documentary about an Alaska Native’s search for her relatives, authorities in the village of Lavrentiya detained them and their crew for having forgotten some paperwork. One by one, the Americans had to appear before a judge, plead guilty, and pay a fine. Some of the Native people of Chukotka, for their part, had grown tired of the stream of evangelists from North America. A Canadian preacher made a video of Natives screaming and crying and throwing themselves on the floor during a come-to-Jesus moment that he had brought about. Other Natives found the video demeaning when it was circulated. A few neighborly gestures still occurred—in the winter of 2012, Nome almost ran out of heating oil, and a Russian tanker arrived in mid-January to resupply the city. But after Russia’s seizure of Crimea, in 2014, remaining civilian communication across the strait began to shut down, and it dwindled to nothing in 2022 after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nome’s geographic internationality helped inspire Jim Stimpfle to work for Russian-American understanding and peace. Since February, 2022, it has motivated other Nome-ites to go to war.

Mark Hayward, a military veteran and a former Special Forces medic who moved to Nome in 2018 with his wife, was in the predominantly Native community of Savoonga, on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea, on February 24, 2022, the day of the invasion. He had gone there as an employee of the Norton Sound Health Corporation to teach residents how to be their own first responders and save lives until victims could be air-transported to better medical care in Anchorage or Seattle. You can’t see Russia from Wasilla, Alaska, but, if you go up on a hill on a clear day, you can see it from St. Lawrence Island. “I’m ashamed to admit, I had checked out of the world,” Hayward told me, by phone. “But, when that invasion happened, I was so freakin’ mad. There’s the Russian coast, less than a hundred miles from Savoonga. If Putin can roll tanks into his neighbor, why wouldn’t he send a sub up here to sink a tanker carrying the oil that keeps my family alive in the winter? When I got home, I knew what I had to do, and so did my wife. She said, ‘You’ve read the news. Get your ass on a plane and get over there.’ ” He left soon afterward, intending to join the foreign-volunteer legion defending Ukraine.

I first learned about Hayward from an article in the Washington Post by Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for the Anchorage Daily News. (He is a college friend of my daughter’s; she put the two of us in touch.) Hughes had gone to Nome last winter and met Hayward in person, but by the time I went, in September, readers of the Post article had sent Hayward money to support his war efforts; one had even funded his return to Ukraine. While walking around Nome, I came upon and tried to make sense of the city’s former hospital building, which sprawls in an indeterminate shape and contains the offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles, a car-repair garage, a pawnshop, the Nome courthouse, and the labyrinthine workshops of Rolland Trowbridge, an enterprising man who bought the building and damaged his knee crawling around in its crannies as he rehabbed it for its present uses. Trowbridge is a collaborator of Hayward’s, and has assembled military matériel in his workshop for Hayward to send to Ukraine via the international courier Meest, which specializes in transporting packages between Ukraine and North America.

I found Trowbridge by asking at the pawnshop. He’s a tall and big man with a well-trimmed beard and mustache, thick, dark eyebrows, and no hair at all north of that. For everyday life, he wears work boots and button-downs. He showed me what he was working on: shrapnel-deterring body armor made of Kevlar fabric sewn with Kevlar thread on his extra-large sail-making sewing machine. (Trowbridge is a sailor who first came to Nome in his own sailboat, amazingly, from Michigan.) In other nooks sat a one-person motorized paraglider that has a range of a hundred and fifty miles and resembles something that Wile E. Coyote might use, and several intricate multifaceted handheld devices for jamming the radio signals that guide drones.

In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Nome residents had joined Jim Stimpfle in his projects of trans-strait druzhba; now dozens of them, by Trowbridge’s estimation, are helping Trowbridge and Hayward help Ukraine. Nome-ites have donated supplies, labor, and money raised at benefit events. He showed me slides of two used yellow-and-green Mercedes-Benz ambulances that he and Hayward bought with the money they raised, and drove from the U.K. to Ukraine in the summer of 2024. His and Hayward’s main achievement so far, he said, has been generating power for a Ukrainian arsenal of Javelin missiles that lacked functioning ignition and guidance systems. He said that by tinkering they put together twelve-volt motorbike batteries with improvised wiring that got the Javelins’ circuitry to work. Then the Ukrainians took these high-tech armor-piercing weapons to the front and “started poppin’ tanks” with them, Trowbridge said, forcing the Russians to turn back their advance on the city of Mykolaiv, a maneuver that could have led to the encirclement of the entire Black Sea region.

He showed me shelves and tables heaped with black, shiny Chinese electronics that he was testing and adapting. “I happen to know a lot about which Chinese equipment is good and which is junk, and how to order the best, which the Ukrainians generally can’t. And you always need to keep buying more of it because drone warfare is changing every day.”

Later, when I talked to Hayward in Mykolaiv from my hotel in Anchorage, he texted me a photograph of a sea-mammal-harpoon point made of shiny steel that he had brought to Ukraine from Savoonga. He also has a motorized paraglider with him. He said he planned to attach the point to a spear and take it up with him in the paraglider so he can harpoon an Orlan-10, one of the sophisticated drones that are killing Ukrainians. “I’m in this war all the way,” Hayward said. “I’ve spent down my I.R.A. and run through my savings. If Putin isn’t stopped here, he will keep on going, and we will all end up living in his gangster world. I’ll give everything I’ve got to stop him, and if I spend all my kids’ inheritance and more helping to create a world where aggression like this cannot stand, that’s an inheritance I’m proud to leave.”

In Nome, Trowbridge told me that he is worried about Hayward. He said, “I’m afraid Mark won’t be satisfied until he gets himself killed there.”

Gay Sheffield, the Bering Strait agent for the University of Alaska’s marine-advisory program in Nome, responds to concerns about sea mammals, subsistence-food sourcing, and environmental change in the region. She also serves as the commissioner of the Port of Nome. The scientific papers she has written or contributed to get down to the real details of life in the area. As someone who has spent a lot of my free time removing debris from trees in the five boroughs of New York City, I was drawn to a 2021 paper, of which she was the principal author, about a “marine debris event” in the Bering Strait in 2020. The study reported that, over the past two decades, five hundred metric tons of seaborne garbage had been collected from the shorelines in and near fifteen coastal communities. Much of it was “industrial fisheries debris”—floats and nets, pallets, deck boots, and various other items “with Russian, Korean, or other Asian lettering.”

Kitchen trash, vegetables, roach-spray cans, air fresheners, bathroom cleaners, a Russian Navy sailor’s cap, disposable gloves, water jugs, food packaging, juice bottles, men’s body-wash bottles—all had sloshed around in the strait and washed up on Alaskan shores. The absence of tampons or diapers in the debris suggested predominantly all-male groups of litterers, such as tanker or fishing-boat crews. The study said the debris could have come from a foreign ship that sank—given the lack of information from the Russian side, who could say? It stated and restated that without meaningful international communication the debris problem cannot be solved.

Other papers that Sheffield wrote or contributed to considered a huge toxic algae bloom in the strait and in the Chukchi Sea north of it, the ongoing disappearance of sea ice, and a recent increase in maritime industrial traffic. I hoped to meet Sheffield, so I stopped by the University of Alaska campus when I was in Nome, but she was on a research trip. When I spoke to her later, she told me that the federal government is not focussed on what is going on in the region. “Only two federal agencies are still in Nome,” she said. “The F.A.A. and the post office. The Parks Service office is closed because of the shutdown. NOAA has reduced its presence. So that means that, basically, the citizens of Nome and the coastal villages are trying to keep track of what’s going on in the region by themselves.

“The toxic algal bloom that happened in 2022 was by far the largest event of its kind ever seen in the U.S.,” she went on. “It stretched for more than six hundred kilometres in the strait and the Chukchi Sea, and certainly must have extended into the Russian side. Ultimately, we have no idea how much harm it caused, since much of it was carried out into the open sea, and onto the Russian coast. A lot of marine animals died, but we can’t be sure whether it was the algae that caused it. Consuming toxic marine life would have caused serious health problems in the region. The warming of the water and the continuing absence of sea ice have consequences. A big one has been the increase in industrial maritime traffic. More and more Russian tankers are bringing liquefied natural gas from the Gulf of Ob through the Russian Arctic, through the strait, and down to China. The federal managers for our maritime resources may have stopped paying very much attention to the region, but the Russians and the Chinese and those of us who live here have not.”

At the Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic, in St. Petersburg, Russia, there is a model of the Earth about fifteen feet across that you can walk around and study from above. What makes it different from other big globes is that it represents only the top part of the planet, no more than a quarter of the total sphere—that is, the entire Arctic and a few degrees latitude below it. Mead Treadwell, who moved to Alaska forty-seven years ago to work on Wally Hickel’s campaign for governor, has prospered there in the pipeline and telecommunications businesses, held political office (lieutenant governor), and served on many Arctic commissions, forums, and institutes. He knows that top part of the planet as well as anybody. I missed him in Anchorage, but met up with him a week later in New York, at another place of convergences, the Explorers Club, on East Seventieth Street. His conversation centered on Alaska but swooped all over that top-view, Arctic-focussed globe—from the Bering Strait to Prudhoe Bay to Russia’s Taymyr Peninsula to Greenland to Iceland to Finland to Wrangel Island, that island beyond the beyond, north of Chukotka, where Treadwell made two expeditions in 1990 that qualified him to become a member of this club.

He agreed with Gay Sheffield that we don’t pay enough attention to our Arctic. “The Barents countries, like Norway, Sweden, and Finland—and also the Laplanders who inhabit them—know much more about their end of the Arctic than we do about ours,” he said. He talked about the natural-gas fields of the far north, and described a fleet of Korean-built, Finnish-designed liquefied-natural-gas (L.N.G.) icebreaker tankers that have spoon-shaped bows and pointed sterns so they can go bow first or stern first, depending on the nature of the ice, and transport L.N.G. to China from western Russia via the Arctic route efficiently and economically. (He believes we should copy them in moving our own North Slope L.N.G. from Prudhoe Bay by sea, rather than relying on pipelines.) Communication between the U.S. and Russia across the strait still exists, he said. On issues of marine safety, search and rescue, and environmental emergency, the U.S. Coast Guard in Juneau still talks to the Russian border-security agents in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and vice versa.

On the question of what is to be done today, he doesn’t know. “I always say that citizen-to-citizen diplomacy opened the border in the nineteen-eighties,” Treadwell said. “And failures of big-country diplomacy contributed to its closing, which started with Putin in 2000. First, Putin discouraged regional governors from doing international relations. Then he told the regions that he would be appointing the governors, and the citizens would no longer be voting on them. Those changes took power away from this neighborhood of the globe. His rise is a lot of the reason the border shut down. I think we could’ve done more with other Arctic-facing countries to counter that shift in power and keep our neighborhoods healthy.

“But there’s always change,” he continued. “A delegation of businessmen accompanied Putin on his recent Alaskan summit with Trump. I don’t know what subjects were discussed. But a lot can be done internationally with mining, shipping, fisheries, energy extraction, and tourism in our shared Arctic. Just because our Russian border appears to be mostly closed, don’t think people aren’t thinking about and planning for a different future.”

In September, 2022, two men who lived in the town of Egvekinot, in Chukotka, decided to escape from military recruiters who had been knocking on their doors. The men filled a sixteen-foot outboard motorboat with supplies and containers of gasoline and set out across the bay next to their village, then braved the open Bering Sea. After several days’ journey, they reached St. Lawrence Island—U.S. soil. Somehow, they had avoided swamping, sinking, drowning, exposure, hypothermia, or capture by the Russian border patrol. Soon after they arrived, U.S. immigration officers flew over from the mainland, arrested them, and brought them to a detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

The office of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, in Tacoma, took their case, and by January, 2023, it had won their release. According to Nicolas McKee, the staff attorney who represents both men, one of them has received asylum and lives in Washington State. The other is waiting for a decision in Alaska, where he has a fishing job in a Russian-speaking community.

Some thirty-five thousand Russians travelled by various routes to the southern border of the U.S. and asked for asylum there in the war’s first year alone; many have suffered in long confinement and with uncertain prospects. As far as anyone knows, the two men from Egvekinot are the only recent Russian asylum seekers to have come from the part of Russia where the United States is so close that under the right circumstances you can see it. McKee thinks that anyone else who succeeds in crossing the Russian-Alaskan border, as his clients did, will also have a good chance of receiving asylum. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea96e40e629c67c05020d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r48407.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 07:58:05.528895

Protest disrupts church services in St. Paul

What we know:

Activists with the Racial Justice Network disrupted church services at Cities Church in St. Paul to oppose a pastor at the church.

Protesters went to the church because they say the pastor in question, David Easterwood, is also the acting field office director for ICE in Minnesota. The protest was documented in part by former CNN anchor turned YouTuber Don Lemon. Video from Black Lives Matter Minnesota also show protesters chanting during services.

""This cannot be a house of God while harboring someone directing ICE agents to wreak havoc on our community,"" attorney Nekima Levy-Armstrong told Lemon during his livestream, explaining why the group was at the church. ""I am a reverend on top of being a lawyer and an activist, so I come here in the power of the almighty God.""

Dig deeper:

FOX 9 can confirm a man named David Easterwood is the acting field office director in Minnesota. Easterwood is routinely named in DHS court filings. However, FOX 9 wasn't able to confirm acting director is the same David Easterwood listed as a pastor on the CIties Church website.

The other side:

Easterwood did not appear to be on hand for Sunday's services. But the church's lead pastor, Jonathan Parnell, did speak with Lemon.

Parnell said the protests inside the church were ""shameful."" ""It's shameful to see anyone interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship,"" said Parnell. ""I have to take care of my church and my family.""

Parnell then asked Lemon to leave unless he was there to worship.

DOJ says they are investigating

What they're saying:

Sunday afternoon, hours after the protests, officials with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were looking into the disruption.

In tweets, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon responded to video of the protest by writing: ""We are on it @CivilRights, working with the USAO in Minneapolis. This is un-American and outrageous.""

Dhillon later added: ""The @CivilRights is investigating the potential violations of the federal FACE Act by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers. Considering and investigating other related crimes as well. @FBI activated too!""

The FACE Act prohibits the use of force to prevent people from receiving reproductive health services, or exercising First Amendment rights at a place of worship.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/cities-church-protest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-19 11:01:40.245097

But it did include statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security that were not part of what Alfonsi had used before her story was pulled. Some of statements, which were carried in full on the “60 Minutes” website, were dated prior to Dec. 21.

“Since November, ‘60 Minutes’ has made several attempts to interview key Trump administration officials on camera about our story,” Alfonsi said. “They declined our requests.”

Alfonsi did not immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Sunday. She said in her email that the administration’s refusal to consent to on-camera interviews was a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.

CBS says it was always going to air the piece

CBS News, in a statement said, that its “leadership has always been committed to airing the ”60 Minutes” CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories, all of which speak to CBS News’ independence and the power of our storytelling.”

Alfonsi’s report was the second of three on Sunday’s show, with the lead story being Cecilia Vega’s report from Minneapolis about ICE enforcement efforts and the protests to its tactics.

The initial decision to sideline Alfonsi’s CECOT story became a flashpoint for critics who said the appointment of Weiss, founder of the Free Press website who had no previous experience in television news, represented an attempt by the network’s new corporate leadership to curry favor with Trump.

While pulled from the broadcast in December, Alfonsi’s original story mistakenly became available online. CBS News had fed a version of the newsmagazine to Global Television, a network that airs “60 Minutes” in Canada, which posted it on its website before the last-minute switch removing the piece.

That enabled sharp-eyed viewers to see what Weiss had rejected, offering the opportunity to compare it to what “60 Minutes” eventually put on the air.

The body of the story was unchanged. It included a brief clip of President Donald Trump saying the prison operators “don’t play games,” and one from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that “heinous monsters, rapists, murderers, sexual assaulters, predators who have no right to be in this country” were sent there.

Alfonsi’s introduction was updated to lead with the Jan. 3 U.S. raid that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, currently held in U.S. custody. She changed the end of the story to include the administration comment, including its explanation for not providing detailed records on the migrants sent to El Salvador.

The administration also provided photos of tattoos worn by the two migrants Alfonsi interviewed, including one swastika that the interviewee said he had gotten as a teen-ager not knowing what it meant.

The CBS-administration relationship has evolved

Since Weiss’ appointment, Trump administration officials have been more visible on CBS News, in interviews that she sometimes helped arrange. The president himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on “60 Minutes” on Nov. 2.

The New York Times reported Saturday that after Trump was interviewed last week by new “CBS Evening News” anchor Tony Dokoupil, Leavitt told the network that “we’ll sue your ass off” if the exchange wasn’t aired in full.

All of the 13-minute interview was shown Tuesday, an unusual step for one of the broadcast networks’ evening newscasts, a half hour summary of the day’s big stories. CBS told The Times that it had decided to run the interview unedited at the time it was booked.

Trump has objected in the past to how his interviews have been edited — including releasing an unedited transcript of an interview conducted by Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” in 2020.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F06%2F796ff77b45da90fcc169f06ab782%2Fcorrection-media-60-minutes-trump-67068.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:00.868121

Bruce Springsteen criticized the Trump administration's deployment of ICE agents to Minneapolis and the fatal shooting by an ICE agent of Renee Good in comments at the Light of Day Winterfest main event show Saturday, Jan. 17 at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in Red Bank.

“I wrote this song as an ode to American possibility,” said Springsteen while introducing “The Promised Land.” “It was about a both beautiful but flawed country, that we are, and the country that we could be. Right now, we are living through incredibly critical times. The United States, the ideals and the values for which it stood for the past 250 years, is being tested as it's never been in modern times.”

The audience broke into applause.

“Those values and those ideals have never been as endangered as they are right now,” Springsteen said. “So as we gather tonight in this beautiful display of love and care and thoughtfulness and community, if you believe in democracy and liberty and believe the truth still matters, you must speak out and it's worth fighting for. If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it. If you stand against heavily armed masked federal troops invading an American city, using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens. If you believe you don't deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, send a message to this president as the mayor of that city has said, ICE should get the (expletive) out of Minneapolis.”

More waves of cheers came from the audience.

“This song is for you and the memory of a mother of three, American Renee Good,” said Springsteen, who then played the opening notes of “The Promised Land” on harmonica.

The Springsteen intro was similar to the Boss' state of democracy speeches he gave during the E Street Band's tour of Europe last year, which also criticized the Trump administration.

President Trump responded by attacking Springsteen on social media several times in response, including sharing a meme that depicted Trump hitting a golf ball and striking Springsteen, which knocks him down on stage.

The Light of Day, which has been supported by Springsteen, raises funds and awareness in the fight against Parkinson's and related diseases. In accordance with Light of Day history, Springsteen was not an announced artist at Saturday's show, which included performances by Gary “U.S.” Bonds, Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, Dramarama, Remember Jones, Fantastic Cat, Williams Honor, James Maddock, Joe D’Urso and Stone Caravan, Wille Nile and more.

Springsteen first appeared on Saturday with Nile when he and Maddock joined the rocker for his “One Guitar.” The Boss returned to join Gruschecky and the Houserockers as they backed Bonds on “Jole Blon.”

“I knew they was going to start some (expletive),” said Bonds as he embraced by Springsteen.

“Bonds is (expletive) 86 years (expletive) old,” said Springsteen, 76. The Boss was instrumental in revitalizing Bonds' career in the early '80s by penning hits like “This Little Girl,” performed on Saturday, for Bonds.

“I got at least 10 more years in me, I know that,” Springsteen said.

“I love these young folks,” Bonds said. “I'm going to teach them how to rock 'n' roll.”

There was lots of rock ’n’ roll on stage Saturday night as the show lasted six hours, ending at 12:30 a.m. The nightcap was a performance of Springsteen's “Light of Day,” and then a rendition of Happy Birthday for festival founder Bob Benjamin, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1996.

He's now confined to a wheelchair. Springsteen stroked his hand after singing.

“This is somebody who has done more for the fight against Parkinson's than anybody I know,” Springsteen said. “Bob Benjamin, let's sing for him.”

The Boss ended the show with an acoustic rendition of “Thunder Road” with an audience singalong.

The recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer has further inflamed tensions surrounding the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, which have been present throughout President Trump’s second term.

Trump on Thursday warned of using the Insurrection Act following demonstrations in Minneapolis, but said a day later there was no reason to invoke the law immediately.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters.

On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed her agency is working on an internal review of the actions of the ICE officer that killed Renee Good.

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz) also said Sunday that he believes “ICE needs to be totally torn down.”

“It has to be created in the image of what people want, right? And what does that look like?” Gallego told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “From my experience running in Arizona, in a very hard, hard state when it comes to immigration and immigration issues, people want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals, right, and focuses on criminals, and immigration enforcement that is actually focused on security, and not the goon squad that has come from Stephen Miller and Donald Trump.”

Gov. Abigail Spanberger moved swiftly on immigration policy in her opening slate of executive orders, rescinding a directive from her Republican predecessor that expanded Virginia’s cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The order repeals former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47, which required the Virginia State Police and the Virginia Department of Corrections to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. The order also encouraged local police and sheriffs to do the same.

Repealing Executive Order 47 does not terminate existing 287(g) agreements. Under their terms, the agreements remain in effect until they are suspended or terminated by either party.

Spanberger’s executive order argues that the policy diverted limited law-enforcement resources away from core public safety functions.

It reads: “This executive order rescinds Executive Order 47, which requires and encourages state and local law enforcement to divert their limited resources for use in enforcing federal civil immigration laws,” the order states. “Ensuring public safety in Virginia requires state and local law enforcement to be focused on their core responsibilities of investigating and deterring criminal activity, staffing jails, and community engagement.”

Under 287(g) agreements, state and local law-enforcement agencies — including sheriffs’ offices and police departments — are authorized to carry out limited federal immigration enforcement duties under ICE supervision. Those functions can include identifying people in jail who may be subject to deportation, serving certain administrative immigration warrants on people already in custody, and, in some cases, deputizing officers with limited ICE authority during routine law-enforcement work.

According to ICE’s website, there are currently 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving local governments, state agencies and correctional facilities. Five of those agreements are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law-enforcement agencies.

Spanberger previewed the move in her inaugural remarks on Saturday, emphasizing her administration’s approach to immigrant communities.

“Our hardworking, law-abiding, immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them too,” Spanberger said.

Youngkin’s original order declared that “Virginia is not a sanctuary state” and argued that the “nexus between illegal immigration and dangerous criminal activity is real.” The policy drew condemnation from immigrant-rights groups and the ACLU of Virginia, while Democratic lawmakers criticized it as a misallocation of resources that undermined trust between communities and law enforcement.

House Republican Leader Terry Kilgore said the decision to end 287(g) agreements for state police would make Virginia less safe.

“This decision allows criminal illegal immigrants to remain in our communities and commit crimes over and over again by shielding them from cooperation with federal law enforcement,” Kilgore said. “That is not public safety — it is reckless.”

Former Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said the move was a “disaster for public safety.”

“Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised,” Miyares posted on X.

Mary Bauer, executive director for the ACLU of Virginia, said Spanberger’s executive order was a good start but that she now must end 287(g) agreements between state agencies and ICE.

“It is not the job of Virginia’s law enforcement agencies to carry out the Trump administration’s brutal and fear-based anti-immigrant agenda,” Bauer said. “(Spanberger’s) executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families.",https://www.virginiascope.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_0400-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:09.635315

Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.
Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.","1. Introduction

In Doe v. HHS (5th Cir. Jan. 16, 2026), Dr. John Doe—a physician challenging an Adverse Action Report (“AAR”) lodged in the National Practitioner Data Bank—sought reconsideration from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) of a prior refusal to remove the AAR. HHS denied the request with a terse rationale: that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.”

After Doe sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in the Eastern District of Texas, HHS defended on a different theory: that it denied reconsideration on the merits because Doe failed to identify new evidence sufficient to reopen. The district court dismissed the APA claim, treating the denial as effectively unreviewable because Doe had not presented new evidence.

The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that HHS’s shift in rationale violated the Chenery principle: a reviewing court may assess agency action only on the grounds the agency itself invoked in the administrative record.

Key issues

Whether HHS may defend an agency decision on a litigation rationale different from the rationale stated in the final agency action.

Whether HHS’s stated “ineligibility” ground was consistent with its own guidance governing reconsideration.

What remedy is appropriate when Chenery is violated at the motion-to-dismiss stage in an APA case.

Parties

Plaintiff–Appellant: John Doe, M.D., Ph.D.

Defendant–Appellee: United States Department of Health and Human Services

2. Summary of the Opinion

The Fifth Circuit held that HHS’s litigation position—asserting a merits-based denial for lack of new evidence—could not be used to uphold an agency action that, on its face, denied relief because Doe was “not eligible” for reconsideration. Applying SEC v. Chenery Corp, the court ruled that it could not credit post hoc rationalizations offered by agency counsel.

The court further observed that HHS’s own guidance contemplated that upon a reconsideration request, the agency would either affirm the prior decision or issue a revised final decision—yet HHS instead declared Doe “not eligible” for reconsideration, a position the court said was “not true” under the guidance language. The Fifth Circuit therefore reversed the dismissal of the APA claim and remanded for further proceedings.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) SEC v. Chenery Corp, 332 U.S. 194 (1947)

The decision rests on Chenery’s “simple but fundamental rule” that a court must judge an agency action “solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.” In Doe v. HHS, that meant the court could not affirm (or sustain a dismissal premised on) a rationale HHS did not provide to Doe in the administrative record. The operative ground was “not eligible for additional administrative review,” not “we reviewed your new evidence and reject it on the merits.”

2) Calcutt v. FDIC, 598 U.S. 623 (2023) (per curiam)

The Fifth Circuit used Calcutt v. FDIC to reinforce the modern Supreme Court’s insistence that courts are “powerless” to affirm agency action by “substituting” a better rationale when the agency’s own reasoning is “inadequate or improper.” Here, the district court’s approach—accepting the litigation theory that the denial rested on lack of new evidence—was functionally a substitution of grounds inconsistent with Calcutt’s instruction.

3) Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156 (1962)

Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States supplies the more specific administrative-law admonition that appellate courts may not accept “post hoc rationalizations” and that an agency order must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself. The Fifth Circuit treated HHS’s merits-based defense on appeal as exactly the sort of post hoc rationalization Burlington forbids.

4) McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1988)

The panel cited McLouth Steel Prods. Corp. v. Thomas in connection with the proposition that agencies must adhere to mandatory procedural language in their own guidance (or at least must supply a lawful explanation if they depart from it). The Fifth Circuit invoked this authority while noting HHS’s guidance describing what happens after a reconsideration request—suggesting HHS did not do what it promised it would do.

5) Prior litigation involving Doe and the AAR

The opinion situates the dispute against extensive prior proceedings where Doe tried to remove the AAR, including:

Doe v. Rogers, 139 F. Supp. 3d 120 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Doe I”)

[Doe] v. Rogers, 656 F. Supp. 3d 78 (D.D.C. 2023) (“Doe II”), aff’d sub nom. Doe v. Rodgers, No. 20-5297, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 3540 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2023) (“Doe III”), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 328 (2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., No. 181 N.Y.S.3d 884 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Medical Center et al., No. 2:10-cv-05588 (E.D.N.Y. filed Dec. 2, 2010)

[Doe] v. Peconic Bay Med. Ctr., 59 N.Y.S.3d 310 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017)

While these cases did not control the Chenery issue, they provide the procedural posture for why Doe sought reconsideration based on discovery materials and why HHS’s characterization of what it did on reconsideration mattered for APA review.

6) Judge Haynes’s pro se deference authorities

In a concurrence in part and dissent in part, Judge Haynes cited: Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989) and Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), emphasizing that pro se filings are construed with deference. Those cases informed Judge Haynes’s proposed procedural remedy (a limited remand to allow fuller presentation to the district court), though the majority resolved the appeal on Chenery grounds as to the APA claim.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) The agency’s stated ground controls

The majority framed the case as one where its “analysis begins and ends” with the agency’s stated rationale. HHS’s final agency action said only that Doe was “not eligible for additional administrative review.” Under Chenery, that statement set the boundaries of judicial review: the court could not treat the decision as if it instead said “we considered your new evidence and deny reopening on the merits.”

2) A guidance mismatch underscored the inadequacy of the “ineligible” rationale

The court found the “not eligible” rationale inconsistent with HHS’s published guidance. The opinion quotes the National Practitioner Data Bank Guidebook as describing two outcomes after a reconsideration request: “Either the previous decision will be affirmed” or a “revised final decision will be issued.” The agency did neither; it issued a threshold ineligibility denial, contrary to the guidance’s described process. That mismatch mattered because it made the agency’s stated ground appear factually and procedurally defective, and it prevented the court from accepting HHS’s later attempt to recast the denial as merits-based.

3) The district court’s dismissal could not stand once the rationale shifted

The district court dismissed the APA claim on the understanding that Doe “failed to present any new evidence,” treating the denial of reconsideration as unreviewable on that basis. The Fifth Circuit held that approach effectively relied on a rationale not provided by the agency to the applicant—and, indeed, contradicted by the agency’s own written “not eligible” statement. Under Chenery and its progeny, that warranted reversal and remand.

4) Remedy: reversal and remand for further proceedings

The court did not decide the ultimate merits of Doe’s APA claim. It vacated the dismissal and remanded so that the case proceeds with the agency action judged on its stated ground (or for further agency explanation consistent with administrative-law requirements). The remedy reflects Chenery’s standard solution: the agency must supply the lawful, contemporaneous rationale in the record, not through later advocacy.

C. Impact

1) Litigation discipline for agencies: the record must match the defense

The decision reinforces in the Fifth Circuit that agencies cannot pivot in court from a threshold rationale (“ineligible”) to an alternative rationale (merits-based “no new evidence”) to avoid review or shore up a weak administrative explanation. For agency litigators, the case is a warning that the administrative decision letter and record must contain the grounds the government expects to defend.

2) Procedural regularity in reconsideration regimes

Although the opinion is brief, its reliance on the Guidebook’s mandatory-seeming description suggests heightened scrutiny when an agency’s reconsideration procedures are framed in “either/or” terms and the agency instead chooses a third option (ineligibility) without explanation. Future challengers may cite Doe v. HHS when an agency denies reconsideration using a rationale that does not track its published process.

3) Administrative law, not NPDB merits, drives the holding

The ruling does not establish substantive standards for removing AARs or interpreting the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (“HCQIA”). Its precedential force lies in administrative law: courts in the Fifth Circuit will police explanation-shifting and require agencies to stand on what they said when they acted.

4) Interaction with pro se considerations (Judge Haynes’s view)

Judge Haynes would have affirmed the unappealed constitutional claims and preferred a limited remand to permit counsel-developed arguments to be aired first in the district court, invoking the deference owed to pro se litigants. Even though the majority did not adopt that procedural framing, the separate writing signals that, on remand, district courts may be receptive to fuller development where initial briefing was pro se—while still remaining bound by Chenery’s restriction on post hoc agency rationales.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): A federal statute that allows courts to review many final agency actions to ensure the agency acted lawfully and provided a reasoned explanation.

Final agency action: The agency’s definitive position (often a letter or decision) that marks the end of the administrative process and is typically what courts review.

Chenery principle: Courts can uphold agency action only for the reasons the agency itself gave at the time it acted—not reasons invented later by lawyers in litigation.

Post hoc rationalization: A justification offered after the fact (in court) that is not found in the agency’s original decision.

National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB): A federal repository that includes certain adverse reports about medical practitioners; hospitals and other entities consult it for credentialing and privileging decisions.

Adverse Action Report (AAR): A report submitted (here, by a hospital) reflecting an adverse professional action, potentially affecting a physician’s career opportunities.

Reconsideration vs. reopening: Agencies sometimes allow a party to ask the agency to revisit a prior decision; such requests often require “new evidence” or similar showings. The key in this case is that whatever the agency’s standard is, it must be the standard the agency states and applies in the record.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Trump administration and different government agencies of using racial profiling to conduct illegal stops and arrests in Minnesota.

According to The Hill, the lawsuit names defendants including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Both agencies have a heavy presence in Minnesota, which is currently being targeted by unprecedented immigration-enforcement actions.

“Masked federal agents in the thousands are violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity irrespective of their citizenship or immigration status, or their personal circumstances. At the center of DHS’s campaign are Somali and Latino people, who are being targeted for stops and arrests based on racial profiling motivated by prejudice,” the lawsuit alleges.

“DHS’s crude dragnet ensnares non-citizens, including individuals with immigration status, without warrants or any lawful basis for arrest,” the lawsuit says. “And its discriminatory practices also sweep in numerous US citizens in the process, shackling them and scanning their faces while ignoring documentation of US citizenship.”

In court filings, the American Civil Liberties Union described the experience of plaintiff Mubashir Khalif Hussen, who claims to have been detained by immigration agents despite repeatedly telling them that he is a U.S. citizen. Both Hussen and the ACLU say that ICE refused repeated requests to inspect Hussen’s identification.

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” Hussen said. “They did not ask me for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

After his initial detention, Hussen was taken to a government services building in Whipple, Minnesota. Only there was Hussen allowed the opportunity to retrieve and share a picture of his U.S. passport. He was ultimately released, but only after being shackled and fingerprinted.

Another plaintiff, 25-year-old Mahamed Eydarus, claims to have been shoveling snow out of a parking space with his mother when they were both surrounded by unidentified, masked federal agents. The agents did not present any identification but demanded that Eydarus prove that he was “not illegal.” During the encounter, the agents allegedly questions why Eydarus and his mother kept speaking in Somali.

“The government can’t stop and arrest people based on the color of their skin, or arrest people with no probable cause,” said Kate Huddleston, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

“These kinds of police-state tactics are contrary to the basic principles of liberty and equality that remain a bedrock of our legal system and our country,” Huddleston said.

Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Minnesota branch, was similarly critical of the federal government’s new tactics.

“ICE and CBP’s practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible,” she said.

“Federal agents’ conduct—sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests—is a grave violation of Minnesotans’ most fundamental rights, and it has spread fear among immigrant communities and neighborhoods,” Ahlin-Halverson said in a statement. “No one, including federal agents, is above the law.”

The report on the facility housing migrants deported from the United States was postponed from an initial air date of Dec 21, with CBS saying it required additional reporting and would be broadcast later.

“CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 Minutes CECOT piece as soon as it was ready,” the network said in a statement on Jan 18 , though the show had

on Canada’s Global TV app in December.

The broadcast on Jan 18 added comments from the US Department of Homeland Security, details of the criminal records of those deported and additional reporting on one with tattoos, the network said.

The US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial to the facility, known as CECOT.

“Last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists,” CBS said in a programme description on the show.

In a segment of the show, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with two Venezuelan men who were later released, and who described conditions in the facility as “brutal and torturous”.

The segment on CECOT included accusations of torture inflicted on Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison and raised questions about how the US characterised them.

There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them.
Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.
After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans.","At 9 AM I fall in love with Amy. We’re in my friend’s old Corolla, following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in our neighborhood. We only know “Amy” through the Signal voice call we’re on together, alongside more than eight hundred others, all trying to coordinate sightings throughout South Minneapolis. Amy drives a silver Subaru and is directly in front of us, expertly tailing a black Wagoneer with two masked agents in front. The Wagoneer skips a red light to try and lose us, but Amy’s fast. She bolts across the intersection, Bullitt-style, and we follow just behind, shouting inside the car, GO AMY! WE LOVE YOU! “I’m gonna fucking marry Amy,” my friend says. “You think it’s chill to propose over this call?”

You can’t walk for ten minutes in my neighborhood without seeing them: boxy SUVs, mostly domestic-made, with tinted windows and out-of-state plates. Two men riding in front, dressed in tactical gear. Following behind is a train of three or four cars, honking. Sometimes there are bikers, too, blowing on neon-colored plastic whistles that local businesses give out for free. Every street corner has patrollers on foot, yelling and filming when a convoy rolls by.

If the ICE vehicles pull over, people flood the street. Crowds materialize seemingly out of nowhere. The honking and whistling amps up, becoming an unignorable wail, and more people stream out of their houses and businesses. When agents leave their cars they’re met with jeers, mostly variations on “Fuck you.” Usually someone starts throwing snowballs. Agents pull out pepper spray guns, threatening protesters who get too close. If there’s enough of a crowd, they use tear gas. Meanwhile they go about their barbaric business: they’ve pulled someone out of their car or home and are shoving them into a vehicle, handcuffed. Over the noise, an observer tries to ask the person being detained for their name and who they want contacted. Sometimes a detainee’s phone, keys, or a bag make it into an observer’s hands. Everyone is filming. The press is taking photos.

Soon the agents are back in their vehicles. They pull risky maneuvers to move through the crowd and speed off. No more than six or seven minutes have elapsed, and another neighbor has been kidnapped. Observers are left to deal with the wreckage: tow an abandoned car, contact family, sometimes collect children. There are lawyers on call, local tow companies offering free services, mutual aid groups to support families after an abduction. Some observers stay behind to do this kind of coordination, and some get back in their cars or on their bikes and speed off again. If enough people get there fast enough, ICE might back off next time. At a minimum, their cruelty can’t go unchallenged.

I’m in my kitchen typing out “do swim goggles protect you from tear gas.” The AI search response that I’ve failed to disable tells me they can “help significantly.” I laugh at this ridiculous tableau. The local ACE Hardware store posted on Facebook that they’ve stocked up on respirators and safety goggles. What I once considered hardcore riot gear is now essential for leaving the house.

I live near the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Lake Street, two major South Minneapolis thoroughfares that mark the northwest corner of the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. My house is a mile north of where George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020 and even closer to where Renee Good was murdered by ICE agent Jonathan Ross this month. Since the Department of Homeland Security initiated “Operation Metro Surge” in December, there have been at least half a dozen abductions that I know of on or around my block. A nearby house of recently arrived Ecuadorians used to be home to sixteen adults and six children. Six weeks into the federal invasion, only eight adults remain.

Citywide, hundreds of people are being abducted from their homes and separated from their families. Citizens are racially profiled and asked for papers. Exact numbers on detainees are unreliable, but the number of federal agents is roughly three thousand. These numbers are similar in scale to ICE operations in other cities across the US, including LA and Chicago, but what’s new in Minneapolis are the extreme tactics that federal agents are using to repress organized resistance. The stories circulating online and by word of mouth are harrowing: federal agents surrounding observer cars to trap them, then smashing car windows and dragging observers out; agents spraying mace six inches from someone’s face or spraying mace into intake vents so that the inside of cars are immediately flooded; agents suddenly braking at seventy miles per hour on the freeway and forcing tailing vehicles to swerve; agents throwing observers on the ground, punching observers in the face, agents taking observers on aimless rides around the city while taunting them with racial or sexual epithets; agents holding observers at the federal detention building for hours without access to phone calls or lawyers. (This is merely how ICE terrorizes US citizens.)

What also feels new is the frequent candor with which ICE agents are displaying hateful ideology. Two days after Good was murdered, DHS overtly referenced a Neo-Nazi anthem in a nationwide recruitment post. Agents seem to feel empowered to say new kinds of chilling things out loud. One told an observer: “Stop following us, that’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.” (He was referring to Good.) A friend of mine was sexually harassed by an ICE agent, who called them “too pretty” to stay locked up while in detention. Another was shoved to the ground and asked, “Do you like the dirt, queer?” Sometimes the behavior is simply bizarre. After an attempted abduction left a couple dozen observers standing on a neighborhood street, one ICE vehicle circled the block, broadcasting a looped audio recording of a woman screaming.

In these moments the whole situation can seem ridiculous. The professional kidnappers step out of their flashy American cars with their special outfits on. They wave their little mace guns at us, but we’re not scared—we have oversized ski goggles! A particularly comic element at play is that we’re in the middle of another winter with wild variations in temperature, meaning that Minneapolis streets are covered in thick sheets of ice. There are some heartwarming videos of agents falling down (“ICE on ice!”) but we slip too, running towards or away from them. It can feel kind of slapstick, until you remember that they will destroy someone’s life today, and that they can kill you.

A black gloved hand reaches out of the Wagoneer window and begins to give a princess wave to us, then the peace sign, then a thumbs up. They’re mocking us. The agents stop their vehicle suddenly but Amy brakes in time. Luckily, so do we. ICE has been using “brake-checks” as pretense for detaining observers. Another observer car pulls up and my city council member steps out. He strides up to the Wagoneer, blowing his whistle. (Absolutely everyone is confronting ICE—I’ve encountered my old boss from the local cafe scuffling with agents, too.) Someone on the street starts filming and the bicyclist we know in the chat as “small fry” shouts at the agents to get out of Minneapolis. We’re honking. The Wagoneer idles for a few minutes and then takes off towards the freeway. We follow until they’re on the exit ramp. It feels good to watch them leave the neighborhood, but I worry about where they’re headed next. We drive towards home and come across another two vehicles with observers tailing behind. Lake Street, a major corridor of immigrant businesses in the neighborhood, has been crawling with ICE vehicles every morning this week.

Powderhorn Park is a middle-class neighborhood known for its May Day parade, replete with larger-than-life puppets and steampunk Mad Max vehicles. Artists and families live here, and young queer people, and many immigrants, most arriving from Ecuador in recent years. The past few summers, the block south of me has become impassable every evening as hundreds of my Spanish-speaking neighbors use the park for massive volleyball tournaments. Food vendors set up tables and families bring lawn chairs to watch the games. Last year, two women sold grilled chicken on the corner closest to me. My neighbor’s lawn became a kind of informal restaurant, where customers would sit at the warping picnic table and eat. I bought their chicken a few times, and it was awesome.

A week into the invasion my neighbor with the picnic table called to ask if I was available to come with one of the two vendors to an immigration appointment. The woman had been contacted by USCIS that morning and was told to come in at 3 o’clock that same afternoon. She was worried she could be detained on the spot and had a newborn with her. Several neighbors gathered to arrange a ride, but in the end she only wanted a lawyer and translator to attend with her. I heard later that at the appointment she announced she wanted to self-deport, trading a planned exit for the fear of being taken at random. Her sister, the other vendor, is still here. The Saturday after Good’s murder, she and I sit with a small group of volunteers gathered to talk about how to improve rideshare coordination over WhatsApp. She tells us in Spanish that migrants can’t use corporate rideshare services because there have been reports of Uber drivers taking people directly to ICE. Of the more than two hundred people in the rideshare text thread, half are citizens offering rides and half are requesting. “I like being in this group because I’m meeting so many neighbors I would not have met otherwise,” someone says at the meeting. “I hope we stay connected after this is all over.”

Powderhorn is the same park where, in June 2020, a majority of Minneapolis City Council members stood on stage and announced their support for defunding the Minneapolis Police Department. It’s also where more than 10,000 people gathered to protest ICE the weekend after Renee Good was shot. Minneapolis learned a lot from the George Floyd protests and it shows. Well before Kristi Noem announced DHS operations in Minnesota, the neighborhood got ready. It started with rapid response preparation in the park’s recreation center and legal observer trainings at a church. Then it was block-by-block meetings. Small networks that formed in 2020 were reactivated to distribute 3D-printed whistles and practice scenarios for confronting agents. When ICE deployed in December, Signal threads for local alerts quickly surpassed the thousand-user limit, and an extensive mutual aid ecosystem of grocery runs and rideshares emerged overnight. After Good’s murder and Noem’s announcement that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would triple, everyone I know cancelled their social plans. Lots of people called off work.

What we’re doing now is this: The trainings have evolved into street medic workshops on protecting yourself from chemical weapons and lessons on digital security; there’s a meet-up to sew reinforced umbrellas as shields from mace and a collection spot for barricade materials. And this is what it’s like: Sometimes you’re chasing ICE off your street, maybe you’re buying groceries for a family, but a lot of the time you’re on your phone. Behind every actionable piece of organizing are hours spent coordinating in Signal threads, calling to check up on someone, scrolling live feeds. At night, over dinner, it’s all anyone can talk about. Did you hear? Did you see that post? Did you read in the thread?

I moved to Minneapolis in 2019 because I was looking for a mid-sized city where rents were still relatively cheap. I knew it was a place where people could afford to be punks and experimental artists and career anarchists. I also knew it was a city with “good politics,” whatever that meant to me at the time. The first summer I lived here, my new friends were going to northern Minnesota on the weekends to support Indigenous resistance camps opposing construction of the Line 3 tar sands pipeline. During Covid, they were standing in parking lots, distributing food and diapers, or defending homeless encampments from police. The uprising following George Floyd’s murder brought everyone out to the streets each night for a week. It’s simply true, I learned, that when you only work part-time, when your main expense is a $400-a-month room in your punk house, you have time to organize. From anarchist info shops to nonprofit worker centers, from the founding of the American Indian Movement in 1968 to the first formations of Anti-Racist Action in the 1980s, grassroots organizing undergirds the culture of the city in a unique way.

Trump officials have made it clear that Operation Metro Surge is as much about seizing migrants from their homes as it is about repression of dissent to fascism. But they seem confused about how exactly the dissent works, and about where it’s coming from. Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary of DHS, lambasted Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, governor Tim Walz, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison—all varyingly pro-cop centrist liberals—for their non-compliance with federal operations on X. “Sanctuary politicians like Ellison are the EXACT reason that DHS surged to Minnesota in the first place,” she wrote. Did she think the attorney general was out in the streets, throwing snowballs with his constituents?

One tactic of fascism is to shift the scales of political alignment: centrists become stalwarts of the radical left; moms become “domestic terrorists.” Everyone with a whistle becomes antifa. And actually, that last part is correct—or at least it should be. A general strike has been called for Friday, January 23. With luck, thousands of Minnesotans will join in on what many further left are already doing: stopping business as usual and withdrawing their consent from fascism. Among many things I hope for, I want to see volleyball games in the park again this summer.",https://www.nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G-cR9YaXYAAlIzr-e1768686637747.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:13.660095

A federal judge in Minneapolis cited the episodes in an unusually detailed ruling on Friday that found a pattern of misconduct by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and ordered them and other immigration agents to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city.

In some ways, legal experts said, the judge’s order was fairly mundane because it merely ordered the federal agents to follow established constitutional law, permitting peaceful protests.

In other ways, it stood out.

“Extraordinary,” Michele Goodwin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said of the decision. The judge, she said, reviewed dozens of witness declarations and video evidence and found conduct “alarming enough, dangerous enough that the court has imposed a preliminary injunction.”

Protesters and state officials have for weeks been calling on the federal government to withdraw its immigration agents from Minneapolis, a movement that has only intensified since Renee Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer.

In late December, the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of several protesters, filed a complaint against the federal government and its agents seeking to protect the protesters’ rights to speech, assembly and unlawful search and seizure.

The court order was based on earlier interactions that immigration agents had with protesters that did not gain as much attention as the killing of Ms. Good. The accounts described in the order were submitted to the court from declarations and video submissions from both parties.

Ms. Goodwin was one of several legal scholars and criminal justice experts who said the conduct of ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge, the government’s name for its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, evoked the attacks by police officers in Birmingham, Ala., on civil rights protesters in 1963.

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, also noted the similarities. “I think about the civil rights movement in the South and how Southern law enforcement reacted with hoses, dogs and lynchings,” he said.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, called the judge’s findings “ridiculous” on Sunday in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation and then blamed the protesters.

“We only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe,” she said, adding that the judge’s order will not change the agency’s operations on the ground. “It’s basically telling us to do what we’ve already been doing,” she said.

Her agency was expected to appeal the ruling.

The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges across the country, including in California, Illinois and Washington, D.C., where civil and immigrant rights organizations have sought to curb the tactics of federal agents.

In Illinois, where immigration agents massed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

The legal moves have come as the Trump administration pursues its deportation agenda, a cornerstone of the campaign that helped get Mr. Trump elected to a second term. For many, including in Minnesota, the immigration crackdown is the welcome fulfillment of that promise and should not be impeded by protesters.

The 83-page ruling found that “the record adequately illustrates that the defendants have made, and will continue to make, a common practice of conduct that chills observers’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights.”

Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden, said that neither party requested an evidentiary hearing, even though the court made that available.

She also stated that she gave “substantial weight” to the sworn statements from the plaintiffs and noted that immigration agents involved in the interactions with protesters did not provide sworn declarations.

Rather, the defense depended on testimony from David Easterwood, who directs the Minneapolis field office for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. Mr. Easterwood said he was not present at the encounters, but rather relied on “personal knowledge, reasonable inquiry and information made available to me.” Judge Menendez said because of that, she gave “considerably less weight” to the testimony of Mr. Easterwood.

In one episode described in the order, Judge Menendez concluded that federal agents likely were “simply fed up with the protesters generally” when they decided to violently arrest a man who was involved in peaceful activity.

“‘Let’s get this guy,’ one of the agents said, before they grabbed Abdikadir Noor, and threw him to the ground,” the ruling said.

While ICE contended in court papers that Mr. Noor was leading an agitated crowd of protesters as agents attempted to make an arrest, videos showed that he had pushed another protester away from the officers and held his arm up to urge other protesters to stay back, the court ruling said.

He was detained by ICE agents, taken to a federal building, shackled and put in a cell, and later released, according to the decision.

Ms. Tincher woke to learn that ICE agents had arrived in her Near North neighborhood in Minneapolis. She drove to a nearby home that was surrounded by agents to find out what was happening.

Standing about six feet from agents who had encircled the home, she said, she heard officers say, “Get back,” and “Take her down.”

Within about 15 seconds, she said, several agents had grabbed her and pulled her to the ground, then handcuffed her while she was face down in the snow. Witnesses said she did not physically resist agents or taunt or threaten them.

ICE agents took Ms. Tincher to the federal building where they removed some of her clothes, cut off her wedding ring, and shackled her. Before releasing her, they told her she would be charged with obstructing a federal officer. She was never charged.

In court papers, Mr. Easterwood said that Ms. Tincher had attempted to cross into the perimeter of the house and tried to push an ICE officer out of the way.

But Judge Menendez disagreed.

She also cited a number of incidents of ICE agents “gratuitously deploying chemical irritants at observers and protesters.”

Alan Crenshaw, 35, a Minneapolis resident involved in the protests, said he entered a restaurant and witnessed two agents “violently slamming a young Black man against the wall” even though the man was yelling in pain and telling them he was a U.S. citizen.

Outside, he said, he saw the agents push the young man into the snow for no apparent reason, handcuff him and place him in a car.

As a crowd gathered, Mr. Crenshaw said multiple people were being pepper sprayed with no warning. Agents drove slowly past, opened the car door and sprayed a bystander on the side of the road. Then, another ICE car without lights drove past and sprayed Mr. Crenshaw right in the face.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:21.745769

Whether it concerns visa status or Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the constitutionality of recent federal action is being highly contested across the country.

In light of this national discourse, a crowd of around 80 students, community members and professors gathered at SIU Simmons Law School on Wednesday, Jan. 14 for a lecture regarding ICE, immigration and new policies under the Trump administration.

Ohio State University’s César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández presented a lecture titled “Immigration Law in Turbulent Times” in which he describes recent events involving immigration through a legal lens. His lecture highlighted the increase in ICE raids across the country, clashes between civilians and agents that have led to shootings — like the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month — lawsuits, mass protests, the recent addition of 75 new countries to the U.S. visa ban list and the overall confusion concerning the legality of federal deportation practices.

Hernández’s teaching and writing details the intersectionality of criminal and immigration law and his lecture at SIU focused on the constantly evolving legal landscape that surrounds immigration enforcement techniques.

Attendees were able to speak with Hernández beforehand and ask questions after his lecture.

In his lecture, Hernández spoke about Trump’s campaign, and how he specifically pledged to evoke a deportation operation similar to President Eisenhower’s 1954 military-style campaign aimed at ending undocumented immigration by deporting hundreds of thousands of Mexicans through mass raids and arrests throughout southwestern America.

Hernández detailed the non-fatal shooting of Marimar Martinez, a Chicago woman whose SUV allegedly struck an ICE agent’s vehicle in October of 2025, after which the agent fired five shots, striking Martinez multiple times. Martinez’s vehicle was “boxed in” by ICE vehicles during the time of the shooting, and is among many of the contentious incidents in which ICE agents have used lethal force while conducting raids.

“The head of the FBI called her (Martinez), a domestic terrorist,” Hernández said.

She was later charged with assaulting and impeding federal officers, but the government’s account was challenged with conflicting evidence, including body-camera footage and text messages from an agent. Federal prosecutors then dismissed these charges citing prejudice, which means the case cannot be reopened because of a weak or flawed case.

Hernández then spoke about the fatal shooting of Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in January 2026 while in her vehicle as she engaged with agents during a neighborhood raid in Minneapolis.

“Good did not open the door. She did not exit the car. She continued driving it. First backwards, then forwards, then to the right. Then an agent, phone in one hand, shot her with a gun that he held in the other.” Hernández said. “The script repeats: Good is dead, and high level government officials say she is a domestic terrorist.”

Hernández also talked about the role that court case Terry v. Ohio plays during ICE raids. The 1968 Supreme Court ruling found it constitutional for police to “stop and frisk” without probable cause if they have reasonable suspicion that someone was involved in a crime.

Hernández said that Terry v. Ohio ties directly into a “turbulent time” on the west coast, with hundreds of ICE agents in the Los Angeles area. A district court in California recently responded to a lawsuit, Vasquez v. Noem (2025), that was brought by a group of people who were stopped and questioned by ICE agents. The plaintiffs believe they were racially profiled.

Hernández explained that the lawsuit, if successful, would prohibit ICE from racially profiling based on skin color, native language, accents, location or work/profession. A federal judge from California then agreed and issued an order restricting these tactics of profiling because it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court later paused the judge’s ruling, allowing ICE to continue those tactics.

Hernández noted that Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, is of the opinion that immigrants “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”

Kavanaugh was appointed in 2018, and has since written multiple court opinions about whether or not factors like race and ethnicity could be considered in immigration stops under the Fourth Amendment.

“How would an agent know that someone does not speak much English? How would an agent go about racially or ethnically categorizing a person?” Hernández asked, referring to Kavanaugh’s remarks regarding the Supreme Court’s hearing of Noem v. Vasquez. “Kavanaugh did not explain how agents were supposed to figure out those factors.”

Hernández explained that he and a friend, “just two brown-skin Latinos speaking Spanish” were having coffee.

“If we said one word to each other in English, it is one more than I can recall. If an immigration agent happened to be nearby, would they hear my conversation, not in English, and then decide that it must be because I cannot speak English?” Hernández asked. “What type of work would they decide I do? Would they assume that I am a tenured, full professor who holds an endowed chair at one of the country’s premier public universities?”

Hernández also spoke about the contingency surrounding the 14th Amendment, which states that people born of naturalized citizenship in the U.S. are citizens of the U.S. and that no state can enforce a law that can abridge the privileges and immunities of citizenship. Upon Trump’s second term, he challenged the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and what it means to be a “natural-born citizen” through an executive order. Trump argues that birthright citizenship should not automatically apply to children born to undocumented immigrants or parents without permanent legal status.

Hernández said that if this case is constitutionalized, “It will leave many of us without the U.S. citizenship we thought was woven into our legal DNA.”

In September 2025, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case. The court will likely not have a decision until mid-2026.

He closed his lecture with sobering remarks.

“We struggle to agree about whether what we see is real,” Hernández said. “We struggle to agree on whether the days are dominated by light or by darkness. We struggle to agree on whether the political storm in which we find ourselves is one of rejuvenation or one of decay.”

Hernández is currently the Gregory H. Williams Chair of Civil Rights and Liberties at Ohio State. Hernández has earned recognition as one of the top 10 most cited immigration law scholars in the U.S. Among being a scholar and author, Hernández is a former member of the ABA Commission on Immigration.

Simmons Law School Dean Hannah Brenner Johnson explained the importance of these lectures and continued conversations. She said the lecture was created in honor of the school’s founding dean, Hiram Lesar, whose work revolved around civil rights and public policy.

“I think at this particular point in our nation’s history, immigration is a very, very hot-button issue. So, it was very timely to bring a scholar in to talk about some of the constitutional issues that have arisen, and to also bring humanity to the problem as well,” Johnson said.

Attendee Sheila Simon, former lieutenant governor of Illinois and Simmons Law School professor, offered her perspective on Hernández’s lecture in an interview with the DE.

“I think it’s really important for them (law students) to hear the importance of conversation and the continued dialogue, and valuing the rule of law as a way to prevent violence,” Simon said.

A mob of anti-ICE agitators stormed a church Sunday in St. Paul, Minnesota, interrupting a worship service after protesters claimed a pastor inside was affiliated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Video shows agitators chanting ""Justice for Renee Good"" inside the sanctuary at Cities Church as the service began, raising concerns among law enforcement and religious leaders about protesters targeting houses of worship amid escalating anti-ICE demonstrations across the Twin Cities.

The person filming then described the disruption as a ""clandestine mission"" and claimed agitators had just learned one of the pastors at the church was connected to ICE.

Frey has defended the protests, pushing back on federal officials who have described the demonstrations as dangerous or lawless and rejecting claims that state and local leaders are responsible for fueling unrest.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.
Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.
In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.","McALLEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — In October, agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a major operation in McAllen.

The agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — raided five used-clothes warehouses, arrested more than 20 people and seized $176,000.

Three months later, as the cases head to trial, prosecutors want to ban any mention of ICE, masks or guns from the courtroom.

“The concern is that all this media attention surrounding these ICE shootings and ICE raids and things, they really strike an emotional chord with people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Lyles said during a hearing on Monday. “And the concern is that the jury would be triggered by use of ‘ICE,’ ‘masks,’ ‘firearms,’ and ‘yelling and screaming,’ and decide the case based on their emotions and ignore the court’s instructions to weigh the evidence.”

Jurors should focus on the facts, Lyles said, not how ICE conducted the raids.

Lyles summarized the government’s argument during a hearing in the case against Pedro Quintero Cardenas, 29, of Mission.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.

Cardenas General Merchandise purchased used clothing from Goodwill locations in Ohio and Maine, according to documents filed in an unrelated lawsuit. The clothing is typically sold to customers in Mexico.

Agents raided Cardenas General Merchandise and detained 23 people on Oct. 2.

Twelve had tourist visas, according to the criminal complaint against Cardenas. Another 11 had no legal status in the United States.

“He admitted to hiring visa holders and undocumented individuals,” Mirna Garcia, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE, testified during a hearing in October. “He also admitted to paying them in cash and not withholding taxes or Social Security from their paychecks.”

People with tourist visas can’t work in the United States.

“The business itself was an illegal enterprise,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Cook Profit said during the October hearing, “because it was employing these illegal individuals who had no status to work in the United States.”

A grand jury indicted Quintero on eight charges, including participating in a conspiracy to encourage non-citizens to illegally enter or reside in the United States. He pleaded not guilty.

Quintero returned to court Monday.

Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.

“The jury has a right to know all the details — all the facts — of the case,” attorney Edelmiro Arredondo III, who represents Quintero, told a judge.

Arredondo said the details would provide “a more colorful picture” for the jury.

“The government’s position is that allowing all this ‘color’ that defense counsel wants into the depositions will seriously risk jury nullification,” Lyles said.

Mentions of ICE, masks or guns are “completely irrelevant,” Lyles said, to whether Quintero encouraged non-citizens to enter or reside in the United States.

“It’s clear, I think, that use of those words risks inflaming the jury, creating undue prejudice and jury nullification,” Lyles said.

It wasn’t the first time Lyles had made that argument.

In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.

Attorneys largely avoided both topics. After more than six hours of deliberation, jurors found the man guilty.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Juan F. Alanis, who presided over the hearing on Monday, granted the government’s motion to prohibit “argument or evidence designed to elicit jury nullification,” but refused to ban any mention of ICE, masks, guns or yelling and screaming.

“If they’re with ICE, that’s a factual statement,” Alanis said. “If they had masks on, that’s a factual statement. If they had their firearms in use, that’s a factual statement.”

Alanis noted that he wasn’t present when agents executed the search warrants and didn’t know what, exactly, happened.

“If, for whatever reason, they felt a need — they had to raise their voice to get control of the situation, that may be just a factual statement,” Alanis said. “I don’t know.”

The ruling is limited to depositions in the case against Quintero. Prosecutors remain free to make a similar request before trial.

“I understand the government’s concern,” Alanis said. “The defense is on notice: If they decide to grandstand or go beyond just asking the straightforward questions, at a later date a judge may disallow that information being played before a jury.”

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.
Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.
This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.
The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.","The Legal Ombudsman (LeO) has been ordered to reconsider part of its findings of poor service by a direct access barrister after it overlooked a key piece of evidence.

However, Marcus Pilgerstorfer KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, dismissed all of Md Abu Sufian’s other challenges to LeO’s decision.

Aside from the mistake of fact, he found neither procedural faults in the way LeO dealt with the case nor unreasonableness or irrationality in its decision making.

Mr Sufian, head of 160 Fleet Street Chambers in London, for ‘Client N’ on several pieces of immigration work, including two oral permission hearings in judicial review proceedings, preparing an appeal to the Court of Appeal – which was conceded before the hearing and led to an order of £16,350 in costs in favour of his client – and a successful challenge to directions to remove the client from the country, again with costs.

Client N complained to Mr Sufian’s chambers about various matters, including that the Court of Appeal costs were paid directly to the barrister. These were rejected, with the chambers saying Client N authorised payment of the costs direct to him.

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.

She found Client N had agreed that Mr Sufian could keep the Court of Appeal costs but went on to decide he failed to provide adequate costs information throughout his instruction, backdated one client-care letter, and failed to inform her of the costs award.

In deciding remedy, Ms Logue found that Mr Sufian received £27,210.50 but that Client N only reasonably expected to pay £17,298 based on the costs information provided.

However, if she ordered him to refund the difference of £9,912.50, that would have meant Mr Sufian receiving only 39% of the overall costs bill of £44,598. Given that the quality of the actual legal work was good, this would be unfair, Ms Logue decided.

Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.

The barrister brought a judicial review on multiple grounds and the only successful element was over one piece of work for which LeO said he did not provide costs information when in fact the client-care letter had expressly quoted a fee of £7,500.

LeO accepted that the evidence pack Ms Logue had used was missing the relevant page and that this amounted to a mistake of existing fact.

This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.

Further, it affected the decision on remedy. Under Ms Logue’s original methodology, adding £7,500 to the fees Client N reasonably expected to pay would have meant Mr Sufian was only overpaid by £2,412.50. Given that, she may well have stuck with that approach.

The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.",https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Marcus-Pilgerstorfer-KC.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:10.010092

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include: The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare.","Did you know that Australia has no national human rights framework? Australia has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since 1948, but this has never been adopted into Australian law.

There are state and territory-based human rights charters in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, with legislation introduced in NSW in October 2025. However, these do not bind our federal government and are not necessarily very effective in enforcing human rights. Governments remain able to have the final say without oversight on whether a law or decision will infringe on a person or group’s human rights.

The national campaign for a Human Rights Act is well underway, and the ANMF has signed onto this campaign as a supporter. So, what would a national Human Rights Act look like, and how would it operate?

History of the campaign

There have been several attempts to launch a Human Rights Act in previous decades, the most recent of which occurred during the Rudd government. The concept of enshrining human rights on a national level appears inherently good, but the campaign has historically failed due to a lack of political will. After all, a large part of a Human Rights Act would be to require governments to consider human rights when making laws and decisions.

What will a Human Rights Act do?

Put simply, a Human Rights Act would do three core things:

Hold our governments accountable.

Consolidate and promote our national values of equality and non-discrimination.

Align our laws with our international obligations and provide legal clarity.

In doing these three things, a Human Rights Act would allow everyone in Australia to look to a set of rights that encapsulates our values and provides an understanding of what people can and cannot do, consistent with a rights-based framework.

Given the federal government makes laws and decisions in relation to key areas like immigration, childcare, aged care, welfare, taxation, and some aspects of health and housing, it is important they are bound by a human rights framework. A Human Rights Act would make sure the government considers our human rights and acts without breaching them. Key examples where a human rights framework would have impacted and potentially prevented poor decision-making include the Robodebt crisis or the use of indefinite immigration detention.

Finally, a Human Rights Act would enable the enforcement of our rights by the courts and prosecutions when they are breached. Individuals or groups would have a clear framework by which they can assess whether their rights have been breached and strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure those breaches do not continue.

How will a Human Rights Act impact ANMF members and patients?

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include:

The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare. It also ensures the underlying determinants of health including environment and work facilitate a person’s good health. This right in particular would have huge impacts for our members and patients across the health system, ensuring healthcare is delivered in a safe environment and at a high quality by appropriately qualified people.

The right to an adequate standard of living: this right would guide housing policy to ensure it is available and affordable, particularly for public and social housing. It would also impact welfare policy to ensure that our society’s most vulnerable are able to have dignity in their lives.

The right to privacy: in an increasingly digitised world, this right would ensure everyone has their privacy and data protected.

Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.
In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.
In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car.
Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’” After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital.","Newly obtained videos of the moments right after the Wednesday incident in which an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis appear to contradict at least some of ICE’s claims about events leading up to the shooting.

In a statement Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the agent targeted, chased and then shot the man in self-defense as the agent was being “ambushed” by three people. But accounts in the videos contradict the identity of the person DHS says federal agents chased, and the details of the shooting itself.

According to DHS, federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when, they say, Julio Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” one of its officers. During the struggle, DHS said in the statement, two additional people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer using a snow shovel and a broom handle.

According to DHS, Sosa-Celis “got loose” and began striking an agent “with a shovel or broom stick.” DHS says the agent then “fired a defensive shot,” which hit Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The three people who allegedly assaulted the officer ran into the apartment building and barricaded themselves before agents arrested all three, DHS said.

But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story. One of them shows a video call made by Sosa-Celis’ partner and reviewed by CNN, frantically describing to family members what she says happened, according to Alicia Celis, the mother of Sosa-Celis, who spoke to CNN.

The call appears to contradict ICE’s claims in DHS’ Thursday statement. There, ICE said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving a vehicle that crashed, and Sosa-Celis who fled on foot before agents struggled with him on the ground.

In the call, Sosa-Celis’ partner seems to say the driver of the car was not Sosa-Celis, but Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna — another man ICE detained during the same raid.

“Julio arrived first. They were chasing Alfredo — he had to jump from his car,” Sosa-Celis’ partner says during the call. “He ran and they threw themselves on top of him. After, Julio threw open the door, and they shot.”

The incident marks the second time in a week an immigration agent shot someone while on the job, sparking heated clashes in Minnesota and prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to use the Insurrection Act. Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.

Sosa-Celis was taken to an ambulance and hospitalized; the city of Minneapolis confirmed he had non-life-threatening injuries. CNN has contacted city officials to determine whether he is still hospitalized.

In a statement to CNN on Saturday, DHS stood by its initial statement that the subject of the raid on Wednesday was Sosa-Celis and that he was driving the vehicle.

The family’s version of events, heard in a livestreamed Facebook video when family members frantically called 911 to ask for help, also differs from DHS’ statement.

In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.

“They were following my husband for about 30 minutes. They were trying to crash into him. He arrived at home and because we closed the door on them, they shot him!” a woman can be heard telling the dispatcher. It’s not clear who is speaking or whether Sosa-Celis is the person referred to as being followed.

Throughout the initial video, several family members can be heard pleading with the dispatcher for help.

“Where did they shoot your cousin?” a 911 dispatcher asks the family over the phone. “In the leg! The leg! Please help us! We have kids!” a man responds.

“We have a small child in the house!” one woman says in the background. “And if they shoot?” another woman asks.

“Do you know who shot them?” the dispatcher asks the group. “The ones from ICE! The ones from ICE!” a man replies.

The stream ends with the family continuing to speak with the dispatcher on the phone.

A different video obtained by CNN shows what was happening outside the home while the family waited inside.

In the video, agents are seen approaching the home and setting off a flash-bang. Smoke can be seen, and ramming sounds are heard as someone says, “They’re in! There’s more than a dozen of them.”

Mothers of detained men dispute DHS statement

Alicia Celis also told CNN she has spoken to her son only once, briefly, from the hospital after the shooting. Celis said she had not asked her son about ICE’s claim he attacked agents with a broom or shovel.

“(Julio) only called me to tell me that he is fine, for me not to worry, and for me to stay calm and not cry,” Celis said.

In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car. DHS also described the agent as “fearing for his life” when he fired the shot. But in an interview with CNN, Mabel Aljorna, the mother of Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, disputed both of those claims on the basis of her conversation with her son immediately after the shooting.

Aljorna said her son told her he was the one being pursued on foot by ICE, and that Sosa-Celis was already inside the home when the agent shot him — not outside, where ICE says the agent fired the shot.

“He told me, ‘Mom, ICE was chasing me. Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’”

After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital. In that video, he says there was a physical confrontation between him and agents before the shooting as he tried to help Aljorna get inside the home.

However, he also claims he was inside the house and the ICE agent was outside — and the two were separated by a closed door — when the agent shot him, while Sosa-Celis was locking the door and Aljorna was already inside.

“What happened was that ICE had been chasing my cousin from far way. He came over here, and he tried coming to the house,” Sosa-Celis said. “He got there and he was able to escape. We struggled with them. We were successful in helping my cousin get inside. And as I tried shutting the door, ICE shot me in the leg.”

“The shot that was fired happened when my cousin managed to escape, and he entered inside,” Sosa-Celis said on the livestream. “I closed the door. And as I was locking it, I heard the shot, and that’s when I realized I had been shot in the leg.”

CNN visited the home Friday. The front doorway was boarded up and there was no evidence to be found about the condition of the front door at the time of the shooting.

CNN has been unable to directly reach Sosa-Celis and Aljorna for comment.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256383698.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 19:57:53.573433

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.
Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.
While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.
Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison.","In his first year back in office, President Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration, launching the most visible enforcement effort seen in history while closing the door to many legal pathways for entering the U.S.

Trump promised to plug the border and crack down hard on those living in the country illegally, and under his tenure crossings have fallen to a historic low while the number of people kept in immigration detention centers has soared.

Whether Trump has fulfilled his promise to go after the worst of the worst when it comes to immigrants in the country illegally is in dispute. More than 70 percent of those held in immigration detention have no prior criminal record.

Separately, many of those targeted have legal status in the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes to end, pause or limit various ways to lawfully live in the country.

The crackdown may also be negatively impacting Trump’s polling numbers.

Polling shows Trump’s approval rating has slipped from 50 percent to 40 percent in the span of a year. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 57 percent of respondents said they did not approve of how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration laws. And a poll from The Economist saw a surge in support for abolishing ICE, with 46 percent recently saying they wanted to scrap the agency, up from 27 percent in July.

Republicans described the year as a culmination of Trump’s most prominent campaign pledge.

“Our job is pretty basic. What did you tell the voters you were going to do when you ran for it? If you get elected, go do what you say. No one does that better than President Trump,” said Rep Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the president’s allies in Congress.

“He told us he could secure the border. He did it in like four months time.”

Democrats argue Trump’s actions have at times descended into unlawful territory.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), who has introduced legislation to shift a number of immigration enforcement policies, said Trump’s actions “completely demeans and denigrates the American values that this country has lived, has relied on for 250 years.”

“The damage to the country is far greater than the actual policy or even the deportation results, because what he’s attacking are the very fundamental values that have been the bedrock of this country since its founding, which is that it’s the land of opportunity that was built by immigrants, has been a refuge for those who are suffering around the world,” he said.

A focus on immigrants with legal status

While Trump pledged to remove those in the country illegally, the president has taken a whirlwind of actions that instead target immigrants with legal status.

“The truth is that the Trump administration campaigned on immigration reform, but what we’ve seen and what he’s delivered goes well beyond what he said,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.

In his first year back on the job, Trump has ordered a re-review of the 200,000 refugees who had been admitted under the Biden administration, a group that undergoes some of the most rigorous vetting before arriving in the U.S.

And in the wake of the killing in November of a National Guard officer in Washington, D.C., Trump paused the processing of pending immigration petitions for people from 19 countries on the travel ban list, a group that grew significantly as the president expanded the ban to 39 countries. The move meant those seeking green cards or even set to naturalize were stuck in limbo, unable to advance their petitions.

In March, Trump said he would strip the parole status former President Biden gave to citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras, curtailing the two-year status and forcing roughly 530,000 people to leave the country.

Trump has also moved to scrap deportation protections for 12 of the 17 countries designated for so-called temporary protected status (TPS).

Meant to block deportation of citizens whose home countries are experiencing natural disasters or civil unrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeated the same refrain as it has ended the status country by country: “Temporary means temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in ending the TPS for Somalia.

Collectively, lifting TPS jeopardizes the status of more than 1 million people, and it’s one of the few issues that has sparked some pushback from within the GOP.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R), whose Florida district includes many people who came in on parole or were covered by TPS, said the process needs more “nuance” to account for those who had legitimate concerns in fleeing dictatorial regimes.

He blamed Biden for a poor process that is “creating a very difficult situation to actually solve this issue for folks who, by the way, are here and are good people, and they committed the original sin, right, [on immigration]. But then most Americans understand, [for] those people, we should have a process,” Diaz-Balart said.

The Trump administration has also revoked 8,000 student visas amid a pushback on people it says have espoused views counter to U.S. interests. The majority of those visas revoked appear to be for committing crimes while in the country, but at least 200 to 300 visas were revoked over alleged support for terrorism, a term the department used for some who have protested the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Beyond students and faculty, the State Department also rescinded permissions for five technology researchers focusing on disinformation the Trump team accused of targeting conservative speech.

Immigration advocates say the move is a clear infringement on free speech.

“One of the ways that they have used the immigration system to impact democratic norms is in the weaponization and targeting people for what is speech, using the system against people who dare say something that the administration disagrees with — not [speech] that is illegal by any means, just not something that they that they want to hear,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

Trump has also sought to prevent new immigration to the U.S. through various moves.

In October the president set the lowest refugee cap in history, allowing just 7,500 refugees to come into the country in the coming year, down from the goal of 125,000 set under Biden. In addition, Trump has dictated that accepted refugees should primarily be white South Africans.

Beyond the initial travel ban, Trump announced last week he would also pause immigration visa processing for 75 countries, effectively blocking immigration from nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe.

Trump also suspended the green-card lottery, targeting the method the Brown University shooter used to arrive in the U.S., upending a program that allows up to 55,000 people a year to migrate.

Trump has opened up some new immigration pathways, but those options have been tied to hefty fees. He revamped the investor visa as a so-called Gold Card for those willing to pay $1 million. H-1B visas now also come with a $100,000 price tag.

Visible enforcement and growing detention

Trump has fundamentally changed the dynamic at the southern border as well as how immigration officials carry out enforcement across the country, part of a widely publicized campaign.

Data tracking crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border shows a nosedive from roughly 100,000 a month under the last few months of the Biden administration to an average of around 10,000 a month since Trump retook office.

Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.

“We’ve pretty much solved that problem,” Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), chair of the House Republican Conference, said of the border.

“So I think it’s been pretty doggone good. It’s been so doggone good that we don’t even talk about the border anymore. That is absolutely fantastic.”

Much of Trump’s focus has been on removing people already in the country as the president has sought to impose the largest mass deportation effort in history.

Rates of those held in immigration detention are also at their highest ever, with some 70,000 people currently locked up and facing deportation.

However, 73 percent of those currently held in detention have no criminal record. The data, compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, indicates that within the 28 percent who do have a criminal record, “many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.”

“‘Mass deportation’ isn’t possible with any kind of targeted approach,” Loweree said. “Their promises to deport people en masse by going after ‘criminals’ were a lie from the start.”

The tactics used by the administration to remove people have also come under significant scrutiny.

ICE officers, backed by other DHS officials, have been dispatched to carry out raids in left-leaning cities across the country. Tracked by protesters and observers, city-by-city footage has emerged of aggressive and at times violent enforcement.

ICE’s policies have particularly come under scrutiny since an officer shot and killed Renee Good on a Minneapolis street earlier this month. The administration argues the ICE officer feared for his life because Good, driving her car, was threatening him. City and state officials argue the ICE officer acted recklessly.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said those images have been a turning point for the public, referencing video of ICE officers cutting a woman’s seatbelt to drag her out of her car as well as the viral footage of Good’s death.

“The American people are changing their views on immigration, whereas immigration, maybe in the past, was seen as a negative thing, a bad thing, I think all polls show that that’s no longer the case,” he said. “And I think the American people are more empathetic about immigrants in the plight of immigrants, as they see with their very own eyes, what’s happening across the country.”

In the wake of Good’s death, the administration has largely doubled down, accusing her of acting as a domestic terrorist while noting attacks against ICE officers.

While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.

“ICE isn’t the problem. The problem is sanctuary politicians and the violent criminal illegal aliens they protect,” Noem recently wrote on social platform X.

“President Trump and this administration work to protect every single American and make sure that they can live in a safe community and can raise their kids without fear.”

Court battles on policy and with judges themselves

Many of Trump’s immigration moves have been paused or overturned by the courts, but the Trump administration has aggressively fought those orders and, in some cases, defied a judge’s directives.

The Trump administration faced a contempt of court inquiry after it sent more than 100 Venezuelan men to be imprisoned in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Numerous courts ruled Trump did not have the power to expel the men without giving them the chance to contest allegations of gang ties.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg determined the Trump team “secretly spirit[ed]” them away after his order to halt or turn around any flights. After Boasberg issued an additional ruling offering the Venezuelans a way to return to the U.S. to continue their court battles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they would not return, citing ongoing negotiations after toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison. Abrego Garcia, who was previously protected from being deported to his home country, was removed because of an administrative error. While numerous courts ordered the administration to attempt his return, it did not do so until it brought him back to face human trafficking charges relating to a 2022 traffic stop.

After lawmakers won a suit challenging a DHS policy seeking to block them from making unannounced visits to detention centers, Noem again tried to enforce the policy.

The Trump administration has also come under fire for interfering with the immigration court system, where migrants pursue asylum and other legal claims for remaining in the country. In some cases, prosecutors pushed to dismiss cases, only to end someone’s legal claim so an officer waiting outside the courtroom could arrest them and fast-track their deportation.

Goldman, who has sought to bar the practice, noted migrants who are pursuing a lawful pathway to immigration cannot be deported.

“The courthouse stuff is the betrayal of the promises of the campaign, when Donald Trump said that he would be focusing on going after the worst of the worst, citing murderers and rapists and sex traffickers and horrific violent criminals,” he told The Hill.

“To turn around and be so lazy and ineffective that they resort to just waiting for people who are following the requirements of immigration law, showing up for court appearances, showing up for their required check-ins, and instead of getting a benefit from doing things the right way, they’re getting smashed and detained and deported. And it’s such a sabotage and it’s so repulsive that rather than going after serious felons who should be deported they’re going after the people trying to do it the right way.”

Trump has faced roughly 150 major lawsuits challenging his immigration policies, and many of his moves remain tied up in court.

An effort by Trump to scrap birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are not American, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, is set to be weighed by the Supreme Court this spring.

He has also tried through numerous different policies and executive orders to end the legal right to asylum, effectively ending the pathway.

Many of Trump’s attempts at scrapping TPS have also been halted, in some cases because the administration failed to follow a process that requires offering detailed analysis of how country conditions have shifted.

But the Supreme Court has also repeatedly blocked lower court injunctions, allowing the Trump administration to continue to deport people to countries they are not from and to force those on parole to leave the country.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back on criticism of Trump, arguing he is using all the legal levers at his disposal to remove those not lawfully present in the U.S.

“He’s simply enforcing the law and a policy of enforcing the law, even one that did not prioritize criminal aliens, would still be enforcing the law,” he said.

“The fact that we had four years of not enforcing the law, flagrantly ignoring the intent of Congress and existing laws, is the four years of criminal conduct by Joe Biden.”

The 3 years ahead

Much of Trump’s immigration push is only just beginning.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump was given $45 billion in ICE funding to expand detention capacity to 135,000 at any given time.

Already the administration has struggled to secure facilities to house the migrants it wishes to detain, pushing them to work with states to line up more space. That includes so-called Alligator Alcatraz, a facility made of tents and chain link fences constructed in just days on an old airway strip in Florida.

Immigration advocates fear many who pose no real threat will continue to be exposed to harsh detention conditions.

“The fact that we’re spending billions of American taxpayer money on detaining individuals who are not criminals, who are not risks to our country, is outrageous,” said Dalal-Dheini, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Some in the GOP are hopeful that the trickle of migrants will mean the party will make good on its promise to review immigration reform once the border is secure.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a former federal prosecutor, said that the focus should be on dangerous criminals and lamented that some industries, including those that need seasonal workers, have been hit hard by Trump’s enforcement.

“They always say, ‘Well, you gotta wait till the border’s secure to talk about immigration reform.’ So then that’s going to be the next debate,” he said.

“We got to look at some common sense solutions,” he said. “There are industries that really need the labor, and that’s the ag industry – I talk to them all the time, the construction, the restaurant [industries].”

He also noted areas like the tech sector also need workers.

Democrats hope to win back the House majority this fall and then have greater power to investigate the administration and curtail its immigration practices.

“This is a marathon. This is not a sprint. And so, yeah, people feel exhausted. I’m a fighter,” Espaillat said.

“I want to see how we could combat [Trump] and make sure that the right things are done.”

But others see Trump’s immigration moves as part of a broader militarization that aligns with decisions to flex U.S. might and trample on the rights of citizens and residents.

“I’m scared,” Goldman said when asked about possibilities under the rest of Trump’s term.

“It’s getting worse and worse and worse.”

Sebastian Ordonez, 58, was detained Thursday morning by ICE agents after leaving his Brooklyn apartment building because he lacked legal immigration status, according to Zhuang.

Ordonez is from Guatemala, but his family and close friends say he has no history of violent crime and has been part of the Brooklyn community for nearly 20 years.

Though his lawyer, Michael Musa-Obregon, believes his client is not legally in the country, he says “everybody is entitled to due process.”

“You cannot just randomly walk up to people, racially profile them, look at them like they’re other. And because of the color of their skin, and their mannerisms, or whatever other things you have as an agent in your brain, assume or presume that they are here illegally,” Obregon said.

“We have to stand up against this nonsense. Against this illegal act by our president,” Councilmember Susan Zhuang said. “We have to make sure everyone deserves due process, regardless of what legal status you have in this country.”

Solidarity follows Ordonez’s detention and the federal visa ban on 75 countries deemed likely to need public assistance in the U.S.

That omission added to speculation that the group may have a broader mandate to cover other conflicts and could even be aimed at creating a U.S.-dominated alternative to the United Nations Security Council.

A Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 endorsed Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and welcomed the establishment of the board as a transitional administration that would set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment.

The enclave was devastated during the two years of war. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. Many of the roughly 2 million residents are still living in tents among millions of tons of rubble.

The board’s charter was sent out with invitations to potential members over the weekend. A copy reviewed by The Times was verified by an official on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy. News of the $1 billion buy-in was previously reported by Bloomberg.

On Friday, the White House announced the board’s members would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Ajay Banga, the head of the World Bank.

Several countries said they had received invitations to join, including Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Turkey. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also been invited, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.

Mr. Trump, who is to chair the board, said in a post on Truth Social last week that it will be “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though much about it remained unclear.

The charter appears to outline a much more ambitious role for the board than the one described in Mr. Trump’s plan for Gaza, published in October 2025, as well as the subsequent Security Council resolution.

The board’s mission, according to the charter, is to seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” and “to undertake peace-building functions in accordance with international law.”

The preamble emphasizes the need for what it calls “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body” and laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalize crisis rather than leading people beyond it.”

According to the charter, the board is expected to meet for voting at least annually, and expenses are to be funded through voluntary contributions from member states or other sources. The charter does not elaborate on the peacekeeping efforts.

Along with the “Board of Peace,” the White House on Friday also outlined a “Gaza Executive Board” that would help liaise with a committee of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer daily life in Gaza. The Gaza executive board includes Ali al-Thawadi, a senior Qatari official, and Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, among others.

The composition of the executive board prompted the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a rare public protest against the Trump administration, saying it “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.”

While an Israeli businessman is on the executive board, Israeli government officials have not been named to it.

Miri Regev, an Israeli minister from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, told Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, on Saturday that Israel objected to participation of Qatar and Turkey, adding, “Prime Minister Netanyahu will do everything to change that decision.”

Relations between Israel and Turkey have oscillated over the decades, but since the war in Gaza, set off by Hamas’s attack against Israel in October 2023, they have deteriorated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has downgraded ties with Israel, repeatedly compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and praised Hamas, while hosting its officials. Israeli officials are anxious about the prospect of Turkey gaining influence over Gaza’s future.

After Israel struck Qatar in September 2025 in a failed attempt to kill Hamas leaders meeting there, Mr. Netanyahu defended the action and lashed out against the country for giving what he called “safe haven” to the militant group, even as Qatar was trying to negotiate a cease-fire.

Qatari officials have said they hosted Hamas officials at the request of the U.S. government to facilitate channels of communication. Mr. Netanyahu has in the past relied on Qatar to send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, a policy that was intended to keep the peace but that also helped prop up Hamas’s rule over the territory.

Israel’s priority is seeing Gaza demilitarized. Hamas so far has not agreed to lay down its arms.

But after being pressed on a video that backed up the accounts provided to the court, she changed course. Protesters were to blame for the use of force, she said, adding that federal officers “only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating.”

The ruling on Friday by Judge Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court in Minnesota said that chemical agents had been used against protesters on at least four separate occasions and called the evidence of their use “uncontroverted.”

“Federal agents used chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected First Amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations,” the judge wrote in issuing her injunction, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In response to an inquiry about Ms. Noem’s comments, Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokeswoman, did not comment on Ms. Noem’s initial denial and backtracking of immigration agents’ use of force. Instead, she emphasized that assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony, and accused protesters of tampering with agents’ vehicles and attacking officers with fireworks and automobiles.

Judge Menendez had dismissed the government’s claims that all use of pepper spray and other chemical irritants had happened after agents were “attacked,” finding that “protected conduct,” including protesting and observing the operations, had “motivated” the agents’ “adverse actions.”

The injunction issued last week stemmed from a lawsuit filed by activists who have protested the crackdown or observed the department’s operations in Minnesota. The suit was filed in December, before an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, prompting increased protests against the crackdown.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive away, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

In addition to barring agents from using “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech, Judge Menendez also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

On Sunday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended the Justice Department’s decision to not investigate the agent who fatally shot Ms. Good, saying that doing so would be bowing to “pressure from the media” and politicians.

“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate, and that is not the case here,” Mr. Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody.”

The Justice Department has instead pushed to investigate Ms. Good’s widow, prompting several federal prosecutors in the state to resign.

Ms. Noem said during the interview that her department was conducting a separate, internal review of the agent’s actions, “following the exact same investigative and review process” that existed for years.

Even as critics of the government’s tactics say the operations, particularly in Minnesota, have indiscriminately swept up individuals based on racial and ethnic profiling, President Trump and members of his administration have insisted they are aimed at violent criminals.

Department of Homeland Security officials have repeatedly said that 70 percent of those detained in the administration’s immigration crackdown have been charged or convicted of a crime. That figure is roughly in line with a New York Times analysis of immigration arrests between the start of Mr. Trump’s term and Oct. 15, which found that 67 percent of those taken into custody had been at least charged with a crime of some kind.

But Ms. Noem on Sunday went a step further. “Every single individual” arrested by immigration agents had broken the law, she told “Face the Nation,” adding that 70 percent of those detained had either committed or been charged with violent crimes specifically.

Ms. McLaughlin, the department spokeswoman, did not respond directly to an inquiry about that statement, but repeated the department’s position that 70 percent of those arrested had been convicted or at least charged with a crime of some kind.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

Undeterred, Mr. Springsteen released a six-track EP that offered a mix of songs and his political remarks from the show in England. That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

Even so, the Pentagon last week put troops with two infantry battalions with the Army’s 11th Airborne Division on alert in case they ended up being called up, two Defense officials said.

“The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander in chief if called upon,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement, using the Trump administration’s preferred moniker for the department.

The Pentagon last week also quietly alerted 200 Texas National Guard troops to be ready to deploy to Minnesota in the event that Mr. Trump followed through with his threat. The Texas Guard soldiers have remained on standby since returning home from Chicago late last year.

But the deployment of troops from the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, would be a major escalation for Mr. Trump, who has already sent National Guard troops into a number of American cities.

The use of military force on domestic soil in the United States is rare, and it is usually reserved only for the most extreme situations. Active-duty forces are barred from domestic law enforcement unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act, which allows for the use of federal troops on U.S. soil.

The order putting the troops on notice to deploy was reported earlier by ABC News.

On Friday, a day after issuing his Insurrection Act threat, Mr. Trump appeared to walk back his comments. “I don’t think I need it right now,” he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend in Florida.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, urged Mr. Trump on Thursday to back off the heated rhetoric. “Let’s turn the temperature down,” the governor wrote on social media. “Stop this campaign of retribution.”

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into Mr. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, an escalation in the state-federal battle over the conduct of immigration agents in the city.

Mr. Trump was talked out of invoking the Insurrection Act in 2020 following the protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman. At the time, his defense secretary, attorney general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all advised him against sending active-duty troops into American cities to battle local citizens.

But Mr. Trump has a much more compliant Pentagon in his second term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has worked to amplify Mr. Trump’s directives and inclinations, rather than seek to restrain him.

One defense official said on Sunday that the Pentagon was aware that Mr. Trump had appeared to back away from his threat, but also said that Mr. Hegseth wanted to be prepared.

“RUN JULIA RUN!!!” Mr. Trump wrote, adding that “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement.”

The move is likely to create new tensions between Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans.

Mr. Trump called Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, on Friday and said he was likely to endorse Ms. Letlow, according to a person briefed on the conversation who was not authorized to discuss the private remarks.

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future. The majority leader also noted that Mr. Trump was starting to push a major health care bill, which Mr. Cassidy would have jurisdiction over as chairman of the Senate’s health committee.

Mr. Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump in a social media post of his own on Saturday night: “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”

Ms. Letlow did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night, but on social media, she wrote that she was honored by the endorsement and made it clear that she was likely to announce a campaign.

“This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver,” she wrote.

The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night. The congresswoman had told people she would not enter the race without Mr. Trump’s official backing. But the move had long been in the works.

Mr. Trump first met with Ms. Letlow on March 5 of last year, the morning after the president’s address to a joint session of Congress. The Oval Office meeting included, among others, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; James Blair, a deputy chief of staff; and Representative Lance Gooden of Texas. Mr. Gooden helped arrange the meeting with Ms. Letlow.

In the meeting, Mr. Trump told Ms. Letlow that he would support her if she decided to challenge Mr. Cassidy, according to a person who was in the room and insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation. But he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.

Ms. Letlow, a former teacher whose political profile in her state grew when redistricting added Baton Rouge to her mostly rural constituency, is not known in the Capitol as an aggressive politician. She was hesitant to make any moves with only private assurances of Mr. Trump’s support.

Ms. Letlow spoke again with the president at the congressional picnic on June 12.

He again privately expressed his support, according to a person who heard their conversation. But he had still said nothing publicly. And she had still heard nothing more concrete from Mr. Trump or anyone in his political operation as of Dec. 11, when she announced her engagement at a holiday ball at the White House.

Big donors, meanwhile, were still giving money to Mr. Cassidy and telling Ms. Letlow that, until she formally declared that she was running, they would support him.

Ms. Letlow had almost resigned herself to staying out of the race. This month, she filmed two campaign commercials: one for a re-election campaign to the House, and one for a potential Senate race. As the February filing deadline approached, she did not know which one she would be using, according to a person briefed on her campaign plans.

But Ms. Letlow has been building quiet support from encouraging colleagues in the House, who said they expected her to jump in now and campaign aggressively.

Any endorsement of a candidate opposing a sitting senator is viewed as unwelcome by Senate Republicans, and it is a move the conference writ large has sought to avoid. That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.

Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.

But he has taken pains to repair relations with Mr. Trump. As of late Saturday, the post he had pinned atop his X account featured a photograph of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president signed red hats.

“This is what a great working relationship looks like,” the October post from Mr. Cassidy said.

Mr. Trump’s endorsement of a potential Cassidy challenger comes days after the president frustrated Senate Republicans when he declared that five other G.O.P. senators should never be re-elected because of their opposition to him on military intervention in Venezuela. Among them was Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is seen as the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in 2026.

Mr. Trump has also been unwilling to throw his support behind Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who is facing a competitive primary race against two challengers, Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas.

Mr. Thune indicated to reporters last week that, despite his best efforts to persuade the president to back Mr. Cornyn, the three Texans were going to have to “duke it out in the primary.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s latest move.

Alex Latcham, the executive director of the main super PAC aligned with Senate Republicans, said in a statement on Saturday that his group’s mission was “to preserve and expand” the Republican Senate majority.

“Anything that distracts from our efforts to beat Democrats in November is unhelpful,” he said.

The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office held a town hall meeting to discuss public safety, community policing and the implementation of Texas Senate Bill 8.

The town hall meeting was held on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramirez Community Center, located at 106 Payton Rd. The Border Network for Human Rights co-hosted the event.

As KTSM previously reported, SB 8 mandates that every sheriff’s office in Texas counties with a population over 100,000 enter into a 287-G agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under the agreement, trained local officers are allowed to carry out certain federal immigration functions.

Out of the three options given for the agreement, Ugarte said they will move forward with the Warrant Service Officer option: limits participation to serving administrative warrants or detainers on individuals already booked into the county jail.

This means that all warrant checks are done by federal officers, rather than local staff, to see if a detainer or immigration warrant exists for someone booked into the county jail. The bill officially went into effect this year on Jan. 1.

“This is not an option. This is not something that I wanted to do. But the Sheriff’s Office needs to do it because it’s a state law,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte spotlights the current political atmosphere, with ICE raids occurring in El Paso and across the nation, and emphasizes the importance of transparency.

“It’s very important because there’s a lot of confusion, there’s a lot of fear in our community because of what’s going on across the nation with federal agencies. So us, as local officials, it’s important to be transparent and talk to the community and have these forums if they have any questions so they can hear it directly from the Sheriff’s Office on what we are doing,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte also notes that, although the Sheriff’s Office is partnering with federal agencies, the priority of his office will remain focusing on crimes affecting the community.

“We work in collaboration with other agencies, but I want to remind the community that the focus of the Sheriff’s Office is dealing with crimes and issues that affect our community. That is the priority of the Sheriff’s Office,” he said.

He asks that if residents see ICE agents out in El Paso County, to not interfere with the investigations, including blocking roadways, assaulting the agents or damaging any property.

“If you do not agree with ICE and if you want to protest, you have a right to protest, but you need to protest from a distance. Keep your distance from the federal officers so they can do their job and do not interfere with any of their investigations,” Ugarte said.

Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights, said the topic most talked about was concerns about ICE and DHS raids that have been happening in El Paso.

“Outside of the 287-G agreements, the community is really concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s raids that are taking place, about Homeland Security investigation raids that are being taken place, that there is no checks and balance when it comes to the federal organizations, that they are not identifying themselves, to community members that are coming in mass and they wanted to know if there was something that they should do or could do as community members to respond to these outgoing enforcement tactics that are taking place,” Singleton said.

She said that the Sheriff’s Office can assist in situations by confirming if the people investigating are federal agents. Once they have identified that they are agents, the Sheriff’s Office has to back off, as they do not have power over them.

“I believe the community should know that there’s always a way to get involved. So we ask that if you have questions, utilize our organization to be a resource. There are some tools that we have that we can help the community with. Most importantly, we want the community to know that we are here and we are here to assist and that we are each other’s keeper. And so we want you all to reach out to us if there are things that is needed from you,” Singleton said.",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2026/01/EPCSO-BNHR-town-hall-meeting.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:17.244363

He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.
And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.
Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration.","Murphy spoke with POLITICO for an hour last week to reflect on his eight years in office, which concludes on Tuesday. He’s the first Democrat in decades to win two terms in the New Jersey governor’s office, and he steps down with his party on an even stronger footing than when he arrived in Trenton. That may have been hard to fathom when the former Goldman Sachs banker emerged seemingly out of nowhere a decade ago to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

But after years as a finance chair of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, Murphy leveraged his wealth and connections to clear a crowded primary field to become New Jersey’s 56th governor. He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.

Over the course of the conversation, Murphy toggled between national and local fights — from the investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which he called “breathtaking,” to his policy achievements at home, including the legalization of marijuana and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

But, like virtually everything else in American life, Trump dominated. And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.

During the pandemic, Murphy also had a working relationship with former White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom he praised for his efforts to provide ventilators and personal protective equipment. He said that “people forget” that “early on,” the administration was “pretty good on this.”

Murphy said he “expanded” his relationship with the president into “adjacent lanes,” like over the Portal North Bridge, an upgrade project important to the Northeast rail corridor that the Trump administration approved federal funding for later in 2020.

“When he ran the first time, he had a great line, he said, ‘I’m the only president, if I get elected, I’ll be the only president in history who understands what rebar is,’” Murphy said, referring to his discussions of the bridge with Trump. “So I would try to couch it in a lane that I thought would connect with him. So less flattery than, ‘Wait a minute, I know this is his lived experience,’ or knowing New Jersey well.”

There’s less of that this time around. Beyond having what he called a “cordial conversation” with the president after he was elected again, Murphy hasn’t spoken with Trump lately — “it’s not that I wouldn’t speak to him, but it’s just harder,” he said — but talked to chief of staff Susie Wiles a couple of weeks ago.

The difference between the two Trump administrations, Murphy continued, is that “they know what they’re doing” and “there are no, that I can find, powerful voices on the other side of some of the actions.”

“I’m not a big Mike Pompeo fan, but Pompeo is brilliant, number one in his class at West Point — you know, a serious person,” he said. “Or Gary Cohn, who I know well, used to work with at Goldman Sachs, was the national economic adviser, Jared himself, who I have enormous regard for. Those folks are not on the scene, and I feel like that’s the biggest — there’s no ballast.”

Even with a good relationship, New Jersey hasn’t been immune over the years to federal issues trickling down into the states. And there’s been plenty of disagreement between the governor and Trump, including on offshore wind, which the president has sought to kill: “We’ve fought like heck against the Trump team on offshore wind,” Murphy said. “I don’t think it makes any sense.”

New Jersey has also been bullish when it comes to legal action against the administration, with outgoing Attorney General Matt Platkin suing more than 40 times since Trump came back into office.

And Murphy himself hasn’t been completely untouched. Last year, Trump border czar Tom Homan said that Murphy could be prosecuted over a comment he made suggesting he was harboring an immigrant at his home, and former acting U.S. attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating him over immigration enforcement. Nothing came out of either of those threats, according to Murphy.

But the governor said that he found that Trump has not gone “out of his way” to impact the Garden State — and “for the most part” still isn’t.

That doesn’t mean he’s not worried.

“I wake up every day hoping that we don’t get hit in an innocent drive-by shooting [and] the shrapnel comes our direction,” he said. “You’re balancing. You can’t abandon your values. You can’t abandon communities or people who are being attacked for no good reason on the one hand. And on the other hand, you’re trying not to start World War III, and that’s hard.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Those fears have only been exacerbated in recent weeks and months. In Murphy’s view, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “will be awful for New Jersey.” The state, which is home to a prominent population of immigrants and a controversial immigrant detention center, is “not immune” to action from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said, adding that he’s worried a situation like the ICE agent who fatally shot a U.S. citizen in Minnesota could happen here.

Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. When it comes to talk about the U.S. seizing Greenland, he said that discussing “a land grab from an ally and a NATO partner of the United States” is “so beyond the pale.” And the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Powell “further undermines an institution that we’ve spent a couple of centuries building up,” Murphy said.

In just a couple of days, Murphy will hand the keys over to Sherrill, who had a blowout win in November to secure a third Democratic term in a row leading the state, a feat that has not been accomplished for six decades. Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration. In an interview last month, her campaign manager and soon-to-be chief of staff told POLITICO that they would be willing to work with the president if the “administration wants to get on the team” to support her efforts to make “life easier and more affordable for New Jerseyans.”

Trump endorsed Sherrill’s opponent Jack Ciattarelli — a change from previous New Jersey gubernatorial elections. He didn’t get involved in Ciattarelli’s 2021 race against Murphy, nor did he back Murphy’s opponent in 2017.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2F9f%2F184d59794edaa0bd46cbc33ea8df%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2244527993,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:30.119803

Businesses have been forced to close.” Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration.
Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.
Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.
Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled.","Nearly one year after returning to the White House with a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history, masked immigration officers ripped a woman from her car as she tried to get to a doctor’s appointment in Minneapolis. On the other side of the country, a 21-year-old protester in Santa Ana, California, was recovering from eye surgery after an officer fired a riot-control weapon inches from his face.

They both came just days after an officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good.

The Trump administration’s promise to go after the “worst of the worst” in his nationwide campaign to rapidly deport tens of thousands of people has turned American cities into conflict zones patrolled by hundreds of masked and heavily armed officers.

Democratic officials warned for months that a surge of militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers would only stir up more unrest. They warned that the scenes of mass protests were by design, giving the president an opening to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy active-duty troops on Americans in cities run by his political enemies.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has reshaped the government to pursue an anti-immigration agenda across nearly every federal agency, with a mission to find, arrest and deport thousands of people, deter new arrivals and impose new restrictions on legal immigration that have repulsed humanitarian aid groups and civil rights advocates.

Thousands of people, most of whom have never been convicted of a crime, are now locked up in immigration detention centers, entering a byzantine legal process that the administration has pushed to make it virtually impossible to escape.

Federal officers, whose identities are largely kept secret and whose faces are covered, are routinely seen jumping out of cars and vans to round up immigrants and citizens alike, sometimes leaving their cars stranded in roadways or rolling down streets. They leave behind neighborhoods in shock and families in crisis, scrambling where to find members who often end up jailed hundreds of miles from home.

From Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, to Chicago, New York City, New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, footage and stories of violent arrests and volatile protests have emerged at a dizzying pace.

In Washington, D.C., last summer, Trump invoked a never-before-used authority to seize control of the city’s police department as deployed the National Guard and surged federal officers into the streets, claiming the city was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.” Officials there accused the administration of waging a politically motivated “hostile takeover.”

And in Minnesota, where thousands of federal officers descended in recent weeks, “news reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” according to Governor Tim Walz.

“This long ago stopped being a campaign of organized immigration enforcement,” he said January 13. “Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

“People are being racially profiled, harassed, terrorized, and assaulted,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement announcing a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of “spreading terror” in the state. “Schools have gone into lockdown. Businesses have been forced to close.”

Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration. In 2023, he told a crowd in Iowa that he would send troops into Democratic-run cities whether officials there wanted them or not.

“And one of the other things I’ll do — because you’re supposed to not be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in,” he said. “The next time, I’m not waiting.”

Facing widespread protests against his mass deportation campaign, and relying on varying justifications for their deployment, Trump did exactly that. In June, the president began ordering National Guard troops to several Democratic-led cities, an effort that one federal judge rebuked as “a national police force with the president as its chief.”

Legal challenges from state and local officials accused the administration of using American streets for political theater, an attempt to stir up unrest to justify the president’s military and federal law enforcement occupation of cities with large immigrant populations.

In December, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from sending the military into Chicago, and, sensing impending legal failures in the face of other lawsuits over his threats to put boots on the ground, Trump pulled out of the idea altogether on New Year’s Eve.

But the administration has continued to surge officers into Democratic-led cities, dovetailing with the president’s crusade of retribution against his political opponents.

In courtrooms across the country, protesters and detainees alleged officers shot them with chemical weapons at point-blank range, turned neighborhoods into “war zones” filled with tear gas, and racially profiled citizens and Native Americans before hauling them to detention centers.

The administration “has blown through normative guardrails to make mass deportations a central element of government function,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.

That “scorched-earth anti-immigration campaign” is “part of a broader Trump administration assault” on constitutional rights, from the arrests of international scholars Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk that presaged the administration’s threats to dissent, to his ongoing efforts to unilaterally define who gets to be a citizen, according to Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

Days after an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, whose death sparked a renewed wave of protests and political outrage, Trump promised a “day of reckoning” for Minnesota, his latest target. “RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” he wrote.

Less than one year after she was sworn into office, Homeland Security Kristi Noem is now facing threats of impeachment from dozens of Democratic members of Congress. And years after moderate Democratic figures sidelined “abolish ICE” demands, lawmakers entered the new year mulling how to cut off new funding for the agency, potentially triggering yet another government shutdown in Trump’s second presidency.

The “abolish ICE” movement gained momentum on the political left under Trump’s first term after the administration’s catastrophic family separation policy and a fresh wave of raids and arrests. Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.

A record amount of new funding has turned ICE into the single largest federal law enforcement agency in the nation’s history, with nearly $15 billion a year to expand immigration detention and billions more dollars to recruit and hire officers.

Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.

Those arrests exploded alongside a historic expansion of immigration detention, with dozens of jails, makeshift facilities and state-backed facilities such as “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida and a wing of the notorious Angola prison in Louisiana holding more than 60,000 people at any given time, shipped around the country and jailed hundreds of miles from where they were picked up.

Unauthorized arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted. Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled. Detentions are at their highest level in modern American history.

More than 622,000 people were deported by the end of 2025, according to Homeland Security. But as many as 73 percent of those booked into ICE custody last year had no criminal convictions, according to ICE data reviewed by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The administration has also “de-legalized” more than 1.5 million people who were already legally living and working in the United States, swiftly expanding the pool of “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants who were following immigration law until the moment Trump’s government changed it.

Immigration agencies are canceling citizenship hearings and threatening green card holders and married immigrants interviewing for permanent legal status. Officers have arrested thousands of people who were showing up for court-ordered check-ins with ICE or immigration court hearings where they sought to make their case to stay in the country, with federal agents waiting on the other side of the door to literally rip them away from their lawyers and families.

With that radical expansion of the nation’s immigration detention centers came an avalanche of reports of abuse and neglect inside them.

A series of sworn testimonials from detainees at the largest ICE facility in the country allege deteriorating conditions and routine beatings that have left several people hospitalized, including detainees whose testicles were “firmly crushed” by guards.

Federal judges have intervened to force ICE to improve conditions inside facilities in New York and Chicago, where detainees were allegedly forced into cramped cells near open toilets without adequate food, water, clean clothing or a place to bathe or brush their teeth.

“After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district ... I have never encountered anything like this,” Trump-appointed Judge Gary Brown wrote in response to squalid conditions at one facility on Long Island.

He rebuked “chillingly brutal conditions” at the jail and questioned why ICE shouldn’t be held in contempt.

The agency’s behavior “shocks the conscience,” he wrote.",https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/15/14/45/Ongoing-federal-immigration-crackdown-in-Minneapolis-stb4tb8d.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:41.572592

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.
“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.","President Trump is facing signs that his immigration crackdown is losing popularity with American voters as fallout grows from the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer this month.

Recent polling has found Trump’s approval on immigration at a low point and shown that even some Republican voters are critical of immigration officers’ approach.

The poll numbers come as some high-profile figures on the right have criticized ICE in the wake of the Minneapolis shooting, underscoring the potential political liability for the party as it heads into the midterms.

“This is the kind of political issue that can get out of control,” Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe said.

Immigration has long been one of the president’s strong suits, and he won his second term partly on the promise of tough border policies and mass deportations.

But his administration’s aggressive moves have drawn sharp pushback from the left, prompted protests throughout the year and now appear to be dragging down his approval numbers.

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House. In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring. And a majority of voters in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS said ICE’s actions are making American cities less safe.

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.

Administration officials have argued Ross acted out of self-defense, alleging Good was impeding federal law enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem swiftly labeled Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.”

A 53-percent majority of voters in a Quinnipiac Poll said the Minnesota shooting wasn’t justified, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of independents and 10 percent of Republicans.

The Reuters survey found a notable 39 percent of Republicans said officers should limit harm to others, even if they make fewer arrests as a result.

“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.

“Americans want to see immigrants that cause crime deported, but they’re much more tolerant of undocumented immigrants who’ve been here a long time and are contributing to the economy and otherwise not breaking laws,” he noted.

Another signal of frustration in the days since the Minneapolis shooting has come from a small handful of media figures popular on the right, even as Republicans in Washington have largely been supportive of the ICE operations.

Conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly warned that ICE “needs to deescalate.” And podcaster Joe Rogan, who boasts a right-leaning audience and backed Trump in 2024, questioned, “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

“Here’s the reality: the President campaigned on and won an election based on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history – he’s keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to The Hill.

Good’s shooting has renewed some Democrats’ calls to abolish ICE. In an Economist/YouGov poll, a 46-percent plurality of respondents supported shuttering the agency, including 47 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans.

A CNN/SSRS poll found that, among the 56 percent of respondents who labeled the shooting an “inappropriate” use of force, 9 in 10 said it “reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.”

“There’s been a drip, drip downward as far as approval on how [Trump] is handling immigration,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Malloy noted that more than 8 in 10 voters said they’d seen video footage of the Minneapolis shooting just days afterward, and that it could grow to have an even larger impact as coverage continues.

Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said his party should seize on the issue entering the midterms, arguing Trump “is in trouble” because of the administration’s hard-line tactics.

“Whenever they get a chance to talk immigration or health care or the economy, they should [talk about it] because people are against Trump on all of it,” Vale argued.

Democratic strategist Anthony Coley said Democrats should frame the argument as anti-American.

“What ever happened to ‘love thy neighbor as thyself’?” Coley said. “What Trump is doing on immigration isn’t about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong. It’s immoral and anti-American, and that’s how Democrats should talk about it.”

Some Democrats, though, stress the party should be strategic in seizing on the controversy: A memo from the center-left think tank Third Way cautions the party to “abolish ICE abuses — not ICE” to avoid the blowback that came with prior calls to “defund the police.”

Some Republicans argue the winds will shift in the GOP’s favor when it comes to immigration. GOP strategist Ford O’Connell forecasts Trump “is going to prevail on this issue” because Democrats “will go too far” with calls to curtail ICE.

“Democrats think that this is going to be a winning issue for them, and they’re going to be wrong,” O’Connell said.

Still, Republican strategist Doug Heye said this might be a problem for Republicans in the midterm elections because “they’ve backed themselves into a corner on this.”

“They can oppose some administration policies — which leads [the media] to go mental with the ‘What does it say about Trump’s hold on the party?’ — but they can’t challenge him on things that are core to his identity. And this is,” Heye said.

White House border czar Tom Homan this week said the Trump administration needs “to be better at messaging what we’re doing out there” when it comes to immigration, arguing it faces “a lot of false media.”

Despite the signals of voter frustration, whether immigration and ICE actions remain a problem for the GOP in the midterms depends on what happens next, Republican strategists said.

“It depends how the Democrats respond. I think if the Democrats become anti-ICE and anti-law enforcement, I think that that will only help Republicans. If instead Democrats use this opening to rebrand themselves as more middle-of-the-road on immigration … that could help them politically,” Conant said.

Though Trump’s overall disapproval rating is reaching all-time highs as the immigration debate intensifies, Republicans “have plenty of time to claw some of this back” before November, said Scott Tranter, director of data science for Decision Desk HQ.

“What will be interesting to me is if it affects some of the big primaries, which will have an effect on control. Like, how does this play in the Texas Senate primary in two months? … How does this play out in the Michigan open Senate race? Immigration is obviously a big issue,” Tranter said.

The polling is a problem “in the immediate,” Roe said, but there will be “a thousand outrages” in the 10 months until Election Day.

“So it is an issue, but I imagine it’s going to get replaced by other issues. But it also depends on how things play out from here,” Roe said, crediting some of the anger over ICE to media coverage and blue-state leaders not cooperating with the agency’s actions.

Republican strategist Brian Seitchik, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, agreed with that sentiment.

“This is short-term pain for long-term gain,” Seitchik said.

Republicans running in the midterms “are simply going to have to weather the storm.”

“There’s no magic to get around it,” Seitchik said. “All we can do is make Americans see the long-term benefit.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/ImmigrationCrackdown_Mueller_AP_AdamGray.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:36.229039

Indigenous members of the Arizona House Democratic Caucus on Friday condemned what they described as the unlawful detention of a Navajo man by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As the man at the center of the incident recounts what happened, he said the encounter left him fearful, traumatized and questioning his safety in his own homeland.

In a statement released Jan. 16, Reps. Brian Garcia of Tempe, Mae Peshlakai of Cameron and Myron Tsosie of Chinle rebuked ICE agents for detaining Peter Yazzie, a Diné, earlier this month while he was in the Phoenix area for work. The lawmakers said Yazzie was carrying valid tribal identification and a birth certificate at the time but was detained anyway.

According to the statement, Yazzie was approached by ICE agents while traveling to work in Peoria, Arizona. Media reports and a viral TikTok video shared by Yazzie prompted widespread concern and scrutiny, leading Indigenous lawmakers to publicly denounce the incident and call attention to what they described as systemic targeting of Native Americans.

“ICE agents continue to show a complete disregard for the rule of law and have absolutely no justifiable reason to go after Indigenous Tribal members,” the lawmakers wrote in their joint statement. “In case they need a history lesson, tribal members are United States citizens.”

They added that Yazzie “should never have been approached” and said that instead of being immediately released with an apology, he was “manhandled, detained and accused of lying and theft.”

Lawmakers condemn detention, call it unlawful

Federal authorities have not publicly released details of the incident. In recent days, Yazzie has shared his account on social media, describing being detained by multiple law enforcement vehicles in Phoenix.

Yazzie said he often sleeps in his vehicle while working in the Phoenix area during the winter months, explaining that the weather allows him to do so as he travels for construction work throughout the year.

“I’m saying that I live out of my ride because, I mean, it’s Phoenix in the wintertime. It’s perfect weather,” Yazzie said. “I do that almost every year. I work in Phoenix throughout the winter, travel in the summer times.”

He said the incident happened early in the morning as he was preparing for work.

“I start work at five, I’m up at four, and I was getting ready, putting on my work shirt, standing outside of my ride,” he said.

Yazzie said several vehicles, including Suburbans, pulled into the area one after another, with only two using lights. At first, he believed law enforcement was conducting a raid unrelated to him.

“They got out and had ‘Police’ written on the back of their vest, so I’m thinking this must be like a drug raid or something,” he said.

Yazzie said officers began yelling commands at him, ordering him to face his vehicle and place his hands on it. He said he complied immediately.

“Where I’m from, you learn that when it comes to the law, you do what you’re told. Otherwise, things escalate,” he said.

He said he watched another man forcibly removed from his truck.

“They pull another guy out of his truck, and they drag him on the ground, like literally dragged him on the ground,” Yazzie said.

Moments later, he said, officers forced him to the pavement.

“They tossed me down, knees on the back, facing the pavement,” he said.

Yazzie said he realized the encounter involved immigration enforcement only after hearing an officer identify himself.

“That’s when I heard him say, ‘immigration control,’” Yazzie said.

He said he immediately told agents that he is Navajo and had identification inside his vehicle, including his wallet, Social Security card, Certificate of Indian Blood and birth certificate.

“I’m full-blooded Native,” he said. “My wallet’s in the car. My ID’s in there. My Social Security card. The backpack in the back seat has my CIB and my birth certificate.”

Despite this, Yazzie said he was placed inside a vehicle while agents searched his car.

“They start pulling off, and I’m like, ‘Why are we leaving? You guys have my identification,’” he said.

Yazzie recounts early-morning stop, detention

Yazzie said agents accused him of stealing both the vehicle and his identity.

“They said that car came back under another name. It’s not listed under the name you gave us, which leads us to believe you stole the vehicle and you stole your identity as well,” he said. “They told me I had 24 hours for my information to come back, otherwise they’d place me with the rest of the deportation detainees.”

He said the threat left him imagining the worst.

“I’m thinking, ‘What the hell? I have a job. I have bills. I have kids,” he said. “And their response was, ‘Oh, we’ll get them next.’”

Yazzie said that at that point he stopped trying to explain himself.

“They’re not listening to me, no matter what I say,” he said.

While detained, Yazzie said he encountered other men who were also picked up while going about their daily lives.

“These were guys who, just like me, left early one morning for work or left to get dinner for their families and never came home,” he said.

He said several men asked him to notify their families if he was released.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a grown man with fear and desperation in his eyes,” Yazzie said. “If that doesn’t move you, then you’re not human.”

Yazzie said he was eventually released without explanation or apology.

“They let me go. Not so much as an apology,” he said.

When he returned to his vehicle, he said it had been ransacked.

“They took everything out, ran through everything,” he said. “I had to fix up my car. I had to call my superintendent, my general foreman, my actual foreman and notify them what happened.”

He said the experience has had a lasting impact on his sense of safety.

“I’m not gonna lie. This is something that has me angry, stressed and worried,” he said. “I gotta look over my shoulder all the time now.”

He said the treatment went beyond racism.

“This is racism, but it’s beyond racism,” Yazzie said. “This is hating someone like they’re a pest or a rodent.”

He compared the experience to being dehumanized in his own homeland.

“You’re treated like a stray dog, like you don’t belong here,” he said. “And not only that, we don’t need to earn a place here. This is where we’re from.”

Yazzie said his family’s roots run deep on this land.

“This is where I was born. My parents were born, my grandparents, great-great-grandparents, all the way down the line,” he said. “We’ve never been nowhere else.”

Encounter changes sense of safety

The Arizona lawmakers echoed those sentiments in their statement, saying ICE’s actions are “making everyone less safe” and accusing Republican-supported immigration policies of violating basic rights and human dignity.

“It has to stop,” the lawmakers said.

In follow-up posts, Yazzie said the attention surrounding his story has brought both support and fear. He said people have offered him places to stay, meals and assistance, but he has remained cautious.

“I feel like I put a large target on my back,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been back in survival mode.”

He said he has changed locations nightly and remains hyper-aware of his surroundings.

“When I’m asleep in my car, I’ll hear a door shut or some kind of fast movement, and I’m just waiting for that knock at the window,” he said.

Despite the trauma, Yazzie said he continues to believe change is possible.

“I still believe we have enough humanity in us to come back from this,” he said. “To turn things around.”

Three members of the Oglala Sioux tribe were detained by ICE, and continue to remain in their custody in Minneapolis, according to their tribal officials.

Federal officials have not publicly commented on the incident. The Arizona lawmakers said they are calling for accountability and greater protections for Indigenous people who they say continue to be wrongfully targeted by immigration enforcement.

One lawsuit by the ACLU has already resulted in a federal judge, Kate Menendez, issuing an order restricting what ICE agents can do when confronting peaceful protestors.

The judge's order says there can be no ICE retaliation against protestors, no detaining people without probable cause unless they are obstructing agents or committing a crime, no using pepper spray on a peaceful protest, and allowing drivers to follow ICE agents' vehicles at a safe distance. On ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" this Sunday morning, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the order changes nothing about how federal agents are conducting their business in Minnesota.

Another development is that the U.S. Justice Department has opened criminal investigations into Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly obstructing the work of federal agents.

Appearing on WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy, Attorney General Keith Ellison called this latter investigation ""from the playbook.""

""This is the president who is persecuting Jerome Powell of the Fed, who tried to prosecute James Comey of the FBI, and the current attorney general of New York, Letitia James. He uses the criminal justice system to persecute the people he doesn't like,"" Ellison said.

The second federal lawsuit against ICE was filed late last week by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It seeks to stop ICE activity throughout the state. The lawsuit argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

That lawsuit argues that President Trump is retaliating against Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' ticket, for his objections to ICE activity.

""What the federal government needs to do is leave and stop the surge,"" Ellison said.

The Tenth Amendment protects states' sovereignty and limits federal powers to those granted in the U.S. Constitution. It provides autonomy to the states in issues like education, elections and public safety. While Ellison is optimistic, some legal experts think the lawsuit is a long shot because it would be similar to telling the FBI it could not operate in the state.

The state, in this second lawsuit, is seeking an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. The judge in the case is Kate Menendez, the same judge who issued that first order favorable to peaceful protestors. The judge said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government. That response is due to be filed at 5 p.m. Monday, which is the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/454ef978-d6d2-43d0-8b1d-d216d2fde6fa/thumbnail/1200x630/bf35a562013bb6332b90700dad4b5214/gettyimages-2256249848.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:59.089111

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained.
Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.
That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.
Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.","Donald Trump’s escalating calls for the United States to seize or otherwise obtain Greenland has ignited fresh criticism from the president’s own Republican party, with some saying it could hurt the US economically or strain the Nato military alliance.

Such Republicans included US senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, who were part of a bipartisan group to travel to Denmark to discuss concerns in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.

Both Tillis and Murkowski sharply criticized new tariffs threatened on Saturday by Trump on a slew of European countries – including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland.

Murkowski wrote on X that the tariffs were “unnecessary, punitive, and a profound mistake”, coming after Nato allies deployed troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island if needed.

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained. “We are already seeing the consequences of these measures in real time: our Nato allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”

She urged Congress to exercise its authority over tariffs to ensure they are “not weaponized in ways that harm our alliances and undermine American leadership”.

Tillis, for his part, wrote on X: “This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies. It’s great for Putin, [Chinese leader] Xi [Jiping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.”

Tillis added that “actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid”.

“It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the Nato alliance over the years,” Tillis maintained.

Mike Pence, the US vice-president during Trump’s first White House term, separately said he believed “the current posture … does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our Nato allies”.

“Denmark is a very strong ally of the United States of American,” Pence said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week, McCaul said: “The fact is, the president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat” that could materialize on the Arctic island.

“So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that’s one thing,” he continued. “But for him to militarily invade would turn … Nato on its very head and, in essence, press a war with Nato itself. It would end up abolishing Nato as we know it.”

Trump has repeatedly argued that US control of the island is necessary for national security, pointing to concerns about Russia and China expanding their influence in the Arctic. That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.

During a Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican US senator Rand Paul weighed in, saying it “ridiculous” to portray Greenland as some urgent situation.

“There’s no emergency with Greenland,” Paul said.

Trump has insisted that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect Greenland in the case of a confrontation with China or Russia, even as he has also said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory.

The goal of the bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers who traveled to meet with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen was to emphasize the Republican dissent to any suggestion that the United States should forcefully seize Greenland.

Polling also shows a substantial majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island.

Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.

Gingrich went on Sunday’s Cats Roundtable radio program and called Trump’s posture with Greenland “a lot of noise to set up a negotiation to get what he wants”.

That “is tourist rights, economic rights, mineral rights and national security rights”, Gingrich said.

Gingrich pointed to Greenland’s abundance of natural resources and noted that China, Russia and the US all have an interest in accessing its minerals. He also called Greenland’s oil and gas reserves “a huge economic opportunity”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7cc9c3ff5d5cee2fddc4c47ef39c344dab03d2a/639_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=663dab34da0603d7b41b99cae84c3a73",N,,2026-01-18 14:57:24.932607

Momentum in Democratic-led states for the measures, some of them proposed for years, is growing as legislatures return to work following the killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. But Republicans are pushing back, blaming protesters for impeding the enforcement of immigration laws.

Democratic bills seek to limit ICE

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey's Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make ""indiscriminate"" arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

""Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,"" Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia's conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

""Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,"" said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta's Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state's Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans ""sanctuary cities.""

Tennessee GOP works with White House

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver's licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students' legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states' requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

""We're going to do what we can to make sure that if you're here illegally, we will have the data, we'll have the transparency, and we're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail,"" House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose ""sanctuary"" policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

""There's not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,"" he said. ""It's almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.""

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won't comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing ""unprecedented"" harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers' safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this past week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim ""Operation Midway Blitz"" made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit ""baseless.""

— Terik Hashmi, immigration attorney with International Law Group

WASHINGTON DC, DC, UNITED STATES, January 18, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — U.S. immigration law firm International Law Group (ILG) announced today that it is offering rapid-response immigration consultations for Venezuelan nationals and families in the Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area who are facing heightened immigration enforcement, status uncertainty, or expiring protections.

Recent federal actions and policy changes by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have created widespread confusion and anxiety among Venezuelans, particularly those relying on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pending asylum applications, work permits, or other humanitarian and employment-based immigration benefits. Increased data reviews, background checks, Requests for Evidence (RFEs), Notices to Appear, and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made early legal review critical.

“Many Venezuelans in the DMV area are understandably worried about what these changes mean for their families, jobs, and futures,” said Terik Hashmi, senior attorney at International Law Group. “Our message is simple: don’t panic, but don’t wait. Ignoring a notice or assuming nothing will happen can be a serious mistake. Early legal guidance can significantly change the outcome.”

To meet urgent demand, International Law Group is offering confidential Zoom consultations, including evenings and weekends, to quickly assess risk, explain options, and help clients respond appropriately to government action.

International Law Group services include:

• Emergency Zoom consultations (available nationwide)

• Review of USCIS, DHS, and ICE notices

• TPS status review and transition strategies

• Asylum and humanitarian case audits

• Work permit (EAD) and Green Card planning

• ICE encounter preparedness and rights counseling

International Law Group has decades of experience representing immigrants in high-stakes, time-sensitive cases, including those involving sudden policy shifts, enforcement actions, and humanitarian crises.

Adds Mike Meier, senior attorney at International Law Group: “Consultations are confidential and designed for urgent situations. We strongly encourage Venezuelan community members in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia who have received notices, whose TPS or work authorization is expiring, or who are unsure about their current status to speak with an experienced immigration attorney immediately.”

""These law enforcement officers are out there every day doing the work to protect the American people, and they will keep doing that because they believe in enforcing the law, which is exactly what President Trump has charged them with,"" Noem said on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Transcript: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan""

A federal judge on Friday blocked federal law enforcement from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters as demonstrations continue. The judge also barred federal agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is ""no reasonable articulable suspicion"" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.

On Sunday, Noem called the order ""a little ridiculous.""

""We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,"" Noem said. ""So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.""

Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks for immigration enforcement operations and to investigate fraud allegations in the state. Federal law enforcement agents have faced allegations of using aggressive tactics.

Noem put the blame on protesters and local leaders for violent incidents, including one in which a couple said they and their six children were tear-gassed while driving home from basketball practice.

""That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations, and that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened,"" the secretary said.

Noem said ""the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis,"" claiming it's ""why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city.""

The administration has faced renewed scrutiny and ramped-up protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Last week, Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged the GOP chairman to call Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify before the panel.

Noem said Sunday that Good ""weaponized her car and threatened the life of a law enforcement officer and those around him."" She said the 37-year-old woman was ""impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened,"" while saying the incident was a ""tragedy."" She added that the officer ""relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him.""

Asked whether the agency was conducting a review of the agent who shot Good, Noem said, ""We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/edf04c16-ba1d-4629-bf3d-0734361dbf88/thumbnail/1200x630/714a0d3d1a59cc46e31671a3199faf8e/noem-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:57:44.324253

In the CBS News/YouGov poll conducted late last week, 61 percent of respondents say the way ICE is conducting its operations when it stops or detains people is “too tough,” while 15 percent say it’s “not tough enough.” Another 24 percent say it’s “about right.” That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.
Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.

The shift comes mostly from Democrats and independents, both of which saw a 9-percentage point increase in the share who say the way ICE has conducted its operations has been too tough — to 94 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

Similarly, the latest poll shows Americans are increasingly doubting the administration’s claims that it is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” in deporting migrants who are living in the country illegally.

Today, 56 percent of people say the Trump administration is prioritizing for deportation “people who aren’t dangerous criminals,” up from 52 percent in the November poll.

Overall support for Trump’s program to deport immigrants are in the country illegally has dropped, from 52 percent in the November poll to 46 percent now.

The poll was conducted a week after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good during a standoff with protesters in Minneapolis. The Trump administration maintains the officer acted in self-defense and feared for his life, pointing to video footage it says shows Good was using her car to threaten his life. Critics, however, say the footage shows Good was trying to drive away from the officer, not run him over.

On Wednesday, the first day of the three-day poll, another ICE officer shot and injured a Venezuelan migrant in Minneapolis after the officer was allegedly attacked when following the target on foot after he fled a traffic stop.

The latest survey included 2,523 adults and was conducted Jan. 14-16. The margin of error is 2.3 percentage points.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Leading-ICE_011126_AP_Jen-Golbeck.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 16:58:07.236877

Editor’s Note: The above guest column was penned by James C. Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project and an Episcopal priest in Austin.","We typically commemorate the Martin Luther King holiday with his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. This time around, it would behoove us to pay attention to his powerful 1967 speech at Riverside Church, “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,” opposing the war in Vietnam.

The moral principles he affirmed, with Rabbi Abraham Heschel, himself a great moral leader, at his side, apply with piercing relevance to the upheaval facing our democracy today.

State terrorism against the immigrant community confronts us daily. Agents with face masks and no identification inflict harm on families as men masked with white hoods once did when perpetrating evil on the nation’s minority communities.

People have been killed, families broken up, and small children handcuffed. There has been long-term detention in disgusting facilities, and people dispatched to countries which are foreign to them. We see attacks on boats, killing people with impunity. Congress is lamer than ever in asserting the rule of law.

Amnesty protections have been abandoned, regardless of how severe the persecution and oppression that immigrant families had to flee or the economic disaster they faced. There have been mass deportations, no matter how many years immigrants have lived as our neighbors and supported our country. Never mind the risk to them if they return to their former homeland.

Dismantling the safety net for vulnerable America’s seniors and poor is underway. The world’s wealthiest country now denies aid to poor countries facing immeasurable poverty and rampant violence. Free speech and dissent are on the Administration’s and Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s chopping block.

We are replicating those dark days of American history from which we thought we had emerged.

Fort Bliss in El Paso, a major immigrant detention facility, was a Japanese internment site 80 years ago. The national security rhetoric used to justify mass incarceration today is the same used for the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans.

The Administration’s actions are against people of color—the same grievance Dr. King articulated about the Vietnam war.

Dr. King understood the retaliation he would suffer for his speech, but his moral challenge to the government was necessary, and correct. He lost significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, and the powerful media. His popularity sank because he did not stick to the “civil rights script” expected of him.

Howard Thurman, the premier Black theologian, in his 1946 essay, “The Fascist Masquerade,” faulted the Christian church for “the bitter truth” of permitting hate-inspired groups … to establish squatter’s rights in the middle of believers because there has been no adequate teaching on the meaning of faith, the faith in terms of human dignity and human worth.”

Faith groups are finally heading his warning. For religious folks, as for non-believers, this current struggle is about the inherent dignity of people and fairness, or, as Pope Leo has forcefully framed it, the core values of democracy.

At a January 9th candlelight vigil for Renee Nicole Good, two days are an ICE agent killed her, Bishop Rob Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire announced he had advised his clergy, “that we may be entering into that same witness,” and to get their affairs in order and write their wills because “it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us, with our bodies, to stand between the powers of this world, and the most vulnerable.”

Dr. King put his body on the line, as had countless others for a more just society.

For Dr. King’s holiday this year, we must jettison our comfort zone and not rest on the laurels we thought that society had accomplished, but which our federal and state governments are steadfastly discarding with abandon.

The call for us is to accept that moral challenge and shed our complacency and, as Dr. King put it in 1967, “go down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land” before “America's soul becomes totally poisoned.”

It is time to break silence and put our bodies on the line.

To find out, I sat down with immigration attorney Adriana Pereyra of Integrity Law Firm, who says what's happening in Southern Nevada isn't always visible.

""How often are we seeing this? Is this happening a lot more often than what people are actually realizing?"" I asked.

""Yes, it definitely is. Even my clients who are detained have told me, you know, they bring 10-15 people a day, just in Henderson detention center,"" Pereyra said.

Here's why that matters: Under federal immigration law, ICE has the authority, including through what's called the 287(G) program, to operate with local jails. ICE can identify and take into federal custody people who were booked into jail.

""ICE is still very involved here in our community?"" I asked.

""Absolutely they're just doing it in a different way that is not so public,"" Pereyra said

.According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website, ICE also maintains holding facilities in Southern Nevada, including the Henderson Detention Center and the Nevada Southern Detention Center, where people taken into ICE custody can be detained for immigration proceedings.

A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.
Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.
""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.","WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court signaled four months into Donald Trump's second presidential term last year its interest in shielding the Federal Reserve from political interference. When the justices on Wednesday consider the legality of his bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, their willingness to preserve the U.S. central bank's independence will be ​put to the test.

With control over U.S. monetary policy at stake, the legal battle over Trump's attempt to remove Cook marks the second case involving an action by the Republican president of vast economic significance ‌to reach the Supreme Court during its current term, which began in October.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments in November concerning Trump's sweeping global tariffs, with justices indicating skepticism over the lawfulness of these import taxes on nearly every U.S. trading partner imposed under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Its rulings in the tariffs and Cook cases are expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

The court has been largely deferential to Trump in a series of rulings on an emergency basis since his return to office 12 months ago as he repeatedly tests the limits of presidential authority. The justices, however, may be less eager to strengthen Trump's hand over the economy.

""I think they worry about the effect that removal of central ‌bank independence could have on the economy,"" said John Yoo, who served as a Justice Department lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush.

""It seems a basic principle of macroeconomics, ​backed up by the experience of other countries, that political control over the money supply, interest rates and central banking will inevitably lead to inflation,"" said Yoo, now a University of California, Berkeley law professor.

According to legal scholars, the court has not been so directly involved in U.S. economic policy since the justices weighed the constitutionality of Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's muscular agenda called the New Deal during the 1930s amid the crisis of the Great Depression.

'NOT UNBOUNDED'

Columbia Law School professor Kathryn ‍Judge said the fights involving Fed independence and Trump's tariffs ""will be key in determining the scope of the president's authority to unilaterally determine economic policy.""

""This Supreme Court has taken a very expansive approach to executive authority,"" Judge said, ""but it is not unbounded.""

Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after he sought to fire her, an unprecedented step by a president against a central bank official. Trump claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before being appointed to the ⁠Fed by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden in 2022, an allegation she denied and described as a pretext to try to remove her for her monetary policy stance.

Similarly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sunday called a criminal investigation of him launched by ‍Trump's Justice Department a pretext to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy. The investigation centers on Powell's congressional testimony about a Fed building project.

Critics see the steps by Trump and his administration targeting Cook and Powell as a bid to ‌pressure the Fed ‌to lower interest rates before the November midterm elections in which Democrats are hoping to regain control of Congress from the Republicans. Pocketbook concerns may loom large for voters.

""With each passing day - and with each passing attack by the Trump administration - I suspect that the court increasingly sees the value of an independent Fed,"" University of Illinois Chicago law professor Steve Schwinn said.

Yoo added that ""Trump is not helping his own case with the Department of Justice's implausible criminal investigation"" of Powell.

REMOVAL PROTECTIONS

Cook has said Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud did not empower him to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act, the law that created the central bank in 1913. Aiming to insulate the Fed's decision-making from politics, Congress included provisions constraining a president's ability ⁠to fire a Fed governor, allowing removal only for adequate ""cause,"" ⁠not policy differences.

A Washington-based federal judge ruled that Trump's ​claims were likely insufficient grounds to fire Cook. A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.

Legal analysts said the justices have offered recent clues signaling their interest in protecting the Fed's independence. For instance, they allowed Cook to remain in her post as the case plays out after allowing Trump to remove officials from other agencies with similar tenure protections while those cases proceed.

Last May, the court let Trump fire two Democratic members of federal labor boards ‍while challenges to their removals continue in lower courts. In that ruling, called Trump v. Wilcox, the court sought to allay concerns that letting the president fire officials from federal labor boards would imperil the independence of the Fed.

""We disagree,"" the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. ""The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.""

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.

""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.

“I think it lays out some ground rules going forward for ICE to operate within,” says Ryan Wood, a former chief immigration court judge. “It really lays out the framework for future court actions for violating those court orders.”

The decision, by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, prohibits federal immigration agents in Minnesota from arresting, detaining or retaliating against peaceful protesters or observers.

They also can’t use pepper spray or other non-lethal munitions against them.

“These are just some of the foundational and fundamental principles under which any law enforcement operation really needs to abide,” notes Jessica West, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. “I think her goal was to start the process of having a dialogue between law enforcement and the courts about what is and what is not permissible.”

But the injunction goes further.

It says federal officers can’t stop or detain drivers or passengers in vehicles with no reasonable suspicion that they’re forcibly obstructing or interfering with agents.

That includes those following at an “appropriate distance.”

Wood says he’s concerned about clarity in the ruling.

“These are all messy situations,” he explains. “What does it mean to have a reasonable distance between a protester and an arrest incident? What does it mean to have a reasonable distance by an ICE vehicle and a vehicle that’s following it?”

The ruling follows a case filed in December by six Minnesota activist-observers, represented by the ACLU.

RELATED: ACLU sues ICE, claiming federal agents deprived citizens of civil rights

Their argument — that government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

West believes the government will appeal, but she says there’s an opportunity for the Department of Homeland Security as well.

“One potential way the government could take this is to start to not only train and hand this order out to their officers on the ground,” she notes. “To start to correct information about who’s doing what, where, when, and hold some of those people accountable; to change the culture a little bit.”

After the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency is taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters. We remind the public that rioting is dangerous — obstructing law enforcement is a federal crime and assaulting law enforcement is a felony.”

The statement went on to say: “Rioters and terrorists have assaulted law enforcement, launched fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, and vandalized federal property. Others have chosen to ignore commands and have attempted to impede law enforcement operations and used their vehicles as weapons against our officers. Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations, our law enforcement as followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The judge ordered the federal government to inform all officers about the ruling within 72 hours as of Friday night.

So far, DHS has not commented on whether there would be an appeal to the ruling and what the process would be to get information about it to officers in the field.

Wood says he hopes the judge’s ruling will make a difference.

“I think this one might have more legs and really provide some careful guardrails for ICE to operate within,” he notes. “I’m hopeful that this court decision will provide some guidance to them, education as to the boundaries and the elements of impeding federal law enforcement officers.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FED-JUDGE-PROTEST-RULING_PKG_KSTPb6fa_146_mxf_00.00.06.42.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:04.723785

Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.

In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program — which has roughly divided the nation for months — has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.

And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.

There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.

So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.

Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.

More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.

Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.

Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.

Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.

Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.

Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran

Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.

Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.

Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.

The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.

Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.

What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?

Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.

Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.

Democratic lawmakers and candidates for office around the country increasingly are returning to the phrase, popularized during the first Trump administration, as they react to this administration’s forceful immigration enforcement tactics.

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent this month in Minneapolis sparked immediate outrage among Democratic officials, who proposed a variety of oversight demands — including abolishing the agency — to rein in tactics they view as hostile and sometimes illegal.

Resurrecting the slogan is perhaps the riskiest approach. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to paint Democrats, especially those in vulnerable seats, as extremists.

“If their response is to dust off ‘defund ICE,’ we’re happy to take that fight any day of the week,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group has published dozens of press statements in recent weeks accusing Democrats of wanting to abolish ICE — even those who haven’t made direct statements using the phrase.

Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) amplified that message Wednesday, writing on social media that “When Democrats say they want to abolish or defund ICE, what they are really saying is they want to go back to the open borders policies of the Biden administration. The American people soundly rejected that idea in the 2024 election.”

The next day, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced the “Abolish ICE Act,” stating that Good’s killing “proved that ICE is out of control and beyond reform.” The bill would rescind the agency’s “unobligated” funding and redirect other assets to its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

Many Democrats calling for an outright elimination of ICE come from the party’s progressive wing. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in a television interview the agency should be abolished because actions taken by its agents are “racist” and “rogue.” Jack Schlossberg, who is running for a House seat in New York, said that “if Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it.”

Other prominent progressives have stopped short of saying the agency should be dismantled.

Sen. Alex Padilla, (D-Calif.) who last year was forcefully handcuffed and removed from a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined a protest in Washington to demand justice for Good, saying “It’s time to get ICE and CBP out,” referring to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“This is a moment where all of us have to be forceful to ensure that we are pushing back on what is an agency right now that is out of control,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said on social media. “We have to be loud and clear that ICE is not welcome in our communities.”

Others have eyed negotiations over the yearly Homeland Security budget as a leverage point to incorporate their demands, such as requiring federal agents to remove their masks and to turn on their body-worn cameras when on duty, as well as calling for agents who commit crimes on the job to be prosecuted. Seventy House Democrats, including at least 13 from California, backed a measure to impeach Noem.

Rep. Mike Levin (D-San Diego), who serves on the House Committee on Appropriations, said his focus is not on eliminating the agency, which he believes has an “important responsibility” but has been led astray by Noem.

He said Noem should be held to account for her actions through congressional oversight hearings, not impeachment — at least not while Republicans would be in control of the proceedings, since he believes House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would make a “mockery” of them.

“I am going to use the appropriations process,” Levin said, adding that he would “continue to focus on the guardrails, regardless of the rhetoric.”

Chuck Rocha, a Democratic political strategist, said Republicans seized on the abolitionist rhetoric as a scare tactic to distract from the rising cost of living, which remains another top voter concern.

“They hope to distract [voters] by saying, ‘Sure, we’re going to get better on the economy — but these Democrats are still crazy,’” he said.

Democrats have for years struggled to put forward a unified vision on immigration — one of the top issues that won President Trump a return to the White House. Any deal to increase guardrails on Homeland Security faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Congress, leaving many proposals years away from the possibility of fruition. Even if Democrats manage to block the yearly funding bill, the agency still has tens of billions of dollars from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Still, the roving raids, violent clashes with protesters and detentions and deaths of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike increased the urgency many lawmakers feel to do something.

Two centrist groups released memos last week written by former Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration urging Democrats to avoid the polarizing language and instead channel their outrage into specific reforms.

“Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want,” wrote the authors of one memo, from the Washington-based think tank Third Way.

“Advocating for abolishing ICE is tantamount to advocating for stopping enforcement of all of our immigration laws in the interior of the United States — a policy position that is both wrong on the merits and at odds with the American public on the issue,” wrote Blas Nuñez-Neto, a senior policy fellow at the new think tank the Searchlight Institute who previously was assistant Homeland Security secretary.

Roughly 46% of Americans said they support the idea of abolishing ICE, while 43% are opposed, according to a YouGov/Economist poll released last week.

Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who co-wrote the Third Way memo, said future polls might show less support for abolishing the agency, particularly if the question is framed as a choice among options including reforms such as banning agents from wearing masks or requiring use of body cameras.

“There’s no doubt there will be further tragedies and with each, the effort to take an extreme position like abolishing ICE increases,” she said.

Laura Hernandez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, a California-based organization that advocates for the closure of detention centers, said the increase in lawmakers calling to abolish ICE is long overdue.

“We need lawmakers to use their power to stop militarized raids, to close detention centers and we need them to shut down ICE and CBP,” she said. “This violence that people are seeing on television is not new, it’s literally built into the DNA of DHS.”

Cinthya Martinez, a UC Santa Cruz professor who has studied the movement to abolish ICE, noted that it stems from the movement to abolish prisons. The abolition part, she said, is watered down by mainstream politicians even as some liken immigration agents to modern-day slave patrols.

Martinez said the goal is about more than simply getting rid of one agency or redirecting its duties to another. She pointed out that alongside ICE agents have been Border Patrol, FBI and ATF agents.

“A lot of folks forget that prison abolition is to completely abolish carceral systems. It comes from a Black tradition that says prison is a continuation of slavery,” she said.

But Peter Markowitz, a law professor and co-director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardozo School of Law, said the movement to abolish ICE around 2018 among mainstream politicians was always about having effective and humane immigration enforcement, not about having none.

“But it fizzled because it didn’t have an answer to the policy question that follows: If not ICE, then what?” he said. “I hope we’re in a different position today.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6316803/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6131x3219+0+436/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F72%2F14f965e74a87aa0f7516fba88748%2Fgettyimages-2256036466.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:02.249674

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.","In November 2002, President George W. Bush signed a bill creating a federal agency devoted to protecting the United States. The country was still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, and the threat of international terrorism permeated public life.

Among the agencies that would be included in the Department of Homeland Security, as it would be called, would be Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — the parts of the government most responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws.

“The new department will analyze threats, will guard our borders and airports, protect our critical infrastructure, and coordinate the response of our nation for future emergencies,” Mr. Bush said at the time, adding that the department would “focus the full resources of the American government on the safety of the American people.”

But more than two decades later, as thousands of ICE and Border Patrol officers flood Minneapolis, some Democratic leaders say the department’s role appears to have strayed far from its original purpose, turning its tools of enforcement away from external threats and toward President Trump’s domestic critics.

They say enforcement has looked more like an occupation, as officers in helmets and tactical gear have faced off against hostile residents and left-wing protesters in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago and Washington. The interactions, broadcast to the world through social media videos filmed by protesters and federal agents alike, have given the impression of a government at war with the country’s own cities.

The Department of Homeland Security “was designed to protect Americans from threats, and what we’ve essentially done is, in some cases, we’ve turned that agency on Americans,” said Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland, Ore., a Democrat. “It’s deeply unsettling.”

Mr. Wilson said he was concerned that federal immigration enforcement activities could lead to a shooting like the one in Minneapolis that took the life of Renee Good, a 37-year-old protester fatally shot by an ICE officer. Hours after his comments, Border Patrol agents shot two Venezuelan nationals who had rammed their vehicle, the department said. The Venezuelans survived their injuries, and one was charged in connection with the incident.

More than two decades after its formation, the Department of Homeland Security is the government’s largest law enforcement agency, with around 250,000 employees. It includes many functions that are not directly part of the turmoil on the ground, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the agency that oversees airport security.

Yet even those agencies have come under pressure to meet Mr. Trump’s political objectives, with the airport security agency providing information to immigration agents and Mr. Trump trying to redirect disaster funding away from states not cooperating with his deportation goals.

ICE’s budget increased dramatically because of the sweeping domestic policy bill the president signed into law last July, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Under Mr. Trump, the department also redirected thousands of agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a New York Times investigation found last year.

The Trump administration and officials in some of the targeted cities have used militaristic language to describe the conflict unfolding on the ground.

A lawsuit filed this week by Minnesota described the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents and officers as “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities.”

“I see it as a personal militarized police force for the president to do his bidding against people who don’t see the world through the lens of the ultra rich,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, a Democrat.

Mr. Trump has recently raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to suppress rebellions and enforce federal laws. On Tuesday, he said on social media that Minnesotans should expect more action in their state, and that the “DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING.”

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has called Chicago a “war zone,” and said the agency had made parts of the city “much more free.” In recent weeks, the department has described Minnesota as a place where there was “rampant fraud and criminality happening.”

Mr. Bush at the time said that the United States would be better equipped to “reduce our vulnerability and, most important, prevent the terrorists from taking innocent American lives.”

Building the agency was a big task, with all or portions of 22 federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be folded into a single department. Some politicians in Washington initially resisted the creation of a new cabinet-level agency, including Mr. Bush.

Supporters of the department’s stepped-up role on immigration enforcement this year say the surge of officers in cities has made the country safer by rounding up violent criminals. They say voters endorsed decisive action on immigration when they elected Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He has pledged to be more aggressive.

“What these mayors are asking D.H.S. to do is not really an option,” said Chad Wolf, an acting homeland security secretary during the first Trump administration. “The majority of American people said, ‘We don’t want that America. We actually want criminal illegal aliens arrested and removed, as well as others.’”

Some law enforcement officials who have had productive relationships with federal authorities in the past have watched the new D.H.S. approach with concern.

“The biggest question that I’ve been receiving is: How will we intercede if there’s a conflict between community members and D.H.S.?” Shon Barnes, Seattle’s chief of police, said in an interview last fall. “Who will we side with? What will we do?”

The answer, Chief Barnes said, was that the department would “keep the peace.”

Jim McDonnell, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said the city had long had close ties to D.H.S., in particular the agencies focused on criminal matters. But that cooperation became harder last summer, he said, when the agency launched a regionwide immigration operation that ensnared thousands of immigrants.

“This has been something very different — unprecedented — that we’ve seen here,” he said last year.

In many ways, Los Angeles was on the front line of the agency’s incursion into large, Democratic-led cities. Last June, following protests of an ICE operation in downtown Los Angeles, the agency empowered Border Patrol agents to lead immigration enforcement in the area.

Soon, agents were seen raiding carwashes, Home Depot parking lots and other locations. At one point, border agents traveled through a city park as a show of force. It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.

“The federal government invaded, intervened and created a problem, and then patted themselves on the back for so-called saving the city, when the city was never at risk of anything,” said Karen Bass, the city’s Democratic mayor.

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.

When it was created, the agency was not just supposed to connect different parts of the federal government, but also expand its outreach to local and state entities.

Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.
Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office.
Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population.
Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.
Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts.","“They’re going to have to be really careful how they talk about this,” Laura Curran, a Democrat and former Nassau County executive, said of her party’s swing seat candidates. “We don’t want to talk about defunding the police or all that stuff.”

Proposals by Hochul and the Democratic-dominated state Legislature to put guardrails around Trump’s immigration tactics have not been enthusiastically received by vulnerable House Democrats.

Reps. Tom Suozzi and Josh Riley would not comment on the governor’s policy pushback, which she outlined in her State of the State speech this week. And a third Democrat, Rep. Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.

Efforts in Albany to check ICE’s actions are quickly becoming an issue in the three Democrats’ races as Trump moves to deport more undocumented immigrants and potentially use the Insurrection Act to quell adversarial protests. Republicans plan to mount competitive campaigns against Suozzi, Riley and Gillen this year with the goal of making in-roads among voters in purplish areas of New York state. Attacks over the governor’s immigration measures are already starting: A spokesperson for the House Republicans’ campaign arm accused Hochul and her fellow Democrats of trying to “reopen the illegal immigration floodgates.”

“New Yorkers haven’t forgotten what Democrats’ reckless open borders did to their state, and they won’t stand for it again,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O’Toole.

The stakes for New York Democrats to get the immigration policy right couldn’t be higher. Races in at least four seats in this deep blue state are expected to determine control of the House — and the course of Trump’s final two years in office.

Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office. GOP candidates hammered Democrats, regardless of what office they were running for, over a controversial law that restricted cash bail.

State-backed provisions that undermine federal law enforcement stand to serve as a replay of a fight that played out in several election cycles and led to electoral gains for Republicans.

Gillen’s office sidestepped questions about the Hochul-backed measures and instead called for action on the federal level.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades and is in dire need of repair,” she said in a statement. “Comprehensive reform must be done at the federal level. Congress should pass my bipartisan Dignity Act to strengthen our border security, remove dangerous criminals, and provide a pathway for law-abiding immigrants to earn legal status.”

Curran, who led bellwether Nassau County for four years, believes Democrats in swing seats will have to remain cautious with calls to scale back ICE. But she acknowledged some voters want action following Good’s death and Trump’s threat of invoking the Insurrection Act amid ICE’s clashes with protesters. The fraught emotions have created a tricky balancing act for Democrats in tough races.

“The dramatic nature of all this ICE action is really starting to freak people out,” Curran said. “The popularity of Republicans is starting to go down if this escalates. This is going to become much more toxic, but I also understand why some of these Congressional Democrats are being vanilla. I understand these districts; they have to be.”

The lack of support for Hochul’s ICE-curbing plans among the trio of vulnerable New York Democrats underscores how Trump’s increasingly controversial deportation efforts continue to be a third rail for the party. Democrats have struggled to articulate an alternative plan and voters punished their candidates in 2024 as the president returned to the White House promising swift action.

But the expansive efforts to remove people from the country have changed how the party’s officials — especially at the state level — are approaching the issue.

Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population. Hochul wants to make it easier for New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court and to require a judicial warrant before carrying out a civil deportation proceedings in locations like schools or houses of worship. Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.

The moderate Democrat in interviews has hammered ICE’s recent actions around the country, accusing the agency of abusing its power.

“It hurts peoples’ confidence in all law enforcement,” she told Fox 5. “This undermines the NYPD, and our state police, who are just doing their jobs.”

State lawmakers have proposed bills to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks while carrying out their official duties. They are calling for new monitoring requirements for ICE. And there are discussions to guarantee that every person facing civil deportation proceedings has access to an attorney.

“There’s a massive shift — including my own shift,” said Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy. “Public opinion has shifted dramatically.”

The Albany-area Democrat has worked with state lawmakers across the country in recent weeks to develop new legislation. Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts. She acknowledged, though, that some moderate Democrats are yet to come around amid uncertainty over how the rapidly changing events will shape the public’s view of the deportation crackdown.

“The marginal Democrats or the swing area Democrats are still nervous about it,” she said. “But now it’s more than an immigration issue. This is about who we are as Americans.”

Even among Democrats eager to put the brakes to ICE’s enforcement there are disagreements.

Hochul is typically cautious around controversial immigration issues — she is not embracing calls to expand sanctuary protections and said in a Fox 5 interview this week she does not want the agency abolished. But the governor received standing ovations from the audience when she laid out her immigration measures in her State of the State address — a speech given days after Good’s shooting in Minneapolis and an indication she is delicately threading a needle with her proposals.

“This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety,” Hochul said in the speech. “It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.”

There are signs voters across the country are becoming unnerved by immigration agents’ expansive tactics and deployments. A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 57 percent of voters disapproved of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws while 53 percent of those surveyed believe Good’s shooting was not justified.

Hochul has said she was “sickened” by Good’s death and called for “recourse” when a federal official acts inappropriately.

“Let’s start holding these people accountable,” she told MSNOW this month.

Her likely Republican opponent, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, has taken a starkly different posture.

Blakeman — who signed an executive order opposing sanctuary-related policies — told reporters this week he does not want to “put any shackles on ICE.” He said videos of Good appeared to show her turning her car toward an ICE agent and “trying to run down” the officer — a claim Hochul’s campaign rebuked. The Republican added that there should be more support for victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants.

“You want to talk about ICE? Let’s talk about the victims of crimes committed in New York state by the people who shouldn’t be here,” said Blakeman, who Republicans expect will have strong coattails in down-ballot Long Island races.

The differing views among Democrats over how to address Trump’s immigration actions highlights Hochul’s imperative to win over statewide voters, while swing seat incumbents must take a more careful approach, said independent political analyst J.C. Polanco.

“Hochul understands she’s never going to win a Blakeman voter,” he said. “Unfortunately for Gillen and Suozzi, they need Blakeman voters.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:20.729538

Jacob Ellis, an organizer of the protests, estimated there were twice the number of protesters than on a standard Saturday.

Recent warnings about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents potentially conducting widespread action in Portland and Lewiston drew a crowd of about 200 people to Monument Square. On both sides of Congress Street, the majority of protesters held up signs against ICE, including “ICE is slippery and dangerous” and “crack ICE.”

While some have been protesting consistently, many demonstrators were there for the first time, compelled to participate because of the recent actions of ICE officers and the Trump administration.

Amara Aiken, 21, is one of them. Aiken said while it is always important for those with more privilege and power to stand up for those who are being targeted, it’s especially essential today.

After hearing about the recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer, Aiken said people are worried that something similar might happen in Portland. In a tight-knight community like Maine, Aiken said, people are concerned it could happen to someone they know.

“Everyone’s having that anxiety that ‘oh, my neighbor might be next, my friend might be next, my partner might be next,’” Aiken said.

Aiken is a manager in a taqueria, and when rumors started spreading about ICE in Portland, the owner and the management team established a protocol in the event that officers show up. They’ve decided they would ask the agents to leave and would refuse to serve them.

At the protest, a nurse gave a speech in front of the crowd, explaining that she has had conversations at work about what to do if ICE agents try to forcibly enter the doctor’s office.

Since hearing the rumors of ICE activity in Maine, many protesters said they have been trying to help out their neighbors and immigrants in their community, from sharing the number of the Maine ICE Watch Hotline to keeping track of where ICE officers might be located.

Jane Hoover, a retired nurse, said she has been involved in helping immigrants for years, from tutoring to helping provide shelter to attending the weekly protest whenever she can.

Hoover pointed sadly to a young girl standing on the sculpture in the middle of the square with a sign that read, “This is home. Why are we scared?”

The girl wasn’t the only one feeling scared. Protesters also said they felt sad, angry, disheartened and resigned. Some, like Nancy Anderson, still felt hopeful.

Anderson was glad to see new faces at the protest Saturday, including many young people. Anderson, who is 76 years old, said it crossed her mind that ICE officers might come to the protest, but there was no place she’d rather be than trying to defend democracy in the country for her four grandkids and help those at risk.

“Our Somali communities are vibrant and a gift to Maine, and people are coming together to do what is necessary to support them,” she said.

Ellis, the organizer, said he was encouraged by the number of people at the protest Saturday, although he is infuriated by the circumstances that necessitated the demonstration.

There will be another protest against ICE at 5 p.m. Sunday at Monument Square in coordination with other rallies across the country, he said.

“If there are any ICE agents reading this article, we do not want you here,” Ellis said. “You are not welcome here. You will never be welcome here.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/IMG_8651.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:24.790598

In the days since, that media presence has ebbed and flowed – though a well-resourced local news corps and many national journalists have remained, including reporters for the Guardian, covering additional clashes between police and protesters.

Another shooting (of a man attempting to flee arrest, the government said) on Wednesday drew more coverage, and on Thursday a CNN crew was hit with projectiles while covering a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While cuts and closures have thinned out local news reporting around the country, the Minneapolis media market remains strong, ensuring the shooting – and what has followed – have received robust coverage.

“I think we have the strongest media ecosystem of any city that’s parallel to our city,” said Matt Carlson, a Minneapolis-based professor of journalism for the University of Minnesota, mentioning the Star Tribune newspaper, Minnesota Public Radio, and smaller outlets such as the Sahan Journal, which covers immigrant communities, including the Somali refugee population that has come under attack from conservatives. (There’s also Alpha News, a conservative outlet that made headlines by publishing cell phone video taken by the ICE officer who killed Good.)

While there are always debates about national and international journalists parachuting in to cover catastrophes, “I think people in Minneapolis are actually excited to see national coverage of this, because we know that we can’t stop what’s happening by ourselves,” Carlson said.

He also predicted that Minneapolis will remain an epicenter of ICE activity and counter-protests, with Donald Trump recently threatening to invoke the Insurrection Action and send troops to the city.

“I would be very happy if the national news were able to leave because things have died down,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not a case where things are dying down.”

Here are some of the journalists and newsroom leaders who have participated in coverage.

Omar Jimenez, anchor and correspondent, CNN

Jimenez, 32, came to the story last week with a lot of experience reporting in Minneapolis.

In May 2020, Jimenez was arrested live on CNN while covering protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away from where Good was killed.

While Jimenez’s team was quickly released, the incident made international headlines as an extraordinary incursion into the activities of journalists.

Since then, Jimenez has returned to the city multiple times for reporting trips. He said his antenna is always up for stories involving Minneapolis. So he flew to Minnesota a few hours after the shooting, arriving on the evening of 7 January and driving straight from the airport to the spot where Good was shot.

“When it became clear that obviously this was going to be as big as it has become, that’s when a manager of mine kind of walked in and said, ‘Hey, are you able to go to Minnesota as soon as possible?’” (He was only delayed, he said, because he needed to go home and get warmer clothes after seeing the weather forecast in Minnesota.)

During his reporting in Minneapolis last week, Jimenez said he met several people that he first encountered back in 2020.

“It’s a little bit of a balance in the sense that you obviously don’t want to be the story,” he said. “But I do think what you want is to try and be able to convey an authentic space, especially when you have the luxury of a camera. Even though everyone is seeing what you’re seeing, they’re not feeling it. There is a little bit of a barrier still. And so that’s why it is a constant balance of: ‘how close do we want to get?’”

Jimenez got pretty close to the action on 8 January, when CNN viewers watched him and his crew running away from law enforcement agents who had moved aggressively toward protesters after someone threw a water bottle at them.

While Jimenez is now back in New York City, he said: “I am not done with this story. I can tell you that.”

Kathleen Hennessey, editor and senior vice-president, Minnesota Star Tribune

A veteran of the Associated Press and the New York Times, Hennessey only took on the top editorial position at the newspaper (which was previously called the Minneapolis Star Tribune) last May. It’s fair to say that she’s been busy, considering the number of major stories that have happened in the state since then, including the June 2025 assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.

“It’s been maybe busier, newsier than I expected to some degree, but it’s also been really rewarding to be at a place that feels so needed,” she said.

Hennessey’s newsroom of about 200 people has broken several major stories since the shooting, including being the first outlet to report the ICE officer’s name. That story drew a sharp rebuke from DHS press secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who called the outlet “reckless” and said it should “delete their story immediately” (it didn’t).

Hennessey said the decision to name the shooter (Jonathan Ross) was “a very deliberate, much-discussed decision” – but she added that it “wasn’t a particularly tough call”.

She said her news team had been “on edge and prepared and ready” for the Good story, considering the surge of deportation enforcement in recent weeks in the community.

“By this time, we feel pretty well practiced in sort of the quick mobilization of an all-hands-on-deck moment,” she said. “And so this was another one of those, really. Just about everybody immediately ran to their stations and did what they do.”

Considering how widely covered this story has been, “I encourage our newsroom to remember that nobody knows this place better than we do,” she said, “and nobody can be as close to the people involved, and be a more reliable source for people who actually live here.”

Unsurprisingly, Hennessey said the Star Tribune’s website has received a very large number of online readers over the last week and a half – though it’s a bit harder to net paying subscribers.

Going forward, she said she expects her newsroom to remain in overdrive covering the story. “It’s ongoing, it’s unfolding, and it feels very everywhere all at once,” she said. “At any given moment, there’s just a million videos popping up everywhere of incidents and encounters with ICE that feel newsworthy.”

Alex Tabet, political reporter, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)

Tabet, who arrived in Minnesota at 1am on 7 January, made it to the scene of the shooting extremely quickly. He had already been tipped off by an ICE observer that there was an enforcement action going on in the neighborhood, and then got word that someone had been shot. It was his third reporting trip to Minnesota over the past month. “We were the first – at least – TV crew on the ground,” he said.

Tabet’s first call was to his network’s editorial leaders and standards officials, telling them, “Hey, this is what we know, this is what we don’t know,” he said. “And we started vetting all of the information that we had to try to figure out what is appropriate to put on air, what should we hold off on, basically making sure we had hit the threshold of understanding what was going on.”

Tabet, who left Minnesota on Tuesday after almost a full week, said he’s “hoping to go back as soon as possible” – though he said the network is well staffed on the story. The decision to leave “was a discussion between my bosses and I, because there’s only so many days [you can go] without sleep”.

“I know MS NOW is committed to having a strong presence on the ground, because they recognize how important of a story this is right now,” he said.

Megan Burks, deputy managing producer, MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)

Burks, who coordinates daily news coverage for the NPR member station, said the newsroom had been settling into a new rhythm since the 7 January killing of Good. And then on Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg, leading to new protests and clashes with law enforcement.

“Just as it felt like we were settling into a manageable rhythm, this new twist came and now we’re back to trying to figure out what is our new normal, what is our new rhythm,” she said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.

“Knowing that we can’t focus on everything, we’re trying to let the audience drive some of what we choose to put our stamp on,” she said.

Nicole Sganga, homeland security correspondent, CBS News

Sganga arrived in Minneapolis two days before the shooting. She participated in a ride-along with immigration agents and interviewed Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, pressing her on how she can “justify” the government sending 2,000 DHS agents to the city.

In addition to reporting on the ground about Good’s killing, Sganga covered the intensification of immigration raids after the incident.

“My approach is always, ‘get there, bear witness, ask questions,’” Sganga said.

She said it’s been important to cover the story from Minneapolis to be able to press government officials on “contradictory accounts” of what happened and what is happening.

“That kind of independent reporting and verification is critical to holding power to account and to clarifying the facts for the public,” said Sganga, who has reported for the network for a decade.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db15c70b319ad3d587a5d51b7ccf3c7301280013/506_0_5055_4046/master/5055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91d9258b3d9dea6d35eeab10b3eab38",N,,2026-01-18 09:58:28.290296
