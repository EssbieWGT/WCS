The Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 marks a pivotal transformation in India’s immigration governance. It replaces a fragmented colonial-era regime with a unified, security-conscious, and digitally integrated legal framework. While jurisprudence under the new Act is still evolving, legacy cases and early judicial commentary offer critical insights into its constitutional and procedural implications.

From Fragmented Statutes to a Unified Law

Aspect Old Laws (Repealed) Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 Framework Dispersed across four statutes: The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; The Foreigners Act, 1946; and The Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act, 2000. Consolidated into a single comprehensive Act governing entry, visa, registration, and deportation. Institutional Control No centralized authority; enforcement was fragmented across agencies. Establishes the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) with statutory powers and centralized oversight. Entry & Exit Passport and visa requirements were scattered across multiple laws. Mandates both a valid passport and visa. Entry may be denied on grounds including national security and public health.

Key Provisions and Case-Informed Compliance

Mandatory Digital Reporting

The Act introduces mandatory digital reporting by Indian entities interacting with foreign nationals, reinforcing procedural accountability:

In Abdul Rahman v. State of Kerala (2010), the Kerala High Court emphasized the need for accurate registration of foreign nationals to prevent misuse of long-term visas.

The new biometric and institutional reporting requirements aim to pre-empt such lapses by embedding accountability into the system.

Enhanced Penalties and Procedural Streamlining

The Act codifies stricter penalties for immigration violations, addressing longstanding judicial concerns:

Unauthorized Entry: Punishable by up to 5 years’ imprisonment or a fine of ₹5 lakh.

Forged Documents: Attracts 2–7 years’ imprisonment and fines ranging from ₹1–10 lakh.

Compounding of Offences: Introduced for minor infractions to reduce judicial backlog and promote administrative efficiency.

These provisions respond to concerns raised in Mohd. Zakir v. State of Bihar (1997), where the court highlighted the inadequacy of deterrents under the previous legal regime.

Legal Orders and Emerging Constitutional Scrutiny

Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025

This Order exempts certain religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India before December 31, 2024, from being treated as illegal migrants.

The exemption mirrors the logic of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, and is likely to face constitutional scrutiny under Article 14.

In Harsh Mander v. Union of India (2020), the Supreme Court admitted petitions challenging religion-based exclusions under the CAA. Similar arguments are expected to surface against this Order.

Immigration and Foreigners Order, 2025 (Foreigners Tribunals)

This Order strengthens the powers of Foreigners Tribunals (FTs), equipping them with authority akin to First Class Judicial Magistrates.

FTs may now issue arrest warrants and detain individuals pending deportation, raising concerns around due process and natural justice.

In Union of India v. Ghaus Mohammed (1961), the Supreme Court upheld the principle that the burden of proof lies on the individual to establish citizenship—but emphasized procedural fairness.

The 2025 Order codifies detention mechanisms that may be tested against evolving standards of habeas corpus protections and administrative discretion.

Conclusion

The Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 represents a decisive shift in India’s immigration jurisprudence—centralizing authority, digitizing compliance, and recalibrating enforcement. As judicial review unfolds, particularly around the Exemption Order and Tribunal powers, courts will likely revisit foundational principles of equality, due process, and administrative fairness. These developments will shape the contours of India’s immigration law for years to come.

The protests came as the administration has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of executive authority, including the president's use of the military for domestic law enforcement, militarization of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agencies far away from national borders, detention of U.S. citizens without charge and deportations of legal immigrants without due process. Many of those detained have reported being held and transported in inhumane and unconstitutional conditions and members of Congress have complained of not being able to access detention sites.

The administration has also continued to try to withhold money from cities, states and counties that was already appropriated by Congress, as well as empower the president to fire federal employees and reshape federal agencies and departments in ways no other president has.

Similar protests in June recorded about 5 million participants. Saturday's demonstrations were planned in more than 2,700 communities across the nation, according to organizers, which included a broad coalition of formal groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and labor unions, and informal supporters, including the organizations Indivisible and 50501.

Demonstrations in the Bay Area were organized in San Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, Mill Valley, Berkeley, Contra Costa County, and several other cities and communities.

Two large events were San Francisco, including a demonstration at Ocean Beach's Sunset Dunes Park and a march from the Embarcadero to the Civic Center along Market Street.

Across the Bay, thousands of protesters streamed into Oakland's Wilma Chen Plaza just before noon where many held signs, wore colorful costumes, and gleefully chanted a unified message about their dissatisfaction with the Trump Administration.

Attendees laughed at the decorations that poked fun at the administration, but through smiles, people reiterated their concerns that their civil rights were in peril, and said it was their patriotic duty to push back.

Rachael Grail arrived to the march with her friends in inflatable costumes in an effort to spread joy to others.

""The reason we decided to wear these (outfits) is for strategic frivolity,"" said Grail. ""We want to stand for joy and kindness. By wearing these we show that we aren't playing by the same tactics as this administration with hate and fear.""

LIST: No Kings rallies protests in the Bay Area near me

Several organizations were involved in planning the Oakland event, including the ACLU of Alameda, Alameda Labor Council, SEIU 1021 and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Dr. Stewart Chen, a local activist in Oakland's Chinatown, spoke just before people marched to the Lake Merritt amphitheater.

""No Kings Day is not just a march. It is a reminder that power belongs to the people, and we have to fight back,"" said Chen.

After traveling several blocks through downtown Oakland, marchers arrived just after 1:30 p.m. at the Lake Merritt amphitheater to listen to local leaders speak.

Organizers from the activist group the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment set up tables across the lawn and walked around with flyers to get people registered to vote in the November election and vote in favor of Proposition 50, which would redraw California's congressional district lines for the next two election cycles to counter a move by Texas to redraw its districts to create a stated partisan advantage.

Valarie Bachelor, executive director of the Alliance said that, besides the protest, they want people to feel empowered.

""Today, and every time we protest against this authoritarian regime, we are saying Oakland will not be bullied, Oakland will not be broken, and Oakland will not buckle,"" Bachelor said.

U.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Oakland, railed against the administration during her speech.

""So, to our neighbors here, to our nation and to our collective people I want to be clear that we are, in fact, living in the midnight of our democracy. Those folks who believe they are powerful, they have shut down our government and dared to call it leadership. We say, 'hell no!'"" Simon told the crowd.

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said true patriotism was standing up for civil rights.

""We're here today because we are the patriots, not the ones waving the flag tearing down our democracy, but the ones standing up to protect it,"" said Lee. ""We are free people, and we intend to stay that way because in the United States of America, there are no kings. There's only 'We the people.'""

Teresa Salazar with Workers United spoke about the impact immigrants have felt following the increase in deportations and raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""We all have the right to due process and legal representation, which are all currently being denied. We don't need the National Guard or the police,"" said Salazar.

""We are currently fighting the federal effort to open a detention center in our county. We need to make sure that the administration knows that we do not want them and we need ice out of Dublin.""

The San Francisco march on Market Street was organized by National Nurses United, Indivisible SF, and the organization 50501.

Marchers packed Market Street for several large city blocks from the Embarcadero to Pine Street with a mass of people holding homemade signs, some dressed in costumes such as dinosaurs, bears, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Several had their dogs or children in tow.

Many held American flags and cheered when the San Francisco Police Department offered a brief police escort for the first marchers from their staging point at Sue Bierman Park onto Market Street.

As of about 2:30 p.m., the crowd was so thick many marchers were still waiting for their turn to enter Market Street to begin the march west to the Civic Center.

A spokesperson for the SFPD said the department had deployed additional resources to ensure the city's safety and said the demonstrations had been peaceful as of 3:30 p.m.

""At this time people have been peaceful and spirited in positive ways. We will do all that we can to ensure the safety of all those enjoying our city,"" said Officer Robert Rueca.

The Oakland No Kings rally continued with music and dance performances throughout the afternoon. Organizers continued to call for mobilization in the case the Trump administration goes through with its threat to send national guard troops to San Francisco.

In the city of Alameda, a crowd marched to city hall with signs denouncing the administration's actions on immigration and executive authority.

Tucson 'No Kings' rally demands Congress swear in Adelita Grijalva ...,Dawn Page,,,,,https://azluminaria.org/2025/10/18/we-are-guerreras-tucson-no-kings-rally-demands-congress-swear-in-adelita-grijalva-calls-to-end-trump-era/,"The “No Kings” rally in Tucson stood out from the more than 2,700 planned demonstrations in cities and towns across the nation.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Grijalva until the House is back in legislative session.
Like Grijalva, Romero made history when she became Tucson’s first woman mayor, first Latina elected to the office and the only Latina mayor in the nation’s 50 largest cities when she won her first term in 2019.
CAGES.” “Yes, we want to swear in Adelita Grijalva because we voted for her fair and square,” Romero yells to the crowd.
“I’m so grateful for your continued support,” Grijalva says.","“We love our country. Save our democracy. No kings,” says Davina Martínez, holding a protest sign with a raised brown fist and handwritten words — “RESIST” — in bold red and black ink.

Standing amid rowdy chants and cheers, echoing against the sand-colored walls of a historic Tucson courthouse, Martínez is one of tens of thousands of people— citizens and non-citizens alike — who took to the streets across America on Saturday. They wanted their voices heard at the “No Kings” rallies against the actions and policies of President Donald Trump and his Republican administration.

“It’s not about our people, our education, our public health — We’re in danger with Trump,” Martínez says, as a woman passes by carrying a sign with an American flag, a peace sign and a red heart that reads: “NO KINGS IN THE U.S.A.”

The fired-up crowd at downtown Tucson’s El Presidio Plaza for the rally includes religious leaders, pro-immigrant organizations, grassroots coalitions, labor unions, Democratic officials and families of all ages.

Demonstrators speak in Spanish and English in their borderlands community, where everyone understands when they hear “presente” that it’s a united show of support.

Republicans have pushed back against the rallies calling the protests and protesters un-American.

Organizers say the rallies are a celebration of First Amendment rights to free speech and to assemble in solidarity. Protesters are pushing back against Trump administration policies, including aggressive immigration enforcement that has separated families, ignored due process rights to deport immigrants to foreign jails and ensnared U.S. citizens, as well as sent troops and masked agents into Democrat-leaning cities.

The “No Kings” rally in Tucson stood out from the more than 2,700 planned demonstrations in cities and towns across the nation. In the Southwest state’s second largest municipality, many protesters denounced the Republican-controlled Congress for not swearing-in Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva, leaving thousands of Southern Arizonans without representation in the legislative branch of their federal government.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Grijalva until the House is back in legislative session. Grijalva was elected nearly one month ago in a Sept. 23 special election, making history as the first Latina and Chicana to represent Arizona in Congress.

The race to represent Arizona’s Congressional District 7 — which encompasses a large swath of Southern Arizona and six counties — was spurred by the death in March of Raúl Grijalva, Adelita’s father. He represented the deep-blue district for more than 20 years. Democrats have threatened a lawsuit to force Johnson to uphold the rights of Southern Arizonans demanding representation.

Surrounded by local constituents, Congresswoman-elect Grijalva and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero are standing next to each other. Like Grijalva, Romero made history when she became Tucson’s first woman mayor, first Latina elected to the office and the only Latina mayor in the nation’s 50 largest cities when she won her first term in 2019.

Protesters recognize Grijalva and Romero for having long fought for each other, for Tucsonans, for the rights of immigrants, Latinos and the most vulnerable people in their communities. That matters to Tucsonans cheering as their elected Southern Arizona representatives encourage the crowd to fight for their country’s values of freedom, liberty and justice.

“We’re defending democracy, fighting fascism and dictatorship, and oligarchy,” Romero says in an interview with Arizona Luminaria, before she speaks to the crowd, explaining why she joined the rally. “I want to make sure I let Tucsonans know that I stand in solidarity with them.”

The buzz around Grijalva’s delayed swearing-in ceremony resonates with demonstrators.

Their support turns into a rallying cry as Romero takes the stage. Chants of “Swear her in! Swear her in!” echo through the plaza as people call for an end to Trump-era politics. Grijalva throws a peace sign to the cheering crowd and places her hand over heart, standing in front of signs that say, “VETERANS AGAINST TRUMP.” “RESIST” “NO BANS. RAIDS. CAGES.”

“Yes, we want to swear in Adelita Grijalva because we voted for her fair and square,” Romero yells to the crowd. “We followed the rules. We want her in Congress.”

Invoking the legacy of late Congressman Raúl Grijalva, Romero raises her arm and shouts: “That is what he taught all of us — stand up in the face of power.”

As Grijalva takes the mic, chants of “Swear her in! Swear her in!” grow louder.

“I’m so grateful for your continued support,” Grijalva says. “We know how to fight back. Standing in union and solidarity is what we must do — for those who can’t be here, who are afraid of this administration. People are literally disappearing off our streets. We have to come together as a community and stand up for them.”

Grijalva speaks to the power of those able to show up.

“Thank you to each and every one of you for using your privilege to be here in unity. It’s an honor to be here with my community, my friends — and my mamá,” she says. “We love our community, and we want to make sure that generations from now, they can look back and know we stood up.”

Grijalva shares what many at the rally believe is at stake for their families, friends and their country.

“This administration wants to eliminate every one of us,” she says. “We are the 99%. We must remind them: We are here. We’re not going anywhere. And we’re going to make some changes in this next election.”

Grijalva also reflects on the legacy of her father:

“My dad was unapologetically the most progressive member of Congress. He never stopped,” she says. “When he passed away, I had to make a decision — and that decision was easier because of the support of this community.”

Ending in a steady voice on the strength she draws from those who came before her, Grijalva recalls her grandfather’s words.

“So, when I get to Congress and they try to ignore me,” she says while the crowd boos, “as my Tata would say: No te dejes, mijita. I’m not going to. You elected an Adelita. Adelitas were women soldiers — guardians of the revolution. We are guerreras. And I will keep fighting until we get the representation this community deserves.”

Cecilia Valdez, Chair of the Pima Area Labor Federation — which represents affiliated unions across Pima County — also urges Congress to swear in Grijalva, emphasizing that more than 800,000 constituents are currently without representation.

“My message today is that we’re in a labor organizing crisis,” Valdez says. “We’re facing serious challenges because of the Trump administration, which eliminated nearly a million federal government jobs. That impacts all workers — especially union members.”

Valdez continues as the crowd breaks into chants of, “Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”

“The fact that Trump is taking from the poor to feed the rich is wrong,” she says “Our federal workers need to go back to work — they shouldn’t be getting fired. They deserve the jobs they have.”

Martínez — the Tucsonan holding a protest sign with a raised brown fist and the handwritten words “RESIST” — is outraged.

“It’s a disgrace. Adelita was elected democratically by the people of Arizona,” she says.

Martínez’s husband, Glen Harelson, is equally furious. Arizona voters’ voices are being silenced, he says.

“She’s our representative — and yet we’re not represented, because she hasn’t been sworn in,” Harelson says. “I don’t like (Trump), his cabinet choices, his policies. It’s all about him, not about the country or our democracy.”

Lidia Godínez and her 10-year-old daughter, Melina Godínez, came to support their community and their country, carrying signs that read: “LONG LIVE REBELLION” and “I CAN’T BELIEVE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO ADULTS.”

“To fight for our rights and support our community,” Godínez says. “I have daughters and sons, and I want them to grow up in a world where their voices are heard. We need to keep rallying and protesting because this is what’s right — to show that we care and support each other.”

Melina’s handmade sign in red and blue paint on white posterboard is so big, she holds it just under her chin, over her long black hair and covering her body down to her knees. Her fingers curl alongside the all-caps word: “EXPLAIN.”",https://azluminaria.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PHOTO-2025-10-18-11-09-48-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 02:02:05.394247

Catch up quick: Since Trump launched ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in Chicago last month, an ICE officer shot and killed a man in suburban Franklin Park. Federal agents also swept up U.S. citizens and zip-tied children during a raid on a South Shore apartment building, according to witnesses and local advocacy groups. National Guard troops were dispatched, but a judge's temporary restraining order halted their deployment.

Meanwhile, large Latino areas such as Little Village have seen drastic declines in business as many residents are too afraid to leave the house to shop, or even go to work and school.

Rapid response groups have trained community members in alerting neighborhoods to ICE's presence and families have stepped in to protect students whose immigrant parents are being swept up by officers.

What they're saying: ""When we see ICE, we yell ""ICE."" It's good in a way that we see the way that community has come together to help each other out,"" Isis Espinoza of Ashburn told Axios at Saturday's march.

""The livelihood of places like Little Village has gone down. It's depressing to see it, because, where is the Hispanic essence in the heart of the Hispanic essence of Chicago?""

The events were part of a national “No Kings” day of protest, the second one since President Donald Trump took office in January. A coalition of progressive and labor groups organizing the national day of action say the demonstrations are in response to “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”

In Chattanooga, crowd size was estimated at around 3,000 attendees, but protests weren’t limited to Tennessee’s large cities, as small towns like Tazewell and Pikeville in East Tennessee and Union City in West Tennessee held events.

Grandson of immigrants worries about economy, due process

Mike Ondek of Nashville wore an inflatable chicken suit to attend the capital city’s protest, held on the grounds of the Tennessee Capitol. His parents immigrated to the U.S. from Slovakia and he said he’s concerned about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and a lack of due process for those being deported.

But the economy is also on his mind.

“I don’t like what’s going on and I’m supposed to be retiring this year and I have no idea what’s going on with Medicaid, the economy,” Ondek said. “I lost so much last time the economy tanked with my 401(k) and built it back up but there’s so much uncertainty.

Immigrant ancestors, fears for the future spur Nashville turnout

Many attendees of the Nashville No Kings event said they were motivated to protest by their fears of fascism, referring to ancestors who fought for the U.S. or to worries about the world their children and grandchildren will inherit.

John Kelty, 65, of Nashville said he is “haunted by the ghost” of an ancestor, also named John Kelty, who fought with George Washington during the Revolutionary War.

“It’s a lot easier to start this up now than for our grandchildren to have to face this when they grow up,” Kelty said, noting he also had seven uncles who fought against fascist regimes in World War II. “We are at the beginning of a fascist takeover.”

Friends Mike Minggia and Crow Lee Belcher expressed similar sentiments.

“(Republicans) love to say our country is divided,” said Belcher, a U.S. Army veteran and artist “This administration is doing everything it can to divide us. They’re not hiding their intentions so we’re not going to hide either.”

“The three branches of government aren’t working,” Minggia said, adding that he fears the U.S. is heading towards fascism. “The Republican government has capitulated to what Donald Trump wants.”

Claire Meneely and John Spragens attended the event with their daughter, Iris, 7, who was holding a sign featuring singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.

“We don’t want Trump to be king because he can be mean to a lot of immigrants and he kicks out a lot of immigrants,” said Iris Spragens, who said she wished Parton were president. “I think (Parton) would make this a better place.”

Retired physician Clay MacConnell, who attended with his wife, Wendy, said he is deeply concerned about Trump’s cuts to the nation’s science and health care infrastructure, including the Centers for Disease Control.

“I’m here for our grandchildren to protect their future, because the way it’s going, I’m scared,” MacConnell said. “I’m scared the education that my grandchildren are getting won’t be the real history.

Wendy MacConnell had thoughts about the Trump administration’s portrayal of No Kings day.

“They’re trying to whitewash this to make it seem like America doesn’t want this — but look around, look around at all these people,” she said.

Tennessee Highway Patrol arrests 71-year-old protester in Monroe County

An East Tennessee woman was arrested Saturday during a No Kings protest and booked into the Monroe County Justice Center.

Anna M. Grabowski, 71, of Ten Mile, was charged with obstructing a highway/passage and failure to obey a law enforcement officer, a Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy confirmed. Bond was set at $5,000: friends and supporters of Grabowski raised money to pay her bond and she was released from jail at 6:30 p.m.

Wesley Kile, one of the approximately 40 people participating in the No Kings protest, said he, Grabowski and two other people were protesting at the same location — on the shoulder of the road adjacent to a bridge — earlier in the month and were told by a Highway Patrol officer, a Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy and a Sweetwater police officer they were allowed to be there.

Grabowski ran as a Democrat for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 2024 and 2016, losing both times to incumbent Republican Rep. Dan Howell of Cleveland.

No other arrests have been reported from the 33 No Kings events across the state.

In Memphis, a peaceful protest as federal task force continues to make arrests

One day after Shelby County officials, including Mayor Lee Harris, and state lawmakers from Memphis filed suit against Gov. Bill Lee over what they allege is unconstitutional deployment of Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis, an estimated 7,000 gathered at Poplar and Highland Park.

Memphis has become a focus of Trump administration law enforcement activities and is one of three cities in the nation — Chicago and Portland are the others — with National Guard troops deployed to allegedly deter crime.

The Trump administration remains deeply unpopular, and the No Kings protests have the potential to push that unpopularity to new heights.","Last Friday, new talking points were seemingly rolled out across the MAGA sphere. Top GOP leadership, from House Speaker Mike Johnson to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, began seeding a narrative about today’s “No Kings” protests.

Rather than describing them for what they are — First Amendment-protected rallies where millions of Americans are expected to peacefully stand against the Trump administration’s unconstitutional, authoritarian, and un-American agenda — Republican leadership is framing the upcoming demonstrations as “Hate America” protests. Party leaders also called the gatherings “terrorist” and “Soros-funded” events that would be filled to the brim with “the antifa crowd, the pro-Hamas crowd, and the Marxists.”

This trial-balloon messaging is meant to get ahead of what organizers say could be one of the largest days of mass protest in U.S. history, with events planned in every state. Millions of Americans are projected to attend some 2,500 rallies to oppose the illegality and immorality of the Trump agenda, the destruction of hard-won civil and constitutional rights, and the fascist ambitions of the MAGA movement. Republican leaders are attempting to preemptively cast this protest within the framework Stephen Miller has been working to aggressively mainstream since the assassination of Charlie Kirk, where all who oppose the extremist MAGA agenda are “domestic terrorists.”

To their credit, Democratic and Independent leaders responded quickly. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a statement pointing out that the No Kings protests are protected under the First Amendment and, contrary to right-wing smears, protesters are standing up for American values. Former Republican and now Independent Joe Walsh called out the GOP’s attempt to vilify half of the American electorate as “shameful” in a post on Twitter and urged his followers to attend the protests, emphasizing that his former party is “scared to death” of the looming rallies.

It’s true: MAGA is terrified of the specter of massive nonviolent protest — and for good reason. Nothing threatens their agenda more than millions of ordinary Americans mobilizing to put a face to the opposition.

The Impact of Images of Dissent

The administration has been working overtime in recent weeks to vilify and alienate its opposition, painting Democrats and left-leaning activists alike as violent extremists. With their media footholds and tight messaging discipline, they’ve had some success in painting a picture of a fictional, widespread antifa threat, which is already serving as a pretext for the Trump’s administration’s Justice Department to file terrorism charges against its foes.

But pictures are louder than words or soundbites. Even small-scale protests, like the inflatable frog demonstrations against ICE in Oregon, have resonated widely and effectively negated MAGA’s breathless portrayal of Portland as a city under siege by any forces other than the National Guard.

By making visible both the magnitude of opposition to MAGA’s authoritarianism and the everyday relatability of the Americans who are taking a righteous stand, the No Kings rallies pose a real PR problem for the extremist right. They puncture the narrative fictions that the MAGA movement has been working so hard to construct and undermine the credibility of their messengers. They also force GOP leaders into the awkward position of explaining why a large swath of the American public, from every walk of life are, supposedly “domestic terrorists.”

Mass nonviolent protests also effectively jolt the disengaged public to pay attention. Americans understandably tune out of day-to-day politics to focus on their immediate sphere; they’re overwhelmed, exhausted, and cynical about politics. But moments of mass protests, when millions are in the streets, are hard to ignore. They generate news coverage and powerful images that serve as irrefutable proof that all is not well, and there is widespread opposition to the regime’s agenda. Critically, they also remind us that we’re not standing alone.

The Persuasive Power of Protest

Protests as evidence of widespread defiance also reach far beyond the American public. They resonate with international audiences and key decision-makers in places like the Supreme Court, the military, and other institutions that may soon be in a position to decide if they will further comply with the administration’s demands.

Political scientists Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan’s widespread research on the power of nonviolent protest spells out how protest and institutional compliance impact one another. In their findings, they identify that once 3.5 percent of a country’s population is engaged in sustained nonviolent protest, authoritarian regimes find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their agendas. That’s because visible protest from large swaths of the population signals a deeper opposition throughout society, including within the very institutions and constituencies an authoritarian regime needs to enforce its will. Widespread public resistance makes obedience — and the carrying out of unconstitutional orders — exponentially harder.

And even for those sitting on the fence, mass protest is among the most powerful tools of persuasion available. The Trump administration remains deeply unpopular, and the No Kings protests have the potential to push that unpopularity to new heights.

Throughout U.S. history, mass protest has driven some of our most consequential shifts in public opinion. Mass protests were critical in building public support and shaping beliefs to win core democratic advances, including civil rights, the social safety net, and women’s suffrage. Sociologist Charles Tilly distilled the key qualities that make mass protest persuasive, popular, and durable. His framework offers four key elements for a successful movement: worthiness, which hinges on the credibility of the participants; unity, which refers to the cohesiveness of the messages; numbers, or the size of the protest; and commitment, or ability of those involved to persevere.

Scholars later added a fifth — diversity — to assess the breadth of who is represented. Together, these elements correlate strongly with a movement’s legitimacy, its ability to inspire bystanders to join in, and its power to influence elites and institutions.

The last time this full constellation appeared in the United States was during the overwhelmingly peaceful George Floyd protests. It may be hard to remember in this moment of revisionist backlash, but that massive, multiracial, and persistent protest moment powerfully shifted the national conversation on systemic racism. In the summer of 2020, nearly 1 in 5 Americans named race relations as the country’s top concern, and a majority recognized systemic racism as a societal problem. That surge in public consciousness and moral urgency around ending systemic racism was so persuasive and enduring that it drove Democratic voter registration and helped propel Joe Biden to victory in the 2020 election.

Through this framework, we can clearly understand the threat the MAGA regime sees in the No Kings protests: Millions (numbers) of everyday Americans (worthiness) from all walks of life (diversity) standing together (unity) for the second time (commitment) for core American values and constitutional and civil rights pose an existential threat to authoritarian ambitions. It is a potential turning point — one that could accelerate the erosion of support for MAGA’s political project, grow the pro-democracy movement that opposes it, and sow seeds of doubt within the administration’s ranks.

Fascists Fight Back

Around the world, authoritarians are wising up. In their research, Chenoweth notes that globally nonviolent movements are meeting less success than in decades past, as regimes coordinate with each other and devise new strategies to curtail their impact, such as controlling the flow of information and working to outright criminalize protest. It’s happening in the US, too: The Trump administration is keenly aware of the potential for mass nonviolent protest to shape public sentiment, which is why it is moving quickly to undermine and dismantle all infrastructure for opposition and organized dissent.

The primary MAGA crony behind this effort is White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller has made abundantly clear that he intends to dismantle his political opposition by forcing the narrative that any opposition to his agenda should be tamped down using the full power of the state. He recently seized his opportunity to create a new designation of domestic terrorism to justify the investigation, dismantling, and defunding of oppositional civil society.

The administration is moving forward with plans to weaponize the IRS and so it can be used to launch criminal probes into left-leaning philanthropic and civil society organizations. Trump acolyte Sen. Ted Cruz has introduced legislation that will make it easier to charge organizations that fund or support public mobilization with RICO charges, and just this week he invoked No Kings as one reason to pass the bill.

The administration hasn’t been shy about the groups it wants to target first. Trump himself has said he wants to go after his enemies on the left. A shoddy report from the conservative nonprofit Capital Research Center, which is believed to be a guiding document for the administration crackdown, cites mass-mobilizing groups like Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the youth-led Sunrise Movement as “inciting terrorism.” It’s no accident that among MAGA’s first targets are organizations that have the strongest track records of nonviolently mobilizing the American public at scale and facilitating media-friendly protests that can move public opinion. Getting rid of organizations that empower Americans to participate in legible nonviolent mobilization is a great way of ensuring that the conceptions of the opposition that reach the public are those that feed the MAGA narrative of a deranged left.

That is why mass public opposition is so vital now, before this crackdown fully takes hold. This is a crossroads moment for our country, and the media should give these protests the coverage and consideration they deserve.

When the attacks against the civic sector organizations that support and anchor mobilization do come, they must be called out for what they are: as nothing less than efforts to stifle free expression, crush the First Amendment, and silence dissent.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2222872800-e1760731242438.jpg?fit=5000%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-18 23:01:56.115049

Bob Ferguson struck a defiant tone at the No Kings day rally in Everett, Washington, where thousands of people attended on Saturday.

“As governor, I promise you one thing above all else, we will never, ever under any circumstances, bend the knee to this autocrat,” he said of President Donald Trump.

In Everett, roughly 4,000 people attended the demonstration, according to Snohomish County Indivisible, the event organizers. The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.”

Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.

In his remarks he cited a letter U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to him in August which threatened to withhold federal funding and prosecute elected leaders if they failed to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

“I can sum up the response letter with two words, hell no,” Ferguson said.

Ferguson said democracies die by a slow, steady erosion of civil liberties and free speech, a gradual consolidation of power in one individual, and prosecuting political enemies with criminal charges.

“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.

He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined. This alliance is aimed to protect public health by breaking away from the guidance of the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“Robert, that guy’s a crank, right?” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, he’s in charge of public health for our country.”

Anita Dietrich, founder of Snohomish County Indivisible, described the actions of Trump as reckless, corrupt and more dangerous than ever.

“They want us silent while they target immigrant families, while they strip our rights, shred our schools, hand our future to billionaire cronies and act like kings above the law,” Dietrich said. “But America has no kings, not now, not ever.”

The first No Kings day was held in June and drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. It was one of the largest protests in Seattle’s history and in Olympia, over 5,000 people attended.

In the demonstration on Saturday, people began to gather around 12 p.m. near the Snohomish county courthouse in Everett. The official event with speakers began around 1 p.m.. and finished shortly after 2 p.m. once it started raining.

In Olympia, meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 people, some in costume and most toting signs emblazoned with personal political messages, attended the rally at the state Capitol.

Seated on the steps of the Capitol and Temple of Justice, they cheered loudly as David Reaves, senior pastor of New Life Baptist Church in Lacey, proclaimed to the “architects of mischief, your time is up.”

“This is a call to the real America. Hold onto hope and protect it fiercely,” he said, imploring attendees to commit to be actively engaged. “Whatever you do, damn it, do something,” he said.

These are citizens.” Michigan Advance Editor-in-Chief Jon King and Freelance Reporter Erick Diaz Veliz contributed to this story.","As the administration of President Donald Trump continues to usher in anti-democratic policies, turns federal agents against migrants and begins a crackdown on any resistance against his administration and its policies, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Saturday across Michigan to join in the nationwide No Kings rallies.

More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.

At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.

For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.

As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.

Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd.

Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE.

Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest.

“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”

Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.

“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.

The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.

Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.”

Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.

State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

Michiganders show up across the state to oppose Trump policies and say ‘No Kings’

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”

There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.

On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.

The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.

Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.

“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”

Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.

“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.

Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond

Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.

Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”

“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue

“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”

After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.

“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.

“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

(AP) — At a Spanish-speaking town hall, the Republican candidate for New Jersey governor assured two young Mexican immigrants who were brought to the United States as children that people without criminal records would not face deportation. Three nights later, Jack Ciattarelli headlined a “Make America Great Again”-style event where a far-right commentator joked about building a detention center like Florida's “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Garden State.

“How about the Boardwalk Brig?” Jack Posobiec said with a laugh as he spoke later that evening at the rally.

Ciattarelli, an unabashed ally of Donald Trump, recently gave the Republican president an “A” grade for his performance in the White House. But as Ciattarelli courts Latino voters in a hard-fought race against Democrat Mikie Sherrill, the former business owner and state legislator has put some distance from Trump on the president's signature issue of immigration.

Expressing support for issuing driver's licenses and Social Security numbers to people who are in the U.S. illegally, Ciattarelli has tried to strike a balance between supporters of Trump's mass deportation strategy and Latino voters that the GOP nominee thinks could be persuaded to support him.

In recent appearances in a Univision forum and in the final debate of the campaign, Ciattarelli promoted not a path to citizenship, as immigration advocates have pushed for years, but what he called a “pathway to recognition,” which he later described as a first step toward citizenship.

It's a high-stakes gambit in one of two states with governor's races this year — Virginia is the other — but it's rooted in Trump's improved performance among Latino voters last year. In New Jersey, for example, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns where he had lost by more than 30 percentage and 50 percentage points, respectively, in 2016. While the state typically votes Democratic in Senate and presidential election years, and Trump has lost it in all three of his White House runs, it has swung back and forth between parties in odd-year contests for governor.

Ciattarelli's more lenient stance toward some immigrants emerges amid Trump's all-out effort to increase deportations, even among those with no criminal record beyond violating immigration laws. Ciattarelli has softened his position in some respects, but he also has made clear that he wants New Jersey law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

Sherrill, a congresswoman in her fourth term, has hammered Trump throughout the race, casting herself as a bulwark against the administration. But she has not made immigration a campaign emphasis.

Ciattarelli navigates the delicate politics of immigration

Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly and in local office before that, had been critical of Trump during the run-up to the 2016 election. While serving in the Legislature, he supported a bill that provided for in-state tuition for certain immigrants without lawful status.

In the governor's race, he has aligned himself with Trump on at least some of the president's immigration policies. Ciattarelli has also said that, if elected, his first executive order would be to repeal the state's Immigrant Trust Directive, which prohibits police from cooperating on civil immigration enforcement matters. He also has expressed opposition to giving birthright citizenship to children born to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally.

During a debate with Sherrill last week, Ciattarelli said he agreed with Trump that anyone with a “history of criminality” should be deported, as well as anyone who “committed a crime or scam.” But he broke with Trump slightly when he said: “I believe that everyone else should be put on a pathway to recognition.”

In front of Spanish-speaking audiences, Ciattarelli has boasted of supporting in-state tuition to students without lawful status, a practice that has been targeted by the Trump administration.

“I do not believe that anyone should be living in the shadows. If we’re giving you a pathway to recognition, that to me starts with some form of government issued ID including driver’s license,” Ciattarelli said in the Univision forum, fielding translated questions in Spanish from New Jersey residents, which he answered in English.

Why does it matter?

Ciattarelli is hoping to reach a key constituency in the state, where Trump cut into Democrats' edge with Latino voters in 2024, as he did across the board in New Jersey. Voter unease about the economy is sure to be central to that effort.

New Jersey Democrats, too, have largely shifted their focus to the economy and driving down costs with polls showing inflation was a top concern among Hispanics. About 1 in 5 residents in New Jersey are Hispanic, according to the census.

Trump lost New Jersey last November to Democrat Kamala Harris by just 6 percentage points — a shift from his nearly 13-point deficit to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among Latino voters, Trump's support went from 28% in 2020 to 43% in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate.

How the shift sits with Republicans

Republicans who enthusiastically embraced the president's crackdown on illegal immigration may disagree with Ciattarelli's views, but many still back him.

“There are certain people it might deter,” said Ed Durr, a former state senator and Ciattarelli's primary foe who now backs him. “There are hard-liners who are going to see that as acquiescent to the Democrats.”

Still other Republicans say his policy looks good compared with the position taken by leading New Jersey Democrats. Mario Kranjac, another former primary opponent in the governor's race who has embraced Trump, invoked Sherrill, U.S. Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer.

“Mikie, Cory, Andy, Josh and their fellow Democrats support sanctuary cities and illegal immigration which foster crime and unnecessary expense,” he said. “While Jack doesn't.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on claims by Ciattarelli that he would be able to work with the Trump administration to exempt deportations of people without criminal records.

Outside a campaign stop at a pizzeria earlier this week, Ciattarelli repeated that some people should not be deported and should instead be brought out “from the shadows.” A request to the campaign to clarify how he reconciles his position with the president’s was not answered.

'He is pretending to care'

Sherrill reacted to Ciattarelli's “pathway to recognition” with skepticism.

“That’s not really a real thing. That doesn’t confer any status to anyone,” she said during the debate. She has promoted her background as a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted criminals, in addition to her work on federal legislation to create opportunities for citizenship.

She summed up their difference this way: “At the end of the day, he’s always going to do what Trump tells him to do.”

Asked repeatedly if she would keep the Immigrant Trust Directive in place, Sherrill has said only that she would enforce the law.

Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who is advising Sherrill, said Ciattarelli is trying to “sound compassionate” toward Latinos who are increasingly worried the Trump administration is scaling up its actions against immigrants and affecting Hispanic businesses as a result.

“He is pretending to care about immigrants and be compassionate, but he is not giving you facts,” Campos-Medina said. “We all should be asking, ‘How are you going to protect data from the Donald Trump machine? New Jersey already recognizes immigrants. How are you going to keep that promise?’”

Standing among hundreds at the “No Kings” rally outside the Manchester Center in Fresno, she said it was time for her to speak out in support of immigrants amid escalating ICE activity across the country.

“I’m out here today because I’m seeing how this administration is destroying our democracy and dividing us, ignoring the Constitution,” she said. “Immigrants are not the enemy, and anyone who is out here supporting our First Amendment rights is not the enemy.”

Thousands of protesters gathered peacefully Saturday near the Manchester Center at Blackstone and Shields avenues in Fresno, and along the Clovis Old Town Trail near Shaw and Clovis avenues, as part of the growing nationwide “No Kings” movement. The rallies voiced opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration raids, the government shutdown and what protesters described as authoritarian tactics used by federal agents, among other things.

“I want basic human rights for all. I want respect for all, and I want Trump out of office,” said Ayse Kblemet, a protester outside the Manchester Center who also joined the rally in response to the ongoing government shutdown. “Trump has to stop bullying the Congress and blaming Democrats. It’s a terrible and inappropriate look for an elected official to place undue blame on other elected officials. Everyone should be getting compensated for their work.”

At both locations, demonstrators waved American and Mexican flags, held up handmade signs reading “No Kings,” and chanted slogans demanding accountability from government leaders. Phrases like “Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” and “The people united will never be divided” echoed from the busy Fresno intersection and the scenic trail in Clovis, drawing honks and cheers from passing cars and cyclists.

The rallies were organized by local nonprofits, community organizers and labor unions, including the May 1st Coalition and the National Union of Healthcare Workers. They followed large “No Kings” protests in June.

Singleton Papendick, a Clovis mom, organized the rally along the Old Town trail with a small team of volunteer safety coordinators by her side.

“The number one thing for me, and from what a lot of people who I’ve talked to have discussed, is exercising our free speech, the First Amendment right,” Papendick said. “To peacefully assemble is huge, and I feel like right now this administration is attacking and using not truthful rhetoric about who is trying to get out and protest and speak their minds.”

The Manchester Center protest drew a diverse crowd of students, families, and longtime activists who lined the sidewalks near one of the city’s busiest transit corridors.

“A good portion of my family has had history with ICE, so it’s just bringing up a lot of bad memories. They’re not willing to come out right now because they’ve been through it,” said Angel Sanchez, a protester at Manchester Center who was holding up a sign that read “More Reformation, Less Deportation.”

“They’re always telling me to be careful and to stay safe,” she said.

The Fresno Police Department was out patrolling the area of Manchester Center during the ‘No Kings’ demonstration that brought thousands to the event. Officers were out to make sure the demonstration was peaceful and that people remained on the sidewalk and away from the median on Blackstone Avenue, near Shields.

“We have flexed additional personnel to work the area,” Fresno police Lt. David Madrigal told The Bee. “Our patrol efforts are to maintain high visibility as well as enforcement action if needed. We have been working with the event coordinator to establish event guidelines. Our officers are also monitoring any potential counterprotests. Overall, we expect a safe event where people can demonstrate peacefully.”

Police said 25 citations were issued; four warnings were given; one vehicle was towed for reckless driving, and six misdemeanor citations related to vehicle code were issued.

In Clovis, the demonstration spanned part of the Old Town Trail’s east side near Shaw, a normally quiet stretch that became a hub of chants and music throughout the afternoon. Though typically seen as a more conservative part of the region, Clovis organizers and attendees said they were motivated to show that resistance to federal overreach isn’t limited by geography.

“I feel like somebody needs to stand up and say we still believe in human rights, and truth, and freedom from oppression and just basic decency,” said Carly Oliver, a protester in Clovis. “I wasn’t sure if there would be as good of a turnout, but Clovis is showing up.”

The Manchester Center protest drew thousands of participants at its peak, while the Clovis event saw 600-1,000 people join in throughout the day. Both protests remained mostly peaceful, and there was little visible counter-protest at either site. Although in Clovis, some drivers yelled “Trump” out of their windows and flipped off protesters.

Nelson Esparza, who represents District 7, which includes parts of central and east Fresno, was seen at the “No Kings” protest at the Manchester Center. He later participated in a kids Halloween event at a parking lot in the area.

“I thought people came out in full force from all over the community. Blocks and blocks and blocks were crowded with attendees,” he said. “It really reflects the angst, the frustration, the anger with this current administration that our country is having to endure. Fundamentally what we’re all seeing is the erosion of our democracy.”

Congressman Jim Costa and former state assemblymember Juan Arambula were also spotted at the Manchester Center rally.

The rallies in Fresno and Clovis are two of more than 2,500 protests that took place across all 50 states today, putting it on track to surpass the demonstrations held on June 14 that mobilized millions of people in over 1,500 cities.

The protests take their name to declare that America has no kings. “The president thinks his rule is absolute,” the group’s website says. “We won’t back down against the chaos, corruption, and cruelty.”

About 15 protests were scheduled around Alabama, part of over 2,600 demonstrations scheduled on Saturday that were expected to draw millions of people. Speakers and participants criticized the administration’s seizure of power; its arrest and detention of immigrants and its policies toward health care. Others said Trump administration policies were hurting members of their families.

The protests were largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported.

A similar round of protests were held in June and drew millions of people to 1,500 sites nationwide. About 14 of those protests were held in Alabama that day with thousands of people in attendance.

Crowd sizes varied, from about 40 people in Selma to up to 2,000 in Birmingham. Here are reports from four of the protests on Saturday.

Birmingham: Calls for community and activism

A crowd of approximately 2,000 people gathered in Railroad Park Saturday for Birmingham’s “No Kings” protest, hearing from speakers including former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones before peacefully marching along a seven-block parade route, carrying signs and engaging in call-and-response chants while drivers honked their horns in support.

“We’re here today, like so many more that have come to Birmingham before us, not just for a No Kings rally but for civil rights, for anti-war protests, you name it, to speak out about injustices when they see it,” Jones told the cheering audience that filled the park’s pavilion and spilled onto a hillside beyond it.

“We’re here because, ‘Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than a generation away from extinction,’” he continued, quoting Ronald Reagan’s 1967 inaugural address as California’s governor. “Two hundred and fifty years ago, this country was born of one thing that every American generation has reaffirmed: no kings.”

Attendees hailing from Birmingham and surrounding suburbs and towns cited concerns about human rights and vulnerable people, including the poor and immigrants, threats to democracy and freedom of speech, and opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies as reasons they came to the rally.

“I thought it was very important that we come out and that we show, really, as a country, how we feel about what’s going on in our government, how oppressive it is, and that we’re saying, ‘No,’” said DeValerie Williams of Birmingham. “We’re saying, ‘No, we love our country. We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.”

In her remarks to the crowd, Rev. Julie Conrady of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham said the city redefined freedom and equality in 1965.

“Over and over in the history of our country, we, the people, have been the necessary checks and balances to ensure that our country continues to progress, improve and prosper,” Conrady said.

She encouraged people to get involved in local causes.

“There is not a lot we can do at the federal government right now,” Conrady said. “One party controls all three branches of government, and one despot’s marching orders control them all. Our resistance must focus locally and statewide, where together, we can make meaningful change.”

Quoting the words of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called the No Kings protests a “hate-America rally,” attendees and speakers at the Birmingham event said they wanted to correct such misunderstandings.

“There’s a lot of people in this country who care passionately about what’s going on with the current administration and all the corruption and all the lies, taking people’s health care away and giving tax breaks to the rich,” said Greg Fuller of Birmingham. “I think it’s un-American. I think it’s not patriotic. And I think this group is full of people who love America, not hate America, as the speaker said.”

Idania Gonzalez with the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd to look around them because the rally is what community looks like.

“This is what power looks like when people stand together for the same cause, when people stand together for our neighbors who are scared to come out, for our neighbors who are living in the shadows due to political fighting,” she said.

Comedian Rebecca Rothman gave rally goers a primer on how to contact their U.S. representatives and then demonstrated it by calling Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s office and leaving a message. She gave the crowd time to make their own calls and encouraged them to place five calls a day.

Candra Bethune of Birmingham said she’s going to do that. Attending the rally made her feel better, even though things are bad, she said, because before she didn’t know what she could do as one person to make a difference.

“We’ve got to do something to let them know that we don’t want this,” Bethune said.

Montgomery: Warnings about federal policy changes

More than 600 people gathered in downtown Montgomery for the city’s “No Kings” rally.

“The kind of change that we are trying to achieve is not the kind of change that happens fast,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who spoke at the rally. “This is the kind of change that requires we keep showing up. The last time we showed up, we were a good, decent crowd, but this time we are bigger. The next time we show up, we will be even bigger.”

The protest, which began at Riverfront Park, featured people dressed in makeshift costumes displaying dinosaurs and squirrels and others who adorned themselves with colors of the rainbow. Many carried cardboard placards replete with crowns that were crossed out with the words “No Kings” on them.

At 9 a.m. the crowd then marched a quarter mile to the Court Square Fountain, a site where enslaved people were bought and sold prior to the Civil War, to hear from speakers who urged them to continue the public outcry, and who criticized nearly every aspect of Trump’s policies, from mass arrest and deportations of immigrants to tariffs on trade, as well as the budget bill that Congress passed at Trump’s urging that cut funding for social service programs.

“No king, no crowns, no thrones, only love, because violence is not just bullets and bombs,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign, said in a speech. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted.”

Jackson has spoken at numerous gatherings before to raise awareness of the budget bill recently passed by Congress and the potential expiration of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans that could drive up insurance costs around the nation. The loss of those credits has been a major reason for the ongoing federal government shutdown. The budget bill also reduced funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food subsidies to lower-income families and individuals. The bill passes more of the cost of maintaining the programs to the states, and advocates had been warning that the bill could reduce the state’s economy by more than $1 billion and eliminate health insurance coverage for almost 200,000 people.

“Our food pantry participation has gone up 200% since he passed this bill,” said Rev. Manuel Williams in an interview following the event, pastor at Resurrection Catholic Church in Montgomery. “These are people who never had to come and get food assistance, but now they are food insecure.”

Others voiced strong opposition to the administration’s efforts to deport large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S.

“One of my biggest things is the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids, the deportation of people who are just trying to live,” said Haley Morgan, who attended the protest. “They are getting deported for a taillight being out, or for speeding. If that is the case, deport me because I have sped and my taillight has been out.”

Many of those who gathered also expressed reservations about Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government.

“I wanted to help protest against all that Trump is doing,” said Judy May, 87, who attended the rally. “He is destroying the constitution. He is trying to take away our right to vote, our rights of free speech. He is firing so many people, taking so many important departments to pieces. He is destroying the Department of Education, he has destroyed the public health department, I just hate everything he is doing.”

Oxford: ‘We are American people who love our country’

Over 200 people gathered along the roads of the Oxford Exchange to protest the Trump administration Saturday under the “No Kings” name.

Protesters of all ages stood along the highway holding signs condemning President Trump for being what they describe as a dictator, demanding the release of the Epstein files and condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“I’m here today to express my displeasure with the current administration. There are many things being done wrong. I couldn’t even name them, it wouldn’t fit on a sign,” Jim Baker, organizer of the demonstration, said. “I hope somebody hears our cries and our anger and does something about it.”

One protestor said she came to stop the government from continuing the way it is now.

“Things are really scary right now, and if somebody doesn’t say something, and if we don’t keep pushing back, then everything is just going to keep moving in the direction it’s moving. And even if it’s stopping things an inch then it’s worth it,” protestor Cami McKenzie said.

Others just want the government to hear them and their opinions.

“Our government isn’t listening to us. The government is meant to serve us, not control us. So I think it’s important that we stand up before we lose our rights,” protestor Pam Howard said.

Baker said he felt like he was alone when it came to standing up for issues such as healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and ICE raids.

“It makes me extremely happy that there are this many people in the state of Alabama with the same mindset that I have,” Baker said. “I’ve lived here for 21 years, and for 21 years I thought I was on an island.”

And some of these issues are personal to the ones protesting.

“I have four biologically born female daughters, and two are gender non-conforming, so I’m really bothered by a lot of the talk about trans individuals and stuff,” said Glenda Reeseg.

Alanna Gregg, another protestor, said these issues affect everyone.

“You should be ashamed of yourself if you don’t care,” she said “It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”

And Baker made it clear that protestors are just regular people who want better for everyone in the country.

“We are not Antifa, we are not insurrectionists. We are American people who love our country and don’t like the direction that it’s going and that’s why we’re here today.

While the overall response from non-protesters was mostly positive with many honking their horns in support of the cause, there were a few that began to heckle the demonstrators.

Halfway through the protest, a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street to heckle the “No Kings” demonstrators. A heated verbal exchange ensued but was quickly settled.

But protesters didn’t let the rude comments from the group dampen their spirits.

“They have every right to be there and we’re fighting for their rights too,” Howard said.

Howard also commended younger people for being at the protest, and not to let anyone deter them from using their voice.

“One thing I want to say to young people is don’t let anybody tell you that your vote doesn’t count. Voter turnout is one of the biggest issues we have in Alabama,” she said. “If you want to see things change, that’s how we change it.”

Selma: ‘We can see each other’

Laurie Kelly and her husband, who live in Chicago, were traveling to the Gulf of Mexico for a beach vacation. Kelly said she asked her husband to find somewhere to stop to protest.

“If we don’t show up, it’s over. This is very important. It’s small, but it’s still here and that does matter,” Kelly said in an interview. “People need to stand up. That’s what I’m trying to do. It’s all I can do.”

The couple joined about 40 people gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge Saturday afternoon for a local No Kings protest.

The Selma protest was the second for some. Jasie Shepard and Dr. Justin Cavanaugh traveled to Selma after the Tuscaloosa No Kings protest ended Saturday morning, about a 90-minute drive.

Nate Bradley and his friends came to Selma after the Montgomery protest ended this morning. He said he is protesting because of President Donald Trump’s disregard of Congress’ power of the purse.

“Now we have a president who says, ‘I’m not going to fund Democrat programs.’ What does that mean?” Bradley said. “He wouldn’t be able to articulate a thought about that. It’s insulting.”

Bradley said the protests in Montgomery and Selma gave him hope.

“I call my representatives, I go to my townhalls,” Bradley said of what he does outside of the No Kings protests. “I just try to stay sane and find a balance between staying sane and keeping up to date with the nonstop deluge of things that this administration is doing or not doing.”

Annie Pearl Avery, a long-time civil rights activist, urged people to protest every day.

“It’s not going to be a lot of show and a lot of talk. There’s going to have to be some action,” Avery said. “You’ve got a purpose. Everyone has a purpose.”

Rev. Leodis Strong, lead pastor at Brown Chapel in Selma, criticized Republicans who claim to be Christian, but do not show it in policies.

“How can you call yourself pro-life when you did not give access to insurance to soon-to-be mothers and soon-to-be children outside the womb? How can you call yourself pro-life when you take away WIC and SNAP?” Strong asked. “That is a polluted religion.”

Jennifer Wright, who recently moved to Selma from Huntsville, criticized Congress for not releasing investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She urged people to write letters and call their representatives. She also wrote a thank you letter to U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, for his petition to release the files.

“Every member of Congress should have happily signed your petition because child sex trafficking should not be considered a partisan issue and should be considered a crime by everyone,” Massie read.

The petition was one vote short of the 218 it needed to pass in September.

Azali Fortier, 18, said the protest gave her a glimpse of hope.

“I know that they can see us because we can see each other,” Fortier said of the Trump administration and Congress. “We’re about to undergo a big change, either for better or for worse.”

The protest wrapped up with Yomi Goodall leading the group singing “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome,” a Civil Rights Movement anthem.

What you’re looking at is ICE agents in an unmarked vehicle slamming into a U.S. citizens pickup truck. So that’s what you actually watch happening here. So that is an ICE agent in that car. The pickup truck is the American citizen.

Leo Martinez is an immigration rights volunteer in California. He was driving through the neighborhood monitoring ICE activity, which he had been doing for months before that. The agents who have been involved with ICE raids knew who he was.

But in this case, everything was different. Agents rammed his truck and then they took him into custody. The incident ignited outrage and protests. Martinez was hospitalized after that car rammed into him. Later, after that, they booked him into a detention center. Of course, he’s an American citizen.

CNN has reached out to both DHS and ICE repeatedly since yesterday. So far, no response from either agency, but Leo Martinez is OUTFRONT now in his first national interview since the incident.

And, Leo, I really appreciate your taking the time. I’m glad you’re okay.

When we watch that footage and we’ll play it again. But you’re in the pickup truck and then you’re rammed, and I know you have dashcam footage of all of the time leading up to that actual moment as well.

LEO MARTINEZ, U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION RIGHTS VOLUNTEER DETAINED AFTER CRASH: Yeah, this was the first time in all the months that we’ve been doing this that the agents turned on us being legal observers, we keep our distance, we keep our safe distance to keep tabs on where they’re at. But this is the first time that they turn their aggression towards us and really started coming after us. So that’s something new. I was trying to stay away from them is why we

were moving in circles, because they kept following me and moving towards me. And once they hit me, I knew that it was a — it was a new ball game and we were going to have to deal with this a little differently in the future, because now they have no problem with — they’ve already pulled guns on us, they’ve already done a multitude of things, but one thing is coming after us in their vehicles.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a1KvYhB80xALZaszpcCuVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Mjg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mediaite_845/bd46fbe1ce52953098d6ebfb6f4b8ca9,N,,2025-10-18 19:58:25.563497

Thousands of people attended the protests in Cathedral Square Park on Saturday, with many donning costumes and inflatables, inspired by protesters in Portland who sought to emphasize the peaceful nature of the protests. Organizers estimated the turnout at around 16,000 people.

“We came out because it’s our right and it’s our privilege and that’s what Americans should do when you disagree with what’s going on,” said Bryan Lorentzen, a 72-year-old from Franklin. ""You need to make that verbal, just like we did during the Vietnam War.”

Lorentzen and others said they joined the nationwide protests to oppose President Donald Trump, who they say is acting like a monarch rather than the leader of a democracy.

Since his election, Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement, sent National Guard troops into several Democratic-controlled cities, made massive changes to American health care and eroded First Amendment rights, critics say.

In February, the White House shared an image on the social platform X mimicking a ""Time"" magazine cover depicting Trump wearing a crown, with the words ""Long Live The King"" at the bottom.

Lorentzen, who attended the protest dressed as Santa Claus, carried around a sign that said “I know who is naughty.""

His former colleague, Hayley Kleppin, who was dressed as an elf, thought the costumes helped diffuse tensions.

“You can’t detain Santa,” Kleppin, 29, of Greenfield, said.

Oct. 18 marks the second round of No Kings protests across the country. The first was held in June, when millions marched against the Trump administration nationwide. Milwaukee's June event drew an estimated 10,000 protesters.

The No Kings protests are organized by a coalition of progressive groups, including Indivisible, Public Citizen, MoveOn, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and Working Families Power, along with multiple unions and grassroots groups like 50501 that formed in response to Trump's election.

Andy Guss, a co-leader of Grassroots Menomonee Falls, said around 20 groups planned the Milwaukee event.

Around 2,500 rallies were planned across the country as part of the Oct. 18 protests, compared to 1,800 in June.

“People need to see that they’re not alone and that that there’s other people here that think like they do,” said Guss, 42. ""We’re not scared. Everyone here takes courage to be here.”

Demonstrators cite immigration, health care, free speech as key issues

JoAnn Vetter, 75, said she skipped her granddaughter’s soccer game to attend the protest because she wants to ensure her granddaughter has a future. She was wearing the hooded robe and wide-brimmed bonnet from “The Handmaid's Tale.”

Vetter said she wanted to speak out against the repression of women and the erosion of due process, the constitutional right to fair treatment by the government.

She said she fears every day for her son-in-law, who is from Colombia, even though he’s a U.S. citizen.

“That he could be stopped and harassed and injured without any due process,” she said.

Galen DiDomizio, who works in the medical field, brought his 2-year-old daughter to the protest, carrying her on his back. He said he was protesting the administration's attacks on doctors and vaccines.

Trump has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including the discredited theory that they cause autism.

""We all have a responsibility to stand up for what's right and tell the government what they're doing is wrong,"" DiDomizio said. ""That's why I'm here, that's why my whole family is here.""

The event drew criticism from some Republican elected officials in Wisconsin.

U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, described the protest as the ""Hate America Rally"" on his social media pages, while U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden called it a ""Election Denier Fest.""

Clay Norrbom, 50, is a small business owner in Madison. Norrbom, who describes himself as generally moderate, said this was the first time he has been worried about “government truly overreaching and starting to intrude in our day-to-day liberties,” including targeting law firms and news media.

""Now we have to worry about whether the government is going to cancel a contract, or is going to come after a law firm that I’ve worked with — maybe come after me, because I’ve spoken up today,"" Norrbom said.

Protests underway in dozens of cities throughout Wisconsin

More than 60 protests were scheduled throughout the state, including in Madison, Green Bay, Appleton, Shorewood, Greenfield, Brookfield, Waukesha, Cedarburg and Oconomowoc.

In Green Bay, retired teacher Ann Larscheid, 81, said she was supporting her friends marching in the protest from the sidelines.

“Green Bay doesn’t have a reputation for being very liberal, so seeing that a significant part of the population is making a joyful noise about all this stuff, it makes me very proud,"" she said.

In downtown Madison, Doug Green, 75, and Chris Carlsen, 69, both said they attended the protest because they’re worried for their grandchildren’s future.

Green said he protested the Vietnam War when he was a college student, and both participated in the 2011 protests against Gov. Scott Walker’s signature Act 10 legislation, which effectively ended collective bargaining for most public employees.

They each have granddaughters, one a women’s rights attorney and another a college student.

“I’m afraid of losing their health care, the watering down of education and just all civil rights being taken away from them,” Green said.

Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell was among the speakers at the Madison rally. He said his greatest concern is about separation of powers in the federal government.

Mitchell focused his remarks on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous 1963 letter from the Birmingham Jail.

“The time is now to act,"" Mitchell said. ""Not to wait for another election, another season, but to really use all our collective voices to inspire change. If not now, I don’t know when will be the time.”

Around 1,550 people attended the No Kings demonstration in suburban Brookfield, according to 78-year-old Carl Lock, who is a part of Brookfield Resist, the group facilitating the event.

Lock, 78, said the laundry list of issues he is protesting include Trump's “disregard” for the Constitution, his use of the Department of Justice and military to go after political enemies, and his treatment of immigrants.

“We love America,"" Lock said. ""We just hate the administration that has taken over.”

Beto O’Rourke joins protesters in Austin to 'win back people power in America'

and

Reporting from Austin, Texas

Former Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke joined protesters in downtown Austin, Texas, saying he “could not be more proud to stand and march with my fellow Texans today.”

He emphasized that the gathering was “clearly peaceful” and called out Gov. Greg Abbott for mobilizing the National Guard for any potential unrest.

“I don’t think Greg Abbott or Donald Trump are interested in the rule of law or the U.S. Constitution or peaceful protests,” O’Rourke told NBC News. “They would rather intimidate. They seek to control and they’re trying to cement authoritarian power nationally and right here in Texas. But the antidote to all that is the 20- to 30,000 people who have shown up so far at the Capitol.”

He said today’s protest is to stop authoritarianism and “win back people power in America.”

“When the president sends the National Guard into the streets of American cities, when he sweeps our fellow Americans up off the streets by masked plainclothes agents without badges or identification or warrants, when he illegally disbands agencies and departments that were created by Congress or defies federal court orders — I mean that contravenes everything that every American has ever sworn an oath to, the Constitution has ever stood or fought for,” he explained.

He called Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago an example of fascism.

“I was just in Germany last week, and the No. 1 question from members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, and press and civil society is, ‘What the hell is going on in your country? You guys, America, you saved us from fascism at the end of World War II. How in the world can it be rising in your own country today?’” he recalled.

Rally in D.C. mixes celebration and concern over Trump policies

and

Reporting from Washington D.C.

At today’s No Kings Day rally in Washington, D.C., protesters cheered, danced to pop music and wore inflatable Halloween costumes. But that celebratory atmosphere was tempered by fear.

Rallygoers expressed fear that the United States is sliding toward autocracy, as President Donald Trump fires federal workers and masked ICE agents ramp up immigration arrests.

“I’m pro-American. I’m pro-Constitution. I’m pro-law and order. I’m pro-immigration, legal immigration. I’m pro-First Amendment rights. I’m pro-free expression. All of that is under assault,” Robin Brown told NBC News. “I’m 66 years old tomorrow. I never thought in my life that I would be here with a dictator in the Oval Office. So I’m here to say no to that.”

Brown is from the New York City area but lives in Mexico.

Taren Peterson from 1199SEIU, a union that represents hospital workers in Maryland and Washington, D.C., said some members are not showing up for work because they fear ICE arrests.

“That’s more work on one individual, which means that potentially we could have infections go up because you can’t clean properly because you have to rush through it,” she said. “I’m not saying that is what is happening, but that is the potential impact of what not having the appropriate amount of staff inside of the building could look like.”

Protester Tara Reel, a former federal worker who was dressed like a crying Statue of Liberty, said that several of her friends were too scared to attend the rally.

“They’re afraid of persecution. They’re seeing these images on television of what ICE are doing around our country, that there’s this militarization that’s happening in our states, and I think they’re afraid for their safety. They’re afraid for their freedom,” she said.

The rally was overwhelmingly peaceful, with protesters pushing back against Republican claims that they hate America.

“I love America, and I think everybody here loves America, and that’s what we’re here to, you know, really express,” Maci Huber-Hopper said.

“We all love our country so much. That’s why we’re fighting so hard for it, because we know it’s important,” her friend Anna Hall added.

Thousands gather in Austin, focusing on democracy and women’s rights

Reporting from Austin, Texas

On the ground in Austin, Texas, there are no signs of unrest or National Guard presence. Organizers and reporters estimate that more than 10,000 demonstrators are making their way across the lake from the Texas Capitol.

Conversations with the crowd highlight concerns over the rule of law and democracy, as well as women’s rights and abortion access, which remain key issues in Texas.

The atmosphere so far appears peaceful and energetic, with protesters calling for accountability and protections for civil liberties.

NBC News has not independently confirmed crowd size.

Protesters form human banner urging 'Yes' vote for Prop 50

Demonstrators at a No Kings protest in San Francisco formed a human banner urging California residents to vote ""Yes"" for Proposition 50.

The human banner, created on the city's Ocean Beach, reads: ""No Kings. Yes on 50.""

Proposition 50 was proposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to redraw congressional districts in the state. The measure was introduced in response to redistricting happening in other states that favor Republican lawmakers in Congress.

Californians will vote on the measure on Nov. 4 during a special election.

Protester: 'They are taking away our civil rights'

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Laurel Beedon, 79, and Deborah Chollet, 75, attended the rally in Washington, D.C., together, telling NBC News they protested against “a group of people who hold up the Constitution but clearly have not read it.”

“They are taking away our civil rights,” Beedon said.

Beedon pushed back against Republicans who she said were calling today’s rallies “socialism,” telling them to “look in the dictionary and define socialism, please, and communism, please.”

“And then look up fascism,” Chollet chimed in.

“Yeah,” Beedon answered. “Look up who you are.”

Reporting from Chicago, Illinois

Madonna Walsh, from LaGrange, Illinois, joined today’s No Kings protest in downtown Chicago, carrying a poster that compared immigration deportations to concentration camps.

“The rise of authoritarianism today is a repeat of what happened in the 1930s in Nazi Germany, and I don’t want it to happen here,” she said. “I did some research on what Hitler was doing in the 1930s and compared it to what Trump has been doing in office in January and the similarities are mind-blowing.”

Andy Thayer, an activist handing out signs that said “ICE OUT!” told NBC News, “Most Chicagoans don’t want ICE here.”

“I’m angry — what’s happening to my neighbors, my husband is second-generation Latinx. I fear for my neighbors. If you don’t think it’ll affect you, but at some point or another, they will get around you. They are arresting citizens,” Thayer sid.

Rachel Mason and Anton Ford came out to protest with their daughter. They said they were motivated to join because “ICE is in our neighborhood.”

“Children are afraid to go outside because ICE is around. It’s crazy — SUVs no license plates outside of schools,” they said.

A teacher named Yabira, who declined to share her last name, joined the protest to let her students know she supports them. She became teary-eyed as she said she prays for her father, a construction worker, to come home every night.

Trump administration mocks congressional Democrats on social media amid No Kings protests

Some parts of the Trump administration have taken to social media to make digs at congressional Democrats during the No Kings protests.

The White House posted on its official X account a photo appearing to spoof a cover of The New Yorker magazine, titling it “NY king of sombreros,” superimposing a photo of Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wearing a sombrero.

Separately, a social media page associated with the Department of Transportation posted what appeared to be an AI-generated cartoon of Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., dressed as Disney princesses, captioning it “No Kings!!”

Spokespeople for Jeffries and Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, or questions regarding whether they have any concerns that such posts could violate the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by federal employees.

Similar posts by the White House broke down negotiations between Republicans and Democrats early on in the government shutdown, after Trump posted an altered video of Schumer and Jeffries with fake audio and portrayed Jeffries in a cartoon sombrero.

Bernie Sanders slams billionaire class at D.C. rally

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called out the tech billionaires who saw “huge increases in their wealth and power” since Trump became president.

“Yes, I am talking about Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated,” Sanders added. “The very same billionaires who funded his campaign, who have bestowed gifts upon him, and who have seen huge increases in their wealth and power since Trump took office.”

Sanders went on to criticize the administration for the recent indictments of those he declared his political enemies.

“Our country is in danger when we have a president who threatens to arrest or imprison political opponents who stand against him, including the attorney general of New York state, a sitting U.S. senator and the governor of California,” Sanders said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren says protests are patriotism and slams Trump as a bully

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren addressed thousands of protesters gathered on the Boston Common for the No Kings rally.

Pushing back on some congressional Republicans who labeled the demonstrations ""Hate America"" protests, Warren said the gatherings reflect core American values.

""Hundreds of thousands of people protesting peacefully for what they believe in? That is deeply American. That is patriotism,"" she said. ""Standing up to a wannabe dictator? That is patriotism. Peacefully protesting to protect our democracy? That is patriotism!""

Warren called the president ""weak"" and ""a bully,"" and accused congressional Republicans of lacking courage. ""Not a single one of them has a spine,"" she said.

""When we don’t bow down to kings or bullies, they start to lose their power,"" she said. ""So now is the time for us to say it clearly: Do we bow down to kings? Do we bow down to bullies? Do we bow down to Donald Trump? No, the American people do not bow down.""

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a brief interview with NBC Boston that it was ""amazing to see so many people"" protesting.

""This is a community and a city where for 400 years we have done everything we can for freedom in this country and to set the course for generations to come, to have every opportunity,"" she said. ""And this is a moment where a lot of people feel that the administration in the White House is doing everything they can to undermine that sense of safety and belonging, and the progress that we’ve made, so we’re going to keep going in Boston.""

Sen. Chuck Schumer joins No Kings protest in New York

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X that he marched with labor unions and others at a No Kings protest in New York City.

In earlier posts, Schumer encouraged Americans to exercise their right to free speech and to “not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence. That’s what they want you to do. They’re afraid of the truth.”

Protester says 'I don't even recognize' country anymore

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Clark Furey, 40, attended the protest in Washington, D.C., accompanied by his dog, Scooby, saying he joined because ""I don’t even recognize what’s happening in this country.""

Furey told NBC News that he grew up in New York in a Republican family. “I actually came down to D.C., worked for College Republicans, always considered myself, sort of, center-right,” Furey said. “And then no longer. Just a slow degradation and then it just fell off a cliff.”

He said he is concerned about the Pentagon's recent decision to refuse credentials to reporters who didn’t sign a pledge to abide by new rules for members of the press.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker addresses protesters in Chicago

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker struck a defiant tone as he addressed protesters in Chicago, where high-profile clashes between residents and federal immigration authorities have taken place in recent weeks.

""History will judge us by where we choose to stand right now, today. Future generations will ask: 'What did we do when fellow human beings face persecution? When our rights were being abridged? When our Constitution was under attack?'"" he asked. ""They'll want to know whether we stood up or we stayed silent.""

Pritzker added that ""resistance starts with refusing to normalize cruelty.""

""Resistance means choosing solidarity over fear and means recognizing that an attack on free speech, on immigrants' rights, on due process is an attack on everyone’s rights,"" he said. ""It means understanding that we’re either building a society based on human dignity or one based on domination.""

Pritzker noted that the ""vast majority of Chicagoans are here because our ancestors fought to escape from tyranny, and another great portion of Chicagoans were brought to this country in shackles and had to fight for their literal freedom.""

""Resistance and survival are in our American blood,"" he said.

Mother from Maryland attends D.C. protest to fight vaccine misinformation

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Jennifer Engle, 49, of Bethesda, Maryland, said she attended today’s protest on her younger son’s birthday to raise awareness about vaccine disinformation and autism.

“My oldest son has autism, and the misinformation around vaccines and the fear that it’s causing around autism is not doing anything to actually help autistic children and adults,” Engle told NBC News.

She added, “Unfortunately, the conspiracy theories around autism are catching on among people with low access to information, and I think that is really dangerous.”

Where's Trump today?

Trump is in Palm Beach, Florida, this weekend and has no public events on his schedule today, meaning we won't see him on camera as thousands of protesters gather for No Kings protests across the country.

Mikie Sherrill and Andy Kim rally voters in New Jersey at No Kings event ahead of governor's race

Reporting from Montclair, NJ

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, her party’s nominee for governor, called on attendees to vote in just over two weeks.

“New Jersey is not a red state. New Jersey is not a purple state. New Jersey is a blue state,” Sherrill said, leading the crowd to chant, “When we vote, we win.”

“We’re gonna fight it tooth and nail,” Sherrill said of Trump’s agenda.

“We know at every level this president is raising costs on people,” Sherrill said, highlighting her proposals to address the state’s high cost of living.

Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., also spoke at the rally, sharply criticizing congressional Republicans. “We do not have right now three functioning branches of government,” he said, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson is acting more like a Trump Cabinet official than a separate branch leader.

“It’s a historic moment in this country,” Kim said, referencing the late Rep. John Lewis, who often said history is “shaped by those who are up.” He called on attendees to support Sherrill as New Jersey’s next governor in November.

Fired USAID worker protests in Washington, D.C.

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Jessica, 44, and Andrew, 56, of Washington said they joined the protest today because they’re “really upset” and “really scared” about the state of the U.S. today.

Andrew, who declined to share his last name, said that he was fired from the federal government earlier this year when the Trump administration cut funding for his former employer — USAID.

He said that in Washington, there are thousands of people “who are extremely patriotic, extremely dedicated to representing the United States here and abroad in really positive ways, in Christian ways, who are, you know, gone, out of jobs.”

“It’s a tragedy,” he added.

Fired USAID worker says D.C. protest is a 'double duty'

Reporting from Washington, D.C.

Amanda Nataro, 41, of Washington, D.C., told NBC News that for protesters, attending the rally is ""double duty"" — standing up against the Trump administration while also working to ""protect our home rule.""

""The common adage,"" Nataro said, ""is that 50% of the country voted for this. But 50% of the country didn’t vote for a government shutdown and the dismantlement of the government and services that people rely on.""

Nataro added that she was let go from USAID in July, joining thousands of federal workers who have been let go since the start of the Trump administration.

""It’s really devastating on all fronts,"" she said. “And it’s really important to not sit back and let this happen.""

The beloved children's show host also slammed Trump and the members of his cabinet for failing to accept ""basic scientific facts."" This presumably refers to a myriad of changes within the Department of Health and Human Services.

""They do not promote the progress of science. They suppress it, to the detriment of our health, well being, and international competitiveness,"" he said. ""It is a formula for failure.""

""No thrones! No crowns! No kings!"" Nye added.

First-time protester fueled by 'extreme frustration' attends D.C. demonstration

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Robin, 62, from Centreville, Va., traveled with some of her neighbors to Washington for the No Kings protest today. She decided to come out “to come to a community of people that have the same feelings about what’s going on with our government right now.”

Robin, who declined to share her last name, told NBC News that this is the first protest she’s attended and she was driven to attend by “extreme frustration.”

Her neighbor, Suzanne, who also declined to provide her last name, said she is “angry” at Trump and at Congress for not holding “Trump and his cronies” accountable.

“I’m just really feeling like, it’s at least something I can do to really utilize my First Amendment right,” Suzanne said. She also expressed frustration with Republicans on Capitol Hill this week who called No Kings protesters as “anti-patriotic.”

Murphy addressed the crowd, calling Donald Trump ""the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America.""

""The truth is that he is enacting a detailed, step-by-step plan to try to destroy all of the things that protect our democracy: free speech, fair elections and independent press, the right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said. ""But the truth is he has not won yet. The people still rule in this country.”

The D.C. event began at 12 p.m. and is scheduled to run until 2 p.m.

White House economist Kevin Hassett dismisses No Kings protests: They 'make no sense'

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett weighed in on the No Kings protests, calling the demonstrations misguided and arguing that they prove the very freedoms protesters claim to defend.

""President Trump has said himself that he’s not a king,"" Hassett told Fox News in a wide-ranging interview today. ""Obviously everyone’s letting them protest, that’s what America is all about, is proving that there isn’t a king, right? And so what they’re doing makes no sense.""

Other Republicans have similarly denounced the rallies as unpatriotic.

Chicago No Kings rally organizers denounce ICE actions

and

Reporting from Chicago, Illinois

Organizers of Chicago's No Kings rally say today's demonstration carries special meaning in the city, driven by frustrations over the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents involved in the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing immigration enforcement campaign, dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

“ICE is occupying our city. They are attacking our neighbors with tear gas. They are indiscriminately snatching people from streets and businesses and homes,” said Kathy Tholin, a board member of Indivisible Chicago, which is organizing a rally expected to draw thousands in downtown Chicago, and more than 30 others in surrounding suburbs.

President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to immediately allow the deployment of National Guard troops here in Illinois, saying they are needed to protect federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement.

“We are coming together on No Kings Day to say, ‘No, this is not the city we want to live in.’ I’m looking at the cruelty and the violence against Chicagoans, and I’m just completely outraged,” Tholin said. She added that she is not aware of any protesters who are being paid to attend, as some Republicans have claimed.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., referred to the protests as “the hate America rally.”

Tholin responded directly: “What is more American than standing up to protest against policies and programs that you don’t agree with?”

What happened on the last No Kings day of nationwide protests

Today's No Kings protests come after the movement's lastnationwide demonstrations in June — the same day that Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota and their spouses were shot, killing two of them.

Those protests coincided with Trump's military parade marking the Army's 250th anniversary. As rallies unfolded across the country that day, Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot in their home, and Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded, also in their home. A 57-year-old Minnesota man was charged in what authorities described as acts of targeted political violence.

Officials tighten security

Officials in several states are boosting security ahead of today’s nationwide No Kings protests, warning that violence or property damage won’t be tolerated.

In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said he’s activated the National Guard to support police “to help keep Virginians safe.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also ordered state troopers and Guard members to Austin, calling the demonstration there “antifa-linked” and pledging to “deter criminal mischief.”

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said officers will safeguard protesters’ right to assemble and that the department’s “Dialogue Police Team” will be on site to assist demonstrators.

In Philadelphia, officials announced road closures and parking restrictions for a large march from City Hall to Independence Mall and urged attendees to expect delays and sign up for safety alerts.

Authorities in all three states said they are coordinating with federal partners to monitor potential disruptions.

No Kings organizers say millions will join protests against Trump's 'authoritarian power grab'

A coalition of leaders for the No Kings protests said in a press conference this week that millions of Americans are expected to join more than 2,600 demonstrations nationwide to protest what organizers called ""authoritarian power grabs"" by the Trump administration.

The leaders insisted the events will be peaceful and lawful, contrasting them with what they described as ""lawless actions"" by the federal government. They urged participants to exercise their First Amendment rights despite what they view as intimidation tactics, including threats of National Guard deployments.

Organizers called the protests a show of unity in defense of democracy. Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said protesting is the ""most patriotic and American thing you can do.""

‘The cavalry is coming’: Indivisible predicts massive ‘No Kings’ turnout

Today's demonstrations are happening against the backdrop of a nation in conflict. Congress is at a standstill amid a government shutdown. Trump ordered National Guard deployments to California, Illinois, Oregon and Washington, D.C., against the wishes of local elected officials. Immigration agents are aggressively carrying out arrests in cities across the country, and videos showing clashes, sometimes violent, with residents and protesters have followed.

In the run-up to the upcoming marches, Republicans have pressed forward with messaging that attempts to cast the marches as made up of dangerous hate groups on the left. At the same time, the Democratic base has expressed its dissatisfaction with its party leadership.

The event on Oct. 18 drew 5,000 people or more according to early estimates from state police. Attendees voiced opposition to Trump's immigration detentions, his effort to redraw Indiana's congressional boundaries to favor Republicans and what protesters view as attacks on free speech.

Immigration took center stage during the first half of the roughly two hour rally, with speakers criticizing the Trump administration's immigration raids, which have led to the detention of more than 170 U.S. citizens, according to ProPublica.

Karla López Owens of the Indiana Democratic Latino Caucus, who is also a deputy Marion County prosecutor, said her family immigrated from Mexico with nothing.

“I have always felt welcome here,"" she said, ""but things are different now.""

Danielle Cooney of Live Free Indiana railed against Marion County Sheriff Kerry Forestal for housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detainees at the county jail. Earlier this year multiple Indianapolis City-County Council members criticized Forestal, a Democrat, for, in their view, actively supporting Trump's mass deportation.

Protesters also expressed anger at what they see as erosions of free speech. Suzanne Swierc, a former Ball State University employee who was fired for a critical social media post she made about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, said she is tired of hearing people say that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.

“Consequences should not be so detrimental that we are afraid to exercise those rights,"" she said.

Protesters slam Indiana redistricting push

Others took aim at the White House's pressure campaign to redraw congressional boundaries in Indiana, where Republicans control seven of nine U.S. House seats. The rally came just one day after Trump called Indiana Republican senators about mid-decade redistricting.

So far, Gov. Mike Braun has not called a special legislative session, but has said, ""It probably will happen."" Multiple polls have been released in recent weeks showing the move would be unpopular.

""Mid-decade redistricting is what you do when you can’t win,"" said state Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.

State Sen. Andrea Hunley said Trump is trying to make Indiana an “unwilling accomplice” in his effort to “rig"" congressional maps.

“Dictators do not act alone,” she said, later adding: “We do not negotiate with terrorists.""

The protest drew criticism from some Republicans. ""Terrorists? Seriously?"" state Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, responded on social media.

Attendance eclipses previous 'No Kings' rally

Indiana State Police Sgt. Robert Johnson said no arrests had been made as of about 3 p.m. “It’s been a peaceful rally,” he said.

He estimated somewhere around 5,000 or more people attended the rally, more than a previous ""No Kings"" rally in June.

There was one tense moment near the beginning of the rally when volunteer event security officials confronted a Trump supporter with a Make America Great Again hat who they said was disrupting the rally.

Amy Kleyla, a volunteer security director with We the People United, said the man had a holstered firearm and was asked to exit because firearms are not allowed on Statehouse property, in most cases. The man left and stowed his gun in his car and then came back, she said.

""I have the right to be here, just like everybody else,"" the man said during a confrontation with Kleyla. It's unclear if he had the firearm during that particular interaction. ""I know how to conduct myself,"" the man said.

The event was one of more than 2,500 demonstrations planned across the country, including in dozens of other Indiana cities such as Bloomington, Evansville, Fort Wayne, Muncie and South Bend.

At the march in Los Angeles, Pam Hope, 62, wore a shirt emblazoned with the Statue of Liberty and the words: “I am Aunt Tifa”.

Hope said she came because she is deeply worried about the direction of the country under Donald Trump, but also to push back on Republican claims that the protests are unAmerican and that anti-Trump activists are part of “Antifa”.

“I love America,” she said. “I just believe America should be against fascism and bigotry.”

It was a dance party in Los Angeles down First Street as protesters moved and grooved around the caravan-like truck pulling a live band.

Parents toted kids in strollers, pet owners walked their pups on leashes and a group of seniors pushed uphill with their walkers – part of a march that stretched several blocks.

The Dark Knight made an appearance in the Batmobile. One protester wore a brown grizzly costume, which he said was a symbol of California’s resistance.

Another protester, Kimberly M, who was only comfortable sharing the first letter of her last name, carried a sign that said “ICE in my horchata not in my streets.”

From Siri Chilukuri in Chicago:

Saturday’s No Kings Protest in Chicago ended without incident with the last protestors filing into Grant Park around 3:45pm.

Along the route drivers and Metra trains, the local commuter trains, honked in solidarity with protestors. One bus driver even put a Hands Off Chicago flyer on the dashboard.

People all over the Chicagoland area showed up for the rally and march which Block Club Chicago reported was two miles long.

When protestors passed in front of Trump tower, they flipped it off, as has become tradition and shouted “Shame! Shame! Shame!”

Deanthoni Wilkins, a 27-year-old Medical Student was inspired by the magnitude of the protest.

“This is my second protest I’ve been to, and the largest I’ve been to and it’s really inspiring to know I live in a place where people share [my] values,” said Wilkins.

The day so far

More than 2,600 demonstrations are taking place throughout the US in protest of the Trump administration, dubbed the “No Kings” protest. The previous iteration of the “No Kings” day that marched in June was one of the largest single days of protest in US history, and today looks to closely match that record.

Republican governors in several US states placed National Guard troops on standby in preparation for the nationwide protests. Governors in Texas and Virginia have activated their state’s National Guard troops.

Ahead of the huge No Kings protests expected across all 50 states of the US on Saturday, several protests in solidarity popped up across Europe.

Donald Trump told Fox News, “I’m not a king,” as millions across the US were about to march against his second presidency, uniting behind a message that the nation should halt its slide toward authoritarianism.

Connecticut senator Chris Murphy called Donald Trump the “most corrupt president in the history of America” at a No Kings rally in Washington DC.

In DC, Bernie Sanders headlined the event and gave various examples of Trump administration moves that he said put democracy at risk. He went on to denounce the billionaires who helped fund Trump’s campaign.

In Chicago, mayor Brandon Johnson spoke at a rally, saying: “We will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit.”

The New York police department posted on social media that most rallies across the city had ended and that there had been no arrests, adding that more than 100,000 people showed up to peacefully protest.

Screenwriter and director Tony Gilroy, who created the Star Wars series Andor, was among the thousands of people who gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon for the No Kings protest.

Andor, starring Diego Luna as the protagonist, follows Cassian Andor’s journey as a thief-turned-spy for the Rebel Alliance – the good guys whose ranks eventually go on to include characters such as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo – in a crusade to take down the Galactic Empire.

“We spent six years making a show about the fascist takeover of a galaxy, far, far away,” he said. “We didn’t think we were making a documentary.”

Gilroy said the show offered a clear model for what authoritarian rule looks like – and how to resist it.

“We spent a lot of time thinking about sacrifice and courage, and the incremental encroachment of authoritarianism and how it works,” he said. “I think I would have been. I think I would have been here anyway, but the show is only amplified my understanding of it – my understanding of the sort of karaoke fascist playbook, but also my appreciation for the varieties of courage it takes for people to resist.”

Gilroy was dismayed by the “vacuum” of leadership among the anti-Trump resistance but saw reason to be hopeful as he looked out at the gathering crowd of Angelenos waving American flags and No Kings posters.

Rally in Portland turns into a massive march

Robert Mackey

The rally in Portland has turned into a massive march, now filling the city’s Hawthorne Bridge with thousands filling the streets leading to the bridge.

I just witnessed a remarkable scene further back in the crowd, as protesters carrying handmade signs passed a trio of street performers, dressed as Donald Trump, whose head was entirely constructed of Cheetos, JD Vance and Kristi Noem.

Just behind the performers, a group of nine people in black bloc clothing held a banner with the slogan “Organize to Attack the State” and chanted for insurrection and revolution.

At least one Portlander passing the group suggested that they looked like entirely “fake antifa”.

Fake or not, they were massively outnumbered by a crowd that included hundreds of people in animal costumes, making the protest feel more like a carnival than anything at all threatening.

Crowds are amassing outside city hall in Los Angeles, where many protesters are carrying American flags and organizers are handing out sunscreen and water.

A group is dancing to a live band as street vendors sell hot dogs and elote. There is a large contingent of inflatable costumes – I’ve spotted a frog, a shark and a duck.

Many people are waving Mexican flags, which have become a sign of resistance and protest amid the Trump administration’s violent immigration crackdown in the city.

There are plenty of signs denouncing Ice and Trump’s deportation campaign. “If you don’t care that he’s a felon, you shouldn’t care if someone is undocumented,” said one, referencing Trump’s 34 felony convictions by a New York jury.

Before the march is to begin, a speaker just led the crowd in a chant: “Fuck Trump. Fuck Ice.”

A panoply of speakers in Atlanta addressed both national problems like draconian immigration enforcement and the erosion of civil liberties, as well as issues of sharp local concern, as when a representative of Play Fair ATL, a coalition of anti-homelessness advocates and rights groups, took the stage.

Play Fair intends to hold Atlanta to commitments to refrain from sweeping unhoused people from the city’s streets before the World Cup next year, skeptical of mayor Andre Dickens’s resolve to resist demands by Fifa and Trump.

The suggestion that support for antifa – that is, antifascism – is tantamount to support for terrorism drew particular scorn from protesters.

“I think that’s absurd,” said Nicky Cooper, a software developer in Atlanta. She wore a shirt with an antifascist symbol on it. The labelling of people as somehow sympathetic to terrorism is chilling, she said: “I mean, we’re leaving a digital trail of this. You know? I have antifascism mentioned on my social media stuff. I mean, I’m not a ‘member’ of antifa, because how do you join antifa? So it’s like, who the hell are we looking for here?”

Comments by defense secretary Pete Hegseth to an assembly of high-ranking military leaders last month featured prominently in the words of speakers and the reaction of protesters.

Brian Woods, 65, from Lawrenceville and a former army communications staff sergeant, said: “I thought it was unnecessary. It goes against what we know as military people.” He marveled at the decision to put that many leaders in the same room at the same time, potentially providing an immense military target to the US’s enemies. “He could have said that over one of their so-called secured lines,” Woods said. “They have a bulletproof mentality, so they just do things recklessly, without real thoughts that go into those types of conversations and communications.”

Atlanta’s protest march concluded at 2pm without incident, traveling down streets hallowed in civil rights history from the Atlanta Civic Center to the state capitol building about 1.2 miles away. At least 35 other affiliated No Kings protests progressed across the state, from Brunswick, near the Ice detention center in Folkston on Georgia’s southern border, to Dalton in the heart of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s north-west Georgia district.

Initial crowds of about 10,000 in Atlanta contracted a bit as the day progressed, but turnout was roughly equivalent to those events in June in Atlanta, and more widely dispersed across the state.

Erik Malewaski, a college professor who lives in Marietta, where protests also had been planned, attended the Atlanta event anyway.

“I did the Marietta protest last time, and I wanted to see exactly what would go down here. Particularly, I thought we may get speakers like Warnock and Stacey Abrams,” she said.

As well he did. Both senator Rev Raphael Warnock and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Abrams described the actions of the federal government under Donald Trump as fascist in plain terms.

“They want us to believe that we’re in danger if we speak up ... that if we assemble like the first amendment tells us we can, that there’s a problem,” Abrams said, arguing that the attacks on press freedoms and the firing of outspoken Trump critics like Karen Attiah and Jimmy Kimmel are discrete steps on a path to autocracy. “They want to break democracy forever,” said Abrams. “Their destination is to take our country from us.”

I am in downtown Portland, where many thousands of No Kings protesters, many in inflatable animal costumes, are rallying in a riverfront park.

A small group of eight counter-protesters in Maga hats and Charlie Kirk shirts have been making their way through the crowd, trying to antagonize demonstrators by blaring air horns and shouting praise for Trump and transphobic slurs through megaphones.

The group is led by Tommy Allen, a pro-Trump streamer who was recently charged with assault by Portland prosecutors for punching a protester outside the Ice facility in south Portland during a skirmish instigated by Nick Sortor, a conservative influencer.

Their IRL trolling has led to jeers from some members of the crowd, but they have largely been ignored so far. One man, holding a sign in favor of trans rights, repeatedly screamed at the Trump supporters that they were “bootlickers”.

Other protesters alerted Portland police officers to the fact that Allen seemed to be trying to provoke conflict, while recording video, and that he was recently arrested. Officers on bicycles seemed to be tracking the movements of Allen and his group from a distance.

In California, San Diego and San Francisco have been identified as the “anchor” cities for the No Kings protests, but a major demonstration is expected to kick off in downtown Los Angeles, at Gloria Molina Grand Park.

Here activists are encouraging voters to pass “Prop 50” – a ballot initiative to redraw California’s congressional boundaries to give Democrats an additional five seats to offset the Republican-drawn and Trump-sought gerrymander in Texas.

Earlier this morning, a group of protesters formed a human banner on Ocean Beach in San Francisco that read, according to the local ABC affiliate, “No Kings Yes on 50”.

Reports are coming in that more than 200,000 people in the Washington DC area rallied near the US Capitol during the No Kings protest today. The event is of the largest nationwide mobilization since president Trump returned to office.

Millions took to the streets today across more than 2,700 cities and towns, marking a day of defiance against Trump’s authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of American cities.

Many people at protests across the nation appear inspired by “Operation Inflation”, an initiative where demonstrators wear colorful and inflatable costumes to protests, usually resembling an animal or Pokémon-type character.

The trend started with a protester dubbed the Portland Frog, who began dressing in an inflatable frog costume to attend Ice protests.

In New York, Chuck Schumer joins No Kings protesters

The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has joined the No Kings protesters in New York.

“I proudly marched side-by-side with labor unions and so many more of our fellow citizens in NYC,” he wrote on social media. “We have no dictators in America. And we won’t allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy.”

In Chicago, mayor Brandon Johnson says: 'We will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit'

From my colleague Siri Chilukuri in Chicago:

The No Kings protest kicked off in Chicago, Illinois, at Grant Park’s Butler Field at noon. There are at least 10,000 people as the speeches begin. An intergenerational group of protesters has gathered, most with signs opposing Ice’s presence in Chicago or mocking Donald Trump.

Many flags, signs and T-shirts read, “Fuck Ice”, and others read “Hands Off Chicago”, a rallying cry that began when Trump first announced his intent to send the national guard into the city. Other signs read “Resist Fascism” and “Hands off our Constitution”.

Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke to the crowd, which erupted in cheers when he took to the stage.

“They have decided that they want a rematch of the civil war,” he said.

“We are here to stand firm and stand committed that we will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit. We do not want troops in our city.”

The crowd erupted in chants of “Fuck Donald Trump” while the Illinois representative Jonathan Jackson spoke to the crowd. Later, as ACLU Illinois’s communications director Ed Yohnka spoke, the crowd chanted: “USA! USA! USA!”

Illinois governor JB Pritzker, Senator Dick Durbin, Lt Gov Juliana Stratton, Representative Chuy García, President of the Cook County board of commissioners Toni Preckwinkle, as well as local aldermen and state representatives were in attendance.

The No Kings protests, which took place in hundreds of cities across all 50 states and in the nation’s capital, are intended to denounce the Trump administration and rally against “chaos, corruption, and cruelty.”

Many protest signs and speakers focused on anger with Trump’s deportation campaign using Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Congress’ failure to release the Epstein files and the conflict in Gaza.

Rosa Valdez said she’s never been involved in politics, but that seeing immigrants removed from their homes without due process brought her to the protest.

“There’s a lot of people that have been around me in my lifetime that have fallen victim to what is going on right now and have, unfortunately, been deported,” she said. “And just the way that everything has gone down, I know that they didn’t get any court (date) or anything like that.”

Duwayne Mills, an Oklahoma native, attended Saturday’s protests wearing a Ghostbusters outfit he altered to instead be a “Trump-busters” jumpsuit.

He said the outfit was meant to be silly because “tyrants hate to be laughed at.”

“I’ve got two kids at home, and I will not have them brought up in this B.S.,” he said. “Because somebody … has some kind of ego trip going on and no one in that party will stop him because they’re just as corrupt as he is.”

Georgia Williams and Kim Reed said they joined the protest because of the actions of GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and a dislike of the administration limiting press access at the White House.

Organizers of the protests held a mock trial for Trump, alleging crimes such as using the military against civilians, obstructing justice, corruption and bribery. Speakers acted as prosecutors and witnesses in the trial, with the crowd of protestors acting as the jury and found Trump “guilty.”

The protests were peaceful and there was no prominent counter protest or local police presence, but organizers hired security to ensure safety.

Across the Triangle, North Carolinians joined millions of protesters across the world opposing the Trump administration’s “authoritarian policies.”

“Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” was a chant used by protesters in Raleigh and Cary.

Demonstrators dressed in colorful costumes and held creative signs expressing their views about the direction the government is being led.

Saturday’s “No Kings” rallies spread into Washington, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles and into hundreds of cities across the U.S. They also took place in France, Switzerland and England.

Nine rallies were held in the Triangle, drawing thousands of people. No incidents or arrests were reported at any of the North Carolina protests. There were no noticeable counterprotests on the streets around the Triangle.

Trump supporters did comment on social media, including North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Southern Pines, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee.

“Imagine hating America so much you skip College Football on a fall Saturday,” Hudson wrote, taking a cue from Republican talking points over the last several days that labeled the protests the “Hate America Rally.”

Protesters offered various reasons for coming out Saturday including policies on immigration, environmental protections, health care and not giving enough attention to mass shootings.

“I’m out here because I want to reclaim patriotism for what’s right in this country,” said Liz Skube, who joined the protest in Raleigh. “I’m also out here for all of the people who are lost and think Trump represents Christ.”

Here are scenes from around the area:

Raleigh

Thousands of protesters gathered along Capitol Boulevard near Triangle Town Center.

People dressed in inflatable costumes that included pufferfish, unicorns, hippos and dinosaurs.

Phoenix Rector, the director of operations for a real estate group, wore an inflatable frog suit with a blue scarf.

She said the costume was to show solidarity with protesters who dressed similarly in Portland while demonstrating outside an ICE facility.

“This is not a war zone,” Rector said. “Portland is not a war zone. Chicago is not a war zone. And so this helps put it in the face of those who want to claim [they are] as nonsense.”

Woody Setzer, a retired employee of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, with 30 years experience, was among the crowd.

The division’s work was used as the basis for agency regulatory rules. But it was shuttered by the Trump administration which claimed that it was wasting government money.

“Well, yeah, it’s wasteful if you think that people should just be able to dump crap in the water or the air all they want,” Setzer told The N&O during Saturday’s protest in Raleigh.

Setzer became active in politics when the science behind climate change became under scrutiny.

Beyond the current administration’s rollbacks on federal workers — like the EPA’s research department — Setzer said the system is skewed.

“This government is very much opposed to setting things up to support ordinary people or poor people,” he said. “This government is set up with a belief that only rich people matter.”

Michael Williams, a Raleigh-based Realtor and Army veteran who served from 1995 to 1999, held an “LGBTQ+ Veterans against Trump” sign.

Williams said he “made the mistake” of turning on the TV at 3 a.m. on election night and saw Trump had won. From there, Williams said he shut down and didn’t tap back into the news until the first No Kings protests in June.

He was encouraged by Saturday’s turnout, thinking it shows the current administration the support the other side has.

“We all need to know that we are not alone in these struggles,” Williams said. “We are not alone in the world dealing with whatever the repercussions are coming from this administration.”

Williams said his biggest issue with the Trump administration is how masked ICE agents detain suspected undocumented immigrants. Williams compared it to the Gestapo, Nazi Germany’s secret police.

“That’s not America,” Williams said. “That’s not what I’ve served in the military to protect.”

Durham

Durham’s protesters shut down streets as they marched into downtown from Central Park, where the rally began with a protest version of Chappelle Roan’s “Hot To Go.”

Speakers at the Durham rally included Rev. William Barber, a civil rights activist and co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign; and Braxton Winston, a former member of the Charlotte City Council and a 2024 Labor Commissioner candidate.

“This is a class solidarity struggle,” said Winston, now president of the NC AFL-CIO.

Cassie Little, a Navy veteran, drove from Creedmoor to Durham to stand up for her freedom of speech.

“I gotta fight this fascism,” she said. “I’m a Navy veteran. I didn’t take an oath to a king. I took an oath to the Constitution.”

Among her chief concerns are attacks on the LGBTQ community.

“I’m a gay veteran,” Little said, “and I have transgender in my family, and they are afraid.”

Erin Wallace, of Durham, was in the crowd with her brother, Andrew.

“I have a child, and I want this country to be better for her, and I know people who are actually in the process of leaving the country, and it’s scary, and I’m trying to make this place better, so that there’s something for people to actually live for,” Wallace said.

Cary

Protesters in Cary didn’t wait for their designated start time to start lining both sides of Kildaire Farm Road between Kilmayne Drive and Maynard Road. Event organizers estimated around 4,000 people showed up, overflowing down sidestreets and standing several rows deep.

“So many people are interested in saving our democracy,” said Martha Glass, of Cary Indivisible.

Other members of Cary Indivisible, which helped organize the protest, passed out yellow shirts, which they said is the color used for generations to symbolize peaceful resistance against oppression.

“No hate, no fear,” protesters chanted. “Immigrants are welcome here.”

Rev. Candy Snively, of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cary, noted that the United States is built on diversity and said she was concerned about Trump’s efforts “to purify our nation.”

It was concerns about changes Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is making at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that brought out Laurie Sorge, a retired biochemist, and her husband, John Sorge, a retired physician.

“We feel like our democracy is greatly at threat, that Congress has relinquished control of tariffs and financial decisions to the executive branch,” Laurie Sorge said.

Pat Reese, a retired researcher who collected data for clinical trials, was also in the crowd.

She said she was protesting for several reasons including the decimation of scientists, the failing justice department and her opposition to the actions of ICE.

“I think our country is in jeopardy, and it’s important for us to speak out,” Reese said. “Democracy is fragile if you don’t protect it,” she said.

Clayton

Hundreds of people in Clayton marched from the town square down Main Street.

Tammy Powell, a Garner resident, held a sign reading: “Ugh, where do I start,” surrounded by a list of her complaints about Trump and his administration. Among them were immigration policies, weaponizing the Department of Justice, renaming the Gulf of Mexico and withholding the Epstein files.

Republicans call protests a ‘hate America rally’

Congressional Republicans and members of the Trump administration have been dismissive of the No Kings protests. Several, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, called it a “hate America rally.”

“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said on Fox News. “I’ll bet you see pro-Hamas supporters, I’ll bet you see the antifa types, I’ll bet you see the Marxists in full display — the people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic.”

A statement by government accompanying the announcement of the public release of the proposed amendments, said this as a “decisive crucial point in national policy with the launch of sweeping immigration reforms designed to realign the system with the priorities of Caymanians, while preserving our competitiveness and social cohesion.”

Among the amendments is the extension to 15 years for the timeframe during which a person married to or in a civil partnership with a Caymanian or a permanent resident has to hold their Residency and Employment Rights Certificate (RERC) before they can apply for naturalisation or permanent residency.

The proposed amendments include extending the length of time a person has lived in Cayman from 15 years to 20 years, and from five years to 10 years after being naturalised, before they can apply for the right to be Caymanian.

The amendments also include the introduction of term limits for civil servants, details of which the government announced in May.

The proposed reforms also state that work-permit holders would not be permitted to change employers within the first two years of their permit being granted, “in an effort to curb job-hopping and encourage stability within the labour market”, the government statement noted. A permit holder would be required to leave Cayman for at least a year before being allowed to apply for another permit.

The bill also includes a clause that states that people who have been granted the right to be Caymanian, known as ‘status’, will be required to provide annual declarations for themselves and their dependents for seven years after being granted the right. Failure to do so will be a ground for revocation of their status.

Holders of RERCs also would be required to provide an annual declaration, or have their certificate revoked.

The amendments also include an age limit to the list of criteria for a Certificate of Specialist Caregivers. They also have a stipulation that holders of Certificates of Specialist Caregivers and Certificates of Commercial Farmhands would cease to be valid once those individuals turn 65.

Surviving spouses or civil partners, with dependents, will be required to have specific financial standing if they were married for fewer than seven years as part of their application to live permanently in Cayman.

A holder of the right to be Caymanian by entitlement, who after reaching the age of 18, resides outside Cayman for five years or more, and who fails to notify WORC, will lose that right, under the proposed amendments.

The public consultation period for the bill runs from 17 Oct. to 14 Nov.

Minister for Caymanian Employment and Immigration Michael Myles in the government stated, “Public consultation of a bill is a cornerstone of good governance. This process ensures that every voice is heard and that the Immigration Bill reflects the realities, needs, and aspirations of the people it will serve.

“By engaging with the public, we can craft a fair, transparent, and effective immigration system that upholds our national values and supports both our citizens and those who wish to contribute to our society.”

This case — and another involving a military contractor — could deliver sweeping immunity to federal contractors, if they get the ruling they want from the high court, allowing them to operate with even greater impunity than they already do.

The two cases have drawn little attention amid a slate of enormously consequential legal battles currently before the Supreme Court. But they offer a window into a decades-long fight by government contractors to avoid public accountability in court, a battle that has ramped up as the federal government has outsourced ever more of its operations to powerful private firms.

Leading the charge are for-profit vendors that work with the Department of Homeland Security on immigration enforcement. Many of these private prison companies and security firms have histories of alleged physical, psychological, and sexual abuse — but often operate in the shadows, resisting public oversight. Private lawsuits are often one of the only ways left to hold these firms accountable.

More than a decade ago, the GEO Group, a private prison company with deep pockets and powerful allies in the Trump administration, was sued under Colorado law for forcing immigrants in its custody to work without pay. The GEO Group is a longtime contractor of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security’s detention and enforcement arm. At ICE’s behest, the prison company now operates private immigration detention centers around the country under contracts worth billions.

While some of GEO Group’s arguments were rejected by a lower court, the prison operator has appealed the matter to the Supreme Court, arguing it is shielded from the lawsuit by so-called “derivative sovereign immunity,” a contested legal theory that holds that private firms are immune from such legal attacks if they are carrying out, under contract, the orders of the government. Over the past decades, private firms like the GEO Group have worked to expand this immunity theory to kill outside lawsuits.

“Immunity for those who carry out immigration laws is a value of high order,” attorneys for GEO Group wrote in their January petition for the Supreme Court to take up the case.

In June, the high court agreed to hear arguments on the case. While the question before the Supreme Court is narrow — revolving around when contractors can appeal a lower court decision on derivative sovereign immunity — GEO Group is also requesting the court “vindicate” and expand contractors’ legal shield, a position that has drawn opposition from unions, consumer groups, and even the Department of Justice.

Private interests have thronged to support GEO Group’s efforts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, and trade associations for government contractors, such as the Professional Services Council, have filed briefs in favor of GEO Group.

The case has also drawn the attention of other government contractors that are facing accusations of illegal conduct, including the obscure transportation company MVM, Inc., an ICE vendor that is facing a lawsuit over its central role in carrying out family separations under the first Trump administration.

MVM claims that it, too, is shielded by derivative sovereign immunity from attempts to hold the company liable for the lasting harms of family separations. The suit in question was brought by a father and son who were separated by MVM in 2018. They did not reunite for years.

But the impacts of the Supreme Court case could go far beyond immigration. Derivative sovereign immunity, as GEO Group sees it, applies to any contractor working for the federal government. And in the prison company’s view, it could grant them broad immunity from lawsuits.

“They’re asking for a change in the law that would immunize government contractors everywhere,” said Jonathan Maier, senior litigation counsel with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has submitted an amicus brief opposing the GEO Group’s argument.

The implications of such a decision would be broad. Government contracting is a $750 billion industry that has infiltrated all facets of American life. It includes major corporations like weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin and technology company Microsoft, as well as far smaller companies that provide landscaping services or security guards for government buildings.

“The amount of money at stake is massive,” said Kate Sablosky Elengold, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. “All of us at some time probably interact with government contractors.”

“It’s Spread Like Wildfire”

In October 2014, nine immigrants detained at the time or in the past at a GEO Group facility in Aurora, Colorado, filed suit against the company. All had worked various jobs at the detention center, like serving meals or doing clerical work, through the facility’s so-called “voluntary work program.” They were paid $1 per day.

All detainees were also forced by prison staff to clean the facility without any pay whatsoever, scrubbing windows, cleaning toilets, and mopping floors. When several of the plaintiffs in the case refused to do so, they were threatened with “the hole” — solitary confinement.

“You feel like you don’t have rights in there,” one man detained at the Aurora facility testified in the case. “They tell you, ‘Clean, because you’re going to the hole,’ I’m going to clean.”

These labor conditions violated several Colorado state wage and trafficking laws, attorneys representing the detainees alleged. They sued the private prison operator for $5 million, noting that in 2013, while GEO Group was forcing immigrants to do its janitorial work for free, the company raked in $1.52 billion in revenue.

Over the last 10 years, GEO Group has “repeatedly sought to delay the case,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief this year. Among the defenses the private prison giant raised to stall for time was derivative sovereign immunity — the sweeping legal shield increasingly invoked by federal contractors. Because its contract with ICE had, among other things, required GEO Group to offer a work program for detainees, the prison operator claimed that it could not be sued under Colorado state law; it was simply carrying out the federal government’s orders.

GEO Group is hardly the first company to make such an argument. Private contractors, from third-party student loan servicers to weapons manufacturers, have increasingly used the derivative sovereign immunity defense when accused of misconduct.

“The courts have been addressing more and more arguments by government contractors that they’re entitled to this defense in a particular case,” said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the consumer legal advocacy group Public Citizen. “It’s spread like wildfire.”

Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that originates from common law. In the United States, sovereign immunity protects the federal government from lawsuits (unless it has explicitly waived that right). Private contractors claim a similar legal shield through derivative sovereign immunity. If a federal contractor is required by the government to carry out an action, the logic goes, then sovereign immunity is passed down from the state, protecting the private company from liability as well.

This principle can be traced back to a 1940 Supreme Court ruling, Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction Co., that found a construction contractor working for the government wasn’t liable for damage to private land — although the high court didn’t use the term “immunity” in its opinion. Generally, the courts have determined that if a contractor is following precise orders from the government, it can often escape liability for its actions. But the scope of this defense is contested, and private contractors have been trying to expand the concept into blanket immunity.

Derivative sovereign immunity is just one of several legal shields private contractors have developed over the years to try to stymie lawsuits over their actions. Military contractors, particularly those working for the Pentagon in combat zones, are using a new case to seek their own unique legal protections.

The case, Hencely v. Fluor Corporation, arose from a lawsuit against a construction contractor operating in Afghanistan, which argued that the contractor’s negligence allowed a suicide bomber access to a military base, severely injuring the plaintiff, a U.S. soldier, and killing five others. The contractor in question, Fluor, is arguing that it has broad immunity from lawsuits related to contract work it undertook for the government.

If the Supreme Court sides with the contractor, attorneys with Public Citizen wrote in an amicus brief in the case, it would grant “blanket immunity” for all lawsuits against military contractors working in wartime combat zones — an area of law that has long been murky.

Fluor “seems to be arguing that they are not liable for anything done within the scope of their contract, even where they breached their contract,” Joshi at Public Citizen told The Lever, a broader request than in the GEO Group case.

Alliance of Goliaths

The backdrop for these twin legal battles is the continual outsourcing of core U.S. government functions to private contractors, which over time has created a class of powerful companies that fill in for the government, but are in some ways more difficult to oversee.

“Public officials are generally more accountable to the public than private companies are,” said Joshi. Private companies have their investors to answer to, rather than a public mandate, and may be subject to different oversight or regulatory requirements than a public body.

The Pentagon, which spends trillions of dollars on private vendors, has never successfully passed an audit. ICE contractors regularly flout congressional disclosure requirements. Already, these contractors are pushing for more impunity in the contracting process; military contractors have advocated for measures, which are being considered in this year’s defense policy bill, to speed up procurement and slash restrictions on contracting.

Further privatization often means replacing union jobs with low-wage positions, as one major union wrote in its amicus brief in the GEO Group case. And all of this comes at an enormous cost, as private contractors take in ever more government dollars.

If the Supreme Court sides with the contractors in the two cases — granting them stronger legal protections against lawsuits — it could further entangle private contractors in the government, eroding the distinction between public and private services, advocates warn.

In the GEO Group case, the Trump administration has taken the side of the plaintiffs, arguing that while a derivative sovereign immunity defense is “critically important” to government contractors, it is not as broad as GEO Group claims. But the Department of Justice is siding with military contractors in the Hencely case, arguing that immunity is necessary for its war contractors.

It’s not the first time that the government has sided with its contractors on this question. Elengold, in a 2021 paper the law professor co-authored on derivative sovereign immunity, dubs this an “alliance of Goliaths,” a marriage between the federal government and big business to crush efforts by consumers or the public to use the courts to push back on exploitative policy.

“My concerns come when private, for-profit entities are violating state and federal law when not strictly required by the federal government and then avoiding liability,” Elengold said. “I think that’s a huge problem.”

Experts are unsure what the Supreme Court will ultimately decide on this issue, particularly in the GEO Group case, since the prison company’s arguments lack the backing of the Trump administration. Unlike other issues, such as dark money or deregulation, it’s more difficult to divine where the justices will stand on derivative sovereign immunity. Currently, the court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case later this fall.

“The Trump administration’s policies on illegal and legal immigration would reduce the projected number of workers in the United States by 6.8 million by 2028 and by 15.7 million by 2035 and lower the annual rate of economic growth by almost one-third, harming U.S. living standards,” the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) wrote in its analysis of deportation efforts led by the White House.

The research organization said the new migrant policies will “substantially” increase the federal debt by $1.74 trillion and reduce gross domestic product (GDP) by $12.1 trillion throughout the span of the next 10 years.

“The reductions in legal immigration include suspending and reducing refugee admissions, the travel ban enacted in 2025, ending Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole programs, prohibiting international students from working on Optional Practical Training and STEM OPT after completing coursework and other changes, such as an expected public charge rule, to restrict legal immigration,” researchers wrote.

“The analysis does not include the likely significant economic impact of restricting U.S. companies’ access to high-skilled foreign nationals through regulatory and administrative action, which could affect productivity growth,” they added.

The Hill reached out to the White House for comment.

The Trump administration has set a goal of removing at least 1 million immigrants in the country illegally per year. The Labor Department recently warned that the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts could drive up food prices due to a dwindling workforce in the agriculture industry.

Taxpayer funds are currently being used to bolster border and immigration enforcement, including the White House’s $45 billion investment to increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity.

The NFAP said as expenditures rise, so will the country’s debt.

“Increasing the federal debt will reduce living standards in the United States by leading to higher levels of taxation, inflation and interest rates than without such debt,” researchers wrote.

“Labor force growth is a crucial part of the economic growth that advances a country’s living standards and facilitates the financing of existing debts and obligations. With the U.S.-born population aging and growing at a slower rate, immigrants have become an essential part of American labor force growth,” they added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/GOP-immigration_bolton_121823_illo_SamanthaWongGregNashFilePhotoAdobeStock.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-18 15:57:43.161062

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it's happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump's erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,'' said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. ""Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.''

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump's deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth ""could be near zero or negative in the next few years.''

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump's immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an ""invasion'' at America's southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump's push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn't get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters. But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum. “You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’ Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’ The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket. “The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’ ""You're not welcome here'' Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May. “Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’ Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000. “A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,"" Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. ""It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’ Some are already packing up. In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa's poor, said Trump's signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders. The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said. _____ Wiseman reported from Washington and Salomon from Miami.

Huerta and other protesters “appeared to be communicating with each other in a concerted effort to disrupt the law enforcement operations,” a federal agent wrote in the complaint.
The agent wrote that they told Huerta that if he kept blocking the Ambiance gate, he would be arrested.
According to the complaint, as a white law enforcement van tried to get through the gate, Huerta stood in its path.
“Despite David’s harsh treatment at the hands of law enforcement, he is now facing an unjust charge,” the statement read.","Federal authorities are now pursuing a misdemeanor charge against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, who was arrested during the first day of a series of immigration raids that swept the region.

Prosecutors originally brought a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer against Huerta, accusing him of obstructing federal authorities from serving a search warrant at a Los Angeles workplace and arresting dozens of undocumented immigrants on June 6.

On Friday, court filings show federal prosecutors filed a lesser charge against Huerta of “obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer,” which carries a punishment of up to a year in federal prison. The felony he was charged with previously could have put him behind bars for up to six years.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles declined to comment.

In a statement, Huerta’s attorneys, Abbe David Lowell and Marilyn Bednarski, said they would “seek the speediest trial to vindicate David.” The lawyers said that “in the four months that have passed since David’s arrest, it has become even clearer there were no grounds for charging him and certainly none for the way he was treated.”

“It’s clear that David Huerta is being singled out not for anything he did but for who he is — a life-long workers’ advocate who has been an outspoken critic of its immigration policies. These charges are a clear attempt to silence a leading voice who dared to challenge a cruel, politically driven campaign of fear,” the statement read.

The labor union previously stated that Huerta was detained “while exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity.” Huerta is one of more than 60 people charged federally in the Central District of California tied to immigration protests and enforcement actions.

Two recent misdemeanor trials against protesters charged with assaulting a federal officer both ended in acquittals. Some protesters have taken plea deals.

In a statement Friday, Huerta said he is “being targeted for exercising my constitutional rights for standing up against an administration that has declared open war on working families, immigrants, and basic human dignity.”

“The baseless charges brought against me are not just about me, they are meant to intimidate anyone who dares to speak out, organize, or demand justice. I will not be silenced,” he said.

Huerta was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles for days, prompting thousands of union members, activists and supporters to rally for his release. California Democratic Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla also sent a letter to the Homeland Security and Justice departments demanding a review of Huerta’s arrest.

A judge ordered Huerta released in June on a $50,000 bond.

The case against Huerta centers on a June 6 workplace immigration raid at Ambiance Apparel. According to the original criminal complaint filed, Huerta arrived at the site around noon Friday, joining several other protesters.

Huerta and other protesters “appeared to be communicating with each other in a concerted effort to disrupt the law enforcement operations,” a federal agent wrote in the complaint.

The agent wrote that Huerta was yelling at and taunting officers and later sat cross-legged in front of a vehicle gate to the location where law enforcement authorities were serving a search warrant.

Huerta also “at various times stood up and paced in front of the gate, effectively preventing law enforcement vehicles from entering or exiting the premises through the gate to execute the search warrant,” the agent wrote in the affidavit.

The agent wrote that they told Huerta that if he kept blocking the Ambiance gate, he would be arrested.

According to the complaint, as a white law enforcement van tried to get through the gate, Huerta stood in its path.

Because Huerta “was being uncooperative, the officer put his hands on HUERTA in an attempt to move him out of the path of the vehicle.”

“I saw HUERTA push back, and in response, the officer pushed HUERTA to the ground,” the agent wrote. “The officer and I then handcuffed HUERTA and arrested him.”

According to a statement from SEIU-United Service Workers West, SEIU California State Council, and the Service Employees International Union, “Huerta was thrown to the ground, tackled, pepper sprayed, and detained by federal agents while exercising his constitutional rights at an ICE raid in Los Angeles.” Video of his arrest went viral.

“Despite David’s harsh treatment at the hands of law enforcement, he is now facing an unjust charge,” the statement read. “This administration has turned the military against our own people, terrorizing entire communities, and even detaining U.S. citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights to speak out.”

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, posted a photo on the social media site X of Huerta, hands behind his back, after the arrest.

“Let me be clear: I don’t care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,” Essayli wrote. “No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.”

In an interview with Sacramento TV news oulet KCRA last month, Essayli referred to Huerta as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “buddy” and said he “deliberately obstructed a search warrant.”

While speaking with reporters in June, Schiff said Huerta was “exercising his lawful right to be present and observe these immigration raids.”

“It’s obviously a very traumatic thing, and now that it looks like the Justice Department wants to try and make an example out of him, it’s all the more traumatic,” Schiff said. “But this is part of the Trump playbook. They selectively use the Justice Department to go after their adversaries.

Mahin Shahriar, 28, who came to Canada from Bangladesh in 2019, told the Canadian Press he accepted an invitation from a “friend” to visit a property near Montreal, which he now suspects was part of a broader human trafficking operation.

He says the alleged property was in a rural area and when he couldn’t find it, he called the acquaintance for directions.

“Then I found myself in the US,” he said. “It was not my intention.” Shahriar approached immigration officials when he realized his mistake – and was subsequently detained.

But unlike recent harrowing stories in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials have blocked attempts to repatriate people to Canada, Shahriar’s lawyer told the Guardian it is the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) hampering his client’s return.

“It’s not that CBSA isn’t accepting him – it’s that they won’t even respond to us at all,” said immigration lawyer Washim Ahmed. The last time he received correspondence from the border agency was in July. “Quite simply, they have a legal obligation to bring him back.”

Ahmed says that, under the safe third country agreement, Canada is required to bring Shahriar back because he was detained by border officials within 14 days of illegally entering the US. Even if the CBSA did not invoke the agreement in this case, an exception could still apply, said Ahmed.

“If you have a family member in Canada that has legal status or is a refugee claimant – which he had – you are entitled to return. And so our position is either to apply the agreement or acknowledge the exception, but the end result is the same: he needs to come back.”

Ahmed has turned to the federal courts, requesting the courts compel a formal decision from CBSA in order to begin the process of a judicial review of the case, under the argument that CBSA is obliged to facilitate Shahriar’s return.

He has also petitioned Canada’s public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree, for assistance in the “unique” case.

“In the past we’ve seen people from the US trying to enter Canada and border officials reject them, citing the safe third country agreement. We’re now asking them to apply those same rules of the agreement to this case,” said Ahmed.

Canada’s border services agency says as a broader policy, it does not comment on specific cases and does not intervene on behalf of foreign nationals subject to immigration enforcement in another country.

CBSA did say that anyone trying to enter Canada must appear at an official examination centre to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

But Ahmed said Ice will not bring Shahriar to an examination centre without prior approval from the CBSA. He says correspondence with Ice also suggests US officials have reached out to Canadian counterparts and faced resistance.

Complicating Shahriar’s case is a failed refugee application in Canada. He arrived to the country in 2019 as a student and fell victim to a fraudulent immigration consultant who portrayed himself as a qualified lawyer. A fraudulent claim was made on his behalf and rejected.

Under Canadian law, Shahriar is eligible to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because his failed claim was made more than a year ago. As part of the assessment, officials check whether claimants would face persecution if deported to their home country. If they face substantial risk, they can remain in Canada.

“Ice has looked at his case and concluded he would face risks in Bangladesh, so they won’t send him there,” said Ahmed. “And so we want to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because we’re confident Canadian officials will see the dangers he will face if he was ever sent back.”

While staying in Canada without legal status, Shahriar managed to bring his mother and sister to the country and Ahmed was able to prepare a successful claim on behalf of Shahriar’s mother.

Shahriar’s mother, who has permanent residency in Canada, has been hospitalized on numerous occasions for severe mental health issues compounded by her son’s detention.

“My client is in arbitrary detention. He didn’t commit any crime. He didn’t steal anything, didn’t harm anyone or cause trouble. And it’s been like this for nearly half a year,” said Ahmed, calling the case a “profoundly disappointing” situation. “He doesn’t know where he’s going. He can’t be deported to Bangladesh. He needs to go back to Canada. And so we’re asking Canadian officials to do what’s right – but also what they’re legally obliged to do.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76089665f713b09175435753e9a2500b067bb7fa/0_163_1536_1229/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c09c99dd820fbfa64e0a7fe282dd1e6",N,,2025-10-18 13:58:06.273050

Johnson said participation in the controversial 287(g) program could allow the city to hire additional officers with no impact on the budget, according to a memo he sent on Friday asking the chairs of the city's public safety and government efficiency committees to hold a joint meeting on the agreement.

""This program could act as a 'force multiplier,' providing a path for the Dallas Police Department to deploy additional resources to reduce violent crime at lower cost to taxpayers,"" Johnson wrote in the memo.

Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Community Police Oversight Board Tuesday that he immediately rejected a $25 million offer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the city to sign such a deal.

""We said, 'Absolutely no, not, no.' That was me who said that. Turned it down,"" Comeaux said, adding DPD officers do not make immigration arrests.

Johnson said such a decision should not be made unilaterally.

""Decisions on matters like this—especially one involving $25 million of public funds—should be made by elected policymakers after receiving public input,"" he wrote, asking the committee chairs to arrange for a public briefing involving ICE representatives and Comeaux.

""With this information, you should then determine what, if any, financial efficiencies and public safety benefits Dallas might achieve by participating in ICE’s Task Force Model,"" the mayor wrote.

Messages to Chair of the Public Safety Committee Cara Mendelsohn, and Chair of the Committee on Government Efficiency were not immediately returned Friday. The mayor's memo was first reported by the Dallas Morning News.

A sample agreement for the ICE task force model, posted on the agency's website, outlines functions local police are able to undertake if such an agreement is signed including:

The right to ask any person believed to be in the country illegally about their right to be in the United States.

The power to arrest any person suspected of being in the county illegally who may flee before a warrant can be obtained.

The power to make arrests for immigration law violations.

If the joint committee meeting proposed by Johnson is held and a recommendation to move forward with a 287(g) agreement is made, the full City Council must still approve any such agreement -- which is likely to be an uphill battle in a city dominated by Democrats.

A bill passed by the legislature earlier this year will mandate large counties within the state, including Dallas County, to sign a version of a 287(g) agreement -- including versions specifically focused on jails. The ""task force model,"" which would apply to DPD, is more controversial.

At Tuesday's meeting, Comeaux expressed concern that making headlines about the department's stance on immigration would bring more federal attention to the city of Dallas.

Johnson is calling for a public review of Police Chief Daniel Comeaux's decision to reject a $25 million federal offer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, urging a joint committee meeting to determine whether the city should reconsider joining the 287(g) immigration enforcement program.

Mayor seeks committee briefing

The Republican mayor's request follows Comeaux's disclosure to the Community Police Oversight Board that he personally declined ICE's $25 million offer, citing concerns about bringing unwanted attention to Dallas.

The 287(g) program allows local law enforcement agencies to perform certain immigration duties under federal authority. Recent changes in Texas law now require county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the program's models.

Johnson says the decision should be made transparently, with public input and a thorough analysis of both financial implications and public safety impact.

Memo outlines mayor's request

In a memorandum sent Friday to city committee chairs - Cara Mendelsohn (Public Safety) and Maxie Johnson (Government Efficiency) - Mayor Johnson asked for a joint meeting to be convened as soon as possible.

""Clearly, participation in ICE's Task Force Model could offer substantial financial benefits to Dallas,"" Johnson said in the memo. ""These funds could be used to hire additional officers without impacting the city's budget. Declining ICE's offer may mean forfeiting significant financial resources.""

Johnson is requesting briefings during the meeting from both ICE representatives and the Dallas police chief regarding the rejected $25 million offer and the 287(g) program. He is urging the committees to evaluate the potential financial efficiencies and public safety benefits of participating in ICE's Task Force Model.

He also said public input should be considered in the decision-making process, followed by a thoroughly vetted recommendation from the committees to be presented to the full City Council for potential further action.

Comeaux explains his decision

Comeaux disclosed the rejection of the $25 million federal offer during a recent Community Police Oversight Board meeting.

During the meeting, he clarified that social media posts suggesting Dallas police were helping ICE were inaccurate. Officers were assisting U.S. Marshals, Comeaux said.

He emphasized that the department has had ""very little interaction with ICE.""

""We were contacted by the federal government, I think it was last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be appointed 287(g),"" Comeaux said. ""We said absolutely no, not no. That was me who said that, turned it down.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke.""

What is the 287(g) program?

Since 1996, state and local law enforcement agencies have been able to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties through a voluntary program known as 287(g).

The program includes three models that departments can participate in:

Serving administrative warrants in jails

Executing civil immigration warrants on behalf of the federal government

Conducting limited immigration enforcement activities

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring all county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the 287(g) models.

North Texas participation details

In February, CBS News Texas asked sheriff's departments in North Texas' four largest counties how they were assisting the Trump administration with immigration enforcement. Dallas, Tarrant, Collin, and Denton counties reported checking the immigration status of any inmates processed through their jails.

The Collin County Sheriff's Office also said it assists federal authorities in apprehending undocumented immigrants when requested.

The city of Keller also participates in the 287(g) program through its jail.

Johnson outlines potential benefits

As of July, more than 100 Texas agencies were participating in the program. Under Senate Bill 8, ""nearly all Texas counties - including Dallas County - are now required to participate,"" Johnson said.

He said ICE now offers full reimbursement for trained officers' salaries, benefits, and overtime.

Potential benefits, Johnson said, include funding additional officers with no budget impact, helping remove violent repeat offenders from the streets, and acting as a ""force multiplier"" for law enforcement.

""Together, we can continue to make our city government more efficient and responsible, and make Dallas safer, stronger, and more vibrant,"" Johnson said.

That Kavanaugh has to own the Kavanaugh stop is cold comfort.
By all outward appearances, Trump’s crime crackdown priorities seem odd.","Believe it or not, there was a time when the Supreme Court’s emergency docket rulings did not regularly garner controversy; they were simply the means by which the court could consider time-sensitive legal crises, such as motions related to capital punishment. But a key feature of the Trump era is the transformation of the emergency docket into the “shadow docket”: unsigned rulings that have had a profound effect on the country. Beyond the fact that these rulings have a “heads Trump wins, tails Democrats lose” bent, they are, as Erwin Chemerinsky notes, often proffered without much in the way of jurisprudential explanation while frequently bulldozing precedent. The justices themselves may not like the term “shadow docket,” but they seem to relish operating in the shadows all the same.

But there is one instance in which a justice did attempt to explain himself in a recent shadow docket ruling, only for that justice’s reasoning to blow up nearly immediately after its first encounter with the real world: Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, in which the Supremes stayed a lower court ruling that was specifically impeding the Department of Homeland Security from racially profiling people for immigration stops. The larger court, as is its wont, failed to offer a ruling. But Kavanaugh opted to weigh in all the same. His reward is a heaping helping of infamy in the form of a specific secret police tactic that many have taken to calling “the Kavanaugh stop.”

Here’s the essential background. As The New Republic’s Matt Ford reported after the ruling in Noem was handed down, Kavanaugh’s surprise concurrence went to some pains to “minimize the impact” of a law enforcement encounter: “Importantly, reasonable suspicion means only that immigration officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status,” Kavanaugh wrote. “If the person is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter. Only if the person is illegally in the United States may the stop lead to further immigration proceedings.”

As Ford noted, the law enforcement encounters that formed the basis of the case itself could hardly be called “brief.” One of the plaintiffs in Noem testified that his attempt to show valid proof of U.S. citizenship did not make the encounter any shorter, as the agents “refused to believe the validity of his California driver’s license.” As Justice Sonia Sotomayor recalled in her dissent, “The agent said the ID was insufficient, ‘grabbed [his] arm,’ escorted him to a vehicle, and drove him to a ‘warehouse area’ for further questioning.” None of that sounds at all like the quick interaction that Kavanaugh suggested was the theoretical norm. And in practice, the Kavanaugh stop hasn’t hewed to his imagined brief encounter, either.

The quintessential components of a Kavanaugh stop involve a person detained for immigration enforcement specifically, with race a certain or likely factor in the decision behind the stop—the Fourth Amendment’s protections from unlawful searches and seizures be damned. Sotomayor saw a grim future in the court’s decision: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

If the news is any guide, Sotomayor’s fears are now reality. As the Chicago Tribune recently reported, Chicago resident Rueben Antonio Cruz, a 60-year-old man originally from El Salvador, was sitting with a friend in Rogers Park when “immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them.” What followed was a classic Kavanaugh stop: Cruz and his friend were asked for “papers” proving their citizenship. Cruz, who was not carrying such papers on his person, was then bundled into the agents’ vehicle and interrogated. Cruz was eventually let go, but not before the agents fined him $130 for “not having his papers.” The ordeal left Cruz angry: “It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident.”

The Tribune notes that while federal law requires registered foreign nationals to carry proof of registration with them at all times, “prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced.” The detention drew the criticism of the ACLU’s Ed Yohnka: “America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident—and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers—is unnecessary and cruel.” Unfortunately, it’s likely to become commonplace as Trump’s goons, freed from legal obligations by the Supreme Court, make the Kavanaugh stop part of their daily operations.

The possibility that Trump’s ICE agents, who have effectively been given carte blanche to abuse their authority, might simply dismiss their quarry’s valid proof of citizenship appears to have not occurred to Kavanaugh. But it has definitely occurred to the jabronis snatching up brown people in American cities. In a second Kavanaugh stop detailed by the Tribune, a 44-year-old Latina woman named Maria Greeley was out for a jog when she was jumped by federal agents who zip-tied her and detained her despite the fact that she carries her passport with her at all times to prove that she was born in the United States. According to the report, agents remarked that she didn’t “look like a Greeley,” dismissed her documentation, and accused her repeatedly of lying.

One of the most obviously impeachable things about the Supreme Court is that it’s so frequently out of touch with the real world—a perhaps inevitable condition of giving nine people special robes and lifetime job security and then stuffing them inside a sepulchral building to stew in their own partisan juices with no one to answer to. Kavanaugh’s flawed reasoning may simply be the product of profound naïveté. But since this all came about in a shadow docket case in which the Trump administration asked for emergency relief in the form of the permission to racially profile people, I think it’s hardly beyond belief to think that Kavanaugh felt compelled to try to put a good spin on a reprehensible ruling.

That Kavanaugh has to own the Kavanaugh stop is cold comfort. Who knows if it’s even possible to shame or humiliate Brett Kavanaugh anyway? It’s very possible that transforming the United States into a country more reminiscent of Nazi Germany’s “Ihre Papiere bitte” era is precisely the legacy that Kavanaugh sought for himself. We’re the ones who are stuck with the consequences.

This article first appeared in Power Mad, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Jason Linkins. Sign up here.

The popular way of describing what’s going on in Washington right now is to say that on October 1, the federal government shut down as a result of Congress’s inability to pass an appropriations bill to keep it funded. Chief among the sticking points was the fact that Democrats and Republicans could not come to terms on the future of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The Republican bill did not include them; Democrats balked at signing their name to a budget that would cause skyrocketing premium costs for millions of mostly low- and middle-income Americans.

You wouldn’t be faulted if that was your capsule summary of the shutdown. It’s essentially the story to which most of the political press is sticking, and there’s nothing fundamentally untrue about it. It would appear for now, in fact, that the broad public acceptance of this state of play is boosting Democrats’ fortunes in the game of who “owns” the shutdown. CNN’s Harry Enten reported this week that voters blame the GOP more, by an average of 12 points, and he noted that historically speaking, the party blamed at the outset is who gets blamed at the end. (It probably helps Democrats’ cause that those perusing the Obamacare exchanges for plans right now are already seeing the huge spikes in premium costs.)

Still, these facts only tell part of the story. This government shutdown isn’t merely about an appropriations bill, and it’s not entirely about health care subsidies. This shutdown is actually the culmination of a much deeper dysfunction, to which blame can indeed be wholly attached to President Donald Trump and his GOP apparatchiks. But the underlying cause of the shutdown is tricky terrain for Democrats to negotiate, and it calls into question whether they can—or even should—speedily resolve it. And the key to understanding the problem begins with acknowledging that this didn’t start in October. The government shutdown began a few weeks after Trump was sworn in.

Trump’s second term is broadly defined by his monomaniacal desire to either end or fatally impair the federal government. With the help of Elon Musk and Russell Vought, the Trump administration managed to do this in the most alienating possible way. As my colleague Alex Shephard noted this week, the administration’s slash-and-burn speedrun through the civil service has been broadly unpopular. It also probably goes a long way toward making any of the GOP’s rhetoric about Democrats being to blame for this most recent shutdown harder to take seriously.

But the reason things have dragged to a legislative standstill in October is essentially because Republicans in Congress willed it to be so when they returned to Washington to rejoin Trump as devoted supplicants. Their most fateful decision in that regard? Giving up one of the legislative branch’s core functions—the power of the purse. As NPR reported, by the first week of February, Republican lawmakers had already begun to master the art of explaining away why they were happy to surrender the power to appropriate money to Trump.

I characterized this at the time as an escalation in GOP lawmakers’ expansive campaign of self-abnegation. But it has ended up being so much more. The decision to give the White House full power to decide what, when, and how congressionally appropriated money is spent has created an impasse more deep and intractable than the shutdown itself, because the question of how the conflict over Obamacare subsidies gets resolved has become impossible to answer.

Let’s think about it for a minute. The White House’s position, as advanced by Vice President JD Vance and others, is that Senate Democrats should stop filibustering the appropriations bill now, and the matter of the subsidies can be negotiated later. The problem is that it’s impossible for a reasonable person to view that offer as sincere. Sure, Congress can go through the motions: meet in committee, hash out a deal, pass a bill, and send it to Trump’s desk. Trump can even sign that bill. But none of it matters when you know that Trump is likely to simply appropriate or not appropriate that money as he sees fit through pocket rescissions.

What we have here is a fully busted appropriations process; it is impossible to have faith in anything that Trump and his Republican cronies do with taxpayer dollars, even in instances in which bills have been negotiated, agreed to, and passed. And Republicans just keep on tipping their hands that they don’t really care about restoring that faith. This week, the chief way they responded to Democrats’ demands was to threaten federal workers’ back pay, despite the law being very clear that workers are entitled to those wages once the shutdown ends. Here, Democrats should say, “If the Trump administration is willing to break faith, and the law, to not pay you now, there is no reason to believe your steady paycheck is safe under any circumstances.”

So when and how does this get resolved? Knowing of the Trump administration’s faithlessness and the physiological impossibility of him honoring any deal made on Obamacare subsidies—or anything else—it’s not clear that Democrats should even play a role in resolving the matter. As Garrett Graff wrote, “If appropriations bills are not seen as enforceable contracts, why should any Member of Congress vote to fund any part of the federal government under Donald Trump? You’re voting to provide money for lawlessness.” Having once opted to give Trump’s paramilitary forces the money to invade American cities, Democrats should not position themselves to be fooled a second time.

It’s worth pointing out that Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, so they can end the impasse any time they want, all on their own. I’ll admit that I do not know what Devil Magic has heretofore kept the GOP from simply nuking the filibuster and getting on with this. Perhaps they desire even the slightest whiff of bipartisan assent for Trump’s designs because of the cover it earns them from the mainstream political media, who are as desperate as ever to find the smallest scintilla of evidence that the American experiment is still working. But from here, the shutdown calculus becomes simple: If Democratic votes are what Trump and his GOP enablers need the most, they must never be provided.

According to a fresh Gallup poll this week, 43 percent of Americans regard the Supreme Court as “too conservative,” against 36 percent who feel that the Roberts court is an even-tempered administrator of justice. That 43 percent is a new high, per Gallup: “Before the court shifted to a 6-3 conservative advantage after Amy Coney Barrett replaced Ruth Bader Ginsburg in October 2020, no more than 33% had ever characterized it as too conservative.” But then, that conservative majority started doing things—like gut Roe—and disapproval followed. Don’t expect things to turn around, by the way. As Matt Ford noted earlier this week, the court is expected to take a rightward lurch during its next term.

I got to thinking about the Supreme Court this week after Brian Beutler invited the readers of his Off Message newsletter to engage in a thought exercise: If you could thwart MAGA and the rise of fascism, but only by “turning the Democrats’ ideological clock” back to 2005, would you take that trade-off? Moderating would mean a lot of ideological progress on the left would have to fall by the wayside (Democrats in 2005 weren’t robustly defending marriage equality, and were nowhere near President Joe Biden’s vision of a pro-worker economy). But the idea is tempting—and the Supreme Court looms large. I would not call the high court’s 2005 incarnation “good” by any stretch of the imagination. But during the transition from Chief William Rehnquist to John Roberts, the court came studded with justices—Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Sandra Day O’Connor—who were willing to swing between ideological poles. Going back sure sounds like a good deal.

Alas, the world only spins forward. There’s no “moderation” button that Democrats might press to take us back to a more halcyon era. As provocative as Beutler’s thought experiment is, I’d prefer Democrats to think more deeply about the present moment—and more strategically about getting out of it. I don’t think we escape the fascism trap without Democrats who are willing to spend a lot of political capital, and I think those Democrats will have to commit themselves to some radical thinking along the way.

There is a place, to my mind, where Democrats can and probably should moderate. The big intraparty battles of the pre-Trump era revolved around whether Democrats should go big on policy or stay toward the center; here were the debates over Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and taxes designed to soak the rich. This is, alas, not the moment to revive or promote these ideas—and I say that as a fervent supporter of them. That’s because they don’t stand a chance under this extremist Supreme Court, which must first be dealt with.

I spelled out some of my thinking on this matter back in 2024, at a time when Kamala Harris was being dogged by daily reports of her reversing herself or becoming suddenly noncommittal about policies she once supported in the years prior to her vice presidency. I was fairly sanguine about this state of affairs because the Supreme Court had, by then, entered its Enemy of Liberal Governance Era, and it was quite clear to me that the six-member conservative majority was simply going to stamp a line-item veto over anything a Democratic president or legislature did.

Under this judicial regime, things like Medicare for All are a complete nonstarter. Hell, so is any hyper-timid means-tested bullshit if five justices don’t want Democrats to succeed. As I urged at the time, conflict with “a Supreme Court that’s holding the policymaking apparatus hostage” is inevitable, and it is “not a fight [Democrats] can duck.”

All of which means that while Democrats might be able to pick and choose some avenues of moderation, the task of arresting and reversing the degradation of the Trump era will inevitably require a hard swerve toward a more radical type of political thinking—especially with regard to the Supreme Court. The polite norms around the Supreme Court have been obliterated. This should be apparent to everyone; every one of these shadow docket rulings where the majority semi-anonymously grants a would-be dictator more power to overthrow the Constitution only reinforces the fact that the high court’s age of respectability is over.

The Democrats who want to win back power in 2026, and win the presidency in 2028, need to embrace this conflict and nurture the growing public antipathy toward the Supreme Court. They will also have to do things that the Democrats of 2020—let alone 2005—dared not: Packing the court needs to be on the table. Reforms must be forcefully imposed. The justices need to be brought before Congress and explain themselves in regular reviews. And to get there, Democrats must engage in a content-creation campaign depicting the Roberts court as it truly is: a promoter of political corruption, a despoiler of the environment, an enemy of democracy, an institution that has pilfered wealth right from the people’s pockets.

I feel for Democrats facing this moment. Institutionalism has served them in decent stead in the recent past. But those institutions have been perverted in the Trump era and must be brought to heel and firmly restored to their civic purpose. There’s no purely moderate path to what should be the ideal “moderate” outcome: a restoring of balance to our civic lives.

But rather than look back to 2005 for solutions, Democrats must wind the clock back still further, to 1862, and find their purpose in this passage from President Abraham Lincoln’s second State of the Union address: “We can succeed only by concert.… The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise—with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.” The Democratic leaders of the future will be those who disenthrall themselves of the dogmas of the quiet past, and face a moment piled high with difficulty with courage and conviction.

Donald Trump was lustily booed at the U.S. Open in New York, and his excursion to one of D.C.’s despots’ club restaurants was interrupted by chanting protesters. But the opposition to the president extends well beyond the Acela corridor. As CNN’s Harry Enten noted this week, Trump’s approval rating is plummeting and he’s now “underwater on every issue”—including on crime and immigration, his supposed strengths. Across the board, Trump continues to have a “consent of the governed” problem, and it’s gotten so pronounced that former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is wondering whether “a despised autocrat can consolidate power.”

It’s a question that Krugman ultimately leaves unresolved. “I guess we’re going to find out,” he concludes. But there’s a hint of passivity here, as though the outcome is beyond our control—which could not be further from the truth. There’s a large and growing anti-Trump movement across the United States that is just waiting for powerful allies to join them, and it just so happens that there’s a minority party in Washington that is desperate for ways to exert its power that don’t require controlling the levers of government. It’s a no-brainer for the Democrats, who can keep the public animus toward the president well stoked by turning Trump’s elite enablers and supplicants—not just in the capital but across society, from Silicon Valley to academia—into objects of opprobrium.

We’ve been over this before, but the most important thing to remember about Trumpism is that it doesn’t work as a matter of policy. He doesn’t know how to run the economy anywhere other than into the ground, and with each passing day come fresh harbingers of shocks to those mythical kitchen tables. (According to recent reports, agricultural economists believe prices for a slew of grocery staples could be set to double this winter.)

As Krugman notes, Trump is running the inverse play from the Dictators’ Guide to Consolidating Power: Instead of using his power to shore up a weak economy, Trump is taking a roaring economy and wrecking it. And it hasn’t gone unnoticed: TNR’s Greg Sargent reported on a recent poll that found that “48 percent of overall likely 2026 voters say Trump’s tariffs are hurting their own economic situation, versus only 29 percent who say they’re not having any effect and an abysmal 8 percent who say the tariffs are helping their economic prospects.”

Still, as Krugman writes, Trump is governing like he has “an overwhelming mandate to do whatever he wants,” which raises the question: How is he getting away with it? Part of the answer is that denial has become his administration’s stock-in-trade—like the hilarious claim that the president’s signature does not appear in Jeffrey Epstein’s birthday sex-crime book. But another part of the answer, Krugman continues, “is anticipatory compliance on the part of members of the elite, from corporate CEOs to university presidents to law partners.”

Let’s linger on this a moment: Krugman is correct to note that one of the key forces enabling Trumpism is this grotesque collection of oligarchic weirdos that everybody hates: Big Law goons, Ivy League ivory tower types, corporate predators, and the tech-bro billionaire set. While some of these supplicants are more willing than others, they’re also the only ones receiving—or hoping to receive—some tangible benefit from Trump. Whether it’s Trump’s Silicon Valley dinner party guests or the university president who tried to cut a deal, all of these elites are operating from the same premise: “Maybe if I’m nice enough to Trump, he’ll let me keep the money.”

But the salient point is this: In the not-so-recent past, it would be the GOP endeavoring to paint Democrats as the captive party of America’s economic and cultural nobility. Now Trump has embraced all of these political albatrosses as his boosters. And as fortunes decline for you and me, it’s these already uber-privileged members of society who are staying whole—or getting ahead. The only people for whom Trumpism works, in other words, are the same sort of people who rigged the system in their favor in the first place. The only thing that’s changed is that the new mob boss is demanding a bigger cut.

It may be that the same forces that are enabling Trumpism could enable the opposition to Trumpism, provided that Democrats lose their risk-averse ways and demonize the elites that are now at Trump’s beck and call. And while it’s true that some have bent the knee more readily than others, we must have the stomach to castigate Trump’s allies no matter how willingly they came to his side. For my part, it’s OK with me if Democratic messaging included the line, “While Trump’s Harvard cronies were cutting deals, the cost of your groceries has doubled.”

There are no allies for Democrats to be found in Trump’s teeming hive of enablers. Anyone who might serve the ends of democracy and the rule of law has, by now, explicitly announced themselves as having taken that side. As Jonathan V. Last notes, “Any institution not explicitly anti-Trump will eventually become useful to Trump.” One day, we might need to have a conversation about whether some of these people or institutions should receive a path back to respectability after violating the social compact on behalf of a wannabe fascist strongman. But that’s not the pressing business of the day.

For now, brave Democrats can and should implicate and vilify those who have abetted Trumpian misrule and have, by extension, reaped the fruits of its poisonous economic tree. It may be that one of the keys to denying Trump long-term power is to foment the public’s ire at the company he keeps, paint the whole lot as crooks and brigands who are looting the proceeds of the public trust. The burgeoning anti-Trump movement in the streets will be cheered to hear from some political allies who are promising to name the villains of the Trump era and to crush them in whatever era comes next.

As Donald Trump’s goon-squad occupation of the nation’s capital wends its way into its third week, the president is already eyeing the next Democratic stronghold he’d like to strangle with his bruised hands in the name of “fighting crime.” Among the municipalities facing the mad king’s wrath is Chicago, which has loomed in far-right lore as some kind of Third World hellhole. While we wait for many Democratic leaders and media elites to take Trump’s authoritarian spree seriously, TNR editor Michael Tomasky this week urged Illinois officials to steel themselves for what’s to come. “Okay, JB Pritzker,” he wrote, “you’re up.”

It didn’t take long for the reply to come. In a Monday afternoon news conference, Illinois’s Democratic governor joined a slew of state leaders speaking out about Trump’s plan to deploy troops to Chicago. Pritzker has, over the past year, begun to cement his national profile ahead of what many presume to be a presidential run in 2028. He has firmly planted himself in the same “fighter” lane as California Governor Gavin Newsom—the better to distinguish himself from, say, whatever it is that Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer thinks she’s been doing lately.

Pritzker ended up being the headline figure of that Monday news conference, thanks to the simplicity and directness of his message. “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago,” he said. “You are neither wanted here nor needed here.” He offered some satisfying digs at the evident decline of Trump’s mental faculties. He hit many of the right notes for someone who wants to establish himself as a leader of a dissident movement. But Pritzker saved his best for last, when he promised to take the fight against Trump a step farther than most Democrats have allowed themselves.

Finally, to the Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.

This is where Pritzker has leveled up over his fellow Democrats, by promising a future of accountability and retribution for the destruction Trump and his minions are doing to the constitutional order and our individual freedoms. As I wrote back in May, the Trump White House and the GOP are no longer a political party by any definition; rather, they are a sort of criminal syndicate with an extensive portfolio of white collar crimes, violent offenses against our civil rights, and an ongoing sort of imposed cultural tyranny that is killing off the well-paying jobs of the future by decimating academia, and literally sparking public health crises at home and abroad through the Lysenkoism of key administration figures like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

As I noted at the time, “There is a certain necessary logic to what has to follow corrupt misrule of this kind: tribunals, trials, punishment, prison, and the running to ground and defunding of the entire Trump syndicate.” The only thing we were lacking then was an ambitious political figure who was willing to say that they were ready and willing to make accountability a key plank in their platform. Pritzker has made a timely arrival.

As Discourse Blog’s Rafi Schwartz points out, this isn’t the only uniquely consequential aspect of Pritzker’s speech. The Illinois governor—channeling the feelings of so many who’ve forewarned of what was to come in a second Trump term—told those assembled, “If it sounds to you like I am alarmist, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed, both here in Illinois and across the country.”

Pritzker’s willingness to straightforwardly announce the existence of a crisis with “no caveats” and “no conditionals,” Schwartz writes, helps to “[neutralize] the latent anxieties of those worried about coming off as unduly panicked or oversensitive to the political realities around us.” In short, Pritzker allows those so inclined to finally grant themselves the permission to see the fascism that’s on the march, and speak of it out loud.

In the same way, I think that Pritzker has kicked open a door to an alternate future: One in which the restorative work of post-Trump patriots involves accountability for criminals and reparations for the people they’ve harmed. The taking of names and the doling out of punishments: This is now part of the larger political discussion; this is now part of the Democrats’ intraparty debate about What Is To Be Done. By including this as part of his political ambition, and broadly suggesting it may be the major goal of some future Pritzker administration, he allows us to imagine this future and have a hand in creating it.

And it sure sounds like Pritzker wants to put his hands to the task right now. “If you hurt my people,” he said, “nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.” In a week where Beltway Democrats passed their time pointlessly debating whether or not they were using words like “food insecurity” too much, and congratulating each other for calling the D.C. occupation a “stunt” or a “distraction,” hearing a Democratic politician speak in plain English is pleasingly bracing. These are, indeed, encouraging words to hear after Democrats long implored us to “look forward, not backward” and allowed misrule to go unpunished, thereby paving the road for Trump’s fascist second act.

Less than a fortnight into President Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. by the National Guard and an alphabet soup of federal law enforcement agents, Washingtonians have rendered an unsurprising verdict on the president’s latest display of authoritarian corruption: They hate it, in large numbers. And they’re organizing against it: A “Free D.C.” movement has taken root—and taken to the streets—to resist the president’s latest power grab.

The response from political and media elites to this militarized takeover of our capital, however, has been rather limp. As The New Republic’s Monica Potts reports, Democrats apparently have been caught flat-footed by Trump’s maneuver; to the extent that they’ve said anything about it, they’ve largely dismissed it as a manufactured “distraction” rather than loudly calling it what it is: a fascist occupation—and a prelude to worse.

But Trump is getting plumped by some in the media as well: The Atlantic’s Michael Powell idly handwaves the fact that D.C. brought the violent crime rate to a 30-year low in 2024 to admonish Democrats for “downplaying crime.” (In this case, “downplaying crime” means “marshaling statistics demonstrating that the crime rate is trending in the right direction.”) Charles Fain Lehman, also in The Atlantic, goes to similar lengths to dismiss the actual facts to assert that “the reality is more complicated” and that some “deliberate intervention”—atop the one that brought the crime rate to a 30-year-low, presumably—is warranted.

These authors and others are making a profound error from the jump in assuming that Trump sincerely desires to lower the crime rate in D.C. Trump is actually a “blank, sucking nullity” who wants to see himself on television and has decided that his second term in office will be about self-enrichment and revenge. He is inventing a crisis of crime as a pretext for further consolidating his power; this is authoritarianism 101.

Personally, I think downplaying crime in the nation’s capital is not nearly as irresponsible as downplaying Trump’s authoritarianism. But if we must pretend that Trump’s efforts are sincere, then I’d challenge the proponents of his militarized deployments to approach their work with more rigor, and less vibes. Trump has proposed a thesis: Crime in D.C. will go down if masked paramilitaries flood the city and amble about the streets. The task, then, is to see if his theory stands up to the test—to take this seriously.

Trump’s critics do take this seriously, and they have a thesis of their own backed up by data. The District of Columbia had a miserable year in 2023; as crime rates were dropping across the country, D.C.’s were spiking. The New Republic’s Grace Segers took an in-depth look into the phenomenon and reported that the city’s woes stemmed from an interlocking array of local failures, structural problems, and lack of investment. But city officials got busy in 2024 and reversed the trend, achieving a 35 percent reduction in violent crime and the aforementioned 30-year low in the violent crime rate. (Trump is now contending that the city lied about these results. As always, the safe harbor for journalists is to treat every Trump claim as a probable lie—unless, for example, you relish being the type of dummy who reported that Trump had “disavowed Project 2025.”)

As the city pulled off this feat without unleashing goon platoons into the streets, Trump’s challenge is to somehow demonstrate that his way of doing things is more effective. While it’s early days, I’m not sure that we’re getting much bang for what I’m guessing will be a lot of bucks taken from taxpayers. What statistics the administration has put forth are scant: The White House told Axios that “212 people have been arrested for various [non–immigration related] crimes” between August 8 and August 18, 101 of which were from Wards 7 and 8.

That sounds fine, but there’s a lot I don’t know about these numbers and no one at Axios bothered to do much in the way of scrutinizing Trump’s claim. Which agency is reporting these numbers? Is this a coordinated data dump from multiple agencies? Are these adult arrests, juvenile arrests, or both? Do these figures include the Metropolitan Police Department’s own arrest tallies during that period? Does “212” reflect the number of defendants or the number of arrest charges? Because that’s how the MPD tabulates its own arrest statistics. Speaking of, in the same time period in 2024, the MPD made 596 adult arrests.

Crime statistics can be treacherous waters in which to wade; in my experience the lack of consistency and the eminent cherry-pick-ability of them is fodder for crime fearmongers to beat their drum. Moreover, as my colleague Matt Ford pointed out to me, arrest statistics can be unreliable because they are more reflective of law enforcement priorities than they are of actual criminal activity. But that suggests there is a ripe avenue for curious reporters: Find out from the administration what their priorities are. Make them stake a specific claim about what they want to achieve and then hold them accountable.

By all outward appearances, Trump’s crime crackdown priorities seem odd. As The New York Times reported this week, most of the troops that have been sent to D.C. are aimlessly wandering around “the National Mall, large monuments and other tourist-heavy areas,” as well as “metro stations, most of which are also near tourist and entertainment sites.” These patrols aren’t exactly taking place in the mean streets, folks.

The big accomplishment of this deployment seems to be a big uptick in the number of selfies tourists are taking with troops. The other achievement is public displays of ridiculousness: My former New Republic colleague Prem Thakker spent Wednesday morning at the Columbia Heights metro station witnessing a farce as various troops and cops rode the escalators up and down and back again, only to eventually nab a single alleged fare evader. Those who think Trump is in the right should probably explain how these activities will achieve a lower crime rate than city officials were managing themselves.

But it’s not all so benign. Gangs of vaguely identified pseudo-cops are brazenly beating up people in the street, in a manner that The New Republics Melissa Gira Grant likens to the violent exploits of the Proud Boys. The occupying forces are carrying out a sadistic campaign against the city’s homeless population. And beneath it all, the city is being subjected to the mother of all ICE raids, with unidentifiable agents snatching food deliverers off the street (one GrubHub driver was rammed by a police car while making a delivery on his moped) and swarming local churches, grocery stores, and daycare centers. That’s certainly a lot of activity, but those who’ve criticized the city’s own approach to law and order should explain what’s being achieved.

Proponents of Trump’s intervention should also explain whether or not what D.C. needed was a swift kick to the local hospitality economy. While the Trump administration has recently tried to claim that restaurant reservations are “up 30 percent” since the takeover, this is a lie. As The Washington Post reported this week, “Restaurant reservations have dropped in the city by as much as 31 percent year over year for a single day,” since Trump kicked off his military takeover, and “business owners are concerned that the continued surge in law enforcement could impact their revenue during a vital period of the summer.” For everyone who pooh-poohed the Democrats who wielded actual facts about crime in D.C., please enlighten me: Is this good? Are these the results we wanted?

You can absolutely mark me down as extremely skeptical that Trump’s interventions are going to reduce crime in D.C. As always, I’m prepared to be wrong. Can the same be said of the pundits who’ve criticized anyone who dares use facts to question Trump’s fearmongering on crime?

Earlier this month, I brought you the good news that Democrats were developing a concept of a plan for their upcoming midterm campaign, having spent the first half of the year on a concentrated strategy of sitting back and letting Republicans screw things up. The precipitating event for the change of heart, according to reports, was the passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I guess was the trap that Democrats were hoping to spring. Well, as if to confirm that the game is, finally, afoot, James Carville—the chief advocate of his party’s “roll over and play dead” strategy—is calling for a big shift, in a recent op-ed in The New York Times.

To my surprise, there is merit to be found in his proposed line of attack. But it’s sandwiched between a confused read of the political landscape and a rather limp call to action that really fails to contemplate the real harms that Trump’s legislation is about to unleash. For this garden to bear fruit, we need to do some weeding.

As is their wont, the minders of the rubber room in which New York Times opinion pieces are formed did permit Carville to spend several paragraphs throat-clearing about how the Democrats are “constipated” and “leaderless”—which, you know, shouldn’t bother someone who advised them to do nothing for six months, anyway. He also seems weirdly panicked at the fact that Zohran Mamdani won his party’s nomination for the upcoming New York mayoral election, which to Carville represents “an undeniable fissure in our political soul.” To my mind, our political soul would be more gravely imperiled had serial sex pest Andrew Cuomo won the nomination, but it’s always interesting to learn about what elite Democrats and their favorite newspaper editors are prepared to forgive.

After this simultaneously overwrought and underbaked beginning, we finally arrive at Carville’s big idea: Democrats should let Trump “rope-a-dope with MAGA on the Jeffrey Epstein case” without “get[ting] in the way” and instead train their fire on the depredations of Trump’s budget bill.

Now, I come from a controversial school of thought that holds that a political party can, and even should, do two things at once. But I’m willing to concede that the Epstein matter has become something of a perpetual motion machine, with Trump’s own actions being the strongest force keeping this hurdy-gurdy spinning. It is also the precise kind of story—salacious, wicked, and conspiratorial—that our cynical political media doesn’t need outside encouragement to cover. As always, Democrats should take note of what it is the political press wants to spend its time covering and do more to provide low-minded fodder for partisan conflict.

But Carville is very much on point where one vital matter is concerned: This is a phenomenally favorable environment to wage war on Trump’s signature law. Carville cites a July 16 CNN poll that found that a majority of respondents oppose the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, 61–39 percent, and expect it to hurt the economy, 51–29 percent.

What can I say? The public basically has it correct. Taken as a whole, we have strong evidence that there is fertile terrain to wage a maximal battle against Trump on this issue. So it’s puzzling that Carville’s clarion call to action is so oddly muted—and so fundamentally illogical:

Our midterm march starts with a simple phrase every candidate can blast on every screen and stage: We demand a repeal. A repeal of Mr. Trump’s spending law is the one word that should define the midterms. It is clear, forceful and full-throated. It must be slathered across every poster, every ad, every social media post from now until November 2026. That single word is our core message. Every Democrat can run on it, with outrage directed not at the president or a person but at this disastrous bill. And the reasons are countless, each one a venom-tipped political dagger.

I am really struggling to understand how we’ve landed at “We demand a repeal.” In the first place, are Democrats … not planning on winning the midterm elections? I thought the goal here was to take back both houses of Congress, in which case they wouldn’t need to demand a repeal from anyone, they could simply—you know—pass their own bills to repeal things and then demand the president sign them. Which Trump wouldn’t do, of course, but hopefully Democrats understand that the goal here would be to use politics to cross-pressure vulnerable Republicans and construct an anti-GOP electoral majority, not expect Trump to give in to their demands. Republicans spent the Obama years trying to send Obamacare repeals to his desk, not because they thought he’d sign them but because doing so helped reaffirm their commitment with their base.

At any rate, “Demand a repeal” is strained and supine—it suggests that you’re either not planning on using your power to fight or you somehow still intend to attempt bipartisan collaboration once you gain back power. A clearer and more full-throated campaign message would be, “Not only will we repeal this bill, we will pass bills to undo the damage done to the government, we will fight to get the civil service rehired, and we will crush the corrupt thieves who stole your wealth and health care.”

And they shouldn’t stop there. Democrats need to contend with what the One Big Beautiful law will do—and it’s not clear that Carville, at any rate, is prepared to do that. Yes, the law, as Carville suggests, filches wealth from the American people in a thousand different ways, but he fails to connect the all-important dots as to where that money is actually going. Beyond the usual, bog-standard creation of yet another taxpayer-funded slush-fund for oligarchs, Trump’s law is a massive transfer of wealth from the American people to fund a domestic deportation army and construct a nationwide network of concentration camps.

Phenomenal sums of money are already changing hands. The law allocates $8 billion to ICE to go on a massive hiring spree, for which the agency is offering $50,000 signing bonuses. This week, an eye-popping Bloomberg story reported that the Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics Company was awarded a $1.26 billion contract to build another detention facility in Texas. Prior to winning that contract, the firm had collected a mere $29 million in Defense Department contracts. And the fact that the company “doesn’t appear to have any experience with detention” was no impediment to its receiving this windfall.

The law is not merely greedy; it’s not merely cruel. What Trump is doing is nefarious. Needless to say, I’m troubled by Carville’s omission of the way this one law furthers and funds what can only be called the president’s fascistic designs for our country’s future. And I’m troubled by the feeling that Democrats—who are far from great on the issues of immigration and asylum—may try to duck this fight.

Democrats are notoriously conflict-averse, and I worry that they’re still intimidated by Trump’s alleged mastery of the immigration issue. But the biggest reason to take this fight to Trump is that Trump doesn’t think Democrats have the heart for it. As Brian Beutler recently noted, Trump is “betting that grappling with a giant, masked right-wing police force and a multistate immigrant gulag will tear Dems apart if they ever retake power.” Anyone authentically concerned with “undeniable fissures” in the Democrats’ “political soul,” as Carville purports to be, needs to make sure Trump loses this bet.

The first six months of Donald Trump’s second presidency have been a master class in what he truly excels at: wanton misrule. With an absence of adult minders and a determination to run roughshod over all of the democratic guardrails that have historically only been propped up by a fealty to norms and the waning spirit of fair play in Washington, Trump has moved fast and broken the government, put the economy into trauma with his constantly shifting tariff demands, perpetrated the deaths of HIV-infected children abroad, and cut the ribbon on a spanking new concentration camp in Florida.

These first six months have also featured a Democratic Party that has done what it does best: kept its stockpile of powder nice and dry. While some Democratic electeds have broken from the herd (often to the disdain of Democratic leadership) to confront Trump and his Republican minions, the party’s age-old theory of how political change happens—wait for the GOP to screw up—has remained in effect. Though now, with the passage of Trump’s big new “kick people off health care and funnel the money into an American Gestapo Act of 2025,” it looks like Democrats finally have their quarry right where they want them.

Or … almost? As it turns out, Democrats are planning to take on the GOP—in a few weeks, anyway. “House Democrats are plotting to turn the August recess into the opening salvo of the midterms, including through town halls and organizing programs,” reports Politico, as the party is experiencing “renewed bravado after months in the political wilderness.” And to think that all it took for Democrats to exit this self-imposed exile was Trump getting everything he wanted.

But come on, feel the bravado, folks. Maine’s centrist weirdo Representative Jared Golden, who is part of a group of Democrats who’ve lately decided that swearing more often makes them look edgy, shows up in the same Politico piece, bragging, “There’s almost nothing about this bill that I’m going [to] have a hard time explaining to the district. This is a giant tax giveaway to wealthy people. Everyone fucking knows it.” Can confirm! The New Republic has been covering this bill rather relentlessly over the past few months, which raises an uncomfortable question: What was stopping Golden from explaining this to his district at any point during the legislative meanderings of this bill? (Perhaps Golden, the most Trump-curious member of the Democratic caucus, was weighing whether to vote with the Republicans, as he has in the past.)

If there’s one thing that Democrats do seem committed to, it’s their August timetable for finally unleashing the spittin’, cussin’, new-look party to officially open the midterm election campaign. Over the past weekend, as Texans faced the now-familiar tragedy of mass casualties from devastating floods, House minority leader and energy vampire Hakeem Jeffries found it premature to go on an attack. Instead, he joined the Sunday morning talk show idiot parade to express his firm hope that Democrats might work productively with the party that’s hell-bent on destroying the government and wiping climate change from our brains: “I think we are going to have to figure out what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again? And so the question of readiness is certainly something that Congress should be able to explore in a bipartisan way, particularly as we head into a summer where we can expect intensifying extreme weather events.”

It’s hard to fathom a Democratic leader speaking these words aloud in July of 2025. In the first place, the hows and whys of this flood should be glitteringly apparent: Trump’s executive branch misrule has led to cuts in the programs and personnel that keep people safe from these disasters, his shell of a disaster-response agency was slowed by Kristi Noem’s penny-pinching and is (as of this writing) “slow-walking the response,” and the federal government’s weather resources are being sold to his cronies. There is also ample evidence of Republican misrule closer to home, from a Republican governor who keeps presiding over these needless disasters to local officials who passed on funding a more robust emergency system so they could score partisan political points. Meanwhile, the GOP’s commitment to the promulgation of deranged conspiracy theories has the MAGA faithful engaging in the sorts of crimes that might cause the next disaster.

Therefore, the question of “How do we stop this tragedy from happening again?” has a pretty clear and obvious answer: Drive Republicans out of office. And that, I’m sorry to say, precludes the possibility of working arm-in-arm with the members of this criminal syndicate to solve the problems of the world. The scores who perished in these Texas floods deserve the finest politicization-of-their-deaths that the Democrats can muster: Take the cheapest shot, force Trump and his lackeys to defend themselves, shred their defense to pieces by demanding more and better, and then reload for the next disaster, which under Trump, as we know, will always be soon in arriving.

I agree with The New Republic’s editor Michael Tomasky that Trump’s murderous new piece of legislation will reveal how cruel and stupid the Republicans have become; how could it not? But the GOP has a distinct advantage over Democrats not just because they, as Tomasky correctly points out, have “a multibillion-dollar propaganda machine that will see to it that [their] vast audience never learns the truth about the impacts of this bill”; they are also vastly better at playing the media game with outlets outside their immediate control, where they are quicker to the punch and more relentless in bringing controversy and conflict to market. It would be a good idea to follow Delaware Representative Sarah McBride’s lead and start referring to the future Medicaid cuts as “Trumpcare.”

Until these widening strategic gaps start to close, I wouldn’t put my faith behind the belief that Trumpism will discredit itself. It’s not enough to simply vote against Trump’s bad ideas—though that is mandatory. You have to engage in full-frontal war with the GOP, relentlessly force them to defend themselves, find a way to blame them for everything that goes wrong, and use your available resources and expertise to help those who will be harmed by the GOP’s policies. This is the time for Democrats to get a lot less civil.

To bide one’s time in the hopes that a more favorable political environment might emerge is malpractice—because while you’re waiting, people are getting crushed economically and snatched off the street by masked paramilitary thugs. And to pretend that you have a productive relationship with the GOP on any level, as Jeffries asserted in the wake of more deaths by Republican hands, is simply brain-dead. I’m pleased as punch to know that in a few weeks’ time, the Democrats will supposedly be firing their powder. I hope to see some real pyrotechnics at last.

Zohran Mamdani’s decisive victory in Tuesday night’s Democratic mayoral primary in New York City is the latest event heralding the potential end of what we frequently refer to as “politics as usual.” Disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo, the candidate of Big Cynicism and the broken status quo, naturally collected the biggest piles of billionaire boodle and got The New York Times edit board to hand him a sideways endorsement after they vowed to abjure such activities. We’re used to such advantages proving decisive, so Mamdani’s rocket ride through the early returns and Cuomo’s swift concession were stunning developments. It’s not every day that Michael Bloomberg, Andrew Cuomo, Bill Ackman, and The New York Times all get pantsed at the same time.

Mamdani’s true upset—he trailed Cuomo in all but a couple of polls—has given bloom to myriad “What It All Really Means” analyses in the political press. But I think it would be wrong to let the moment pass without shining a light on one of Tuesday’s also-rans: Brad Lander. The New York City comptroller may have finished third behind Mamdani and Cuomo, but during the latter half of this month he has played a pivotal role in American politics and been a warrior for his party, as he helped to elevate Mamdani while also putting a thumb in the eye of the two most venal politicians in America: Cuomo and Donald Trump.

It’s hard to imagine Mamdani putting Cuomo’s comeback bid to bed without Lander’s assistance. But you don’t have to take my word for it. Mamdani adviser Morris Katz put it best Tuesday night: “Hard to tell the story of the Election Day results without [Brad Lander,] who went all out in the closing 10 days, defending Zohran, spending nearly half a million dollars attacking Cuomo, and building momentum that could not be overcome.” You can also hear the appreciation among Mamdani’s voters, who gave Lander a hero’s welcome when he arrived at the newly crowned nominee’s watch party last night.

It’s not every day a defeated candidate walks into the winner’s campaign celebration and receives such acclaim. But two weeks ago, when Mamdani and Lander cross-endorsed each other—that is, urged their supporters to rank their rival second on the ballot to take advantage of the primary’s ranked-choice vote system—it felt like the ground was starting to shift. The pair’s affable, charming cross-endorsement video was a soothing balm to what had been a bruising war with Cuomo. Instead of cynicism, voters got to see something that looked more like a budding bromance. This is what ranked choice is meant, in part, to accomplish.

Obviously, it helped immensely that Lander, who is Jewish and a self-proclaimed Zionist, had this genial relationship with Mamdani as attacks from Cuomo-aligned super PACs amped up their anti-Muslim rhetoric in the final press of the primary campaign. It also helped that Lander was willing to lustily deride Cuomo all campaign long, frequently in defense of his fellow (non-Cuomo) nominees.

But Lander’s most important political actions in this past week had little to do with the mayoral election and more to do with the people he has worked tirelessly to serve—which brought him into direct conflict with the Trump administration when he was arrested and detained by ICE while accompanying a defendant out of an immigration court. Lander had, by then, quietly made it a habit to help defendants get into and out of the courtroom. That he had not bragged about this humble service to New York’s most vulnerable residents helped cement his integrity, and that he was taking these kinds of risks while running for office highlighted his courage. (Upon his release, he held a press conference joined by other mayoral candidates and took another jab at Cuomo for not being there.)

Most importantly, Lander joined a small pantheon of Democrats—including Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, California Senator Alex Padilla, and others—putting themselves in direct confrontation with Trump’s mass deportation policies. As I noted two weeks ago, conflict with Trump is inevitable and Democrats need to be more ready, willing, and able to get confrontational with the administration. And as Brian Beutler recently observed, Democrats’ willingness to fight seems to have a real yo-yo effect on Trump’s numbers. At the peak of the party’s confrontation over Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s wrongful arrest and remanding, Beutler writes, “Democrats dragged Trump’s immigration approval underwater. Instead of viewing their quick success as an invitation to continue pressing their advantage, they viewed it as the perfect time to quit while they were ahead. Once they relented, though, Trump’s numbers floated back up.”

Over the course of the last two weeks, which featured nationwide anti-ICE protests and the arrests of Padilla and Lander, Trump has lost considerable ground—so much so that CNN data maven Harry Enten recently declared, “I think we can say that Donald Trump has lost the political battle when it comes to what has happened out in Los Angeles.” Even if the confrontational tactics of Democrats like Lander aren’t directly pushing these numbers down, the fact that Trump is so underwater on what the punditocracy presumed would be his best issue in perpetuity should only embolden Democrats to keep bringing the fight to Trump and his minions. Moreover, what Lander’s derring-do shows is that you don’t have to file lawsuits or pass bills—you don’t even have to win elections—to play a vital role in the anti-Trump resistance.

Where Lander goes from here is anyone’s guess. There may be opportunities for him to lend his considerable skills to a prospective Mamdani administration, but he could also set his sights higher. He’d be a good look—and a great leader—for Democrats aiming to take back the House of Representatives. Should he want to bide his time, the 2028 cycle offers the possibility of a Senate run, where he’d be a massive improvement over Chuck Schumer, whose weak-kneed approach to confronting Trump leaves him unsuited for the moment.

At the root of all of Lander’s recent newsmaking are qualities that are often so hard to come by in the average politician. His willingness to put bigger matters ahead of his own near-term political aspirations cuts a huge contrast with Democratic members who grab political office only to play it safe and, in so doing, boost the broken status quo. But what’s truly refreshing is Lander’s innate understanding of this political moment. In a statement to Politico after the election, he said, “I don’t think the line right now is between progressives and moderates. I think the line is between fighters and fakers.” By all means, let’s get this man to his next fight.

In the end, I was only on hold with the Trump Mobile customer service line for about 13 minutes. I’d been offered the opportunity to simply leave a number for an agent to call me back, due to “unprecedented demand,” but my extreme reluctance to give anyone affiliated with the president my contact information left me listening to a limp jazz instrumental loop for what I felt was a perfectly precedented amount of time. Maybe there is a massive number of people ready to ditch their wireless provider and follow the president on this new venture, but I’ve honestly been on hold with CVS longer.

Once on the phone with an agent, I was quick to learn that this new side hustle was at least refreshingly free of Donald Trump’s signature bombast. There was no braggadocio; no outrageous claims being made about the phone’s capabilities. Instead, I was treated to that other signature Trumpian quality: the unreadiness for prime time that those of us who lived through the Covid pandemic knew all too well. But this time, it also comes with the stink of self-dealing, if not outright corruption.

What is Trump Mobile? First and foremost, it’s a very gaudy, very gold-looking mobile device—most renderings show a screen emblazoned with the president’s name, an American flag, and the “Make America Great Again” motto. The exact model name is the “T1 Phone 8002,” and no, I don’t know why they’ve skipped “8001” but I wouldn’t be surprised if it all has something to do with obscure white-supremacist lore. The phone can allegedly be yours for $499 (they are taking $100 preorders). Trump Mobile is also a wireless service that you can join right now with your current device, if you’re so inclined, for—sigh— $47.45 a month.

The agent I spoke with wasn’t prepared to do a side-by-side comparison between the iPhone and Trump’s wares. (Strange because they were in many ways comparable—at least on paper.) She could tell me nothing about cloud storage. She knew the screen dimensions and the weight of the phone but could only add that “it looks like it had the standard thickness.” The Verge’s David Pierce (who calls the phone “bad and impossible”) reported that there was no processor listed on the website for the phone, and I was unable to get any clarification on this matter beyond the assurance that this was going to be an Android phone. Gen Z can rejoice, however, because Trump is bringing back headphone jacks.

Of course, the most important question was the one I asked first—and one she couldn’t answer: Where was this phone going to be made? After all, the major selling point of this whole enterprise is that the Trump phone was going to be made right here in America. Instead of cheerful affirmation, I got a long, suspicious pause followed by a plaintive, “I don’t know.” That’s fine. With Trump, it pays to be suspicious; you’d do well to keep yourself unassociated with his central claims. But the salient point is this: Even as he collapses the government, shreds the economy, and potentially takes us to war, the president is at all times expanding his scam empire.

My experience with Trump Mobile seems pretty typical—though I wasn’t willing to actually put my credit card at risk for journalism, sorry. The Washington Post’s Shira Ovide said that while Trump Mobile successfully charged her for joining Trump’s wireless service, it charged her more than the listed price and she hasn’t been able to use it yet. 404 Media’s Joseph Cox attempted to make a $100 down payment on the Trump phone itself (due to hit the market in September), only to be billed $64.70 and sent a cryptic confirmation email. “It is the worst experience I’ve ever faced buying a consumer electronic product and I have no idea whether or how I’ll receive the phone,” he wrote.

And experts, asked by CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal to weigh in on the likelihood that this phone will be made in the United States, respond with a resounding LOL. “There is no way the phone was designed from scratch, and there is no way it is going to be assembled in the U.S. or completely manufactured in the U.S.,” said one, adding, “That is completely impossible.” Says another, “The U.S. does not have local manufacturing capabilities readily available.” In fact, all signs point to the inconvenient truth that China’s vaunted manufacturing hubs will have to be involved.

If Trump has a magic power, it’s that no matter how much evidence you marshal in the service of letting the buyer beware, the president still manages to get fools to part with their money pretty regularly. Whether it’s for Trump steaks or the Trump presidency, the one constant is the multitudes willing to be his marks. Frankly, even Trump’s self-conception borders on the level of delusion necessary to con oneself. His own recollections of dealmaking derring-do, when probed, tend to reveal a disastrous self-pantsing.

But maybe the Trump phone is more than meets the eye. As Business Insider reported this week, Mark Cuban thinks that it has something to do with the Trump family’s emerging interests in cryptocurrency:

“I think the smart game they are probably playing is to put a crypto wallet on the phone that leverages WLF, $Trump, and their stable coins,” Cuban posted in response to the product launch. WLF is a reference to crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which is connected with the Trumps.

“Whatever transactions they can create [generate] fees for them, and there are so many ways to sell things and pre-load whatever they want,” he added.

Cuban may be onto something. Crypto has become the new, transcendent dimension of Trump’s scam empire. This week, Eric Trump announced that the family is planning to start “American Bitcoin,” a “company focused on Bitcoin mining, the business of running energy-guzzling machines to generate new coins.” Alongside Trump’s interest in WLF and his emoluments clause–busting memecoins, the president is now tightly entangled in what The New York Times refers to as a “business portfolio … fraught with conflicts of interest that have blurred the boundary between government and industry.”

Between his own up-to-the-gills involvement with the industry and his orders to have both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission effectively stand down on policing the industry, the president’s capacity for self-dealing and favor trading has reached steroidal new highs. As Harvard University’s go-to expert on authoritarian regimes Steven Levitsky told The Guardian this week, “I have never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere.”

Perhaps the most distressing thing about this is the extent to which Democrats are helping to further Trump’s ends. This week, 18 Senate Democrats helped pass the “GENIUS Act,” which is essentially the crypto industry’s version of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. As University of California-Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen describes at length, the GENIUS Act would bring widespread mayhem in the way it would grant “hundreds—perhaps even thousands—of American companies” the power to issue their own bespoke cryptocurrencies. “Imagine Walmart issuing a Walmartcoin, and Amazon doing the same with an Amazoncoin, enabling them to bypass the banking system and credit card networks,” he writes.

While the idea may seem dizzily postmodern, Eichengreen says that these proposed arrangements bear “an uncanny resemblance to the way America’s monetary system functioned from the mid-1830s until the Civil War,” when “bank failures, personal bankruptcies and financial instability” were part of daily life. “Lawmakers should think twice before passing this piece of legislation,” he writes. Whoops!

Trump might be the nation’s biggest problem right now, but the crypto industry ranks high on the list. As The New Republic’s Paige Oamek reported last September, Washington has lately been flooded with crypto cash: “Crypto companies spent over $121 million to sway elections during [the 2024 election] cycle,” she wrote. “By comparison, since the Citizens United ruling in 2010, the fossil fuel industry has collectively spent $176 million over 14 years of election cycles.”

With that kind of filthy lucre sloshing around, it’s not hard to buy off some Democrats. As The Lever reported this week, the crypto industry has purchased key allies, in the form of scheming strategists who’ve spun through the government-to-private-sector revolving door, now coaching Democratic lawmakers in the art of offering “symbolic anti-corruption amendments” knowing that they would, in the end, be “dead on arrival, since the language would likely be voted down by Republicans.” I suppose that in this way, Trump has done the impossible: He’s brought both parties together in a rare demonstration of bipartisan comity. Too bad, then, that it’s all in the furtherance of the president’s corrupt self-enrichment.

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.
During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.
The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,” said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. “Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.”

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.’’

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump’s immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion” at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters.

But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum.

“You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’

Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’

The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.

“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’

“You’re not welcome here”

Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.

“Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’

Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000.

“A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’

Some are already packing up.

In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders.

The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 forbidding the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard, ruling there was “no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Since then, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay Perry’s order blocking the National Guard’s deployment, with a three-judge panel writing in an opinion published Thursday that “political opposition is not rebellion.”

But the administration is continuing its insistence that Chicago-area protests against Trump’s immigration enforcement actions are far more violent than the accounts Perry relied upon in issuing her two-week temporary restraining order. The order is set to expire on Thursday, Oct. 23, though Perry has scheduled a hearing the day before on a possible extension.

Sauer wrote that continued delays in deploying guardsmen to protect federal immigration agents and property from “rioters” puts agents’ lives at risk. He cited incidents of slashed tires on vehicles belonging to Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and alleged protesters have aimed fireworks at agents “and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

The filing accused Perry of having “disregarded outright the evidence of violence proffered by federal officials” and “instead accepting the implausibly rosy assessment of state and local officials,” which he called “indefensible.”

Perry was appointed to the bench last year after former President Joe Biden’s previous attempt to appoint her U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois was blocked in the Senate by now-Vice President J.D. Vance.

The judge last week said the DOJ’s arguments — particularly its characterization of the protests she noted had never exceeded 200 people outside the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview — seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She also gave credence to allegations that agents were often the aggressors in clashes with protesters and predicted that deploying the National Guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

But on Friday, Sauer shot back that the judge’s ruling was part of “a disturbing and recurring pattern” that follows similar cases in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon.

In his telling, protestors in those Democratic strongholds put immigration agents at risk and obstructed their work while local law enforcement offered only “tepid support,” prompting the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard for the protection of agents and federal property. Sauer decried local federal judges’ rulings against the Trump administration after “local political leaders” filed lawsuits.

“The district court then issues an opinion granting injunctive relief against the President’s action that downplays or denies the ongoing threat to the lives and safety of federal agents, substitutes the court’s own judgment for the President’s about the need for military augmentation, and gives little or no weight to the United States’ interest in enforcing federal immigration law,” he wrote.

They erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they police.
The Trump administration’s crackdown in Chicago is also a reminder that only Congress can permanently fix our immigration system.
Lawmakers should reform our asylum system, which hasn’t been meaningfully updated in decades, so that it works quickly, fairly and with finality.
What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.","When it comes to fixing our immigration system, Democrats and Republicans in Congress both need to admit where they have been wrong. This includes acknowledging that for decades, both parties ignored the main problem: the cartels that have made billions of dollars smuggling people, drugs and weapons into the United States.

Democrats must concede that Donald Trump was right about the importance of securing the border. He was right about the need to create a joint task force — involving multiple government departments, agencies and military branches — to fight the cartels. And he was right about the need to deport violent criminals who are in this country illegally.

But Republicans have to realize that the Trump administration risks squandering the progress it has made by conducting raids on workplaces and neighborhoods throughout the country, such as the disastrous crackdown it began five weeks ago in Chicago. These raids — rounding up people who often have lived here for decades, raised families, held jobs and committed no crimes beyond lacking proper documentation — are economically unwise, socially destructive and morally wrong.

The raids remove workers from businesses that rely on them. They erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they police. And they separate families.

While Democrats must denounce these raids, we do need a crackdown — on the cartels. The cartels and the human traffickers known as coyotes who work for them teach migrants to exploit loopholes in our immigration law and deliberately overwhelm our asylum system. In the chaos, they smuggle drugs, traffic people and expand their grip on both sides of the border.

I recently visited the southern border in Arizona with a bipartisan group of fellow U.S. representatives. We met with immigration officials, law enforcement officers, Border Patrol agents and intelligence officers, all of whom issued the same warning: Though the border is officially closed to asylum seekers between the ports of entry, the cartels and coyotes are still hard at work, spreading false promises and luring families north.

The cartels are well organized, well funded, tech-savvy transnational enterprises. Fighting them at the border requires investing in drones, movement sensors, physical barriers and rapid-response units. It requires continuing to support the joint task force that is working to disrupt their financial networks and their leadership. It requires using law enforcement resources wisely: Every federal officer who is focused on arresting a farmhand, factory worker or landscaper could be better used to fight the cartels.

The Trump administration’s crackdown in Chicago is also a reminder that only Congress can permanently fix our immigration system. It cannot be done by executive orders, presidential decrees, lawsuits or agency directives. One president can issue an order, the next can reverse it. Judges can block policies or gut them. Cabinet officials can change enforcement priorities overnight. That’s not real leadership; it’s political theater.

Instead, we need legislation — ideally bipartisan. Lawmakers should reform our asylum system, which hasn’t been meaningfully updated in decades, so that it works quickly, fairly and with finality. Legitimate claims should be honored; meritless ones should be resolved swiftly with deportation.

Lawmakers should also fix our guest worker programs and create earned legal status for longtime residents. The border needs to be secure, but children should not live in fear of losing their parents to a midnight raid and families that have built lives here deserve the chance to earn legal status.

These reforms would also reduce cartel profits, stabilize labor markets and give employers greater certainty.

Meaningful change requires that Republicans acknowledge the economic and humanitarian necessity of immigration and that Democrats grant the necessity of secure borders and the deportation of violent offenders. Neither open borders nor mass deportation is a serious solution. What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19suozzi-mfjc/19suozzi-mfjc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 09:01:53.947046

The big picture: Previously relegated to niche online communities like the HistoryMemes Reddit, the Third Amendment is receiving almost as much attention as its big siblings, the First and Second Amendments.

Context: The Third Amendment prohibits the forcible housing of the military in a civilians' house during peacetime, and requires any change to that status to be codified by law during times of war.

""She didn't ask for a meeting. She asked to use the restroom. This is insane.""

""These types of communication channels are extremely effective. It just depends on the person that's using them.""

Zoom in: The memes keep coming. Users have remarked how they never expected to need their knowledge of the Third Amendment from history classes, and apologized to the Founding Fathers for not seeing their vision.

At the end of a secluded, winding road in Laredo, Texas, sits the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office. For nearly two decades, Stern has investigated the deaths of immigrants attempting to cross into the United States illegally.

On a hot summer day, less than 24 hours after a woman attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, her body arrived at Stern’s office – the first dead border crosser in weeks.

The Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office has reported a nearly 97% decrease in migrant deaths since 2021, a trend she attributes to Trump's federal anti-immigration policies. Nineteen border crossers have lain on Stern’s autopsy table so far this year.

“Today, we might get a call, it's been maybe once every three weeks,” Stern said. “This year, the numbers just plummeted.”

That’s compared to 77 deaths in her jurisdiction last year – a stark contrast from 2021 at the height of the migrant surge when she recorded nearly 300 deaths.

“We would get multiple calls a week and sometimes multiple calls a day,” Stern recalled.

Webb County is the sixth-largest county in Texas by land, and covering it is no small task. From Stern’s office, it can take more than two hours to reach the furthest point. Her coverage area also spans 10 other counties across hundreds of miles.

June through September are typically the busiest months, as many crossers die from heatstroke on their journey by foot in triple-digit temperatures and desert-like terrain. The woman who lay on Stern’s autopsy table on Aug. 13 was “markedly dehydrated” and died of hyperthermia.

Stern’s job is unique in that a large number of her patients are unauthorized immigrants, many dying from heat stroke or drowning while attempting to cross the Rio Grande River.

“Because I work down here on the border, a great percentage of my patients are those individuals that die in their attempts to cross the border between Mexico and the United States,” she said.

Although many die from hyperthermia, and others drown while attempting to swim across the Rio Grande River, Stern still conducts an autopsy to determine the cause of death correctly. For women, she checks the reproductive organs to see if she was pregnant. If a dead border crosser was carrying a child at the time of her death, authorities could charge the “coyote” (a person who helps smuggle migrants in exchange for payment) with two counts of murder instead of one.

The woman in Stern’s autopsy room was not pregnant.

Life at the Border: Living Among Law Enforcement

The data show a significant drop in illegal immigration, but numbers don’t tell the complete story about Laredo.

With a 95% Hispanic population, the “Gateway City” is 150 miles from the nearest big city, San Antonio.

Known to outsiders as the United States’ largest inland port of entry, with tens of thousands of semi-trucks passing through with cargo daily, Laredo is largely known to its residents as “safe” and “community-oriented.”

Despite the grim realities of migrant deaths, Laredo was named one of the safest U.S. cities last year by WalletHub. Immigration remains a part of daily life here.

“I love life on the border. Laredo is my home,” Stern said. “It’s one of the safest cities in the country, and I think part of the reason is we have so many boots on the ground.”

At any given moment, Border Patrol cars patrol the city roads and station themselves along the river where city parks are also located. Although Laredo residents are all too familiar with seeing Border Patrol vehicles, some say they’ve noticed an increased presence.

The agents are also locals, frequenting business owner Janet Zapata’s pizza shop, 550 Pizzeria, and other spots like coffee shop Borderland Espresso & Gifts.

Zapata said she’s noticed more agents in recent months, though their presence has been a part of daily life for many people’s entire lives in Laredo — a community where immigration is never far from conversation.

“We think about a lot of the changes that are happening, that are going to happen,” Zapata said.

One of the more noticeable changes is the installation of a military Stryker parked underneath the pedestrian bridge that connects Laredo to its sister city, Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The armored vehicle sits steps from the Rio Grande River and a city park.

Laredo Border Patrol Chief Jesse Muñoz said there is no militarization of the border, but instead, the vehicle is there in a “supportive role.”

“When I think of military militarization, you think they're coming to do military operations or military things on the border, and that's not the case,” Muñoz said. “They're here to help with border security.”

Public Information Officer Joe Baeza with the Laredo Police Department said this level of enforcement is more than what they’ve seen before.

However, Border Patrol emphasized that this is not a militarization of the border.

“I think we sent a message, and you know one thing is, I don't think the Border Patrol is anti-immigrants or anti-migration. We're anti-illegal immigration,” sector Chief Muñoz said.

Ashley N. Soriano is a bilingual multimedia journalist covering politics and immigration.

It lit up the media. Democrats and civil libertarians denounced the FCC chairman Brendan Carr for violating the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech. Voices on the right, including Senator Ted Cruz, joined them.

Within a week, Kimmel’s show was back on the air.

While bipartisan agreement may be rare, it’s not surprising that it came in defense of the First Amendment – and a popular TV show. A recent poll found that a whopping 90% of respondents called the First Amendment “vital,” while 64% believed it’s so close to perfection that they wouldn’t change a word.

In just 45 words, it bars Congress from establishing or preventing the free exercise of religion, interfering with the peoples’ right to assemble and petition, or abridging freedom of speech or the press.

I’m a historian and scholar of modern U.S. law and politics. Here’s the story of why this amendment – now considered fundamental to American freedom and identity – wasn’t part of the original Constitution and how it was included later on.

Added three years after the Constitution was ratified, it resulted from political compromise and a change of heart by framer James Madison.

Soured on bills of rights

Building a strong national government was the focus of Madison and the other delegates who met in Philadelphia in May 1787 to draft the Constitution.

They believed the government created by the Articles of Confederation after the colonists declared independence was dysfunctional, and the nation was disintegrating.

The government could not pay its debts, defend the frontier or protect commerce from interference by states and foreign governments.

Although Madison and the other framers aimed to create a stronger national government, they cared about protecting liberty. Many had helped create state constitutions that included pioneering bills of rights.

Madison himself played a critical role in securing passage in 1776 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a monument to civil liberties.

By the time the Constitutional Convention met, however, Madison had soured on such measures. During the 1780s, he had watched with alarm as state legislatures trampled on rights explicitly guaranteed by their constitutions. Bills of rights, he concluded, weren’t sufficient to protect rights.

So Madison and his colleagues put their faith in reinventing government.

No appetite to haggle

The Constitution they wrote created a government powerful enough to promote the national interests while maintaining a check on state legislatures. It also established a system of checks and balances that ensured federal power wasn’t abused.

In the convention’s waning days, delegates briefly discussed adding a bill of rights but unanimously decided against it. They had sweated through almost four months of a sweltering Philadelphia summer and were ready to go home. When Virginia’s John Rutledge noted “the extreme anxiety of many members of the Convention to bring the business to an end,” he was stating the obvious. With the Constitution in final form, few had the appetite to haggle over the provisions of a bill of rights.

That decision nearly proved fatal when the Constitution went to the states for ratification.

The new Constitution’s supporters, known as Federalists, faced fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists who charged that a powerful national government, unrestrained by a bill of rights, would inevitably lead to tyranny.

Ratification conventions in three of the most critical states – Massachusetts, New York and Virginia – were narrowly divided; ratification hung in the balance. Federalists resisted demands to make ratification contingent on amendments suggested by state conventions. But they agreed to add a bill of rights – after the Constitution was ratified and took effect.

That concession did the trick.

Harmless, possibly helpful

The three critical states ratified without condition, and by midsummer 1788, the Constitution had been approved.

However, when the First Congress met in March 1789, the Federalist majority didn’t prioritize a bill of rights. They had won and were ready to move on.

Madison, now a Federalist leader in the House of Representatives, insisted that his party keep its word. He warned that failure to do so would undermine trust in the new government and give Anti-Federalists ammunition to demand a new convention to do what Congress had left undone.

But Madison wasn’t just arguing for his party keeping its word. He had also changed his mind.

The ratification debates and Madison’s correspondence with Thomas Jefferson led him to think differently about a bill of rights. He now thought it harmless and possibly helpful. Its provisions, Madison conceded, might become “fundamental maxims of a free government” and part of “the national sentiment.” Broad popular support for a bill of rights might provide a check on government officials and how they wielded power.

Madison pushed his colleagues relentlessly. Wary of provisions that would weaken the national government, he developed a slate of amendments focused on individual rights. Ultimately, Congress approved 12 amendments – ensuring rights from freedom of speech to protection from cruel and unusual punishment – and sent them to the states for ratification.

First Amendment no cure-all

By the end of 1791, 10 of them – including the First Amendment ≠ had been ratified.

As Madison anticipated, the First Amendment wasn’t a cure for a government bent on suppressing dissent. From the Sedition Act in the 1790s to McCarthyism in the 1950s and the Trump administration’s assault on the First Amendment, government has used its awesome powers to pursue and punish critics.

On occasion, courts have intervened to protect First Amendment rights, a weapon Madison didn’t anticipate. But not always.

Perhaps the ultimate protection for First Amendment rights is “national sentiment,” as Madison suggested. Norm-breaking presidents can disregard the law, and judges may cave. But public sentiment is a powerful force, as Jimmy Kimmel can attest.

In State of Illinois v. Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed the scope of presidential authority to federalize and deploy National Guard forces under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 in response to protests surrounding federal immigration enforcement in Illinois. The dispute arose after President Trump, citing threats to federal agents and facilities during “Operation Midway Blitz,” ordered the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois over the Governor’s objection. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago sued, arguing the legal predicates for § 12406 were unmet and that the action violated the Tenth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act.

The district court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining both federalization and deployment. On expedited review, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the TRO was appealable, rejected the administration’s argument that the President’s § 12406 determinations are unreviewable, and—giving the President substantial deference on facts—held that the record did not satisfy § 12406’s predicates. The court denied a stay as to deployment but continued a stay of the portion of the TRO that had enjoined federalization, effectively allowing the federal government to maintain federal control of Guard members but forbidding their deployment within Illinois pending appeal.

The opinion establishes two key clarifications with broad significance: (1) presidential call-ups under § 12406 are judicially reviewable because the statute enumerates factual predicates; and (2) political protests, even disruptive and occasionally violent, do not amount to a “rebellion” within § 12406(2) absent organized, deliberate violent resistance to governmental authority. The court also found insufficient evidence that federal authorities were “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws” within the meaning of § 12406(3).

Summary of the Opinion

Appealability: The TRO was appealable because it bore the “hallmarks” of a preliminary injunction—an adversary hearing, extensive submissions, and thorough reasoning.

Reviewability: The President’s decision to federalize and deploy the National Guard under § 12406 is judicially reviewable; Martin v. Mott and Dalton v. Specter do not bar review of statutory predicates in this context.

Deference and Standard of Review: While the court affords the President “a great level of deference” to factual assessments in national security contexts, it reviews statutory meaning de novo and district court factfinding for clear error.

§ 12406(2) “Rebellion”: Political opposition and protest—even if organized, persistent, and marred by isolated unlawful incidents—does not constitute a “rebellion or danger of rebellion” absent organized violent resistance to governmental authority.

§ 12406(3) “Unable with the regular forces”: On this record, federal enforcement activities were continuing successfully; thus, even under a deferential “significant impediment” standard, the predicate was unmet.

Tenth Amendment: The state-sovereignty claim rises and falls with the statutory predicates; because those predicates are unmet on this record, deploying Guard troops over the state’s objection likely infringes Illinois’s Tenth Amendment interests.

Stay factors: The administration failed to show likelihood of success or irreparable harm outweighing the state’s sovereign injury. The court therefore denied a stay as to deployment but continued to stay the bar on federalization itself.

Disposition: Motion to stay pending appeal granted in part and denied in part. The administration may keep the Guard federalized but may not deploy National Guard forces within Illinois pending appeal.

Factual and Procedural Background

Operation Midway Blitz (Sept. 8): The administration increased immigration enforcement in Illinois, focusing attention on ICE’s Broadview processing facility. Protests—longstanding but generally small—grew in size but typically remained under 200 persons, with occasional road closures and arrests.

Escalation and Response (late Sept.–Oct. 4): DHS requested troop support, and federal officials anticipated increased chemical agent use. Illinois formed a Unified Command and implemented designated protest areas. State and local law enforcement contained incidents without DHS intervention on several days; federal facilities remained open.

Federalization Orders (Oct. 4–5): The President invoked § 12406, asserting coordinated assaults impeded federal law enforcement and that regular forces were insufficient. Illinois objected. The Secretary of Defense federalized Guard troops, referencing threats and planned operations, including federalizing up to 400 Texas Guard members for deployment in Illinois and Oregon.

Government Messaging: DHS publicized the success of Operation Midway Blitz, noting increased arrests and deportations and that protests had not slowed ICE operations—facts the court later treated as undercutting “inability” claims.

District Court TRO (Oct. 9): Enjoined federalization and deployment for 14 days; found neither the “rebellion” nor “inability” predicates met; gave limited credit to federal declarants where contradicted by objective evidence and state/local accounts.

Seventh Circuit Administrative Stay: Allowed Guard members to remain under federal control but blocked deployment while considering the stay motion; final stay ruling continues that arrangement pending appeal.

Analysis

Precedents Cited and Their Influence

Martin v. Mott, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 19 (1827): The administration invoked Martin to argue the President’s call-up determinations are conclusive. The Seventh Circuit distinguished Martin as addressing subordinate officers’ obligation to obey orders in wartime invasion, not whether courts may review if statutory predicates exist in peacetime domestic operations. Thus, Martin does not preclude judicial review here.

Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994): Dalton’s bar on reviewing actions “committed to the discretion of the President” did not apply because § 12406 enumerates specific, reviewable predicates and does not make the President the sole judge of their existence.

Newsom v. Trump, 141 F.4th 1032 (9th Cir. 2025): The Seventh Circuit aligned with the Ninth Circuit that § 12406 decisions are reviewable and that courts should afford “a great level of deference” to presidential factfinding. It noted—but did not adopt or reject—the Ninth Circuit’s interpretations that “unable” means “significantly impeded” and “regular forces” means federal officers.

Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932): Cited to show executive discretion in deploying military forces is given a “permitted range of honest judgment,” but courts still review whether underlying conditions legally justify deployment.

Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981): Support the notion that courts defer to the political branches’ national security factfinding but ultimately retain their role in statutory interpretation.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024): Emphasized that interpretation of statutes is “precisely the business of the judiciary,” underscoring the court’s independent role in defining § 12406’s terms.

Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. 650 (2025) (per curiam); Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579 (2018); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974): Provided the framework for treating a TRO as appealable when it bears the hallmarks of a preliminary injunction.

Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009); Camelot Banquet Rooms, Inc. v. SBA, 14 F.4th 624 (7th Cir. 2021): Articulated the stay factors applied by the court.

United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000): Reinforced that general police powers reside with the states, a background principle informing the Tenth Amendment analysis.

Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300 (7th Cir. 1978): Recognized that violations of constitutional rights, including state sovereignty interests, constitute irreparable harm.

Legal Reasoning

1) Judicial Review of § 12406 Actions

The court held that because § 12406 enumerates specific triggering conditions—(1) invasion, (2) rebellion or danger of rebellion, or (3) inability to execute federal law with the regular forces—the President’s invocation is judicially reviewable. Nothing in the text renders the President the sole, unreviewable judge of those predicates. Martin v. Mott and Dalton v. Specter do not foreclose judicial review in this context.

2) Deference to Executive Factfinding; Standards of Review

The court granted “a great level of deference” to the President’s factual assessments in national security matters. Still, it reviewed statutory interpretation de novo. On the preliminary record, the district court’s factfinding—crediting state and local declarations and objective evidence over federal declarants the court found omitted material information—was not clearly erroneous. That factual backdrop drove the statutory analysis.

3) Defining “Rebellion” Under § 12406(2)

The Seventh Circuit substantially endorsed the district court’s approach in Newsom: a “rebellion” entails organized, deliberate violent resistance to governmental authority, often avowed and aimed against the government as a whole, not mere opposition to a single law or policy. The court emphasized:

“Political opposition is not rebellion.”

Protests—even organized, sustained, and accompanied by civil disobedience or sporadic unlawful incidents—do not become a rebellion.

Isolated violence by rogue participants falls within the space between protected speech and rebellion; it does not suffice to trigger § 12406(2).

Applying this understanding to the record—including small-to-moderate gatherings, episodic arrests, effective containment by state/local authorities, and continuing federal operations—the court found insufficient evidence of an actual or threatened rebellion.

4) “Unable with the Regular Forces to Execute the Laws” Under § 12406(3)

The court did not definitively resolve two interpretive disputes: whether “unable” means “significantly impeded” (Ninth Circuit’s view) or “incapable” (district court), and whether “regular forces” means federal officers broadly (Ninth Circuit) or the regular armed forces. The Seventh Circuit held that, under either understanding, the record showed continued and successful immigration enforcement:

Federal facilities remained open and operational despite protests.

State and local Unified Command effectively contained disruptions; DHS intervention was not required on key dates.

DHS and ICE publicly touted enforcement successes and increased arrests, undermining any claim of “inability.”

Accordingly, § 12406(3)’s predicate was not met on this record.

5) Tenth Amendment Considerations

Because Congress has constitutional authority to provide for calling forth the militia (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 15), the Tenth Amendment question tracks whether § 12406’s predicates are satisfied. On this record they were not, making deployment over the state’s objection a likely violation of Illinois’s reserved sovereignty interests. The court gave particular weight to the proposed deployment of out-of-state Guard units (e.g., Texas) into Illinois, heightening the sovereignty injury.

6) Stay Factors: Balancing Equities and Public Interest

The administration failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm absent a stay. By contrast, the state faced irreparable sovereign injury from unlawful deployment. The public interest favored avoiding unnecessary military presence in domestic policing. However, the court considered the harm from allowing temporary federalization (without deployment) relatively minimal at this stage and thus continued to stay the TRO’s bar on federalization while maintaining the bar on deployment.

Impact

Judicial Review Cemented: The decision solidifies that § 12406 invocations are reviewable and not committed to unreviewable presidential discretion. This aligns with the Ninth Circuit and sets the stage for consistent nationwide treatment unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Meaningful Limitation on “Rebellion”: By clarifying that political protest—even disruptive and occasionally violent—is not a “rebellion” without organized violent resistance to governmental authority, the court places a high bar on using § 12406(2) to federalize and deploy Guard forces in response to domestic dissent.

Evidence Matters for “Inability”: Government messaging that enforcement is proceeding apace can undercut claims of inability under § 12406(3). Agencies invoking § 12406 must curate a consistent evidentiary record of actual impediment or incapacity—mere inconvenience or episodic disruption will not suffice.

State Sovereignty Emphasized: Deployment of federalized Guard into a state over the Governor’s objection, especially involving out-of-state Guard units, poses severe Tenth Amendment concerns that courts will treat as irreparable harm in equitable balancing.

Remedial Middle Path: The court’s interim remedy—allowing federalization while forbidding deployment—offers a pragmatic template in fast-moving crises, preserving federal command arrangements while preventing premature military use on the streets absent lawful predicates.

Convergence with, Yet Distinction from, the Ninth Circuit: The Seventh Circuit sidestepped resolving contested definitions of “unable” and “regular forces,” holding the government lost even under the Ninth Circuit’s more government-friendly readings. This minimizes circuit conflict for now but leaves doctrinal questions open.

Signals for Future Litigation: The opinion’s careful parsing of “rebellion” and “inability,” its reliance on objective, local-law-enforcement evidence, and its attention to agency press releases will inform both executive-branch decision-making and state litigation strategies in any future domestic deployments.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Federalization vs. Deployment:

Federalization (Title 10 status): National Guard members come under federal command and become part of the U.S. armed forces. They are subject to federal law and restrictions (including the Posse Comitatus Act).

Deployment: Actual use of those federalized forces for missions, here proposed for domestic protection of federal agents/facilities in Illinois.

10 U.S.C. § 12406 (Call of the National Guard into Federal Service): Authorizes presidential call-up of National Guard in limited circumstances—(1) invasion, (2) rebellion/danger thereof, (3) inability to execute federal laws with regular forces.

“Regular forces”: The statute’s phrase is debated. Some courts read it as including federal law enforcement officers; others as limited to the regular armed forces. The Seventh Circuit left the question open in this posture.

Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385): Generally prohibits the Army and Air Force (and by policy, the Navy and Marine Corps) from participating in civilian law enforcement absent express authorization (e.g., the Insurrection Act). When Guard members are federalized (Title 10), PCA constraints apply to them.

Tenth Amendment and State Sovereignty: Reserves general police powers to the states. While Congress can authorize federal call-ups of militia, deploying federalized troops for domestic law enforcement over a state’s objection without meeting statutory predicates implicates state sovereignty and can be enjoined.

Standards on Emergency Relief:

Appealability of TROs: A TRO can be appealed if it has the practical features of a preliminary injunction (adversary hearing, thorough merits reasoning, etc.).

Stay Pending Appeal: Requires showing likelihood of success and irreparable harm; court then balances harms and considers the public interest.

Standards of Review: District court factfinding is reviewed for clear error; statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo; executive factfinding may receive deference, especially in national security contexts.

Insurrection Act vs. § 12406: The Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. §§ 251–255) authorizes use of active-duty military in limited circumstances (e.g., suppression of insurrection, enforcement of federal law when impracticable through ordinary means). Section 12406 pertains specifically to calling the National Guard into federal service. This case concerns § 12406, not the Insurrection Act.

What the Court Did Not Decide

It did not set a definitive test for “unable” or “regular forces” under § 12406(3); it held the administration failed even under the more lenient interpretations.

It did not reach or resolve the Posse Comitatus claim, because the statutory predicates for federalization/deployment were dispositive at this stage.

It did not permanently enjoin federal control; it left Guard members under federal command but barred their deployment within Illinois during the appeal.

It did not foreclose future federalization or deployment should facts materially change to satisfy § 12406’s predicates.

Practical Guidance and Implications

For the Executive Branch:

Build a consistent, evidence-based record of actual organized violent resistance (for § 12406(2)) or concrete, significant inability of federal forces to execute the laws (for § 12406(3)).

Align public communications with legal positions; claims of enforcement “success” may undermine assertions of “inability.”

Document unsuccessful reliance on federal officers and cooperative state/local measures before invoking military support.

For States and Localities:

Establish unified command structures and document effective containment using civilian law enforcement.

Preserve objective evidence (e.g., surveillance footage, incident logs) to counter claims of rebellion or inability.

Emphasize sovereignty harms, especially where out-of-state federalized Guard units are slated for in-state deployment.

For Courts:

Maintain deference to executive factfinding while rigorously enforcing statutory predicates.

Use calibrated interim remedies (e.g., permitting federalization but enjoining deployment) to balance equities in fast-moving situations.

Conclusion

The Seventh Circuit’s decision sets an important marker on the limits of executive power to deploy military forces domestically under § 12406. It clarifies that courts will review whether statutory predicates are met; that “political opposition is not rebellion”; and that claims of enforcement incapacity must be grounded in demonstrable, not rhetorical, impediments. The court’s nuanced remedial approach—allowing federalization but barring deployment—protects state sovereignty while preserving federal command arrangements during ongoing litigation.

Going forward, the opinion will guide executive branch lawyers, state attorneys general, and district courts evaluating federal call-ups during periods of civil unrest. It underscores the judiciary’s role in policing the boundaries of statutory authority, even while according deference to the political branches in matters of national security. Most practically, it warns that deploying the National Guard into a state over its objection requires more than sporadic disorder; it requires evidence of organized violent resistance or an actual breakdown in the capacity of federal forces to execute federal law.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 01:02:03.003793
,Litigation,2025-10-18 10:54:10+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Chicago's federal court feeling impact of government shutdown,Jason Meisner,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/17/chicago-federal-court-operations-shutdown/,"The ongoing federal government shutdown is starting to have dire consequences at Chicago’s Dirksen U.S.
Courthouse, where money has run out to pay staff and some jury trials have already been canceled amid growing uncertainty.
“I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year as far as paying jurors,” Kendall said.
After that, they’ll be working without pay as “excepted” employees in order to keep the court’s constitutional functions running, she said.
Kendall said the courthouse staff is keeping a stiff upper lip, but the prospect of working without pay is daunting especially in an uncertain economy.","The ongoing federal government shutdown is starting to have dire consequences at Chicago’s Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where money has run out to pay staff and some jury trials have already been canceled amid growing uncertainty.

In one bit of good news, however, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts notified all federal courts nationwide this week that there are sufficient funds to continue to pay jurors and grand jurors for up to about three months.

U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall told the Tribune on Friday that the announcement was “out of the blue,” but the exact date the funding would run out was unclear.

“I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year as far as paying jurors,” Kendall said.

Still, the ongoing shutdown, which began Oct. 1 and currently has no end in sight, prompted Kendall to announce Friday the U.S. District Courts in Chicago are now entering “Phase 2” of its shutdown operations, stopping salary payments to courthouse employees and reducing operations at the clerk’s office to only “excepted activities” such as constitutional functions.

While the courthouse will remain open, Kendall said that workers — from docketing employees to clerks and courtroom staff — will get their last paycheck on Oct. 24. After that, they’ll be working without pay as “excepted” employees in order to keep the court’s constitutional functions running, she said.

Kendall said the courthouse staff is keeping a stiff upper lip, but the prospect of working without pay is daunting especially in an uncertain economy.

“Regardless of your political position, it’s critical that the court has stay open for those seeking redress, and it’s unfortunate that Congress is not understanding that those individuals working to keep it open are citizens who need to support their families,” Kendall said.

The shutdown initially affected only civil litigation involving the United States as a party since the court keeps a reserve of funds that allow most operations to continue.

Despite that, judges in several criminal cases at the Dirksen courthouse this week decided to move jury trials that were imminent to avoid having to shut it down in the middle of proceedings.

Among the cases postponed was that of Antoine Larry, a police officer in south suburban Phoenix who had been scheduled to go on trial Wednesday on charges he shook down drug dealers for money.

Also canceled was the trial starting Wednesday of Jawad Fakroune, a Moroccan national accused of threatening and assaulting a Chicago restaurateur to collect a debt Fakroune claimed he was owed. In a minute order last week, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah said the “uncertainty” surrounding the lapse in appropriations could affect the ability to summon jurors in the near future.

“Although circumstances could change between now and (the start of trial), the court concludes that resetting the trial will allow the parties a better opportunity to reasonably and effectively prepare for the trial,” Shah wrote. Fakroune’s trial was reset for January.

Kendall said that because of the way jurors are called in for service, some judges went forward with canceling trials before it was known this week that funding would indeed be available to pay the panel. She said she’s since told the 34 district judges that “If you have a trial this year and you haven’t canceled yet, I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year.”

While government shutdowns — and threatened ones — have affected the courts numerous times over the past decade and a half, the situation this year is the most serious since 2013, when federal workers who were deemed “essential” reported to work but went without paychecks until Congress later approved the money.

At the U.S. attorney’s office that year, about a third of its 300 employees — mostly from its civil litigation and support staff — were sent home during the budget stalemate. Most of the office’s approximately 125 criminal prosecutors are exempt from budget-related furloughs, and their work would not be affected.

Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for current U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros, said Friday the office had furloughed about a quarter of its staff, also mostly civil litigation and support employees.

Kendall said the Federal Defender Program, the not-for-profit that represents clients who can’t pay for their own lawyer, has told her they have enough funding to last through November.

How long the shutdown lasts this time around is anyone’s guess, but there is no doubt the money will run out eventually.

In 2013, then-U.S. District Chief Judge Ruben Castillo told the Tribune that if the stalemate hadn’t been resolved, he was prepared to send a doomsday email that would have halted all trials at the busy downtown courthouse because he had no more money to pay jurors and court-appointed attorneys or cover other costs of a trial.

Officials in Washington had told Castillo to give jurors IOUs for their service if necessary — something he refused to do.

She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order.","The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order.

That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday.

Friday's court filing came amid a legal fight between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call ""politically driven RIFs,"" or reductions in force.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause.

As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with ""an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.""

In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.

At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs have members or bargaining units.

In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to ""err on the side of caution.""

She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding ""We ought not make it worse.""

The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order.

The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.

In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions.

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his declaration to the court about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown.

""HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,"" he wrote. ""Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.""

During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.

The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.

Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing.

At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as ""ready, fire, aim"" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding ""to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.""

In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston ""another far left, partisan judge.""

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs ""an unfortunate consequence"" of the government shutdown.

OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect.

While the White House promised ""substantial"" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January.

Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary.

That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates.

Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's ""Fork in the Road"" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2364x1330+0+246/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F0a%2Fc1bf8e494d09bf8efdd61a21b938%2Fgettyimages-2238023122.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:57:00.658123

His lawyers filed an emergency appeal urging the court to set aside rulings of judges in Chicago and hold that National Guard troops are needed to protect U.S. immigration agents from hostile protesters.

The case escalates the clash between Trump and Democratic state officials over immigration enforcement and raises again the question of using military-style force in American cities. Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly gone to the Supreme Court and won quick rulings when lower-court judges have blocked his actions.

Federal law authorizes the president to call into service the National Guard if he cannot “execute the laws of the United States” or faces “a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority” of the U.S. government.

“Both conditions are satisfied here,” Trump’s lawyer said.

Judges in Chicago came to the opposite conclusion. U.S. District Judge April Perry saw no “danger of rebellion” and said the laws were being enforced. She accused Trump’s lawyers of exaggerating claims of violence and equating “protests with riots.”

She handed down a restraining order on Oct. 9, and the 7th Circuit Court agreed to keep it in force.

But Trump’s lawyers insisted that protesters and demonstrators were targeting U.S. immigration agents and preventing them from doing their work.

“Confronted with intolerable risks of harm to federal agents and coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law, the President lawfully determines that he is unable to enforce the laws of the United States with the regular forces and calls up the National Guard to defend federal personnel, property, and functions in the face of ongoing violence,” Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer wrote in a 40-page appeal.

He argued that historically the president has had the full authority to decide on whether to call up the militia. Judges may not second-guess the president’s decision, he said.

“Any such review [by judges] must be highly deferential, as the 9th Circuit has concluded in the Newsom litigation,” referring to the ruling that upheld Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.

Trump’s lawyer said the troop deployment to Los Angeles had succeeded in reducing violence.

“Notwithstanding the Governor of California’s claim that deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles would ‘escalat[e]’ the ongoing violence that California itself had failed to prevent ... the President’s action had the opposite, intended effect. In the face of federal military force, violence in Los Angeles decreased and the situation substantially improved,” he told the court.

But in recent weeks, “Chicago has been the site of organized and often violent protests directed at ICE officers and other federal personnel engaged in the execution of federal immigration laws,” he wrote. “On multiple occasions, federal officers have also been hit and punched by protesters. ... Rioters have targeted federal officers with fireworks and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

“More than 30 [DHS] officers have been injured during the assaults on federal law enforcement” at the Broadview facility alone, resulting in multiple hospitalizations, he wrote.

Officials in Illinois blamed aggressive enforcement actions of ICE agents for triggering the protests.

Sauer also urged the court to hand down an immediate order that would freeze Perry’s rulings.

The court asked for a response from Illinois officials by Monday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95097bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4644x2438+0+329/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2F1e%2Fb0b1864e483b869a80960b9cc646%2Fafp-getty-trump-signs-order-for-task-force-for-missing-a5.JPG,N,,2025-10-18 18:03:46.181281

The Justice Department asked the court to block a judge’s ruling that halted the deployment of hundreds of troops over the objection of Illinois state officials and local leaders, while litigation challenging Mr Trump’s plan continues.

Given events on the ground, the judge questioned the administration’s

stated reasons for sending in the military

. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s ruling on Oct 16, also doubting the administration’s stated justification.

The administration has stated that danger to federal property and personnel posed by protests against Mr Trump’s hardline immigration enforcement policies justified the president’s deployment of troops.

In a written filing, the Justice Department called the assessment by local officials of these protests as “implausibly rosy” and urged immediate action.

Federal law enforcement agencies “have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence,” the department said. “Local forces have failed to respond, or unaccountably delayed their response, even when federal agents face life-threatening violence.”

The Supreme Court asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the Justice Department’s request by Oct 20 afternoon.

“Donald Trump will keep trying to invade Illinois with troops – and we will keep defending the sovereignty of our state,” Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker wrote on social media.

“Militarising our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy. What will come next?”

Mr Trump ordered National Guard troops to Chicago, the third-largest US city, and Portland, Oregon following his

earlier deployments to Los Angeles

, Memphis and Washington.

He has sought to use military forces to suppress protests and support domestic immigration enforcement.

Mr Trump and his allies have described these cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests in need of military intervention.

Democratic mayors and governors, along with other Trump critics, have said these claims are a false account of the situation and a pretext for sending troops to punish adversaries, accusing Mr Trump of abusing his power.

Federal judges have expressed scepticism over the administration’s view of events on the ground. Demonstrations over the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts have been largely peaceful and limited in size, according to local officials, far from the “war zone” conditions described by Mr Trump.

Testing the limits

Though Mr Trump has suggested troops can be used to tackle crime, National Guard and other military personnel under US law are not typically permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. While a US president can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, Mr Trump is testing the limits of those powers by sending troops to cities controlled by his political adversaries.

The legal dispute centres on Mr Trump’s invocation of a federal law that allows a president to federalise National Guard troops only in the case of rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The administration in October federalised 300 Illinois National Guard troops and also ordered more Texas National Guard troops into the state.

In the face of criticism and pushback from local leaders, Mr Trump escalated his threats, calling on Oct 8 for the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois, both Democrats, to be jailed, accusing them of failing to protect immigration officers.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration over the deployment. On Oct 9, Chicago-based US District Judge April Perry, an appointee of former president Joe Biden, a Democrat, temporarily blocked the move.

Judge Perry said the administration’s claims of violence during protests at an immigration facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, where a small group of demonstrators had gathered daily for weeks, were unreliable.

In a written opinion, Judge Perry faulted administration officials for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticising their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence”.

There is no evidence of a danger of rebellion in Illinois or that the law is not being enforced, the judge said, adding that a National Guard deployment “will only add fuel to the fire”.

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Judge Perry’s order blocking the deployment, concluding that “the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois”.

Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Mr Trump.

Officials from Portland and Oregon are pursuing a separate legal challenge to Mr Trump’s planned deployment to that city. A judge blocked the deployment – extending that order on Oct 16 – and an appellate court has heard arguments in the administration’s appeal.

“In New York City, ICE officers tackled a photojournalist filming protests outside a courthouse, claiming she had assaulted them.
They prohibit using city resources for federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant.
They require that ICE warrants be verified by city personnel and that the city solicitor review any administrative subpoenas before compliance.
Our officers respond to Providence residents.","“It comes down to creating trust and accountability mechanisms here in Providence. While it’s clear and important to acknowledge that this alone isn’t going to stop ICE officials from creating and continuing barbaric actions, it’s going to set a precedent on where the Providence lies in terms of what our values are as a city, not only as individual councilors but as a city as a whole. Many elected officials, including the Mayor, have said that Providence is a welcoming city, and we welcome everyone. Providence has a diverse history of immigration, whether it was the Italians and Irish or the Latino communities today - at the end of the day, immigration is the backbone of our city.

“We’re a working-class, welcoming, and diverse city. What’s before us today is to put clear accountability mechanisms into the city ordinances. There will now be a mechanism for the people we serve to hold us accountable as elected officials. There’s also going to be an avenue of accountability for individuals - that has always been the case since 2017 - but now we’re going to add organizations.

“What happens when someone is detained is that they are transported to another facility. That’s what we’re seeing. Someone might be detained here in Providence but quickly transported to Louisiana or Texas. Usually, the deported individual doesn’t have the resources to hold the city accountable if there is certain collaboration between the Providence Police Department and immigration officials, but now there’s going to be an avenue where organizations hold us accountable to our values - values we all share.

“This has been worked collaboratively with many partners locally and federally. We’ve been working with the mayor’s office the past couple of days, and I don’t want to speak for the mayor, but I believe he is very supportive of where we’re at today with this ordinance because at the end of the day, we all want to have a welcoming city with clear procedures and policies when it comes to our colleagues on the police department and immigration officials. At the end of the day, what we all want is a safe, welcoming city and accountability measures.”

“If I may pivot outside of Providence, we’ve seen horrific stories about ICE’s abuse. Several days ago in Houston, a mother was selling fruit on the corner with her children when her 15-year-old son, who has autism and the cognitive ability of a 4-year-old, asked to use the bathroom. Minutes later, he was gone. ICE agents had taken him. The family spent days not knowing where he was until they learned he had been placed in a federal children’s detention facility, but no one told them. No one even thought to call. Imagine the terror of a mother who doesn’t know where a child is, only to find out he’s been locked in federal custody for days.

“Then in Chicago, a woman driving to work was slammed by an unmarked federal SUV. Witnesses yelled, ‘Hit and run!’ as agents jumped out, dragged her out of the car by her legs, and detained her at gunpoint. She was a U.S. citizen, just cleared by her doctor to return to work after surgery.

“In New York City, ICE officers tackled a photojournalist filming protests outside a courthouse, claiming she had assaulted them. They arrested her, cuffed her, and later released her with no charges because, what do you know? There was no assault. The only thing she was guilty of was recording their actions.

“In California, a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Iraq war, an American citizen on his way to work security at a farm, was surrounded by ICE agents, tear gassed in his car, and dragged out. He was detained for days, stripped, placed on suicide watch, and kept under 24-hour light in his cell. His family had no idea where he was. His ID was sitting in the car they towed away. He later told reporters that the only thing he could think about while being locked up was seeing his kids again.

“Perhaps most haunting of all is what we saw in Chicago. Days ago, a massive pre-dawn raid at South Shore Drive, residents awoke to Black Hawk helicopters overhead, flash bangs, and hundreds of agents in combat gear storming their building. Doors were kicked in. Children were zip-tied on the sidewalk. Birth certificates and belongings were thrown into the hallway. Thirty-seven people were reportedly arrested, but many of those detained were U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Department of Homeland Security called it a joint operation, but residents called it what it was: a military style assault on their neighborhood.

“This is what happens when a federal agency operates without restraint. This is what we mean when we say ICE is a rogue agency. And of course, Providence is not immune. This week on Chalkstone Avenue, an unmarked ICE vehicle ran a red light with its lights on but no siren. It struck another car, jumped a sidewalk, and snapped a telephone pole. Witnesses said it was chasing another unmarked vehicle through a city intersection.

“Back in July, ICE crashed into a suspect’s car on Alverson Street, and Providence Officers were found to have assisted them, violating both department policy and city ordinance.

“According to records, as of September 21, 2025, ICE held nearly 60,000 people in detention, and over 71% had no criminal conviction whatsoever. These are not hardened criminals. They are parents, workers, students, and neighbors. When people in our city, especially those who are undocumented, believe that calling 911 could bring immigration agents to their door, they stop calling. Crimes go unreported. Victims go unprotected. Predators roam free. That makes all of us less safe.

“The amendments before you tonight make this law enforceable. They spell out cooperation and include every indirect way local resources are pulled into immigration enforcement, like setting parameters, sharing data, offering staging space, or providing equipment. They prohibit using city resources for federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant. They add protections against profiling based on immigration status or citizenship. They stiffen privacy safeguards or limit data sharing with outside agencies. They require that ICE warrants be verified by city personnel and that the city solicitor review any administrative subpoenas before compliance. They empower the residents to take legal action if the city fails to follow this law.

“Before I conclude my remarks, I want to remind us that what we’re doing tonight is constitutional. The 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle clarifies that the federal government cannot force local police to enforce federal law. Our officers respond to Providence residents. I know that’s a radical idea, but they don’t answer to what happens in Washington, and our laws should reflect that.

“The question we have before us is: Do we want to be a city where a mother can report abuse without worrying about which badge shows up at her door, where a child can walk home from school without finding himself in the middle of a federal convoy, and where our police are focused on protecting our residents and not enforcing civil immigration law? Nationally and in Providence, the record shows an agency operating with impunity, sweeping up citizens and non-citizens alike and sowing distrust in local enforcement.

“I value what the community did in 2017 in passing the CPRA, but the landscape has changed, and I don’t believe it’s enough. I think these amendments bring the CPRA clarity and the power it needs to protect our residents, uphold the constitution, and keep Providence safe.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hdi3!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c41be43-894f-4841-84df-cc1a5c122558_1500x844.jpeg",N,,2025-10-18 14:57:49.799654

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported.","When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.

Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.

“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”

One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”

And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”

During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.

Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.

And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.

One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”

The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.

The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.

The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.

The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.

Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.

“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”

Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”

“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.

In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.

“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.

McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”

“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.

Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.

The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.

“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

“Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.

“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”

Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”

U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.

The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”

Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.

“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”

In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.

“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.

In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.

Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”

With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.

On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”

The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.

Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.

Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.

“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”

Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.

“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.

Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission (Dec. 9) – Whether a federal law limiting coordinated party expenditures violates the First Amendment.","The Supreme Court announced on Friday afternoon that it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 8 in the battle over the president’s power to remove the heads of independent federal agencies created by Congress. The case, Trump v. Slaughter, is one of eight cases scheduled for oral argument during the court’s December argument calendar, which runs from Dec. 1-3 and again from Dec. 8-10. Other high-profile cases now slated for argument in December include National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission and First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin.

The dispute over presidential power began in March, when Rebecca Slaughter received an email notifying her that she had been removed from her position as one of the five members of the Federal Trade Commission. Under federal law, commissioners can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” but the email did not indicate that she had been fired for one of these reasons.

Federal courts in Washington, D.C., ordered the Trump administration to reinstate Slaughter. They pointed to the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, which held that Congress can create independent, multi-member regulatory agencies, like the FTC, whose members can only be removed “for cause.”

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court in early September, seeking permission to fire Slaughter while the litigation continued. By a vote of 6-3, the justices agreed to put the lower court’s order requiring Slaughter’s reinstatement on hold.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, the justices will decide whether to overrule a 2001 decision that upheld federal limits on coordinated campaign expenditures, which bar political parties from spending money on campaign advertising with input from political candidates. The case was brought by (among others) then-Sen. J.D. Vance, contending that the federal law at the center of the case violates the First Amendment.

Mashable’s Arguments Mashable moved to dismiss, contending that the Pen Register Act, applies only to person-to-person communications such as phone calls or emails, not to general website activity.
Mashable also asserted that pending Senate Bill 690 indicates the California Legislature’s disagreement with the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Pen Register Act.","On October 9, 2025, the Northern District of California denied Mashable, Inc.’s motion to dismiss a class action alleging violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). Mashable operates a digital news and entertainment website that publishes articles and multimedia content online. The plaintiff alleged that Mashable disclosed the IP addresses and device identifiers of its website visitors to Microsoft and other third parties in violation of CIPA.

Case History

The plaintiff alleged that Mashable’s website embedded third-party trackers from Microsoft and others which collected users’ IP addresses and device information, transmitting that data to third parties for advertising and profiling. The plaintiff argued these trackers function as “pen registers” under CIPA. The Pen Register Act (the chapter of CIPA at issue) prohibits installing or using any device or process that records addressing information from electronic communications without a court order.

Mashable’s Arguments

Mashable moved to dismiss, contending that the Pen Register Act, applies only to person-to-person communications such as phone calls or emails, not to general website activity. It further argued that the complaint did not plausibly allege a violation and that the CIPA statute is ambiguous and should be interpreted narrowly under the rule of lenity– a legal principle that requires courts to interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants. Mashable also asserted that pending Senate Bill 690 indicates the California Legislature’s disagreement with the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Pen Register Act.

Court’s Reasoning and Decision

The court rejected Mashable’s arguments and found that the Pen Register Act’s language is intentionally broad, covering any “device or process” that records addressing information. Pen Register is defined as a “device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a communication.” Hinging on the inclusion of “process” in the definition, the court held that this definition was intended to encompass software trackers embedded in websites, not just traditional telephone hardware. According to the court, “[w]hat matters under the statute is not the form of the tool, but rather the function.”

The court further held that a user’s visit to a website, which involves transmitting an HTTP request containing IP and device data, constitutes an “electronic communication” under the statute. The court likened an IP address to a telephone number, as “quintessential ‘addressing’ information…[that] identifies the device sending the communication and determines where the packet is to be routed.”

In addition, the court found that Mashable’s role in embedding trackers and using the resulting data was sufficient to plead “installation” and “use” under CIPA, even if third-party vendors operated the trackers. The court held that, even if the trackers were operated by a third party, Mashable embedded the trackers onto its website and used the data captured from them to facilitate targeted advertising.

Moreover, the court found the statute clear enough in its “language, structure, history and purpose” to apply to the conduct alleged and declined to apply the rule of lenity. It also held that S.B. 690 is not persuasive evidence because it has not passed and “[the] Court must apply the statute as it currently exists.”

Implications

This decision significantly broadens the scope of CIPA compliance risk for website operators in California. By holding that the Pen Register Act applies to modern web tracking technologies, such as embedded third-party trackers that collect and transmit IP addresses and device identifiers, the court clarified that CIPA is not limited to traditional telephone or direct person-to-person communications. Any website embedding third-party advertising or analytics tools that record user “addressing” information could face similar exposure, even if the trackers are managed and operated by external vendors. Importantly, the court’s dismissal of the rule of lenity and disregard for pending legislative amendments further signal that California courts are leaning toward expansive interpretations of digital privacy statutes.

Takeaways

Website operators, especially those with significant California user bases, should reassess their use of tracking technologies and the sharing of user data with third parties. Compliance strategies should include conducting thorough audits of all embedded trackers, understanding what information is collected, ensuring appropriate disclosures, and evaluating the legal basis for any data-sharing practices. The court’s emphasis on function over form warns that simply relying on vendor installation or technical outsourcing does not insulate companies from liability under CIPA. In this environment, proactive reviews of privacy practices and ongoing legal monitoring are critical, not only to limit exposure in potential CIPA litigation, but also to align with evolving regulatory and judicial expectations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15533_134.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:57:53.148890

The video recorded by Mari Magana and posted on Facebook showed the moment ICE agents kicked down the bedroom door in the family’s apartment in Gresham, approximately 17 miles outside of Portland, Wednesday evening. The video has been shared across social media.

The baby’s grandmother, Gloria Bautista, told The Independent that her daughter has been left shaken by the ordeal.

“The mother is so traumatized that anything scares her, she's shaking all the time,” she said.

“This is unfair they scared my baby,” Magana wrote in a Facebook post alongside the footage. “We are not criminals to be treated that way let alone point us with guns.”

Two male relatives in the room were detained by ICE agents in the confrontation, where an agent appeared to grab one of them by the hair and pull him backward out of the room. The two suspects have been taken to a detention center in nearby Tacoma, Washington.

A senior Department of Homeland Security official told The Independent that “no injuries were sustained” in the operation, which was targeting “a previously removed violent criminal illegal alien from Mexico” who remains at large.

“ICE officers attempted to pull this criminal illegal alien over in a vehicle stop,” the official said. “He attempted to evade arrest and rammed into a United States Postal Service vehicle before fleeing on foot into an apartment. After refusals to come out, law enforcement entered the apartment.”

“The target escaped and remains at-large,” the official added. “Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene.”

The family claimed the men who were detained are in the U.S. legally.

""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""","Amid President Donald Trump's unprecedented and accelerating attacks on US democracy, millions of Americans in every state and beyond are preparing to take to the streets Saturday for a second wave of No Kings rallies.

In what organizers and participants say might be the ""largest protest in US history"" in a single day, No Kings demonstrations are set to take place in more than 2,500 communities across the nation, from its biggest cities to small towns like Burns, Oregon—population 2,700—and Bryson City, North Carolina, with 1,500 residents.

The first round of No Kings rallies, held on June 14, drew an estimated 4-6 million participants to over 2,100 demonstrations. Organizers say that the October 18 protest could be even bigger, as Americans are more alarmed than ever by the assault on democracy by Trump and Republicans.

""What we’re seeing is truly unprecedented,"" Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told Common Dreams. ""What we’re seeing from this administration is authoritarian slip. We are seeing them attack judges, attack nonprofits, trying to attack the media, stifle First Amendment protected speech, and arrest sitting members of Congress for doing their oversight of [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].""

""The list, unfortunately, is very long and what we want is what we’ve seen in other countries that have successfully resisted authoritarianism—to hold on to our democracy and to create and protect the checks that we have against that kind of executive overreach,"" she added. ""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""

As Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson (La.)—who called Saturday's pro-democracy demonstrations ""hate America"" rallies—attempt to smear the No Kings movement, organizer Sarah Parker of 50501 and Voices of Florida said during a Thursday press conference that ""we have a saying in the South: A hit dog will holler, and I’m hearing a lot of noise from Washington, DC right now.""

""And with that said, on October 18 millions of people just like me... are going to take the streets peacefully and say there will be no kings in America,"" she continued.

""These are everyday Americans coming together to organize,"" Parker said. ""These are faith leaders, teachers, veterans, small business owners who are being impacted by extremely dubious tariffs. These are people that are seeing their friends and family members be kidnapped off the streets. These are everyday Americans that are struggling to put groceries into their fridge, and these are Millennials and Gen Zers who were promised a beautiful and free America.""

""They are rising to this moment because they feel… it is their obligation to joyfully and peacefully push back against authoritarianism like the generations that came before us,"" she added.

Jamie Contreras, the executive vice president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 32BJ who is also a US Navy veteran and former undocumented immigrant, told the press conference that ""America belongs to the people—working people—not to billionaires or a few politicians who think they can rule like kings.""

Addressing the Trump administration's designation of leftist protesters as ""terrorists"" and its ominous threat to take the ""same approach"" to them as to the alleged drug traffickers it is extrajudicially assassinating on the high seas, Contreras said that ""the real threat to this country isn’t peaceful protesters, it’s politicians shutting down our government to protect billionaires and corporate greed.""

""What’s ironic to me is, you call peaceful protesters terrorists, but then the [January 6 insurrectionists] patriots,"" he added. ""That’s so ironic and so far from the truth.""

The federal government shut down at the beginning of the month, and as Democrats and Republicans continued to spar over the GOP's healthcare cuts, Johnson warned this week that it could be the longest shutdown ever.

Indivisible co-founder Leah Greenberg told the press conference: ""Republicans are blaming and smearing millions of Americans who are peacefully protesting because they have run out of excuses for their own failures. Republicans understand that Americans are blaming them for the shutdown, Americans are blaming them for out-of-control healthcare prices, and a rising affordability crisis.""

Greenberg continued:

They are blaming them for the fear and chaos gripping the country. They are panicking and they are flailing and they are searching for anything, literally anything, to distract from their governing failures. And in their desperation they have decided to go with smearing millions of Americans who are coming out to peacefully, directly assert our rights. It is both ridiculous and outrageous. It is ridiculous because it is transparently false, it is outrageous because it is an attack on the First Amendment and on all of our right to free speech.

Parker said Republicans ""are refusing to accept the fact that the American people are pissed, by the millions. They are refusing to accept the fact that their actions are harming our beloved country. They are refusing to look in the mirror and accept the fact that they are destroying America.""

ACLU chief political and advocacy officer Deidre Schifeling said during the press conference that ""President Trump and his allies are abusing their power and attempting to scare their own citizens away from exercising our rights and freedoms.""

""What we have seen so far is as troubling as it is illegal,"" Schifeling continued. ""The Trump administration has directed ICE to kidnap people including journalists and students off the street, ripping them from their families and deporting them without due process.""

""Their allies are attempting to undermine fair elections at President Trump’s direction by redistricting voting maps and further gerrymandering states,"" she noted. ""And they are attempting to limit our First Amendment rights and use the federal government to attack political rivals, stifle dissent, and undermine checks and balances on presidential power.""

""The Trump administration has even deployed armed agents and troops into American cities, including my home of Washington, DC, turning our streets into militarized zones and threatening to do so again to quash Saturday’s protests,"" she said.

""You have to ask: Why are they so afraid of their own citizens?"" Schifeling said. ""Well, they know that their agenda of selling fear, division, misinformation, lawbreaking, and violence is deeply unpopular. Millions of Americans will peacefully protest on Saturday to tell the Trump administration that we are a country of equals, we are a country of laws that apply to everyone, of due process, and of democracy.""

""We will not be silenced,"" she added. ""If we stop exercising our rights, our First Amendment freedom of speech out of fear, we forfeit our power in advance. The best way to protect our freedom is to act free.""

Gilbert told Common Dreams: ""I think we can turn this around. I think we wouldn’t be doing this if we couldn’t. We are still in a democracy today, we’re having this free and fair conversation right now, you and I… and we have a set of protections we can exercise and we need to remind people what democracy is supposed to look like.""

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston said during an emergency hearing the restraining order affects any agency that has employees who are members of the unions that brought the lawsuit or are in collective bargaining units.

The Trump administration choosing not to recognize those union activities based on an earlier executive order doesn’t mean an agency can issue layoff notices, she said.

Illston, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, specifically said the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services must comply with the TRO and cannot issue Reductions in Force, or RIFs.

“It is not complicated,” Illston said. “During this time these agencies should not be doing RIFs of the protected folks that we're talking about.”

She also added the National Federation of Federal Employees, Service Employees International Union and National Association of Government Employees, Inc. to the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order.

Meanwhile, as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 extends with no end in sight, administration officials said they will freeze $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects and furlough Energy Department employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration.

Unions argue administration ignoring part of judge’s order

The California case was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing those unions, said during the hearing the Trump administration had been “overly narrowly interpreting the scope of the TRO and ignoring some of the language in the TRO.”

Leonard pointed to a brief filed by the Department of Health and Human Services that said the agency hadn’t issued any layoff notices to workers covered by the TRO, even though an earlier filing to the court said HHS had sent notices to 982 employees.

That department, Leonard said, appeared to take the position that an earlier executive order ended all union representation at HHS.

“The government is well aware that is a disputed issue,” Leonard said.

Elizabeth Hedges, counsel for the Trump administration, said after considerable back and forth that she didn’t agree with Leonard and the judge’s interpretation of the temporary restraining order’s impact.

“I would submit that’s not what the TRO says,” Hedges said, though she later told the judge she would make sure the administration complied with the updated explanation of the restraining order.

Hedges also told the judge the Interior Department didn’t previously disclose it was contemplating layoffs because officials began considering those RIFs before the shutdown and were only going to implement them during the shutdown because it’s gone on so long.

The judge ordered the Trump administration to tell the court by 9 a.m. Pacific on Monday about any actual or imminent layoff notices under the full scope of the restraining order.

Army Corps to pause billions in big-city projects

White House budget director Russ Vought announced hours before the emergency court hearing the administration plans to freeze and may unilaterally cancel billions more in funding approved by Congress.

“The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,” Vought wrote in a social media post. “The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.”

The Trump administration has been cited several times by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office for not spending money approved by Congress as lawmakers intended.

Generally, after Congress approves a spending bill and it becomes law, the president is supposed to faithfully implement its provisions.

Any president that wants to cancel funding lawmakers already approved is supposed to send Congress a rescissions request, which starts a 45-day clock for members to approve, modify, or ignore the request.

The Trump administration followed that legal pathway earlier this year when it asked Congress to cancel billions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid.

The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, approved the request after senators preserved full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

The White House budget office sent up another rescissions request in late August, asking lawmakers to cancel billions of additional spending on foreign aid programs.

Neither chamber has taken action to approve that request, but Vought believes that since it was sent up within the last 45 days of the fiscal year, he is allowed to cancel that funding without congressional action.

The GAO and Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both called the maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, unlawful.

Nuclear security workers to be furloughed

The Trump administration also announced Friday that it would have more than 1,000 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration stop working for the remainder of the shutdown, joining hundreds of thousands of others on furlough. According to its website, the NNSA’s job “is to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.”

By Andy Worthington, October 17, 2025

Since its founding in January 2012, marking the 10th anniversary of the opening of the ""war on terror"" prison at Guantánamo Bay, the Close Guantánamo campaign has persistently called for freedom and/or justice for the men held there, struggling against indifference under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, but shut out completely under Donald Trump, who, in his first term in office, disregarded the remaining prisoners so thoroughly that, for four years, it was as though they had been entombed.

In the eight and a half baleful months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the 15 ""war on terror"" prisoners still held at the prison (down from 40 in his first term) have, predictably, largely disappeared from view, made invisible as the would-be tyrannical president sprung a miserable surprise on everyone, seizing on the naval base as a venue for perforative cruelty in the ""war on migrants"" that he declared when he took office, promising what Human Rights First has accurately described as ""an unprecedented mass deportation agenda.""

On January 29, out of nowhere, Trump ordered the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, via a ""Presidential Action,"" to make preparations to hold up to 30,000 migrants there — plans which, fortunately, never materialized.

Beginning in February, however, the first of what, to date, have been just over 700 migrants held at Guantánamo were flown to the naval base from detention facilities on the U.S. mainland run by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), part of the Department of Homeland Security, both of which were created in 2003 as part of the domestic response to post-9/11 paranoia. No one at the time could have had any idea that one day they would get embroiled with Guantánamo, which was so clearly the territory of the military.

Some of these migrants were held in an existing Migrant Operations Center, used to hold migrants intercepted at sea since the 1990s, with others held, illegally, in Camp 6 of the ""war on terror"" prison, which, by law, can only be used to hold prisoners allegedly seized in connection with the 9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.

Faced with legal challenges, Trump disposed of all of the first migrants held at Guantánamo — 178 Venezuelans — within weeks, sending all but one back to Venezuela. In the months that followed, however, more migrants continued to arrive, in smaller numbers, and from a variety of countries, although they too were all subsequently deported or returned to the U.S. mainland.

In June, reports emerged that Trump was once more threatening to massively increase the migrant population at Guantánamo, allegedly planning to send 9,000 men there, including 800 Europeans. I speculated at the time that the news had been an internal leak, designed to get the plans dropped via the fury of European leaders, who, as anticipated, in many cases vociferously complained in public about this flagrant affront to diplomacy.

The arrival and subsequent disappearance of migrants at Guantánamo reportedly convicted of serious crimes

In July, however, further disturbing news emerged, establishing that, at the time, 72 migrants were held, with 26 of them singled out for particular attention by the Department of Homeland Security, which published a hysterically-entitled list, describing them as the ""Worst of the Worst Convicted Criminal Illegal Aliens,"" and giving their names, their nationalities, and the alleged crimes for which they had allegedly been convicted (no actual proof was provided). The men came from a variety of countries, mainly in Central and South America and South East Asia, although they also included individuals from the U.K. and Romania.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts had evidently arisen because the administration had been repeatedly humiliated, exposed time and again lying about most of the men it had been seizing, routinely describing them as gang members and ""heinous criminals"" based on nothing more than the fact that they had tattoos. In case after case, exposed by lawyers, investigators and journalists, their family members had established that their only ""crime"" had been to undertake perilous journeys to seek work in the promised land of the USA.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts was particularly disturbing because it coincided with the administration’s successful efforts to deport migrants not to their home countries, but to third countries (namely, South Sudan and Eswatini), with none of the guarantees required under international humanitarian law to ensure that they would not be abused, tortured, ""disappeared,"" or even killed.

Nevertheless, despite my best efforts to promote the precarious position these 26 men at Guantánamo were in, no one at all followed up on the story, attempts to chase leads led nowhere, and the story soon sank without trace.

It was only on October 2 that Carol Rosenberg of the New York Times reported that all of the migrants held over the summer had been removed, with none remaining at all.

As Rosenberg explained, on October 1 the last 18 migrants held were removed on a charter flight to the U.S. mainland. As she stated, ""Their final destinations were not known, but immigration authorities have in the past moved migrants back to the United States to consolidate deportation flights.""

Further elucidating the story of the migrants held over the summer, Rosenberg explained that, at the end of July, 61 migrants were held, but that, since then, 16 ICE flights had ""picked up deportees, to either return them to the United States or to add to flights already loaded with other migrants and continue on to other countries.""

She added that, according to Thomas Cartwright, who tracks deportations with the immigrant rights group Witness at the Border, ""Their destinations included Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, England, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Laos, Nigeria, Romania, St. Kitt, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.""

Some of these deportations undoubtedly included the 26 men on the list published by the DHS, most notably the British national, although as with his arrival at Guantánamo, and his imprisonment over the summer, there has never been any mention of him in any British media outlet at all.

Once upon a time, a British national held at Guantánamo, even one allegedly convicted of paedophilia, would have been a major news story, but now it’s lost in a vortex of media indifference and the perma-chaos of Trump’s insane rule.

I can only wonder how many other troubling stories are not even being noticed at all.

More migrants arrive at Guantánamo

Unfortunately, on October 14, Rosenberg provided an update regarding the migrant situation at Guantánamo, noting that she had been told by a Defense Department official that about 20 more migrants had arrived at the naval base, although no further details — about their nationalities, for example — were provided.

Every time the naval base is emptied of migrants, I hope that the Trump administration will finally have taken note of some of the main reasons why using it is so inappropriate — the colossal costs involved, for example, or the evident illegality of using it to hold anyone detained in connection with civil immigration matters.

Every time, however, the administration’s contempt for propriety and the law wins out.

Later this month, however, a federal judge in the District Court in Washington, D.C. will finally hear a case, Luna Gutierrez v. Noem, which was submitted in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).

In their submission in June, lawyers for ""all immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be held at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay, Cuba"" argued that all these individuals ""do not challenge the government’s authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government’s unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act], and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.""

As the lawyers added, ""Moreover, the government’s use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.""

In addition, as they stated, ""Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so. The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States.""

It is to be hoped that, when the hearing takes place and a ruling is handed down, it will be another blow against the monstrous overreach and illegality of this particularly cruel and disdainful administration.

However, even if this is the outcome, and the ruling survives further appeals, 2025 will go down in history as the year that, in a cynically constructed policy echoing the lawless indignities of the Bush administration’s ""war on terror,"" Donald Trump and senior officials in his administration — Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth, and numerous devious legal advisers — conspired to replicate the horrors and lawlessness of the post-9/11 period not on foreign Muslims seized abroad, but on hapless migrants seized on the U.S. mainland.

And they did so not because there had been any great tragedy like 9/11, but simply because of their deep and revolting racism.",https://www.closeguantanamo.org/statics.1/img/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-18 12:03:05.678875

“Governor Newsom is deliberately trying to deceive parents by claiming this bill protects them, when in fact it does the opposite,” Jonathan Keller, president of California Family Council, said in a press release.

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 495 into law, enabling an individual to care for children of deported parents, despite claims that it poses a legal loophole for kidnapping children, says the California Family Council.

Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 495, also known as the “Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025,” this past week despite heavy opposition from parental advocacy groups.

Authored by Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez, D-San Fernando, the bill claims to give immigrant families facing deportation solutions in taking care of their children and ensures that they are not left vulnerable if a parent is unexpectedly detained by immigration officials.

“Our children deserve to feel safe at home, in school and in the community,” Newsom said in a press release. “We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies.”

According to the bill, a “nonrelative extended family member” could authorize school-related medical care and enrollment in school for a minor by filling out a one-page affidavit.

“I am grateful that the Governor has signed AB 495, the Family Preparedness Plan Act, into law today. This is a crucial step toward protecting children and families at a time when they are facing the terror of separation,” Assemblymember Rodriguez said in Newsom's news release.

Newsom’s press release clarifies that the bill does not alter a child’s caregiver, legal custodian, or guardian without a court order despite opponents’ claims that it erodes parental authority and child safety.

The California Family Council and other parental advocacy groups have been in huge opposition to this bill, as it claims the bill is a child trafficker's dream bill.

“Governor Newsom deceptively describes AB 495 as a caregiver planning tool for undocumented immigrant parents. It’s more accurately described as a child trafficker’s and child predator’s dream bill,” Dean Broyles, president and chief counsel of the National Center for Law & Policy, said in a statement. “Its sweeping application is not limited to immigrant families, does not require any parental notice or consent, and lacks even the most basic safeguards to protect children.”

CFC claims that this bill is unconstitutional and that there are not enough safeguards in place to protect children.

“Governor Newsom is deliberately trying to deceive parents by claiming this bill protects them, when in fact it does the opposite,” Jonathan Keller, president of California Family Council, said in a press release. “AB 495 strips parents of their constitutional rights and hands them over to unverified strangers.""

Yet the author of the bill states it is all about unity for the family.

“AB 495 is about one thing: keeping families together,” said Rodriguez. “It strengthens the ability of parents to make decisions for their children, empowers them to prepare for the unthinkable, and ensures kids are cared for by people they know and love.""

Keller disagreed.

“It is unconstitutional, it is illegal, and no school or medical facility should recognize or accept the authority of a Caregiver’s Authorization Affidavit without a verified signature from a parent or legal guardian. Newsom knows exactly what this bill does, but he’s hoping the press and the public won’t read it for themselves,” Keller added.",http://www.goldenstatenewspapers.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-18 14:57:54.443159

“During the pandemic … at that point we should have had the authority to sort of suspend accepting any applications,” she said.
Julia Sande, a human rights and policy lawyer with Amnesty International Canada, said it’s misleading to suggest these powers would have been used during the pandemic period.
“It’s really to try and respond more fairly and flexibly, for the safety of Canadians as well as the safety individuals that are coming to claim asylum,” Diab said.
Trump rationalized the tariffs by claiming Canada wasn’t doing enough to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking at the border.","“So currently in the law, (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) has the ability to do that, but on a case-by-case basis,” Diab said.

She said that case-by-case approach is no longer effective.

“During the pandemic … at that point we should have had the authority to sort of suspend accepting any applications,” she said.

Under C-12, cabinet would have to authorize any such orders, which would be temporary.

Diab said getting that authorization would not be easy and the proposed power to limit or cancel immigration applications is meant to be used only in extreme circumstances, when public safety or national security is threatened.

Julia Sande, a human rights and policy lawyer with Amnesty International Canada, said it’s misleading to suggest these powers would have been used during the pandemic period.

She said Canada gave temporary foreign workers in the agriculture and food processing sectors some exemptions to travel restrictions that were in place during the pandemic.

“There were efforts to expand people’s ability to be here because there was a recognition at that time — we were calling workers heroes, including temporary workers who came, who were on the front lines, carrying out critical, essential work,” Sande said. “So at that point in time, there was an effort to ensure that people could come here.”

In the early days of the pandemic, employers were required to pay temporary foreign workers during mandatory quarantine periods upon arrival. Unvaccinated temporary foreign workers in agriculture and food processing, meanwhile, were allowed into the country while a vaccine mandate was in place for other international travellers in early 2022.

Under C-12, people who have been in the country for more than a year could no longer file claims for asylum — a rule the legislation would make retroactive to June 24, 2020.

Those barred from filing asylum claims could still apply for a pre-removal risk assessment and could claim asylum if they can prove they face a risk of persecution or harm if they’re removed.

The bill also would make it easier for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to share applicant information with federal, provincial and territorial partners.

“It’s really to try and respond more fairly and flexibly, for the safety of Canadians as well as the safety individuals that are coming to claim asylum,” Diab said.

More than 300 civil society groups, including Amnesty International, have called on the government to scrap the bills, saying they limit the ability of people to claim asylum and threaten due process.

“Both Bill C-2 and 12 are targeting our neighbours and vulnerable communities in very similar ways that people are being targeted by the U.S. administration,” Sande said.

“Some of these things, I think, genuinely are put in place to appease Trump and appear to be aimed at making Canada more like the U.S. right now.”

Bill C-2 was introduced after Trump imposed his first tariffs on Canada. Trump rationalized the tariffs by claiming Canada wasn’t doing enough to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking at the border.

Trump used the same rationale for his identical tariffs on Mexico, despite the fact that illegal crossings and fentanyl from Canada make up a very small percentage of illegal activity at the U.S. borders.

He is now increasingly disregarding the requirement of an appropriation before spending money,” said David Super, a Georgetown Law professor and expert in federal budget law.
Trump’s official legal justification is that the Pentagon is using funds that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth determined have a “reasonable, logical relationship” to military pay and benefits.
That “reasonable, logical” connection would be “consistent with applicable law,” including the so-called purpose statute, Trump’s directive released Wednesday says.
The official said the military is a special category within the government that Congress always intended to keep fully funded.","It’s been a year full of money grabs by an executive branch that puts less weight on Congress’ “power of the purse” than any since the Nixon administration.

But President Donald Trump’s latest budget maneuver — paying military salaries out of unrelated research funding — has so openly flouted federal law as to make lawmakers’ appropriations authority, and Congress itself, practically irrelevant, critics argue.

“President Trump has been ignoring Congress’ authority to say which funds should be spent since the early days of this administration. He is now increasingly disregarding the requirement of an appropriation before spending money,” said David Super, a Georgetown Law professor and expert in federal budget law.

“This renders the appropriations process essentially meaningless if the president continues along this course,” Super said.

Trump’s official legal justification is that the Pentagon is using funds that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth determined have a “reasonable, logical relationship” to military pay and benefits.

That “reasonable, logical” connection would be “consistent with applicable law,” including the so-called purpose statute, Trump’s directive released Wednesday says. That’s a longstanding part of federal budget law requiring that appropriations “shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.”

In an interview, a senior administration official fleshed out what they argue is the reasonable, logical use of unspent R&D funds to pay the troops.

The official said the military is a special category within the government that Congress always intended to keep fully funded. But because appropriations for military personnel accounts expired Sept. 30, the Pentagon had to tap unspent funds that have not yet expired to keep funding the military during a shutdown.

R&D accounts were the obvious place to find this money, given their two-year availability, and one logical connection is that personnel are needed to conduct that research, development, testing and evaluation that those accounts pay for.

‘Pale in comparison’

The argument doesn’t pass the smell test with critics on either side of the aisle, who argue it is simply an illegal power grab.

G. William Hoagland, a longtime Senate GOP budget aide, said Trump’s budget moves are “without precedent” and that President Richard Nixon’s flouting of spending directives — which led to the landmark 1974 budget law’s enactment — “pale in comparison.”

The 1974 law created the modern controls on presidential “impoundments,” requiring the executive branch to obligate funds consistent with enacted appropriations laws — unless Congress passes legislation rescinding certain funds identified by the president.

This year, Congress passed one such rescissions package. But Trump’s budget office has taken heat for freezing appropriated funds using its “apportionment” authority, or responsibility to ensure money isn’t burned through too quickly. In some cases, funding freezes have been blocked in court.

In one high-profile case that’s currently at the Supreme Court, Trump employed what’s known as a “pocket rescission,” or a loophole in the 1974 law requiring Congress to approve rescission requests within 45 days. In this case, the Trump OMB put a hold on $5 billion in foreign assistance funds within 45 days of Sept. 30, when the money expired.

Critics were already up in arms over that move, saying it’s a violation of impoundment law that basically neuters the power of the purse. Now, Trump has gone even further, they say.

Georgetown Law’s Super pointed out that OMB Director Russ Vought, the architect of Trump’s impoundment strategy, has argued that the 1974 law doesn’t require presidents to spend every penny of an appropriation. The law puts a ceiling on that spending, rather than setting a floor, Vought says.

Now, Super said, Trump “apparently does not even believe that” and instead contends the administration is free to spend money it doesn’t have or for purposes Congress did not intend.

Constitutional principles

The purpose statute is separate from the Antideficiency Act, which bars the administration from spending money in excess of available appropriations and is another cornerstone of federal budget law.

The ADA is what requires the government to “shut down” during a funding lapse, other than special “excepted” functions critical to public safety and security, and programs that don’t rely on annual appropriations.

But the purpose statute is considered an equally bedrock constitutional principle, with its roots in Article I: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”

The senior administration official argued tapping Pentagon R&D funds to pay the troops doesn’t run afoul of the ADA because there is clearly money available. It’s the “purpose” of it that’s in question, and Congress’ intention in providing Pentagon appropriations, including for two fiscal years, was to have a functioning military.

When there is a functioning military personnel account, that’s what would fund salaries, the White House argues. So when those accounts have no money, it has to come from somewhere else.

And the president’s constitutional duties as commander in chief adds to this being a special case, which Trump alluded to in his “national security memorandum” laying out the troop funding maneuver on Wednesday. The president has identified a need for that money to carry out his duty to defend the nation, the thinking goes.

Other factors in the decision: the Pentagon couldn’t use “general transfer authority” to simply shift the R&D money into personnel accounts, because of a restriction on transferring money into expired accounts.

In addition, there’s a constitutional roadblock to tapping Pentagon funds appropriated in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation package (PL 119-21), which many expected would be the source of cash to pay the troops.

Article I restricts Congress’ power “to raise and support Armies” to appropriations that are available for no more than two years, as the R&D funds appropriated in the fiscal 2025 spending law are. The money appropriated in reconciliation is available for five years, making that a no-go.

‘King’ Trump?

It’s such a politically unassailable move — ensuring the troops got paid on time, despite the shutdown — that the Trump administration knew going in that any on-the-record critiques would lead to swift recriminations.

Predictably, no Democrats have stepped up to publicly oppose the funding shift in and of itself. But some question the legality of it and argue it further undermines trust in the appropriations process.

“I don’t know that he’s got legal authority … to do any of this,” Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., said Thursday. “We all want to pay the troops, but … these complicated schemes to pay the troops that he’s using is just evidence of how badly they want to avoid negotiations.”

Even some Republicans are chafing a little at the erosion of lawmakers’ authority.

“It’s always preferable that Congress not only be consulted, but when it comes to appropriations, the Constitution requires the appropriations to be done by Congress,” said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., who like Murphy is a senior Appropriations Committee member.

Bobby Kogan, a former Democratic budget aide, said Trump’s move to pay the troops using money that wasn’t appropriated for that purpose is “going to further neuter and further destroy our appropriations process.”

“At this point Trump is an appropriations king; he gets to do whatever he wants,” said Kogan, now with the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

As for Appropriations Committee members, Kogan said: “Obviously they have an existential question for themselves about what their job is.”

""This isn’t just politics. It’s democracy versus dictatorship. And together, we’re choosing democracy,"" according to the No Kings website.

The demonstrations are expected to bring thousands of Michigan residents to the streets, for the second time this year.

""Recognizing the historical and central importance of protests and demonstrations, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects your right to protest, assemble, and petition,"" the ACLU says on its website.

Trump has taken several steps challenging the extent of his powers and presidential norms. His approval rating has remained around 40%, with some pollsters reporting a few points higher, according to recent polls.

Here's a look at why people protesting President Trump's policies.

Why are people protesting Trump?

Since taking office in January, Trump's actions in his second term are redefining executive power and challenging presidential norms.

Partners under the No Kings banner, which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Michigan Climate Action Network, are protesting the president for a multitude of reasons including disagreement with immigration, foreign policy, federal spending cuts, civil rights, reproductive rights, the stripping of diversity commitments, tariffs and climate change, among other things.

""In June, millions of everyday Americans from every walk of life peacefully took to the streets and declared with one voice: No Kings,"" the No Kings website says. ""The world saw the power of the people, and President Trump’s attempt at a coronation collapsed under the strength of a movement rising against his abuses of power.

""Now, he’s doubling down — sending militarized agents into our communities, silencing voters, and handing billionaires giveaways while families struggle,"" according to the No Kings website.

Why are many protesters wearing yellow?

According to No Kings, people have asked for a simple, shared way to show unity.

""Throughout history, people who have come together in protest against authoritarian regimes have utilized a color that is easy to see among a sea of thousands,"" No Kings explained. ""Yellow is a bright, unmistakable reminder that millions of us stand together in the belief that America belongs to its people, not to kings.""

The group also pointed to Hong Kong, where protesters carried yellow umbrellas, and said yellow ribbons are emblems of hope, accountability and reform. Eastern Ukrainians' yellow ribbon movement is a sign of resistance against Russian aggression, the group added.

Where can I gather to protest?

Public areas, like streets, sidewalks and in front of government buildings, are open to protests as long as you are not blocking access or interfering with operations, the ACLU says.

How can I find a demonstration to join?

The No Kings website lists every scheduled protest in Michigan, and allows people to search for locations nationwide, and in other countries.

Lieff Professor of Law, Columbia Law School faculty experts Gillian Metzger, Elora Mukherjee, Kate Redburn, and Thomas P. Schmidt unpacked important Supreme Court decisions with a focus on rulings on the emergency docket—commonly called the “shadow docket”—which are issued outside of formal opinions.

Daniel Abebe, Dean and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Law, introduced the event and said that the timing of the Supreme Court’s rulings has created a tradition of faculty members providing analysis at the LCI SCOTUS Roundup early in the fall semester. This offers an opportunity to “leverage the fantastic expertise of our wonderful faculty,” who regularly provide commentary in the media about the court’s rulings and “play a central role in shaping the national conversation,” he said.

Federal Agency Independence

Emergency orders granted by the Supreme Court that allowed the removal of members of independent government agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), are part of a decade-and-a-half-long trend of the Roberts court invalidating regulatory schemes and administrative structures, said Gillian Metzger, Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law.

“The Supreme Court, in its recent decisions, kept saying that it’s not overturning Humphrey’s Executor,” the 1935 ruling that prevents presidents from removing independent agency members from their positions except for cause, Metzger said. But in the NLRB and MSPB cases, the court reiterated its position in previous cases that “the president can remove those who exercise executive power on their behalf, subject to narrow exceptions,” she said.

Allowing the president more power to remove independent agency leadership, as the court’s recent decisions do, “has been the trend of the court’s decisions,” Metzger said. “What is a little bit surprising is [that] they were doing this against the backdrop of a president who was exercising pretty aggressive executive power. And it didn’t seem to stop them one inch.”

Immigration

Elora Mukherjee, Jerome L. Greene Clinical Professor of Law, spoke about four emergency docket immigration decisions: two that permitted the end of Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua; one that allowed deportations to South Sudan; and Noem v. Perdomo, an emergency ruling in which the court allowed immigration enforcement stops in Los Angeles to continue based on race or ethnicity, command of English, location, and type of job.

Mukherjee said that the rulings show that the Supreme Court is increasingly relying on the shadow docket “to issue hugely consequential immigration decisions without adequate reasoning—or any reasoning—and without letting lower court proceedings play out as they should.” Action by federal immigration authorities to detain and deport immigrants “is pushing the bounds of … executive authority well past the system of checks and balances that has been set up in our U.S. Constitution,” she said.

The Perdomo decision is “an invitation to law enforcement nationwide to engage in racial profiling,” Mukherjee said. “And through this one-paragraph decision on the shadow docket, the Supreme Court has turned America, our nation, into a show-me-your-papers nation where, depending on what you look like, you need to carry papers to prove that you belong in this country, and you should not be subject to summary deportation.” She added that the Supreme Court “has essentially become a rubber stamp for executive branch immigration policy, even policies that are clearly unconstitutional and illegal.”

Medical Care and Gender

U.S. v. Skrmetti upheld a Tennessee state law restricting medical care for transgender minors. The court found that the law applied to individuals based on age and medical treatment rather than on sex, which would have required a higher standard of review, said Associate Professor of Law Kate Redburn. As a result, the ruling “leaves open a lot of questions for both the rights of transgender people under the 14th Amendment but also the status of sex-based equal protection law in general,” Redburn said.

The scope of a “medical-context exception to sex classifications” is unclear, Redburn added, querying whether it could apply to “contraception or other kinds of sex-inflected medical regulation that’s not exclusive to trans people.”

Skrmetti did not cover what level of scrutiny would apply to a claim of transgender status discrimination, Redburn said. But, since the court has agreed to hear cases on the participation of transgender athletes on sports teams, “we'll probably have an answer to some of these open sex equality questions in the next year.”

Nationwide Injunctions

In Trump v. CASA Inc., the Supreme Court as a whole for the first time addressed the issue of universal injunctions in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump that sought to restrict birthright citizenship. The court ruled that lower courts could not issue universal injunctions that prohibit enforcement of executive actions beyond the plaintiffs before the court because that remedy was not available to the courts in the founding era.

Like emergency rulings from the highest court, universal—or nationwide—injunctions from lower courts jumped in 2025, said Associate Professor of Law Thomas P. Schmidt, with about 25 issued so far this year compared with more than 100 in the nation’s history. “Presidents of both parties, when in power, have challenged their propriety in court,” he said.

The birthright citizenship order had been blocked by lower courts, which issued universal injunctions against its implementation. In appealing to the Supreme Court, the administration did not argue that the executive order was lawful or defend it as consistent with the 14th Amendment, Schmidt said. “Instead, the only argument that the administration made to the Supreme Court was that the injunction granted by the courts below was too broad because it extended beyond the parties to the case.”",https://www.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/architectural_details_jrp0733_0130.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:01:59.446991

Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were ""tremendous levels"" of crime in the city.
In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month.","The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois after lower courts blocked the deployment.

As legal challenges to President Trump's push to send military troops to Democratic-led cities make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue.

In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to ""prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety"" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois. Sauer argued that the judge's ruling ""improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.""

Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state.

The Trump administration is ""going to litigate this as much as we can,"" Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with ABC's This Week on Sunday. ""We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.""

The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening.

President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments.

The president is currently in a legal battle with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were ""tremendous levels"" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked. A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.

In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.

But since Ellis issued her order, agents have deployed tear gas multiple times in Chicago, including in Albany Park last weekend and following a collision Tuesday between Border Patrol agents and another vehicle on the city’s Southeast Side.
It was an order.” Note: Loevy & Loevy have done legal work for WTTW News.","Russell Hott, the field director for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in Chicago, is exiting his post and returning to Washington, a day after a federal judge in Illinois demanded he appear in court to answer questions about his agency’s continued use of tear gas in and around the city.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday confirmed Hott, whom it said was serving in Chicago on an interim basis, is heading back to D.C. as part of a “planned return” to resume his permanent post as field operations director there.

That shift was revealed in a footnote included in a new filing Friday morning by the Trump administration in an ongoing lawsuit over the continued use of tear gas and other so-called “riot control” weapons by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Illinois.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis on Thursday said she was “not happy,” a week after she granted a temporary restraining order barring the use of such weapons against journalists, protesters and anyone not posing an immediate threat to immigration enforcement agents.

The lawsuit was brought after a series of clashes between protesters and agents at ICE’s processing center in suburban Broadview. But since Ellis issued her order, agents have deployed tear gas multiple times in Chicago, including in Albany Park last weekend and following a collision Tuesday between Border Patrol agents and another vehicle on the city’s Southeast Side.

“There’s a reason the Chicago Police Department has policies about car chases and where they occur, and where they need to stop,” Ellis said Thursday, suggesting the tense situation resulted from Border Patrol agents using tactics not appropriate in the nation’s third-largest city.

“We’re not on the border. We are in an urban, densely populated area where crowds are going to converge when there’s a commotion, where appropriate crowd control is important,” she said. “Trying to apprehend and detain people is very, very different when you’re in an urban setting than when you’re out on the border.”

Ellis demanded that Hott appear in court next Monday morning in order to “explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.”

But in a new filing Friday, the Department of Justice asked Ellis to reconsider, stating it has since learned of Hott’s departure and offered instead the appearance of Kyle C. Harvick, a Border Patrol deputy incident commander working under the ongoing “Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

During a brief phone hearing Friday afternoon, Ellis said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government intends to present at Monday’s hearing, but added she’s been “very clear” that she wants to hear from someone who can shed more light on “what’s been going on over the last week.”

“Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” she said. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”

The DOJ claims that the presence of Harvick, rather than Hott, would be more appropriate after DHS determined that it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in those recent tear gas incidents.

In response, attorneys from the law firm of Loevy & Loevy — which represents the journalists and protesters who brought the lawsuit — noted the timeline of Hott’s sudden departure shortly after he was asked to appear in court.

“How convenient,” attorney David Owens wrote in a filing Friday.

“Plaintiffs object because the government should not be allowed to play a game of hot potato with its different agencies using force against civilians in this District,” they continued. “This Court should order Hott to appear as an ICE supervisor, particularly given that the government has not represented in its filing that ICE was uninvolved.”

Ellis on Thursday also said she intended to expand her existing restraining order, requiring all federal agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz and who have body cameras to have them on during encounters with protesters.

On Friday, she said that decision was not “up for debate” and that she would be amending that order to add in that new requirement immediately.

“This was not a suggestion,” she said. “It wasn’t a hint, it wasn’t a topic of conversion. It was an order.”

Federal law enforcement agencies “have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence,” the department said.
While a US president can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, Trump is testing the limits of those powers by sending troops to cities controlled by his political adversaries.
Illinois and Chicago sued the administration over the deployment.","CHICAGO: Donald Trump’s administration asked the US Supreme Court on Friday to allow his deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, as the Republican president moves to dispatch military personnel to a growing number of Democratic-led locales and expand the use of the armed forces for domestic purposes.

The Justice Department asked the court to block a judge’s ruling that halted the deployment of hundreds of troops over the objection of Illinois state officials and local leaders, while litigation challenging Trump’s plan continues.

Given events on the ground, the judge questioned the administration’s stated reasons for sending in the military. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s ruling on Thursday, also doubting the administration’s stated justification.

The administration has stated that danger to federal property and personnel posed by protests against Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement policies justified the president’s deployment of troops. In a written filing, the Justice Department called the assessment by local officials of these protests as “implausibly rosy” and urged immediate action.

Federal law enforcement agencies “have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence,” the department said. “Local forces have failed to respond, or unaccountably delayed their response, even when federal agents face life-threatening violence.”

The Supreme Court asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the Justice Department’s request by Monday afternoon.

“Donald Trump will keep trying to invade Illinois with troops — and we will keep defending the sovereignty of our state,” Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker wrote on social media. “Militarizing our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy. What will come next?“

Trump ordered National Guard troops to Chicago, the third-largest US city, and Portland, Oregon following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C. Trump has sought to use military forces to suppress protests and support domestic immigration enforcement.

Trump and his allies have described these cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests in need of military intervention. Democratic mayors and governors, along with other Trump critics, have said these claims are a false account of the situation and a pretext for sending troops to punish adversaries, accusing Trump of abusing his power.

Federal judges have expressed skepticism over the administration’s view of events on the ground. Demonstrations over the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts have been largely peaceful and limited in size, according to local officials, far from the “war zone” conditions described by Trump.

Testing the limits

Though Trump has suggested troops can be used to tackle crime, National Guard and other military personnel under US law are not typically permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. While a US president can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, Trump is testing the limits of those powers by sending troops to cities controlled by his political adversaries.

The legal dispute centers on Trump’s invocation of a federal law that allows a president to federalize National Guard troops only in the case of rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The administration this month federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and also ordered more Texas National Guard troops into the state.

In the face of criticism and pushback from local leaders, Trump escalated his threats, calling on October 8 for the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois, both Democrats, to be jailed, accusing them of failing to protect immigration officers.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration over the deployment. On October 9, Chicago-based US District Judge April Perry, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the move.

Perry said the administration’s claims of violence during protests at an immigration facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, where a small group of demonstrators had gathered daily for weeks, were unreliable.

In a written opinion, Perry faulted administration officials for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence.”

There is no evidence of a danger of rebellion in Illinois or that the law is not being enforced, the judge said, adding that a National Guard deployment “will only add fuel to the fire.”

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Perry’s order blocking the deployment, concluding that “the facts do not justify the president’s actions in Illinois.” Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.",,N,,2025-10-18 15:58:22.697447

In the second year, minimum ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.

The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only male inmates.

Gov. Jim Pillen’s office said the contract would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.”

Projected cost savings

Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, which is largely Pillen’s main legislative lobbying arm, said in an email to state senators Friday that the arrangement is “designed to maximize fiscal benefit.”

“This new revenue model, when weighed against the current annual facility operating expense from general funds, demonstrates a significant financial advantage for the State of Nebraska,” Zoeller wrote.

Speaker the Nebraska Legislature John Arch of La Vista could not be immediately reached for comment.

Pillen’s office said the facility, which officials have said would be rebranded the “Cornhusker Clink,” will remain state-owned, and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services will continue to run it.

Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys signed the contract on behalf of Nebraska. The contract states Nebraska and ICE could agree to use the Work Ethic Camp this way for up to five years.

Pillen’s office now estimates that the state could begin accepting detainees before November. Jeffreys has said he hopes the facility can be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement.

“I’m very grateful to President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for their strong leadership in securing our nation’s southern border and addressing illegal immigration through initiatives like this,” Pillen said Friday in a statement.

Minors are not supposed to be housed at the repurposed prison. Any young people sent there must be relocated within 72 hours and be housed away from adults during that time, the contract states.

Reached Friday, State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said he hadn’t yet reviewed the contract but was pleased to hear one was signed. He said was still supportive of using those facilities “to enforce the law.”

“I just knew that we were going to cover all of our expenses, but I didn’t know we were going to make that much money,” Clements said. “I’m pleased to hear that.”

He said the extra funds could also help Nebraska’s budget situation and that “every little bit helps” as the state continues to face a projected budget deficit.

‘Public has a right to know’

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha blasted the contract Friday as “not just morally wrong, it’s unconstitutional” because of legislative checks and balances. She criticized provisions in the contract that ban videotaping, recording and public access to the state-owned facility, which would be contrary to how other state facilities operate.

“Nebraska taxpayers are funding this prison, and the public has a right to know what’s happening inside,” Hunt said. “When oversight is blocked, abuse thrives.”

State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha warned that ICE could withhold or deduct state payments for alleged noncompliance at the facility and that if detainees’ rights are violated, Nebraska taxpayers could be on the hook for any legal costs.

Hunt said that if ICE or state officials bar senators from conducting oversight, it would violate the separation of powers and obstruct lawmakers’ constitutional duties.

It wasn’t immediately clear why officials did not release the contract for 17 days after Jeffreys and an unnamed federal official signed it Sept. 30, hours before the ongoing federal shutdown. Pillen’s office and Jeffreys’ agency had denied multiple public records requests over that span, including one from the Examiner requesting a copy of the contract on Oct. 2.

Prison transition specifics

Attorney Jennifer Huxoll in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office told a Red Willow County District Court judge Thursday that she did not know when the facility would open but that all state inmates had been moved out. A Correctional Services spokesperson could not immediately answer Friday specifically where the inmates had been relocated.

Zoeller said all remaining state inmates were transferred to other facilities last week. There were 186 inmates at the facility on Aug. 19 when Pillen announced the plan.

Huxoll had also indicated Nebraska had entered multiple contracts, though she did not specify with whom. Jeffreys’ agency is currently contracting with a Lincoln-based fencing company for $750,000 to build a razor-wire fence around the Work Ethic Camp, which Huxoll said Thursday was 90% complete.

Zoeller said internal modifications will continue so Nebraska can house up to 300 detainees, up from about 200, and allow for virtual and in-person attorney visits and court proceedings. Providing additional housing and legal space will involve converting rehabilitative programming space. Zoeller said an intruder detection system had also been installed, and armed staff will constantly patrol the perimeter.

Staffing will increase from 97 full-time employees to 171. Zoeller said the new positions will provide coverage for repurposed spaces, housing units and transportation. Transportation will be reimbursed monthly at $10,816.67, with regular and overtime rates for on-call guards.

Minimum staffing levels required of the state under the contract have been redacted, as has information on handling emergency situations in receiving or discharging detainees.

“NDCS has developed staff training specific to the management of the detainee population and is exploring options to allow for the utilization of electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees,” Zoeller said.

Separation of powers lawsuit

State lawmakers created the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. It opened four years later. The prison is primarily designed to reduce Nebraska prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere.

Thirteen McCook residents, plus a former state lawmaker, filed a lawsuit Wednesday to try to stop the transition and reopening of the Work Ethic Camp. They argue that because Pillen and Jeffreys did not receive legislative approval first, the transition of the facility violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

13 McCook residents, former lawmaker sue to stop Nebraska-ICE detention center

Red Willow District Judge Patrick Heng will hear arguments next Friday on whether to grant a temporary injunction. He declined this week to block further action in the meantime.

State officials did not immediately answer whether they would begin to accept federal detainees before the temporary injunction motion could be heard. A temporary injunction would pause action until the lawsuit can be more holistically argued and evaluated.

In 1958, voters gave the Legislature authority over the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions. The latest lawsuit targets that constitutional provision as well as a state law that says state agencies can’t change or divert from the “use or purpose, kind or class” of public buildings in which lawmakers have appropriated tax dollars for.

Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

Nick Grandgenett, an attorney on behalf of the McCook residents, told District Judge Heng that state law also does not give Jeffreys’ agency the authority to house federal detainees.

“At its core, this is not about immigration,” Grandgenett said Thursday. “This is about our constitutional republican form of government.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0456-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 01:57:35.635380

According to the petition, ICE agents entered at least four separate courthouses across Chicago’s Cook County in September alone, including the Cook County Domestic Violence Courthouse.
In a statement, the Cook County Public Defender’s office said the order was urgently needed to ensure that courthouses remain accessible to the public regardless of immigration status.
Two state lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would codify the ban on civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at courthouses across the entire state of Illinois.
Vasquez’s office said she is one of two Cook County commissioners who authored a resolution asking other county agencies to alert the commissioners when ICE agents are seen inside county buildings or on public property.","As the Trump administration ratchets up its targeting of immigrant communities across the Chicagoland area, elected officials are looking for any tool they can find to protect their residents from militarized raids and roving bands of Border Patrol officers.

Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans banned civil arrests at county courthouses across Chicago this week, preventing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from arresting and attempting to deport people who show up to public courtrooms for matters unrelated to immigration.

The order went into effect on Tuesday and comes as federal judges and public officials in Illinois continue to push back against President Donald Trump and Operation Midway Blitz, ICE’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the Chicago area, after weeks of militarized chaos and violent arrests.

Immigration violations are a civil, not criminal, offense, despite the Trump administration’s repeated attempts to brand them that way. Under a policy established shortly after Trump took office that opened formerly protected areas such as schools and churches to immigration enforcement, ICE agents have arrived at Chicago area courthouses masked and unannounced to arrest people showing up for regular hearings, often without arrest warrants or uniforms clearly identifying them as ICE agents, according to Cook County Commissioner Jessica Vasquez.

Vasquez said local officials and advocates were particularly alarmed after ICE made an arrest in September outside a courthouse that hears cases filed by victims of domestic violence.

“Broadly across Cook County we have seen ICE agents target our courthouses for arrests, and these are individuals who are being compelled to come to court, they are coming to hearings they are mandated to go to,” Vasquez told Truthout in an interview. “Your government is asking you to come in for this, and then you are essentially being targeted by this federal agency for arrest.”

The ban on civil arrests at Cook County courts follows similar moves by judges and local officials inOregon,New York, New Jersey and beyond to limit ICE’s ability to arrest people in and around public courtrooms, including civil litigants and crime victims. Since Trump took office, ICE has targeted undocumented people who attempt to comply with everyday legal obligations — including immigration check-ins required of those seeking permanent legal residence in the United States.

Federal detention data and reports from Chicago and across the country suggest ICE is targeting anyone who is unable to produce documentation regardless of their criminal history or how long they have lived in the United States.

As part of Operation Midway Blitz, ICE agents have enraged and terrified residents with a series of militarized and highly performative immigration sweeps and raids across Chicago in recent weeks. Despite a well-documented drop in homicides and shootings recently, Trump has described Chicago as a crime-ridden “hellhole” and is pushing to deploy the National Guard against the wishes of city leaders and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

A federal judge on October 9 issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s National Guard deployment for two weeks. A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected the administration’s appeal and upheld the ruling.

More than a dozen lawyers, legal aid groups, and civil rights organizations petitioned Judge Evans for the ban on civil immigration arrests at county courthouses on October 1. According to the petition, ICE agents entered at least four separate courthouses across Chicago’s Cook County in September alone, including the Cook County Domestic Violence Courthouse.

“The reason we moved with such urgency was because we are also seeing how they are entering courthouses in New York City … they are masked, don’t have identification visible, and they come in and you don’t know what they are there for, essentially,” said Vasquez, who called Judge Evans to act on the petition.

In a statement, the Cook County Public Defender’s office said the order was urgently needed to ensure that courthouses remain accessible to the public regardless of immigration status. “No longer will federal immigration agents be permitted to use our court system as a way to target people who are complying with court orders or supporting loved ones,” the public defender’s office said.

Two state lawmakers recently introduced legislation that would codify the ban on civil arrests, including immigration arrests, at courthouses across the entire state of Illinois. Experts say states could also pass laws prohibiting staff at courthouses and state agencies from working directly with ICE.

Vasquez publicly called for the ban on civil arrests on October 3, the same day an ICE agent manhandled and handcuffed Chicago Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes while she was attempting to visit a constituent who was targeted by ICE while receiving treatment inside a hospital. The ICE agent reportedly threatened Fuentes with arrest before releasing her outside the hospital, and the alderwoman is reportedly preparing to file a lawsuit in response.

In a video of the incident, Fuentes can be seen asking plainclothed ICE agents for identification and a warrant before one of them grabs her, spins her around and puts her in handcuffs. Fuentes, who is Puerto Rican and represents a historically Latinx area of Chicago, told Block Club Chicago on Tuesday that the same ICE agent has apparently been seen in other raids in Chicago, and alleged that he was one of the agents caught on camera aggressively pushing a woman into a car in a Chicago neighborhood.

“Us documenting the atrocities, the constitutional violations and the violence that we are witnessing is what we need to do in this moment,” Fuentes said.

Vasquez’s office said she is one of two Cook County commissioners who authored a resolution asking other county agencies to alert the commissioners when ICE agents are seen inside county buildings or on public property. Those alerts go to volunteer community groups that respond to ICE operations in residential neighborhoods.

Vasquez said the Cook County Board is also looking for ways to prevent third party data brokers from mining county databases and contracts for personal information on residents and selling the data to ICE. The Trump administration is allowing ICE unprecedented access to personal information on millions of Americans held by the federal government, including health and tax records.

For example, Vasquez said private contractor LexisNexis manages data used by county criminal courts, and the company also has a lucrative $22 million data and surveillance contract with ICE that has so far avoided scrutiny from regulators. Critics say this gives ICE a “digital backdoor” to surveil people in the criminal legal system.

“We need to do everything we can to save as many people as we can as quickly as possible, and that means leaving no stone unturned,” Vasquez said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234389566-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:57:37.316365

And wouldn’t that counter the public policy behind the public records law itself?” And Eckerstrom pressed Pierce on the potential impact of attorneys’ fees.
“Couldn’t you chill people from filing public records requests if they don’t have deep pockets?” Eckerstrom asked.","Key Points:

Santa Cruz County sought clarity on releasing election and voting tally data

County denied request for ballot images and sued requester

Judges question impact on transparency, public access to records

A case poised to determine whether a county can sue a public records requester to obtain court-ordered clarity is pending at the Arizona Court of Appeals.

Under public records law, when someone requests a public record and is denied access, they have the authority to challenge the decision in court. If successful, they are entitled to recoup their legal costs.

But, when Santa Cruz County faced some uncertainty over whether to release an elections-related record, it decided to sue the organization requesting the record to get a final word from the court.

The Court of Appeals is now tasked with deciding whether Santa Cruz County does, in fact, have the authority to seek a declaratory action instead of becoming a defendant in a special action.

After the 2022 primary, Americans United for Democracy, Integrity and Transparency in Elections, also known as AUDIT USA, sent a public records request to Santa Cruz County for ballot images and the Cast Vote Record, or CVR, a dataset that anonymously shows each vote cast.

Santa Cruz County denied the request for ballot images due to a state law that shields access but initially agreed to transmit the CVR, along with some additional requests from the organization.

But on the day AUDIT USA expected the county to send the records, Santa Cruz County and its election director Alma Schultz changed course and filed a lawsuit in Pima County seeking a declaratory judgment on whether the CVR constituted a public record.

The county took the position that the CVR was protected by the same law shielding digital ballot images and sued first in anticipation of AUDIT USA doing the same.

AUDIT USA did not sue the county. But, Santa Cruz continued in its crusade for court clarification on the CVR and public records law.

Pima County Superior Court dismissed the lawsuit, denied reconsideration, and then rejected the claim a third time after the Arizona Court of Appeals remanded for further inquiry into whether a renewed request from AUDIT USA for the CVR could provide grounds for the suit.

The question is once again on appeal, with the Court of Appeals now considering whether a declaratory action is a reasonable course of action for a county to take when faced with a questionable public records decision.

In a draft decision issued before oral argument, the Arizona Court of Appeals again found the county did not have a justiciable controversy.

But the panel heard arguments Oct. 14 ahead of issuing a final ruling.

Justin Pierce, attorney for Santa Cruz, argued that counties are stuck “waiting to be sued” but noted the declaratory judgments act should allow a party to strike first if there is an actual case or controversy.

Judge Peter Eckerstrom pressed on how far a declaratory action statute can stretch.

“The declaratory action statute is certainly to be construed liberally, but it’s not to be construed to require a court to issue advisory opinions to every governmental entity that has to make a tough decision, right?” Eckerstrom said.

Pierce agreed, but said the county had public officials subject to liability in a “potential, but realistic cause of action.”

He said the case at hand is not a request for an advisory decision, but rather a situation where the county needs clarity given AUDIT USA’s history of litigation.

AUDIT USA’s website clarifies its aim at auditing ballot images and notes its work “often entails filing lawsuits against election officials who do not follow federal requirements to maintain election materials.”

But attorney for AUDIT USA Bill Risner countered the characterization of the organization as litigious and noted the organization had only sued once before in Maricopa County.

Risner argued the county never had a real conflict because the county never formally denied the request, leaving no controversy to litigate. He said there would not have been a difference if the county had decided to deny the records request and claimed that AUDIT USA never had any intention to sue Santa Cruz County over the denial.

Risner noted that litigation is not the only option available to the county, noting the ability to consult the secretary of sState or the attorney general.

As for the option to go to the attorney general for an advisory opinion, Pierce once again noted the need for some binding precedent.

“We believe we have the right to request a judicial determination on that to protect the county and to protect the county officials who are making decisions on these things in good faith,” Pierce said.

Eckerstrom was not convinced, noting that the current state law explicitly allows public records requestors to file a special action, not the other way around.

“You’re saying that we should rule, as a matter of law, that anytime someone files public records request that in your bag of options, it’s not to say yes or no, there’s a third option, file a lawsuit against them or a (declaratory judgment) action in a Superior Court, because we can’t decide whether to say yes or no,” Eckerstrom said.

He continued, “Doesn’t that impose at minimum attorney fee costs on people seeking public records? And wouldn’t that counter the public policy behind the public records law itself?”

And Eckerstrom pressed Pierce on the potential impact of attorneys’ fees.

“Couldn’t you chill people from filing public records requests if they don’t have deep pockets?” Eckerstrom asked.

Pierce argued it was appropriate for a county to pursue a judicial answer and said the parties sued could be named out of necessity, or enter an appearance if they decided not to defend the suit.

But Judge Sean Brearcliffe said that situation could give way to a county choosing a defendant who would be unable to put up a legal fight.

Pierce contended the courts could still serve as a safeguard in that scenario, and he again stressed the county has no path forward to get a judicial determination.

The disclosure of the CVR issue is still unclear, though, and Pierce noted that all the county has been asking for is to address the legality directly.

“Wouldn’t you get that if someone thought it was important enough to file a special action?” Judge Christopher Staring said.

Pierce said the county could, but it goes back to the central issue of the case, whether the county is compelled to wait for litigation.

“We believe the law is that we’re not. And that’s why we pursued this course. And we believe that the court should remand to the Superior Court to make a decision on this once and for all on the merits,” Pierce said.

Ken Bennett, chair for AUDIT USA and former lawmaker, said he, Risner and director John Brakey were “cautiously optimistic” given the draft ruling and the “tenor of (the judges’) questions today.”

A spokesperson for Santa Cruz County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Counties typically deny or heavily redact requests for the CVR, fearing a violation of voter privacy by releasing data showing how people voted.

And, state law requires election officers to “ensure that electronic data from and electronic or digital images of ballots are protected from physical and electronic access, including unauthorized copying or transfer.”

Lawmakers have attempted to make the CVR a public record in the past, though none have been successful.

In the 2025 session, Sen. Mark Finchem introduced a CVR bill but hit a wall at the Governor’s Office.

“As secretary of state, I protected the right of every Arizonan to make their voice heard at the ballot box,” Gov. Katie Hobbs wrote in her veto letter. “This bill would place constitutionally protected voter privacy at risk.”",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2024/03/Judge-gavel-justice-court.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:57:57.280592

Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as ""lawless"" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.

The resolution(link is external), cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.

""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News. ""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""

The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included(link is external) roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.

Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz(link is external), a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.

On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas(link is external) during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers(link is external) operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was ""a little startled"" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. ""I live in Chicago,"" Ellis said. ""And I'm not blind.""

Johnson told reporters that ""ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,"" adding that Republicans ""stand for law enforcement.""

Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles ""fuels impersonation of immigration officers"" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who ""understand the importance of not having government overreach.""

On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. ""CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers ""are authorized to defend themselves and others"" and that DHS ""reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.""

The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.

Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.

""I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,"" he said. ""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.

“In the wake of the Trump Administration’s continued cruel actions, I am doing everything in my power to protect Providence’s immigrant community and I applaud the work to prioritize and update the Community Relations Act. I am thankful to have worked collaboratively with Council leadership on changes to their proposed amendments that align with my executive order and remove language that would have made the City and our taxpayers vulnerable to unnecessary lawsuits,” said Smiley.

“These changes will help to protect our City from dangerous financial liabilities, continue to protect our immigrant communities, and support our officers to continue their nationally recognized community policing practices,” Smiley added.

The amendments now require one more passage by the full council, with a vote scheduled for November 6. The council also passed a resolution relative to virtual court hearings.

“In Providence, we take pride in being a welcoming city where every neighbor deserves to feel safe,” said Councilor Miguel Sanchez (Ward 6), the prime sponsor of the amendments. “Across the country, we’ve seen federal immigration agents bring chaos and trauma into local communities. These amendments make clear that here in Providence, our police will not be part of that harm. Our immigrant neighbors are the backbone of this city, and they deserve safety, dignity, and accountability.”

But, the FOP says the ordinance is an overreach.

“Also, the concept that our police officers could face legal consequences (civil or otherwise) for performing their sworn duties is unlawful and disgraceful. Restricting police officers in a way that doesn't allow them to respond properly to potentially dangerous situations without fear of unfair repercussions puts the safety of all members of the public in jeopardy, as a situation could escalate to a point of lost control. Federal law enforcement officers are required to and will respond to threats and force with force of their own, when necessary, but if our police officers have a presence at a volatile scene, then the potential of violence can be deterred,” said the FOP letter signed by President Michael Imondi.

“One not need look any further than to what occurred this past weekend in Chicago, where Chicago police officers were ordered to refrain in a timely manner from attending to a violent and out-of-control scene where federal law enforcement officials were under attack, to see the results of this foolhardy concept,” added Imondi.

The Council office claims the changes are as follows:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not normally tasked with immigration who have recently been deputized by the Trump administration in order to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as those directives are accompanied by a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant. The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CPRA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces allows families, and especially youth, to have more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and more specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all of the restrictions set forth in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow certain types of non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CPRA violations by Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

A two-count indictment returned Thursday evening by a federal grand jury in Des Moines charges Ian Roberts with one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.

Roberts, who is originally from Guyana and worked for two decades in school districts across the country, was detained September 26 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a targeted operation.

Authorities said Roberts fled from agents in his district-issued Jeep Cherokee before being found in a wooded area. Roberts had a handgun wrapped in a towel inside the car, investigators said.

Des Moines Public Schools hired Roberts in 2023 to lead its district of about 30,000 students.

The indictment alleges that he made a “false attestation” on a US Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, claiming he was a US citizen when he knew he was not.

Roberts’ attorney, Alfredo Parrish, didn’t immediately return a phone message.

Federal authorities said an immigration judge issued a final removal order last year, and an appeal to reopen immigration proceedings was rejected earlier this year.

After his detention by ICE, Roberts was transferred to federal custody October 2 on an arrest warrant and charged with unlawfully possessing firearms while being in the US illegally. In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three other weapons were found during a search of Roberts’ home, authorities said. The indictment mentions all four weapons, including two pistols, a rifle and a shotgun.

The district continues to face the fallout, filing a lawsuit against the consulting firm it used to facilitate the superintendent search in 2023.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-26t213225z-128767218-rc289eaikhqs-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-migration-desmoines.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-17 20:03:20.826331

Operation Patriot 2.0, as the agency called it, was run from September 4th to 30th. It said more than 1,461 people were taken into custody in the first Operation Patriot in the state, back in May.

From a total of 1,406 undocumented people detained in Massachusetts last month, more than 600 had ""significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives,"" ICE said in a statement released on Thursday.

""Six of those arrested were documented members of transnational criminal gangs while several others were gang associates,"" the statement said. ""Three of those arrested were known or suspected terrorists.""

ICE arrests in Massachusetts

Among those arrested, according to ICE, were 24-year-old Anderson Stephen Hernandez-Vasquez of Guatemala, who served two years in prison in Woburn for child rape.

Mario Augusto Lopes-Barros, a 42-year-old citizen of Cape Verde, who served time for voluntary manslaughter in Bristol County, and 29-year-old Welington Aristy of the Dominican Republic, who was wanted for possession of fentanyl and other drugs in Massachusetts, were also detained, ICE said.

However, WBZ-TV found that at least some of those arrested in Massachusetts in September had no record of having committed violent or other crimes.

They include Jhon Palacio-Morales of Lowell, who was wrongfully arrested outside his home on September 8, according to his partner. His family said he has no criminal history and was legally allowed to enter the U.S. from Columbia in 2022. But ICE said Palacio-Morales ""is an illegal alien"" who ""unlawfully entered the United States.""

Edgar Hernan Elias Escobar, who was taken into custody on September 17 in Malden, also has no criminal record, according to his attorney, who added that his client has a pending petition to become a permanent U.S. resident. Escobar's family said Friday afternoon he was released on bond on October 11.

WBZ has reached out to ICE's Boston office for comment on both cases but has not heard back yet.

In another case, involving a 16-year-old ICE took into custody in Milford on September 12, the agency later acknowledged that it didn't know his age and ultimately drove the teen back home and released him.

WBZ has also reached out to Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for comments on ICE's announcement. Both have been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

1 Second Circuit Affirms Dismissal of Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims for Lack of Article III Standing

Key Takeaway: On a matter of first impression, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of breach of fiduciary duty claims because the named plaintiffs failed to sufficiently plead that they suffered injury-in-fact.

On August 18, 2025, in Collins v. Northeast Grocery, Inc., No. 24-2339, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals largely affirmed dismissal of a complaint brought by participants in the Northeast Grocery 401(k) plan. The plaintiffs challenged (i) recordkeeping and advisory fees and (ii) the selection and retention of certain plan investment options, including funds they claimed underperformed or used higher-cost share classes when lower-cost share classes were available. The District Court for the Northern District of New York had dismissed the complaint without leave to amend, in part because the plaintiffs had not invested in any of the investment funds they challenged and, thus, failed to plead injury-in-fact.

On appeal, the Second Circuit addressed for the first time whether plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the selection or monitoring of 401(k) plan funds that they did not invest in. The Second Circuit squarely rejected the plaintiffs’ standing theory that allegations of plan-wide mismanagement are sufficient to demonstrate injury-in-fact. The Second Circuit held that such allegations were conclusory and speculative; rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they were affected in a personal and individual way. For this reason, the court held that the plaintiffs lacked constitutional standing and failed to satisfy the class standing test as to their claims concerning funds that they did not invest in. In a separate summary order, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of the remaining breach of fiduciary duty claims for failure to plead a meaningful benchmark. However, the court reversed and remanded one prohibited transaction claim in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Cunningham v. Cornell University.

2 Ninth Circuit Clarifies Law Regarding Whether Plan Language Can Require Arbitration

Key Takeaway: The Ninth Circuit affirms in part and reverses in part a district court’s decision denying motion to compel arbitration.

On August 4, 2025, in Platt v. Sodexo, S.A., No. 23-55737, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court for the Central District of California’s decision denying the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in a case concerning challenges to monthly tobacco surcharges on health insurance plan premiums. In so doing, the Ninth Circuit drew a distinction between moving to compel arbitration of claims brought by an individual plan participant (under ERISA Sections 502(a)(1)(B) & (a)(3)) and moving to compel arbitration of claims brought by a participant on behalf of the plan (under Section 502(a)(2)).

With respect to the claims brought by the plaintiff as an individual plan participant, the Ninth Circuit held that the plan’s arbitration clause was unenforceable as to this plaintiff because it was added to the plan after the plaintiff joined the plan. The court held that, to be bound by the arbitration clause, the plaintiff must consent to it, which the plaintiff did not do. The court noted that, although explicit consent is unnecessary, the plaintiff lacked sufficient notice of the addition of the arbitration clause or that he would be subject to it by virtue of his continued participation in the plan.

With respect to the claims brought on behalf of the plan, the court concluded that the consent of an individual plan participant to arbitrate is not needed; the participant’s unilateral consent to the plan is sufficient consent to the arbitration clause. However, the plan’s arbitration clause also included a class action waiver, which the Ninth Circuit found impermissibly restricts the right of plan participants under ERISA to bring a class action. The court remanded to the district court to determine whether the class action waiver was severable (i.e., whether the arbitration clause permitted the class action waiver to be removed in the event that a court determines that the waiver impermissibly restricts the rights of plan participants). If so, the arbitration clause could still be enforceable. The Ninth Circuit also remanded the case to the district court for it to determine whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable.

3 Defendant Prevails at Trial on Recordkeeping and Share Class Claims

Key Takeaway: The court found that the defendant had prudently monitored a 401(k) plan’s recordkeeping costs and the share classes of its investments.

On August 12, 2025, in McDonald v. Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, No. 22-680, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina entered a full defense judgment for defendant Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) in litigation regarding its 401(k) plan. LabCorp’s motion to dismiss had narrowed the claims, leaving only two surviving claims: the defendant had breached its duty of prudence by failing to monitor the plan’s recordkeeping costs by failing to investigate the availability of lower-cost share classes for its investment options. On Daubert motions, the court had excluded opinions from one of the plaintiffs’ experts regarding what would constitute a reasonable recordkeeping fee for the LabCorp plan but otherwise declined to exclude the experts’ opinions. A bench trial was held from May 5, 2025, through May 8, 2025.

The court entered a judgment for LabCorp on all claims. The court first found that, while it had not excluded most opinions from plaintiff’s experts, it found those experts opinions to be unpersuasive because the experts either testified solely based on their own experience and not industry standards or started with their ultimate conclusion and then found evidence to support it. Next, the court found that LabCorp had prudently monitored the plan’s recordkeeping costs, including through the use of an independent consultant and multiple requests for information or fee benchmarking analyses. Finally, the court also ruled in favor of LabCorp on the share class claim, finding that there was no evidence that LabCorp either met the minimum asset requirement for lower-cost investments or that this requirement would be waived for the plan.

4 Recent Developments in Forfeiture Cases

Key Takeaway: District courts have continued to weigh in on forfeiture claims and have dismissed many such claims. Several forfeiture cases are now before appellate courts and, in one, the Department of Labor has submitted an amicus brief in support of the defendants.

Key developments in forfeiture cases over the past quarter include:

Courts Continue to Grant Motions to Dismiss Claims Challenging Allocation of Forfeitures

District courts have continued the growing trend toward the dismissal of claims that challenge employers’ allocation of forfeitures to reduce employer contributions. In several of these decisions, courts have dismissed forfeiture claims under Rule 12(b)(6) based on the reasoning in Hutchins v. HP — that the plaintiff’s theory is overbroad because it allows for no set of circumstances or context in which a prudent and loyal fiduciary could apply forfeited amounts toward employer contributions. In other decisions, courts have dismissed forfeiture claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of Article III standing. In those cases, the courts held that the plaintiffs could not have suffered an injury-in-fact because the plans did not authorize the defendants to use forfeited amounts in the way the plaintiffs claimed they should have been used.

A Small Number of Courts Have Denied Motions to Dismiss Forfeiture Claims

By contrast, a handful of district courts have bucked the trend toward dismissal and allowed forfeiture claims to proceed to discovery. For example, in Buescher v. North American Lighting, Inc., the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois denied a motion to dismiss where the complaint specifically alleged that there were circumstances in which the decision to offset employer contributions could align with the interests of participants. The court held that the defendants were required to base their decision regarding how to use forfeited amounts on an adequate investigation.

Department of Labor Weighs In on Forfeiture Litigation in Favor of Employers

On July 9, 2025, the Department of Labor (DOL) filed an amicus brief in support of the defendants in the Hutchins v. HP appeal currently pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The DOL explained its view that the fundamental issue with the plaintiff’s theory of liability was that the plaintiff ignored the constraints on the fiduciary’s decision-making evident from the face of the complaint and the plan terms. For example, there was a possibility that there would be a funding shortfall if the plan sponsor refused to increase its contributions to make up for amounts that would be covered by forfeitures. This is the first public position the DOL has taken on the recent wave of forfeiture litigation.

Appeals of Forfeiture Decisions Granting Motions to Dismiss Continue

In addition to the Hutchins v. HP appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, several plaintiffs have appealed district court decisions granting motions to dismiss in the Ninth, Eighth, and Third Circuit Courts of Appeal. The forfeiture cases currently on appeal include:

Hutchins v. HP Inc., No. 25-826 (9th Cir. Feb. 7, 2025)

Sievert v. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc., No. 25-3409 (9th Cir. May 28, 2025)

Wright v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 25-4235 (9th Cir. July 9, 2025)

Matula v. Wells Fargo & Co., No. 25-2441 (8th Cir. July 17, 2025)

McWashington v. Nordstrom, Inc., No. 25-04613 (9th Cir. July 18, 2025)

Cain v. Siemens Corp., No. 25-2564 (3d Cir. Aug. 19, 2025)

Barragan v. Honeywell International, Inc., No. 25-2609 (3d Cir. Aug. 22, 2025)

The HP case is fully briefed; the briefing for the other appeals is expected to be completed by later 2025 or early 2026.

Since Trump took office for a second term, Indivisible has concentrated most of their efforts on organizing local and national events to voice discontent over his growing authoritarian agenda.

The goal is to draw attention to community-wide concerns about preserving democracy, immigration and deportations and other civil rights issues, organizers said. Leaders have said a core principle behind the “No Kings” movement is a commitment to peaceful, nonviolent action.

Peggy Flynn, co-president of the Democratic Women’s Club of Santa Cruz County, said that despite the challenges brought by the current administration, many local residents’ commitment to defending democratic principles remains firm.

“We’re not going to be intimidated” by the Trump administration’s actions, said Flynn, whose organization is helping to promote the local rallies. “We’re the ones who love our country and want our democracy to continue intact.”

Flynn said she hopes for strong turnout locally.

“It’s important to be counted. It’s important to be present,” she said.

An estimated 10,000 people participated in the June “No Kings” protest in Santa Cruz, and organizers are expecting a similar turnout on Saturday.

The White House office of management and budget (OMB) said Donald Trump “wants to reorient how the federal government prioritizes Army Corps projects”.
New York projects account for $7bn of the total.
The OMB said many of the projects sit in “sanctuary jurisdictions” that have resisted the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
The army corps of engineers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The White House budget director, Russell Vought, said on Friday that the Trump administration will freeze another $11bn worth of infrastructure projects in Democratic states due to the ongoing government shutdown.

Vought said on social media the US army corps of engineers would pause work on “low priority” projects in cities such as New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore. He said the projects could eventually be canceled.

The White House office of management and budget (OMB) said Donald Trump “wants to reorient how the federal government prioritizes Army Corps projects”.

The Trump administration has already frozen at least $28bn meant for transportation and energy projects in Democratic-controlled cities and states, as the president pressures his opponents in Congress to end the shutdown, which began on 1 October.

Trump has also vowed to cut “Democrat agencies” and has sought to eliminate 4,100 federal jobs as he looks to inflict pain on his political opposition.

The army corps of engineers projects include a waterfront park in San Francisco, bridge expansions in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and water and wastewater systems in New York City, the OMB said. New York projects account for $7bn of the total.

Other affected projects are in Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Delaware, the OMB said.

All of these states voted against Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

The OMB said many of the projects sit in “sanctuary jurisdictions” that have resisted the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Reuters first reported DHS’ plans to keep paying frontline federal law enforcement personnel.
But even with these extraordinary measures in place, many employees at national security and law enforcement agencies will apparently keep working without pay until the shutdown ends.
Many federal employees received their first partial paycheck last Friday, and are set to miss their first full paycheck later this month.
“We got the people that we want paid, paid,” President Donald Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.","The Trump administration is doubling down on its plans to keep paying some frontline federal law enforcement employees during the government shutdown, while many civilian government workers risk missing their first full paycheck next week.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X on Thursday afternoon that more than 70,000 federal law enforcement officials — including employees from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Secret Service, as well as federal air marshals and other “critical mission areas” will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown.

Noem wrote that these federal law enforcement employees will receive a “super check” by Oct. 22 that covers shutdown days already worked without pay, their overtime and their next pay period.

“President Trump and I will always stand by law enforcement, and we are keeping our promise to always support them by making sure they are paid during the Democrats’ shutdown,” Noem said.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will ensure that these 70,000 employees “will be having their pay covered during the Democrats’ government shutdown.”

The spokesperson said CBP border patrol agents, ICE deportation officers, Secret Service special agents and Transportation Security Administration air marshals are specifically covered by this announcement.

The budget reconciliation bill, which was signed into law this summer, gave DHS additional funds and few conditions on how to spend that money.

Reuters first reported DHS’ plans to keep paying frontline federal law enforcement personnel.

But even with these extraordinary measures in place, many employees at national security and law enforcement agencies will apparently keep working without pay until the shutdown ends.

The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CBP customs employees, said CBP officers will continue to be paid during the shutdown, but other agency employees won’t be paid on time.

“This is welcome news for these law enforcement officers who staff our nation’s 328 ports of entry and have worked without interruption during this shutdown,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement. “However, this decision does not apply to other CBP employees who also do vital work facilitating international trade and travel and other federal employees who work every day to serve the American people.”

DHS is moving money around to pay federal air marshals working for TSA, but a TSA spokesperson said in a statement that TSA officers are not covered under Noem’s announcement, “as they are not law enforcement officers.”

Geddes Scott, president of the American Federation of Government Employees NY/NJ VA Council 246 and a retired Department of Veterans Affairs nurse, said many of the veterans showing up for VA healthcare appointments work as federal law enforcement officials, and are concerned about missed paychecks.

“A lot of the veterans we take care of work at these different agencies, whether it’s DHS, Border Patrol, Bureau of Prisons or TSA. When they’re not getting paid, it affects their mental health,” Scott said. “When they show up to my facility … you can see the mental toll it takes on those individuals.”

Scott said he recently spoke with two Bureau of Prisons employees, both of them veterans, who raised concerns about not being paid on time during the lapse. One just had a baby, the other recently bought a car.

“You see the life in them is being sucked out, because of this political fight that’s going on, that they didn’t sign on for,” he said.

The Trump administration is not going to these lengths to keep civilian federal employees working during the shutdown from missing a paycheck.

Many federal employees received their first partial paycheck last Friday, and are set to miss their first full paycheck later this month.

“We got the people that we want paid, paid,” President Donald Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.

The Defense Department started the trend this week by repurposing $6.5 billion in unspent research and development funds to keep active-duty service members from missing a paycheck on Wednesday.

But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) told reporters on Friday that the same ad-hoc process won’t be an option to cover their next paycheck, if the shutdown continues.

“I do want you to know that that option is not going to be available in two weeks for their next paycheck,” Rogers said. “We have 2 million service members that were able to get paid this week because of President Trump’s creativity. These are families that are serving around the world. Many of them in very unfavorable conditions, making huge sacrifices for our freedom and safety, and most of them live paycheck-to-paycheck.”

Rogers said that 500,000 civilian federal employees will miss their first full paycheck next week, “and then the rest of them the week thereafter.”

“This is going to get really painful for a lot of civilian employees. Obviously, I think about the DoD civilian employees. But throughout the federal workforce, people will start missing their first paycheck next week and the week after,” Rodgers said.

On Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel told reporters at the White House that the Trump administration had taken steps to ensure that the bureau’s more than 13,000 special agents will be paid during the shutdown.

However, other FBI and Justice Department employees — including attorneys representing the Trump administration in federal court — continue to work without pay.

Meanwhile, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said federal courts, starting Oct. 20, “will no longer have funding to sustain full, paid operations.”

“Until the ongoing lapse in government funding is resolved, federal courts will maintain limited operations necessary to perform the Judiciary’s constitutional functions,” the office said in a statement Friday.

Federal judges will continue to work, but court staff may only perform certain excepted activities during the remainder of the shutdown.

“Each appellate, district, and bankruptcy court will make operational decisions regarding how its cases and probation and pretrial supervision will be conducted during the funding lapse,” the notice states.

The rulings in Illinois followed similar decisions from federal district judges in California and Oregon blocking deployments in those states.
The judges said Trump had made false claims of uncontrolled violence and infringed on states’ power to manage their own law enforcement challenges.
But courts have not ruled uniformly against Trump’s use of the National Guard.
In June, the administration won orders from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing deployments in Los Angeles to continue.","In response to the appeal, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said on X: “Donald Trump will keep trying to invade Illinois with troops — and we will keep defending the sovereignty of our state. Militarizing our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy.”

The appeal marks the first time the high court will consider Trump’s efforts to federalize state-run National Guard troops and deploy them into states led by Democratic governors who have opposed the extraordinary moves. It comes one day after a federal appeals court panel voted, 3-0, to leave in place the Chicago-based district judge’s restraining order that prevents Trump from putting the guard troops on the streets in Illinois.

“Political opposition is not rebellion,” the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel wrote, rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that immigration-related protests amounted to the sort of extreme threat to government authority that is needed for the president to have authority under federal law to deploy the guard.

The rulings in Illinois followed similar decisions from federal district judges in California and Oregon blocking deployments in those states. The judges said Trump had made false claims of uncontrolled violence and infringed on states’ power to manage their own law enforcement challenges.

One of the judges — a Trump appointee in Oregon — concluded earlier this month that Trump’s basis for federalizing Oregon troops to deploy them in Portland was “untethered” from reality and warned the effort risked normalizing the use of military troops against Americans in ways the founders had warned against.

But courts have not ruled uniformly against Trump’s use of the National Guard. In June, the administration won orders from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowing deployments in Los Angeles to continue.

The Oregon judge’s ruling is also currently on appeal at the 9th Circuit. When a panel of that court heard arguments last week, a majority of the judges seemed inclined to allow the troops to be put on the street.

In addition to the Chicago area, Portland and Los Angeles, Trump has ordered the military into Memphis, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., citing claims of uncontrolled violent crime that local officials have sharply rejected.

The deployments have inflamed tensions with Democratic governors and city leaders, who say the presence of troops has stoked, rather than calmed, civil unrest.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F49%2Ff7%2F44e81e864c6a93b5a2665c4bcefd%2Faptopix-national-guard-cities-chicago-61631.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:02:55.618842

The man, Andrew Stanton, 38, of Kenosha, Wis., pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee on Thursday, one day after he was indicted on three criminal counts that carry a combined maximum of 20 years in prison.

The charges include threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a U.S. official; sending threatening communications across state lines; and stalking, according to court records.

Mr. Stanton was arrested on Oct. 8, four days after saying in a TikTok video that ICE agents conducting immigration roundups for the Trump administration should be targeted, the authorities said.

“It’s time we start shooting at you,” a criminal complaint quoted Mr. Stanton as saying.

In a statement, John Bradley, a lawyer for Mr. Stanton, a Marine Corps veteran who served in the Iraq War, said: “It is important to remember that the contents of a criminal complaint represent one side of the story and are just allegations. Mr. Stanton pled not guilty. He is presumed innocent, and we will vigorously defend against these charges in court.”

Federal investigators said that they began monitoring Mr. Stanton’s social media posts in late August, citing a tip from the Wisconsin Statewide Intelligence Center, a federal office that tracks suspected terrorist activity.

At the time, a TikTok account registered to Mr. Stanton asked for whereabouts of any Israel Defense Forces members in the Illinois or Wisconsin area, a special agent for the F.B.I. wrote in the criminal complaint.

In another TikTok video posted in late August, Mr. Stanton said that words were not bringing about change from politicians, the authorities said.

“You have to use bullets,” he was quoted as saying in the complaint.

Investigators said Mr. Stanton recorded a separate video that same day in which he endorsed terrorism and the text onscreen read, “I think we should be OFFING federal agents.”

According to the F.B.I., law enforcement officers tried to interview Mr. Stanton twice in early September and were unable to reach him.

But he did not go dark on social media.

When a gunman fatally shot Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder and a right-wing ally of President Trump, while he was speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, Mr. Stanton resurfaced online, the authorities said.

“Long day for me, and I’m not necessarily out here to be eloquent,” Mr. Stanton said in a video that day, according to the complaint. “I just want to say one thing. Do more Charlie Kirks. Do a lot more Charlie Kirks.”

On Sept. 11, a supervisor with U.S. Customs and Border Protection who was assigned with the F.B.I. texted Mr. Stanton that he wanted to speak with him about his various posts on TikTok, the authorities said.

After initially using an obscenity to tell the investigator off, Mr. Stanton sent him a series of threatening text messages, according to the complaint, telling him “Kill yourself fed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16xp-tiktokthreats-cpkb/16xp-tiktokthreats-cpkb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 18:57:56.780415

The request came a day after a three-judge panel for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld a federal district court order halting Trump’s military intervention in the Windy City.
It also marked the first time an appeals court officially blocked one of Trump’s National Guard deployments in a major U.S. city.
12406 (Title 10), an archaic law Trump has repeatedly used to federalize state national guard troops and deploy them into major Democratic-led cities across the country.","President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court Friday to stay a lower court order barring his attempted military deployment in Chicago.

The stay application marks the first time that a block to Trump’s troop deployments around the country has reached the Supreme Court.

The request came a day after a three-judge panel for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld a federal district court order halting Trump’s military intervention in the Windy City.

The appeals court ruling was a major win for Illinois and Chicago, both of which sued earlier this month arguing that the deployment infringes on the state’s sovereignty and its right to self-governance. It also marked the first time an appeals court officially blocked one of Trump’s National Guard deployments in a major U.S. city.

In its application, Solicitor General D. John Sauer claimed that both the district court and the Seventh Circuit erred in questioning Trump’s authority to deploy troops domestically.

“Both courts were mistaken to conclude that a federal court may review the President’s judgment at all,” Sauer argued.

“Even if the President’s determination to call up the Illinois National Guard were subject to review at all, the government is likely to succeed in showing on appeal that the President acted well within the authority vested in him by Section 12406’s provisions,” the solicitor general added.

Sauer was referring to 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), an archaic law Trump has repeatedly used to federalize state national guard troops and deploy them into major Democratic-led cities across the country.

The rarely used statute allows the president to federalize state Guard troops when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or when the president is unable to execute laws with regular resources.

After threatening to send troops into Chicago for months, Trump last week used the statute to federalize Illinois and Texas Guard troops and deployed them into the city over the repeated objections of local and state officials.

The Trump administration claimed the troops were needed to protect federal property and law enforcement officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies, who it claimed have been unable to carry out immigration arrests due to a “rebellion” in the city.

Chicago residents in recent weeks have staged largely peaceful protests against the Department of Homeland Security’s aggressive and escalatory immigration raids throughout the city.

However, U.S. District Court Judge April Perry, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, quickly halted the federalization and deployment after finding the Trump administration’s account of recent protests unreliable. Perry said that recent protests could not constitute a rebellion.

The Seventh Circuit Thursday evening partially stayed Perry’s order by upholding the federalization of Illinois and Texas Guard members but barring Trump from deploying them anywhere in Illinois.

The appeals court panel, which was made up of judges appointed by Trump, former President Barack Obama and former President George H. W. Bush, agreed with Perry’s assessment that recent unrest did not amount to a rebellion.

“Political opposition is not rebellion,” the panel wrote.

“We conclude that the district court’s factual findings at this preliminary stage were not clearly erroneous, and that the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois,” it added.

In the stay application to the Supreme Court, Sauer not only claimed that the protests were a rebellion but likened them to the Whiskey Rebellion, the 1794 armed uprising of farmers and distillers during the presidency of George Washington.

Illinois and local officials have warned that the Trump administration has deliberately used aggressive immigration raids and escalatory tactics to provoke unrest in the city and create a pretext to deploy troops in Chicago.

Residents have documented instances of federal agents grabbing people by the throat, releasing tear gas on busy residential streets and arresting local elected officials.

In a court hearing last week, Department of Justice attorneys did not disagree with Perry’s assessment that the government could deliberately foment unrest in a city and cite that unrest in deploying troops.

A 43-year-old woman, Kenia J. Merlos, of Honduras, is also legally in the U.S. under the deferred action status, the complaint said.
They asked the federal government to revert to its previous policies that would shield immigrant crime victims from deportation.","A new lawsuit from immigrant advocates argues that the federal government is illegally detaining and deporting crime victims who should have been protected from deportation.

Among the plaintiffs is Yessenia Ruano, the former Milwaukee Public Schools teacher's aide who publicly fought her deportation but eventually was forced by immigration officers to return to El Salvador with her twin U.S. citizen daughters.

The federal lawsuit, filed in the Central District of California Oct. 14, identifies several immigrants nationwide who had applied for trafficking and crime victims' visas, known as T and U visas, but were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawsuit targets policy changes by President Donald Trump's administration that it alleges are running contrary to laws ""that Congress created specifically to protect them from deportation,"" the suit said.

Named as defendants are Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — ICE — which handles deportations, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, which handles legal immigration pathways.

The lawsuit focuses on immigrants with two kinds of statuses: crime victims who were granted a ""deferred action"" status, meaning they are allowed to legally stay in the U.S. for a period of time; and victims who have pending T or U visa applications.

Before Trump took office, people with pending T and U visas could generally remain in the country while they waited for a decision in their cases. ICE told Ruano she must self-deport instead of waiting for a decision in her case from USCIS, the agency that would issue that visa.

The lawsuit argues that ICE was required by law to ask its counterpart, USCIS, if Ruano's T visa case had enough evidence to support it. If it had been found to meet initial requirements, ICE would've been legally required not to deport her. ICE did not seek that determination in Ruano's case, the lawsuit said.

Several of the other plaintiffs are women who survived domestic violence or are crime victims, then applied for T or U visas, and were granted the ""deferred action"" status. Despite that, the lawsuit said, the women were detained by immigration agents.

Among them is a 64-year-old Los Angeles woman identified in the complaint with a pseudonym who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years and has four U.S. citizen children and three grandchildren. The suit said the woman was arrested outside her home by ICE in April for a 1998 deportation order. Her attorney informed ICE of her deferred action status, but officers deported her a day later, the suit said.

Also included in the lawsuit is a 46-year-old vendor of tamales in Los Angeles who was beaten at a bus stop in 2021 and had received a deferred action status. She was detained as part of ICE raids in her city and was released on bond, but is required to give ICE her location weekly, the complaint said.

A 43-year-old woman, Kenia J. Merlos, of Honduras, is also legally in the U.S. under the deferred action status, the complaint said. While she was visiting Canadian relatives at a park in Washington state, border agents approached the family and detained her, her 71-year-old mother, her four children — a 7 year old and 9-year-old triplets — and the Canadian relatives. All were later released except Merlos, who remains in ICE custody, the lawsuit said.

The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit with several California-based immigrant advocacy groups, including the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, and the Immigration Center for Women and Children.

They asked the federal government to revert to its previous policies that would shield immigrant crime victims from deportation. And they asked the court to issue an order returning the plaintiffs to their previous position. If the suit is successful on that front, it could mean Ruano would be able to return to the U.S.

The policies replace ""the long-standing and judiciously crafted 'victim-centered' approach with an unforgiving, arbitrary and unlawful 'deportation-centered' system that ignores crime victims' eligibility for relief and railroads them into detention and removal without due process,"" the complaint said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/PMJS/86748504007-mjs-250530-local-mjsdeporthearingp-1.jpg?crop=5947,3347,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-17 20:02:59.932359

Abughazaleh said she was hit in the face with a baton Friday and saw a woman pushed to the ground by officers.

The renewed attention on the Broadview site comes as federal courts weigh the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago. A federal appeals panel ruled Thursday that the administration cannot send troops to the city, upholding an earlier order blocking the move.

Gov. JB Pritzker, who sued to stop the deployment, called the attempt ""unlawful and unconstitutional,"" saying there is no rebellion or insurrection taking place in Chicago.

Texas National Guard troops were seen outside the Broadview ICE facility late last week but have not returned since. Local officials say they will continue monitoring the situation as Friday’s demonstrations unfold.

Federal immigration agents ordered to wear body cameras

A judge on Thursday ordered federal immigration officers in the Chicago area to wear body cameras and also summoned a senior official to court next week to discuss an enforcement operation that has resulted in more than 1,000 arrests.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said she was a ""little startled"" after seeing TV images of street confrontations that involved tear gas and other tactics during President Donald Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdown in the nation’s third-largest city.

""I am adding that all agents who are operating in Operation Midway Blitz are to wear body-worn cameras, and they are to be on,"" Ellis said, referring to the government’s name for the crackdown.

She said cameras would provide evidence to back up how agents handle confrontations with protesters.

""Worst of the worst""

Dig deeper:

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security released details on several people described as ""the worst of the worst"" that are being held inside the Broadview ICE processing center.

DHS officials said those detained in the facility include people convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, felony robbery, drug possession, and more.

Radule Bojovic, a Hanover Park police officer and native of Montenegro, was taken into custody during a targeted immigration enforcement operation on Oct. 16, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Officials allege Bojovic overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.

“Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living illegally in the United States for 10 years — what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns?” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated.

McLaughlin added that it is a felony for undocumented immigrants to possess firearms, and called Bojovic “a law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law.”

Bojovic recently graduated from the Suburban Law Enforcement Academy and had started a 15-week field training program, according to a Hanover Park Police Department Facebook post in August.

Village officials defended the hiring process. At a municipal meeting Thursday evening, Hanover Park Mayor Rodney Craig said Bojovic was legally authorized to work in the U.S. at the time of his hiring and passed background checks conducted by the FBI and Illinois State Police.

“If Officer Bojovic did not hold federal work authorization, he would not have been hired,” Craig said.

Craig added that the village will monitor Bojovic’s immigration proceedings and that, if he is ultimately allowed to remain in the U.S. and retain legal work status, he will be reinstated to full duty.

Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) criticized the Trump administration following a ProPublica investigation that found more than 170 U.S. citizens had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers this year.

“This report is absolutely shocking,” Jayapal, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, wrote on social platform X. “ICE does not have the authority to detain US citizens during immigration enforcement — full stop.”

“The Trump administration is out of control, violating the rights of American citizens,” she continued. “They must be held accountable.”

The ProPublica investigation, published Thursday, identified cases of citizens being detained by ICE officers at raids or protests. Officers arrested about 130 U.S. citizens and held nearly two dozen for longer than a day without allowing them to call lawyers or family members.

Reporters found at least three instances of pregnant people being detained and multiple instances of citizens being shot, tased, beaten or otherwise physically harmed by officers.

Since entering office, President Trump has significantly increased the budget of the Department of Homeland Security — ICE’s parent agency — to increase deportations and border enforcement.

Jayapal has previously criticized the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement operation. She introduced legislation in July to “formally block” ICE from detaining or deporting U.S. citizens.

“ICE is acting like a rogue force, kidnapping and disappearing people off the streets with no due process,” Jayapal said in a release announcing the legislation.

This week, as a judge extended the order blocking federal troop deployments to Portland, Ore., Trump announced that he was considering sending troops to San Francisco, Calif. — another city he has mischaracterized as being crime-ridden.

As in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., such a deployment would directly oppose the wishes of state and local officials.

“Contrary to Trump’s lie, no ‘government officials’ here have requested federal occupation,” state Sen. Scott Weiner posted online Wednesday. “We don’t need Trump’s authoritarian crackdown in our city. Bottom line: stay the hell out of San Francisco.”

In other cities and states, Trump’s allies are using their official power to promote and expand the president’s military deployments on American soil. This week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said that he hopes to have federal troops in the state by next month.

As these dangerous tactics escalate, we’re investigating Trump’s abuses of power, erosion of transparency, and efforts to use the presidency to punish perceived political opponents, including by usurping state and local power.

Trump’s unprecedented domestic deployments raise serious legal questions about the president’s authority. The governments of Portland and Oregon have sued Trump alleging the deployment was “patently unlawful” and violated the Constitution.

According to recent reporting, the Department of Defense and the White House have used Signal — a secretive, private, and non-governmental messaging app with auto-delete capabilities — to coordinate at least one of the deployments. We launched an investigation earlier this year when high level Trump administration officials reportedly used Signal to coordinate military attack plans in Yemen.

Leaked images of officials’ Signal conversations surfaced earlier this month, revealing details about the administration’s plan to deploy the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to Portland.

Trump’s extraordinarily unusual deployments overstep the president’s authority and infringe on the power of state and local governments. These actions must not be normalized. We are committed to fighting for transparency, holding the government accountable and informing the public of efforts to seize control and consolidate executive power.

Demanding Answers about DHS’s Taxpayer-Funded ICE Recruitment Ads

As the government shutdown continues, it was revealed this week that the Department of Homeland Security has spent at least $51 million of taxpayer money to run advertisements thanking Donald Trump for his border policies and urging undocumented immigrants to self-deport. The campaign is reportedly the most expensive political ad campaign of the year.

The Trump administration is also spending millions more taxpayer dollars on television ads to recruit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as part of its $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 new ICE officers by the end of the year.

These ads are flooding Youtube, social media platforms, and streaming services like Spotify and Hulu. Thirty-second television ads playing in select cities urge current law enforcement officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst.”

To investigate ICE’s ad blitz, we submitted records requests for the agency’s communications, strategy documents regarding recruitment efforts, and advertising budgets.

ICE is also offering new recruits sign-on bonuses as large as $50,000 and up to $60,000 in student debt relief.

Those who decide to take the offer will join an agency whose budget has ballooned to $76.5 billion — 10 times its prior size — thanks to the spending bill Trump signed into law in July.

The administration hopes this influx of funding and officers will help it achieve its goals of arresting 3,000 immigrants each day and deporting one million people a year.

This rapid expansion comes as the Department of Homeland Security is cutting internal oversight and blocking external accountability.

This summer, DHS adopted a policy that blocks members of Congress from accessing detention facilities and the information needed to perform their legally authorized oversight duties. We are representing Congressional members in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s illegal blocking of ICE facility oversight.

At a time when ICE is detaining more individuals than ever before — over 56,000 people — and as reports of mistreatment, deplorable conditions, and in-custody deaths continue to mount, the need for oversight has never been more urgent.

We’re demanding the public and members of Congress have access to the information they need to hold ICE accountable.

The Public Deserves the Full Jack Smith Report

More than nine months after Special Counsel Jack Smith submitted his report on Trump’s mishandling of classified documents, Volume II remains hidden from the public. We petitioned the court to vacate the order blocking the full report’s release.

We sued the Justice Department in February for failing to respond to our FOIA request seeking the full report.

This week, the House Judiciary Committee asked Smith to testify about his investigation into Trump before the end of the month.

In a letter to Smith, the committee chairman accused the special counsel of conducting “politically motivated investigations,” and the Biden-Harris Justice Department of having “weaponized federal law enforcement.”

Smith refuted accusations that politics played a role in the investigation of Trump’s mishandling of classified documents in an interview released this week.

We’re demanding answers about the administration’s use of executive power to target its political opponents and transparency about the special counsel’s findings. Read more here about our petition for the release of the report.

""DHS remains deeply grateful to our law enforcement for their continued professionalism, vigilance, and service under challenging circumstances,"" Noem added.

Much of DHS is considered ""essential"" to government operations, so officers have remained on duty during the shutdown.

The shutdown entered its 17th day on Oct. 17 with no end in sight as lawmakers are at an impasse over federal funding allocations for the 2026 fiscal year.

A tenth vote on Oct. 16 failed to reopen the government, and the Senate will vote again on a House-passed measure on Oct. 20. By that point, the shutdown will become the third-longest in history.

Noem said DHS officers will receive a ""super check"" on Wednesday, Oct. 22, covering all hours worked during the shutdown as well as the next pay period.

USA TODAY has reached out to DHS for more information.

Most government employees who are considered essential and therefore still working during the shutdown aren't getting paid.

Once Congress agrees on funding appropriations and the shutdown end, federal workers should get paid as usual in accordance with The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.

The Office of Management of Budget said in an Oct. 14 statement posted on X that the White House is “making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats’ intransigence.”

“Pay the troops, pay law enforcement, continue the (reductions in force), and wait,” the OMB added in the statement.

How many ICE, Border Patrol agents are working during shutdown?

It doesn't appear that the ""super check"" will be going to all of the exempted DHS employees who are still working during the shutdown.

Noem said that more than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers will receive the check.

Sworn officers are those who carry a firearm, have arrest power and a badge. Unlike unsworn officers, sworn officers must attend a law enforcement academy, according to Go Law Enforcement.

According to DHS' shutdown contingency plan, the agency has approximately 161,000 essential employees working under the ""necessary to protect life and property"" exception, which is inclusive of law enforcement officers.

There was a hastily called hearing Friday afternoon, in which Judge Sara Ellis told the government she wants live testimony Monday from someone from ICE and someone from Customs and Border Protection.

She said she wanted the witnesses to have knowledge of recent incidents and other enforcement operations in the Chicago area, along with knowledge of how the terms of her temporary restraining order have been disseminated to agents in the field.She did require that any particular person appear, but left it up to the government to produce the appropriate witnesses.

Hott was being asked to testify Monday about several incidents involving agents allegedly violating her order not to use tear gas against peaceful protesters without warning.

The Department of Justice is requesting that Customs and Border Protection Deputy Incident Cmdr. Kyle Harvick answer questions about those potential violations instead.

In a statement Friday, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""Russell Hott is the permanent Field Office Director (FOD) for the Washington, DC area of responsibility, not Chicago. He served in Chicago as interim FOD and this is planned return to his permanent office in DC.

""I just need somebody from ICE and Customs and Border Patrol to tell me what is happening and has been happening over the last week since I issued this order,"" Ellis said. ""It doesn't have to be complicated. I just need some people here that can answer the questions I have as to how this order has been disseminated, what happened with these various incidents over the last week - some of which I have found particularly concerning - and give me some belief that my order that I entered is being followed.""

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ellis modified an already existing temporary restraining order, or TRO, in place to require all agents working under ""Operation Midway Blitz"" who have already been issued body cameras to wear them and keep them on during ""law enforcement activities"" in Chicago.

In addition to Monday's hearing, Judge Ellis also set a Nov. 5 date for a preliminary injunction hearing to decide whether the TRO will remain in effect for a longer period.

Judge Ellis told the parties the ""ideological motivation"" behind the Administration's so-called Operation Midway Blitz is, so far, ""irrelevant"" to this case. Rather, the judge is focused on how agents are enforcing the law, and whether it's violating people's constitutional rights.

""What I'm looking at is how are these agents enforcing the law?"" Ellis said. ""Are they doing so in a manner that is violating other people's constitutional rights? If that is happening, that needs to stop.""

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July. Representatives said they’ve seen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations. It also has drawn lawsuits from some states and the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Asked about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done, because what’s happening with these ICE agents and courthouses and territories around courthouses is unacceptable,” Welch said. “People are afraid to go to court. They’re afraid to comply with subpoenas. We can’t allow that. These should be safe spaces.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed street chase on Chicago’s South Side.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events citywide and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three detained recently.",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/AP25288660208628.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:03:45.652285

Recent actions from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) federal agents, including conducting raids in unmarked vehicles,(link is external) denying members of Congress access to ICE facilities(link is external), and more, have raised serious questions about the protections of due process and civil liberties.

“These tactics are about avoiding accountability and transparency. We need standards of conduct for ICE agents and to ensure agents cannot trample on civil and human rights. I’m proud to put forth this common sense defense of American values that we should all support,” said Rep. Ro Khanna.

“We have had enough of ICE abusing their powers and pushing the limits to continue terrorizing our communities.

United Auto Workers, Communications Workers of America and the American Federation of Teachers sued the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This comes after the State Department said it had revoked the visas of at least six people over social media comments made about late conservative activist Charlie Kirk following his murder last month.

""Plaintiffs represent thousands of people whose speech is chilled by the threat of adverse immigration action if the government disapproves of anything they have expressed or will express,"" the lawsuit reads.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VET LEGAL IMMIGRANT APPLICANTS FOR 'ANTI-AMERICANISM' AND ANTISEMITISM

Administration officials have purported that foreigners do not have the same constitutional rights as U.S. citizens and do not have a right to hold a visa, as the federal government seeks to target them for speech.

""The United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country, commit acts of anti-American, pro-terrorist, and antisemitic hate, or incite violence. We will continue to revoke the visas of those who put the safety of our citizens at risk,"" State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

The lawsuit points to high-profile cases and the comments of federal officials to argue that a government program uses artificial intelligence and other automated tools for surveillance of visa holders' posts and targets people critical of the Trump administration and what the government considers to be ""hateful ideology.""

The federal government has broadly defined support for terrorism to include criticism of U.S. support for Israel and the Jewish State's military action, as well as support for Palestinians. The government has used this as a justification to cancel visas.

FEDERAL JUDGE LAUNCHES SCATHING BROADSIDE OF TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO DEPORT PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS

The unions' complaint cited the case of green card holder Mahmoud Khalil, who was released in June following months in detention after the government attempted to deport him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University.

The lawsuit said the immigration threats over views disapproved by the government have prompted some union members to withdraw from publicly affiliating with their unions at organizing events, step down from leadership roles and ""deleted, refrained from, or otherwise altered their social media and online engagement with the unions.""

""This loss of engagement has harmed the plaintiffs’ ability to further their organizational missions and impeded their ability to carry out their responsibilities, which include recruitment, retention, and organization of union members; advocacy on behalf of union members; and the promotion of civic and political engagement among union members,"" the lawsuit said.

Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, the administration has searched for online posts to target foreigners for the potential rescinding of their visa.

On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order to ensure visa holders ""do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to our national security.""

Individuals were given time from 2022 to acquire Latvian language skills at the required level.

According to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), A2 level indicates that a person can understand and use simple phrases and sentences in everyday situations, communicate on familiar topics, and exchange basic information.

In the event of an unsuccessful language proficiency test, an individual may retake the examination. However, those foreign nationals who have not demonstrated an interest in continuing to reside in Latvia – either by failing to submit the required documents or failing to provide proof of Latvian language proficiency – no longer have legal grounds to stay in the Republic of Latvia.

In connection to the above, it has been established that 10 foreign nationals are residing in Latvia illegally. Consequently, the OCMA has been obliged to issue them with orders to leave the country.

Save Jobs USA, an organization of American tech workers, filed suit challenging a 2015 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that allows certain H-4 visa holders whose H-1B spouses are on the path to permanent residency to apply for employment authorization. H-4 visas are granted to dependent family members of H-1B specialty occupation workers, a category widely used in the technology, healthcare, and other sectors.

Save Jobs USA argued that DHS exceeded its statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act by extending employment authorization for a visa class not explicitly authorized by Congress and that the rule harmed American workers by increasing labor market competition. The group also claimed that a circuit split existed regarding the scope of DHS’s regulatory authority, which warranted Supreme Court review.

(KOIN) – A clash between an ambulance crew and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stalled a medical transport at the South Portland ICE facility earlier this month.

On Oct. 5, our footage captured a group of protestors outside Portland’s ICE facility.

The incident between AMR and ICE allegedly ended in a federal agent threatening to shoot an ambulance driver, according to leaked documents first reported by Willamette Week.

While details of the allegations are unconfirmed by officials, KOIN 6 News has confirmed that American Medical Response (AMR) leaders and Teamster union members met with the Federal Protective Service on Wednesday night to discuss the incident. However, no officials are commenting during the ongoing investigation.

Portland Fire and Rescue records and radio dispatch obtained by KOIN 6 News show that ICE detained a suspect that night, described as a 32-year-old white man with a broken collar bone.

Bureau of Emergency Communications dispatch records show an AMR ambulance was called to the ICE facility at 9:14 p.m. to transport the man to Legacy Emanuel Hospital. Public records show that the ambulance arrived within five minutes, but there was some kind of hold up when the ambulance tried to leave at 9:34 p.m.

According to the radio records, at 9:34 p.m. the EMT driving the ambulance told dispatch that they were “not being allowed to leave by the ICE officers.” The EMT reiterated this again over the radio at 9:40 p.m.

Portland police radio recordings provide a similar account, stating that “protesters are out of the way” and that it “looks like they’re getting ready to open the gates soon.”

However, the ambulance was still not on the road.

“There’s 50-60 federal agents out there completely blocking the road with the ambulance, still not driving out yet,” a Portland police officer said to dispatch.

What exactly happened behind the gates for those roughly 10 minutes is not revealed in public documents.

However, police radio transcripts from outside the building around that same time appear to show that law enforcement was working on clearing the roads of some people.

Our camera crew captured video of the ambulance leaving the ICE facility, and the EMT is heard on the radio at 9:42 p.m. saying she “finally made it on the road – CODE 1 to Emanuel.”

KOIN 6 News reached out to AMR, which shared the following statement:

“The safety and wellbeing of our public service partners, employees, patients and community members remain paramount to AMR Multnomah County (AMR). AMR is collaborating closely with Federal Protective Service to thoroughly review all aspects related to this incident.

“To protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation, we are unable to offer further commentary or disclose additional details. We reaffirm our commitment to the residents of Multnomah County, ensuring continued focus on quality care, and will uphold support for both our caregivers, partners and patients as we honor the trust placed in our organization each day.”

KOIN 6 News also reached out to ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but neither agency has responded to the request for comment.

Paramedics familiar with the incident told KOIN 6 the two employees involved were initially “shaken” but felt better after the meeting on Wednesday. Medics, however, said they are looking to AMR leadership to provide safety during these tense times.

“We stand against assault on our health care providers just as we stand against assault on our community. We continue to do our part, our leadership needs to do the same in keeping everyone safe,” Tim Mollman said, a paramedic with AMR.

Austin DePaolo, the Secretary-Treasurer with the Teamsters Local 223 union, shared the following statement:

“Our Teamster 223 EMS members at AMR respond to all calls with the same professionalism and composure they bring to every emergency. We appreciate that federal agents have since been cooperative and open to learn from this experience as we have. We all share a common goal, ensuring the safety of patients, first responders, and the public and we’re encouraged that constructive dialogue is taking place to prevent any similar incidents in the future.”

According to court documents, a teacher had led her to believe—falsely, it turned out—that she was already a lawful permanent resident.
In a public statement issued shortly after her arrest, the Department of Homeland Security mistakenly identified her as a Columbia student.
According to court documents, the money came from her waitressing job and from contributions from her neighbors.
According to court documents filed in August, Kordia has lost a significant amount of weight in detention.","On a Monday afternoon in late September, a group of students and professors from Columbia University stood outside the campus gates, holding large printed photos of people whom the U.S. government is seeking to deport. After two tumultuous years of protests, multiple waves of arrests, and, ultimately, a two-hundred-and-twenty-one-million-dollar settlement with the Trump Administration, the university has returned to something resembling normality. But such gatherings remain commonplace, often with members of the faculty holding photos of Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, whose highly publicized cases made them symbols of the government’s crackdown on student protesters. That day, someone held the photo of a woman largely unknown to the public: Leqaa Kordia, who was not a Columbia student but “a simple Palestinian girl,” as she describes herself, who’s been in ICE detention in Texas for the past eight months.

On March 13, 2025, just five days after Khalil, a green-card holder who is married to a U.S citizen, was arrested, Kordia walked into an immigration office in Newark. A few days earlier, agents from the Department of Homeland Security had visited her mother’s home, in Paterson, New Jersey. The agents took a photo of a sign that said “Palestine” on the family’s front porch. Kordia’s mother, who struggled to communicate with them, called her daughter. The agents told Kordia, who was in the process of obtaining a green card, that there was a problem with her immigration status and that they needed to speak with her. And so, accompanied by a lawyer, she presented herself at the office in Newark, assuming that the matter would be easily cleared up. Her stepfather and her sister waited for her in the car.

Until then, Kordia’s life had been fairly ordinary. She had never been convicted of a crime, and she was in the middle of a lawful immigration process. “I honestly didn’t think that it’s going to be a big deal,” she said. “I literally was thinking that there was maybe a small issue in my application.” Instead, she says, she was taken through “many stairs and doors,” before being locked in a cell. It was Ramadan, but few religious accommodations were provided—the guards Googled the direction of Mecca, and Kordia laid out toilet paper on the floor of her cell to pray. A few hours later, she was put on a flight to Texas, but the documents she was given said she’d been transferred to upstate New York. Officers were apparently confused. “Good luck understanding anything in this file,” an official who had flown with her from New Jersey reportedly said, when Kordia’s file was handed over to agents in Texas, according to court documents.

Kordia, who is thirty-two, has lived in the United States since 2016. She was born in Jerusalem and grew up in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Her parents divorced when she was a child. She and her brother stayed with their father. Her mother moved to the United States, remarried, and had other children. In Ramallah, Kordia would watch videos of people around the world protesting for Palestinian rights, something she herself was unable to do in the West Bank. “Growing up under military occupation, that itself is a nightmare,” she said. “I’ve never had any day of freedom or peace.”

She eventually reunited with her mother in 2016, when she entered the U.S. on a visitor visa. In Ramallah, she had studied fashion design; in the U.S, she enrolled in English-language programs on an F-1 student visa. Her mother, who is a U.S. citizen, filed a family-based petition for her to start the process of obtaining permanent residency, which was approved in 2021. While waiting for a green card, Kordia withdrew from school, voluntarily giving up her student status. According to court documents, a teacher had led her to believe—falsely, it turned out—that she was already a lawful permanent resident. In the years that followed, she cared for her mother, worked as a waitress, and helped look after her half brother, who is autistic. Paterson, which has a large Palestinian and Arab community, began to feel like home.

Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, following Hamas’s attacks on October 7, 2023, Kordia has lost more than a hundred and seventy-five relatives in the Strip. “My mind was all about Gaza, nothing else,” she said. The stories she heard from family members were horrifying. They were continuously displaced from one city to the next, fleeing for safety, only to confront more immediate dangers. Kordia, feeling “heartbroken,” didn’t know what to do. “To feel helpless—this is one of the most awful feelings in the world,” she said, adding that one of her aunts had already lost her home during Israeli bombardments in 2021. “There is no safe place in Gaza.”

As Kordia watched loved ones going hungry or being indiscriminately killed, protest became her only lifeline. She was accustomed to going to New York, a forty-five-minute train ride from Paterson, to visit museums and stroll the city’s streets. On April 30, 2024, as Columbia students erected encampments in solidarity with Palestinians, attracting international attention, she joined a demonstration outside the university’s gates, calling for an end to the violence. Police ordered the crowd to disperse. “Something you only see in movies,” she said of the display of force. Kordia, who felt lightheaded, sat on a sidewalk and was swept up in the arrests; she was handcuffed and shuttled by bus to police headquarters, where she was forced to remove her hijab for a search. The next morning, she was released with a notice to appear in court. The charges were later dismissed. She assumed that was the end of it.

When Kordia was arrested in March, the government accused her of terrorism. In a public statement issued shortly after her arrest, the Department of Homeland Security mistakenly identified her as a Columbia student. “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,” Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security Secretary, said. “When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.” According to a report by the Associated Press, the N.Y.P.D. had turned over evidence of her arrest at the student demonstrations to ICE.

The government claims that money that Kordia sent to her family in Gaza—a few thousand U.S. dollars in total—is evidence of material support for Hamas. According to court documents, the money came from her waitressing job and from contributions from her neighbors. In late June, a federal judge concluded that Kordia’s detention likely violated her constitutional right to due process and recommended her release. No convincing evidence linking her to terrorist activity had been brought up. In response, the government contended that she posed a flight risk. Her petition is now pending in federal court alongside a separate asylum proceeding. “It breaks my heart to be labelled as something that I have nothing to do with,” she said.

In early October, the Trump Administration helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which included an exchange of hostages and prisoners. “Together we’ve achieved what everybody said was impossible,” President Trump said. “At long last we have peace in the Middle East.” Kordia, meanwhile, is the last remaining campus protester still in detention from the Trump Administration’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the U.S. At Prairieland Detention Facility, in Texas, she is fighting for her release while living in constant fear of deportation. She holds a passport from the Palestinian Authority, a travel document that offers no protection if she is deported to Israel. Such deportation, her legal team contends, would send her into the custody of the same Army that has killed dozens of her family members. Both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority have targeted those accused of being affiliated with Hamas. Photos of Kordia have circulated widely online. Her lawyers say that the gravity of the allegations against her have compelled her to seek asylum. “I’m not just scared—I’m terrified,” Kordia said. “I’m terrified of being subjected to jail, torture even. It could get to the point of getting killed.”

In the facility, Kordia spends her days reading, praying, writing in her journal, and answering letters of support. She also finds solace and strength in the friendships she’s developed with the other detainees. “They’re beautiful women with dreams. They’re educated. They’re smart. They’re funny,” she said. “These beautiful women made it bearable.” She formed a particularly strong bond with Ward Sakeik, a Palestinian woman whose family is from Gaza. Sakeik was arrested by ICE in February while returning from her honeymoon in St. Thomas. In July, she was released.

According to court documents filed in August, Kordia has lost a significant amount of weight in detention. The filing noted that Kordia, a practicing Muslim, “has only had a single halal meal on a religious holiday, even though the detention center accommodates the religious dietary needs of other people in custody.” Kordia said the Quran helps her stay strong, especially the verses that remind her that hardships can be a divine test. One reads, “God does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.” Kordia added, “Allah has chosen me for this, and I should be honored and proud.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68ee8b10bafe39542db3313e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Alami_Final.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 14:03:18.763909

The mother of two girls says she has seen how her neighbors have been chased down by immigration enforcement agents.
He says he's always ready to confront ICE agents with non-aggressive tactics, like annoying them with loud noises.","HANOVER PARK, Ill. — Nearly a dozen kids come around the block, some running and others riding their bikes. They are heading straight to the gap between the grocery store and the old apartment building — the same area where Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans often park.

""We heard they were here so that's why we came,"" a kid says to another one.

By ""they"" he means ICE agents. He and the other kids were ready to start recording the latest immigration enforcement action in their neighborhood.

An organizer with Patrulla Popular, or the People's Patrol, an all-volunteer group of activists, is nearby and approaches the kids.

""You guys need to keep yourselves safe, OK? You guys need to be careful,"" Ruby tells the kids. She asked to only be identified by her first name because she fears retaliation for her work warning people about ICE's presence.

She says the kids should document everything they see while keeping their distance. This could help eventually identify the undocumented immigrants being taken away by federal immigration agents.

She also tells them one of the goals should be to alert everyone around them about the presence of ICE. She gives them whistles.

""When you see somebody and you see a car or something suspicious, you do a break of a whistle,"" Ruby says, meaning a soft series of whistles. ""If you see somebody being detained the whistle is long, as loud as you can.""

Ruby is part of a growing number of volunteer groups who, along with advocates and lawyers, are patrolling the streets of Chicago and its suburbs warning migrants of ICE's presence, contacting family members of those detained and linking detained immigrants with legal services.

From the building's main balcony a group of adult immigrants, many without a legal status, listens as she reminds them of their rights if they were to interact with ICE.

""Do not sign anything without having talked to an attorney,"" she tells them in Spanish.

Residents in this area say they have been terrorized since last month, when the Trump administration ramped up its crackdown on immigration in Illinois under ICE's Operation Midway Blitz.

One of the residents watching is Diana, a Mexican woman who NPR is only identifying by her first name because she's undocumented.

""I'm panicking, I don't want to leave my place,"" she says in Spanish.

The mother of two girls says she has seen how her neighbors have been chased down by immigration enforcement agents. In this apartment building, some adults have decided to stay home and not go to work, and to not send their kids to school.

But there's one person she says is giving her hope.

His name is Ivan and he's 17. He has taken on the unlikely role of protector, often patrolling his neighborhood daily starting around 5 a.m.

""I may not be no cop or none of that, but I be taking care of the community,"" Ivan says. ""I don't want none of these people get deported.""

NPR is identifying Ivan only by his first name because he's a minor.

Witnessing ICE arresting people in this area has become an almost daily occurrence over the last few weeks, Ivan says. A few days ago, he took a video of an enforcement operation happening at the nearby grocery store.

Ivan says every day he tries to keep an eye out for suspicious cars. They could be ICE, he says. His goal is to give migrants enough time to either hide or flee if agents are around.

""All these people make the U.S. work,"" Ivan says. ""Without them how is the U.S. gonna be?""

Cristóbal Cavazos is also a volunteer with the People's Patrol, and the co-founder of Casa DuPage Workers Center.

He says he's always ready to confront ICE agents with non-aggressive tactics, like annoying them with loud noises.

""I will take out my bullhorn, I will start to make some noise, people start to honk their horns, people start to pull up,"" Cavazos says. ""ICE starts to get nervous. They start to look around, you know, and they start to assess, is this worth it right now?""

But increasingly, federal immigration agents have responded with force.

Recently, Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd who had gathered in Chicago's East Side to protest after a crash between the officers and someone they were chasing.

Cavazos says this work — chasing leads or even, at times, following ICE agents — to alert the community can be hard, especially now that the Department of Homeland Security regularly accuses groups like Cavazos' of interfering with their jobs and endangering the lives of immigration officers.

The Trump administration has loudly denounced activist volunteers like Cavazos accusing them of interfering with their jobs and endangering the lives of immigration officers.

""There's that fear,"" Cavazos says. ""But if you're a real community activist, you need to do what's right for your community in spite of the fear … because it is a scary time right now.""

But he remains defiant.

Every morning, with his mate tea in hand, Cavazos checks his phone to verify whether there has been any sighting of ICE agents in the Chicago suburbs.

He sees the role of the People's Patrol as not only helping migrants feel safe and have reliable information, but also fighting for free speech and the right to protest — two things he says the Trump administration is trying to quash.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5712x3213+0+536/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2Fed%2Fed2aed4f4824a00c54648f112f13%2Fimg-4445.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:03:22.484923

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

In late September, plaintiffs in the case presented Judge Talwani of the District Court of Massachusetts examples of USCIS refusing to adjudicate adjustment of status applications of people who arrived through U4U and CHNV. In response, DHS insisted that there is no “categorical hold” on adjudications and provided statistics on the number of parolee applications adjudicated, asserting that between May 28 and September 15, it had adjudicated over 52,000 applications filed by people who had arrived on U4U, CHNV, and family based parole programs, including over 4,300 adjustment applications. DHS clarified that many applications are, however, going through additional review, investigation, and vetting. On October 9, Judge Talwani of the District Court of Massachusetts denied the government’s request to stay litigation over the issue of application adjudication during the government shut down, noting that doing so would “further prolong the period during which class members’ future immigration status remains uncertain” and given that “the federal government will continue immigration enforcement during the government shutdown.”

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

As we reported last month, on September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order protecting people paroled into the United States from expedited removal. This ruling leaves in place the district court’s order, issued on August 1, which found that it was unlawful to place those who entered on humanitarian parole into expedited removal. This means that any person who entered on parole should insist that DHS cannot place them in expedited removal per the lower court’s decision. Here is a practice alert from the National Immigration Project of the Lawyer’s Guild explaining what to do should someone who entered through a port of entry on parole is nonetheless placed in expedited removal.

Sileiri Doe et. al. v. DHS et. al. is a new class action lawsuit filed on August 11 challenging mass termination of parole and revocation of work authorization of people who waited for CBP One appointments and entered through land border ports of entry.

Here’s where we are:

In late September and early October, the two sides in the case presented opposing views of the mass termination. DHS claims “[t]he reasons why a person was granted parole can vary widely” and that people who came into the country using CBP One don’t constitute a harmed class. But lawyers for the parolees assert mass termination was done “in one stroke” to everyone who came to the U.S. through use of the CBP One app. The fact that DHS has discretion to terminate individual paroles does not make mass termination lawful, they argue.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

On October 3, the Supreme Court sanctioned the termination of Venezuela TPS, throwing over 300,000 Venezuelans out of status immediately and several hundred thousand more on November 7. Without TPS, Venezuelans can be arrested, detained, and deported. Congress must provide a solution for Venezuelans and many TPS holders from other countries who are integral members of U.S. communities and at risk of deportation to danger. You can support the National TPS Alliance’s push for legislative reform here.

Two recently implemented policies attest to the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to make parole extremely expensive to attain and to starve out parolees who want to work to support their families. On October 16, the administration began charging a $1,000 fee to anyone granted parole or re-parole, which is in addition to a $580 application fee. These new fees were authorized by the reconciliation package that passed in July. And the Department of Transportation has published a rule that denies those with work permits based on parole status (or asylum applications, TPS status, and most other immigration statuses) eligibility for commercial vehicle licenses, shutting them out of the trucking industry. Several commercial truckers who came in on parole programs and through CBP One appointments have also recently been arrested at weigh stations and interior border patrol check points in Texas and Oklahoma.

The major ongoing immigration enforcement campaigns in Washington DC and Chicago are arbitrary – indiscriminately targeting people who have been living in the cities for decades and those who have more recently arrived on humanitarian parole after entering with CBP One appointments at the border. This has led to increasing legal challenges and solidarity in opposition to the Trump administration’s detention and deportation agenda.

For example, on August 15, a Venezuelan who entered at the border in 2024 with a CBP One appointment and has a pending asylum application was arrested while on his motorbike to do a DoorDash delivery in Washington, DC. Federal officials took him first to the ICE facility in Chantilly, Virginia and then to one in Caroline, where he has developed a rash and severe anxiety while he awaits his court hearing. He is part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of members of the organization CASA and others arrested in DC without a warrant and probable cause. Similarly, on September 9, a Venezuelan man who was paroled after entering in 2023 with a CBP One appointment was arrested during a raid outside the Home Depot on Cicero Avenue in Chicago, though he had documents in his backpack attesting to his temporary protected status. A federal judge has ruled such arbitrary, warrantless arrests violate a court settlement in northern Illinois and similar cases should be referred to NIJC here.

Refugees International is keeping track and collecting stories of enforcement against people who arrived on parole, so please send Yael Schacher the data and accounts you have. In coming newsletters we will be taking stock of what extant data reveals about enforcement against humanitarian parolees. By elevating this data and the stories of people affected, we can contribute to the growing public backlash against the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. New polling from the Refugee Advocacy Lab, Refugees International, and Data for Progress indicate that 59 percent of U.S. voters oppose the Trump administration deporting people who entered the U.S. legally on humanitarian status and are now living and working in U.S. communities.

Latest from Congress

Amid the U.S. government shutdown, the Administration has markedly intensified immigration enforcement operations in major cities—most prominently in Chicago, as discussed above. Several members of Illinois’s Democratic congressional delegation have been denied access to conduct oversight visits at local ICE facilities, including in districts directly affected by enforcement activity. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, condemned what he described as an unprovoked and dangerous escalation of immigration enforcement in Chicago and across the country. According to Administration officials, plans are underway to further expand these operations, leveraging resources from the July reconciliation package, which allocated historic levels of funding to the Department of Homeland Security.

Queer and trans immigrants at a detention facility in south Louisiana have alleged that they faced sexual harassment and abuse, medical neglect and coerced labor by staff at the facility, and that they were repeatedly ignored or faced retaliation for speaking out. In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at the South Louisiana Ice Processing Center (SLIPC) in Basile, Louisiana, said they were recruited into an unsanctioned work program that forced them to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. Detainees also alleged that queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who stalked, harassed and sexually assaulted them.

By doubling down whenever challenged, the Trump administration is creating a negative feedback loop which is leading both sides to harden their opposition.
In short, the administration’s mass deportation is creating a tinderbox that makes all Americans less safe — including DHS officers themselves.","On September 24, 2025, a disturbed young man climbed to the roof of a building outside the Dallas Field Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and opened fire. Before he took his own life, his bullets struck three handcuffed immigrants. Norlan Guzman-Fuentes died at the scene and a second man, Miguel Ángel García, died at the hospital days later. A third man, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, remains hospitalized.

Like multiple shootings in recent months, finding the truth about a motive may never be possible among the fog of internet memes and punditry hypothesizing. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has seized on the moment to declare that the cause is clear; “hateful rhetoric” that is “demonizing” ICE.

The Dallas shooting, in the view of the Department of Homeland Security, is one of many acts of “political violence” inspired by “rhetoric” that has led to “assaults against our brave DHS law enforcement.” In a video entitled “Dangerous Democrat Rhetoric Against ICE” posted by the White House, the administration suggests that everything from California Governor Newsom calling for ICE agents to “unmask yourselves,” to more aggressive comparisons between secret police and internment camps, are a direct cause of violence against ICE.

It’s true that heated rhetoric around immigration has increased in recent years. During the Biden administration and presidential election cycle, this involved candidates and politicians making xenophobic claims of Great Replacement, migrant “invasions,” and Haitian refugees eating pets. Under Trump, the rhetorical battle around immigration has worsened, with public officials calling for “remigration,” Cabinet secretaries accusing opponents of supporting pedophiles, and where even America’s legal immigration agency is now hiring “homeland defenders” to “protect our nation and defend your culture.”

But it is not the words of politicians which are driving some people to become increasingly opposed and outspoken against federal immigration enforcers. Nor is it political rhetoric which has been met with an unprecedented street-level pushback against immigration law enforcement. It is the Trump administration’s radical shift away from standard law enforcement principles and toward a “mass deportation” agenda, as well as the related tactics which are focused more on creating content and hitting arrest quotas than on public safety and national security.

We all want to be safe, and we want law enforcement to adopt policies that keep us safe — and make communities feel safe. It’s also true that ICE officers have a genuine concern for their own safety. Yet the Trump administration’s aggressive mass deportation operations are premised on an explicit goal of making immigrant communities feel unsafe; to frighten millions of immigrants into “self-deportation.” And when communities feel unsafe, the natural reaction is to direct blame towards the most visible cause — increased immigration enforcement and the people carrying it out.

The Trump administration’s campaign of fear is being carried out through aggressive changes in immigration enforcement. Thousands of federal agents from the DEA, ATF, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies have been reassigned to carry out immigration enforcement. The White House has set politically motivated arrest quotas and ordered ICE to stop focusing on people with criminal records and instead raid businesses and trawl public places. DHS is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on nationwide ad campaigns telling people to self-deport. The man in charge of the Los Angeles and Chicago raids has openly told reporters that agents are targeting people for stops based on “how they look.”

This mass deportation effort has led to images and videos of law enforcement agents taking actions that shock many Americans to the core — as it is explicitly intended to do. In the United States, we have little history of masked federal agents jumping out of unmarked vehicles to arrest people at Home Depot, or detaining sobbing immigrant families at courthouses. This clear break from American norms is increasingly unpopular, and has caused President Trump’s polling average on immigration to fall by more than 15 points since taking office.

As federal agents become more aggressive in public spaces, both physically and verbally, images and videos of these operations are circulating social media and going viral. Like the video of George Floyd slowly being starved of oxygen as a police officer sat on his chest, these videos motivated many who might not otherwise care about the issue to be shocked into action. The administration’s constant propaganda about the “worst of the worst” and smearing people who support due process as terrorist-lovers raises the temperature even further. By doubling down whenever challenged, the Trump administration is creating a negative feedback loop which is leading both sides to harden their opposition.

Opaque, aggressive, and seemingly indiscriminate acts of immigration enforcement are now creating new scandals on a near-daily basis, with a growing number of U.S. citizens and others with legal status alleging lengthy detentions and racial profiling. But instead of taking accountability for the inevitable consequences any such abuse of law enforcement power, the administration is instead unabashedly disregarding oversight requirements and blaming others for any unrest.

One of the most egregious examples of this lack of accountability came in late September, where DHS initially suspended an officer for violently shoving a sobbing woman onto the floor of the New York Immigration Court, sending her to the hospital. On September 26, the officer responsible was suspended and DHS’s own spokesperson declared that his conduct was “unacceptable.” Yet by September 29, he was reportedly back on duty.

Unsurprisingly then, the number of protestors and activists opposing ICE’s actions have continued to grow — not top down, from the mouths of politicians, but from the grass roots. This is a direct response to the actions that normal people are seeing in their communities, as well as the rhetoric and lack of accountability they are seeing from the leaders in the White House and DHS. Adding to the sense of anger is the fact that the Trump admin is diverting extensive resources away from other public safety priorities, including political violence, terrorism, and child exploitation while simultaneously undermining public trust in all law enforcement.

Beyond acknowledging the need for accountability, the government could also protect its people better if it didn’t continue to push them to engage in behaviors which Americans view as fundamentally antithetical to professional law enforcement — like masking, refusal to provide identification, and racial profiling. We all have a responsibility to speak out against things we believe the government is doing that are wrong. That should never mean violence. But in a world in which every person can see daily violations of the basic norms of American law enforcement, an official position of impunity is going to radicalize people further. And that is a problem that cannot be solved by chastising Democratic politicians.

In short, the administration’s mass deportation is creating a tinderbox that makes all Americans less safe — including DHS officers themselves. And if the administration keeps barging forward without any changes, there is a real risk that this cycle will keep growing until another tragedy like Dallas occurs.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-287g-communities.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:03:01.630713

Among the worst of the worst arrested during operation Patriot 2.0:","BOSTON — ICE and federal law enforcement partners apprehended more than 1,400 illegal aliens during a weeks-long immigration enforcement operation focusing on transnational organized crime, gangs and egregious illegal alien offenders throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. During the surge operation Patriot 2.0, officers from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston and ICE Homeland Security Investigations New England joined forces with partners from the FBI; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the DEA; the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Marshals Service to arrest an astounding 1,406 illegal alien offenders from Sept. 4 to Sept. 30.

“Patriot 2.0 exposed the grave consequences of sanctuary policies and the urgent need for local leaders to prioritize their constituents’ safety over politics,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “Every illegal alien we arrested during the operation was breaking U.S. immigration law, and hundreds were violent criminals who should never have been allowed to roam freely in our communities. Local law enforcement agencies released them instead of handing them over to us in a secure environment, and this puts neighborhoods, law enforcement officers and illegal aliens at risk. Local politicians are responsible for protecting their constituents, so they need to step up and end irresponsible sanctuary policies.”

More than 600 illegal aliens arrested had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives. Throughout the duration of Operation Patriot 2.0, ICE and its federal law enforcement partners targeted egregious criminal alien offenders, including transnational criminal organizations known to operate in and around Boston and throughout Massachusetts. These organizations include the notorious MS-13, Tren de Aragua, Trinitarios and 18th Street gangs. Six of those arrested were documented members of transnational criminal gangs while several others were gang associates.

ICE and its federal law enforcement partners prosecuted numerous targets who had foreign arrest warrants and Interpol Red Notices, apprehending criminal alien offenders wanted by authorities in several foreign countries. Three of those arrested were known or suspected terrorists.

“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is a significantly safer place to live and work thanks to the hard work and determination of the men and women of ICE and our federal partners. Working together, we were able to arrest more than 1,400 illegal aliens throughout the commonwealth, many of whom had significant criminality in the United States or abroad,” said ICE ERO Boston acting Field Office Director David Wesling. “These include criminal offenders who victimized innocent people and traumatized entire communities — murderers, rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs. All made the mistake of attempting to undermine U.S. immigration law by hiding out in Massachusetts.”

“We continue to work alongside our federal partners to rid our great country of murderers, child predators, gang members, drug traffickers and many more,” said ICE HSI New England Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol. “Public safety and national security remain our number one priority, and we will not relent.”

“Operation Patriot 2.0 should send a clear and unmistakable message: If you are in this country illegally, hiding out and committing crimes, the FBI and our partners will find you, we will arrest you, and we will remove you from our communities,” said Ted E. Docks, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston division. “This latest surge led to the arrests of more than 1,400 illegal aliens, many with violent criminal records. Hundreds were ordered to leave the U.S. but remained here illegally. These are not harmless individuals in search of a better life, they are threats to public safety. The FBI will not sit idly by and let our immigration system be exploited because the rule of law is not optional.”

ICE and its federal law enforcement partners made many of the apprehensions after local jurisdictions refused to honor immigration detainer requests to turn over the offenders and instead chose to release them from custody, forcing officers and agents to make at-large arrests in Massachusetts communities.

“The U.S. attorney’s office will continue to prioritize working with our law enforcement partners to root out and prosecute individuals who are illegally in the United States and breaking federal laws,” said U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley. “By removing these individuals, we have made our communities safer.”

Among the alien offenders apprehended during Operation Patriot 2.0, 277 had been previously ordered removed from the United States by a Justice Department immigration judge. However, they refused to comply with their removal orders and remained in the country illegally.

“ATF is always proud to support our federal, state and local law enforcement partners as they work to protect our communities,” said ATF Boston Special Agent in Charge Thomas Greco. “We will continue to seek the removal of anyone engaged in criminal conduct while unlawfully present in the United States.”

“The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to stand alongside our federal law enforcement partners to disrupt transnational organized crime and illegal alien offenders in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,” said DSS Boston Special Agent in Charge Matthew O’Brien. “Operation Patriot 2.0 demonstrates our shared commitment to protecting our communities, upholding the rule of law, and safeguarding national security.”

All aliens detained during Operation Patriot will remain in ICE custody pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their deportation from the United States.

On September 29, 2025, in what has become a shockingly common occurrence, Huabing Xie died in ICE custody after suffering an apparent seizure. Xie, a citizen of China, is the 23rd person officially reported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to have died in custody this fiscal year, marking 2025 as the deadliest for ICE detainees since 2004. As of writing, two more people have died in ICE detention since the fiscal year ended on September 30.

The first year of the second Trump administration has been even deadlier than 2020, when the unchecked COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the high death toll in detention facilities. The rising fatalities this year are likely caused by several factors, including acute overcrowding, abysmal detention conditions, medical neglect, soaring mental distress, and even gun violence.

Why are so many people dying in ICE custody?

In less than a year, the Trump administration has increased the number of people detained in ICE facilities by almost 50%. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) incarcerates close to 60,000 people. The administration’s push for mass detentions and deportations has led to overcrowding as most facilities now exceed their contractual capacity.

Across detention centers, overcrowding has resulted in dire and inhumane conditions. For example, a Massachusetts ICE field office used a windowless room as a holding area packed with “35 to 40 men” who had to share one toilet without privacy and sleep “head-by-toe” on the concrete floors. Similarly, at Krome Service Processing Center in Florida, people were forced to sleep on the floor and only given “a cup of rice and a glass of water a day.” ICE is refusing to give people enough food in some facilities and provides rotten food at other facilities. These reports are understandably alarming family members and advocates.

Overcrowding and poor hygiene can spread and exacerbate diseases, leading to deaths. But medical neglect in detention can lead to equally harmful consequences. Sick detainees are being denied care, leading to unnecessarily worsening medical conditions. NPR reported that a man with a “serious eye infection for almost two weeks” and a “fever” was denied medication for both conditions.

In another instance, a previously healthy 23-year-old man was unable to walk due to pain after only a few months in ICE confinement because of medical neglect. The Venezuelan asylum seeker was frequently moved between detention centers without the ability to shower or change his clothing, forced to sleep on the floor, and frequently complained of pain. Nurses prescribed him antibiotics and pain medication, but his medical records show that he rarely actually received his prescriptions, and that ICE took his medications from him when it transferred him between detention centers. Ultimately, his symptoms worsened so acutely that he was “taken to medical in a wheelchair, assisted by fellow detainees, because he was unable to walk on his own.” This young man’s story is just one example of countless horrifying incidents occurring out of the public eye.

The Trump administration’s immigration detention policies and the resulting appalling conditions have also led to disastrous effects on detainees’ mental health. Three of the reported deaths are by apparent suicide. Twenty-seven-year-old Brayan Rayo-Garzon was found “unresponsive in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck” in April 2025. During his two-week detention, his appointment with the mental health clinic was rescheduled twice. In June, Jesus Molina-Veya was discovered “unresponsive with a cloth ligature around his neck tied to the bottom rail of the top bunk.” Chaofeng Ge was also found “with a cloth ligature around his neck in a shower stall” four days after his intake assessment. Many other people have reported experiencing acute mental distress in detention, including suicidal thoughts.

And noncitizens in ICE detention have another deadly threat to worry about: gun violence. Two people detained by ICE were killed by a gunman opening fire on an ICE facility in Dallas. This fatal incident was the third shooting at a federal immigration facility in Texas in recent months, bolstering fears about increased political violence. While DHS may not be able to prevent all external violence from impacting people in its custody, it can control the atrocious conditions within ICE detention centers that have caused the deaths of far more immigrants.

How is ICE getting away with this?

People in immigration detention have protested their inhumane treatment to raise awareness, but accountability for ICE remains minimal. For instance, a group of men at Krome staged a peaceful sit-in, while noncitizens in a California detention center staged a hunger strike protesting poor conditions. In New York, a federal judge ordered ICE to hold fewer people in the cells and allow people to shower more frequently at a Manhattan holding facility. But even with a court order, poor conditions persist. Until ICE drastically reduces the number of people it chooses to incarcerate, or elects to stop using detention as punishment, this disturbing trend is unlikely to change.

As of writing, only 17 of the 23 deaths are listed on ICE’s Detainee Death Reporting webpage. The other reports can be found wading through ICE’s news releases. But the official reports of deaths in ICE detention are not the end of the story. As previously detailed, ICE frequently seeks to release critically ill detainees prior to death, allowing them to avoid their reporting requirements. In addition, the Trump administration slashed internal accountability measures by shutting down oversight offices that oversee immigration detention. The agency’s lack of transparency and its obfuscation conceal the gravity of the inhumane treatment people face in ICE custody and allow ICE to avoid accountability.

We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government.","Following a July 24, 2025 public hearing held by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that examined widespread human rights and refugee law violations inflicted by the U.S. government, a coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations that participated in the hearing submitted a follow-up report to the Commission this week. The organizations include Al Otro Lado, Americans for Immigrant Justice, Amnesty International, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Hope Border Institute, Human Rights First, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, the International Refugee Assistance Project, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, RAICES, and Refugees International.

The report addresses questions raised by the Commissioners during the public hearing and includes recommendations for IACHR to investigate and document the mass human rights abuses committed by the United States. Since the hearing took place, the human rights situation in the United States has only deteriorated further. The report documents worsening abuses in the immigration context including:

Disappearances of immigrants who are unfindable in government custody for prolonged periods, causing severe anguish for families and making legal representation impossible. Recently, over 1,000 people reportedly disappeared from a single detention center.

Arbitrary detention in life-threatening conditions, including in dangerous ICE jails where at least 16 people have died from January to September 2025, with reports of delayed or denied medical care leading up to some of the deaths.

Skyrocketing illegal arrests, detention, deportation, and assaults against immigrants, including families with children, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and people with Temporary Protected Status.

Unbearable conditions, medical neglect, and abuses in immigration jails that inflict trauma on adults and children, with one fourteen-year-old child recounting: “[b]eing here has affected my little brother a lot. He doesn’t sleep well. He cries all night. Yesterday he had an attack where he would not stop crying from 7pm to 9pm and he was outside the room crying that he didn’t want to go back in and that he wanted to be free.”

Widespread separation of immigrant parents from their babies, toddlers, and children, with reports of families seeking asylum in the United States forced to choose between being separated from their children or returning to persecution; children placed in foster care after their parents are detained; and children dragged from their beds, zip-tied, and separated from parents.

Expulsions and deportations of people to third countries where they face arbitrary imprisonment, torture, return to danger in home countries, and other rights violations. The U.S. government has carried out some of these forced removals in violation of court orders and with little to no transparency around the terms of the agreements with third countries.

Mass violations of due process protections and refugee law resulting from the government’s systematic efforts to strip people of the right to an immigration hearing regardless of how long they have lived in the United States, and to shut down asylum processing for people fleeing to the United States-Mexico border.

Attempts to conceal abuses and block legal access, including reprisals against lawyers, advocates, journalists, and government officials; the dismantling of oversight agencies; and the denial of statutorily-mandated access to detention centers for Members of Congress.

“The disappearances, mass arrests and detentions, abusive detention conditions, and other human rights violations occurring in the United States threaten all communities and undermine our Nation’s most fundamental values,” Sui Chung, Executive Director, Americans for Immigrant Justice. “We call on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the U.S. Government, and the public to shine light on these problems and take decisive action to end them. The time is now to confront these violations with transparency and urgency.”

“The Trump administration is terrorizing immigrants in the United States through mass disappearance and detention tactics that have caused family separation, increasingly concerning deaths in detention, and third country deportations to danger,” said Margaret Cargioli, directing attorney, policy and advocacy, at Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef). “We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, as well as to conduct site visits of detention facilities as people’s lives are at risk.”

“In less than a year, we have seen this administration strip noncitizens of due process rights, separate families, and deport people to countries they’ve never been to before,” said Maria Fernanda Palacios Herrera, Policy Counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP). “The international community must speak out against the widespread terror and violence inflicted upon asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrant communities by the Trump administration. We respectfully request the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights call on the United States government to cease these human rights violations immediately.”

“The cruelty inflicted on immigrants in the United States reverberates far beyond its borders,” said Taylor Koehler, Policy & Programs Staff Attorney at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL). “Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable. As a global community, we cannot allow that precedent to take hold. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to act with urgency and use every tool within its power to protect immigrants and uphold fundamental human rights in the United States.”

“The Trump administration’s policies are sowing fear and forcing people to make terrible decisions, violently uprooting community members, separating families, disappearing people to abusive detention conditions and to countries where they are in danger or that they don’t know,” said Yael Schacher, Director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “We ask that the IACHR help to stop these violations of human rights by documenting harm, demanding accountability, and promoting an alternative, humane approach to migrants and asylum seekers in countries throughout the Americas.”

“Over the course of the past 10 months, the administration has continued to escalate its attacks on immigrants throughout the United States, both living in our communities and in immigration detention,” said Laura St. John, Legal Director at the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Our clients are reporting extremely alarming conditions in detention centers, more people are at risk of being removed to third countries to which they have no ties, and immigration enforcement is terrorizing our communities. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to sound the alarm on danger and violence that immigrant communities in the United States are being subjected to and ask the Commission to demand that the U.S. government immediately halt all actions that violate the human rights of immigrants in the United States.”

“My colleagues and I know the truth behind the charade. The goal is the money. The strategy is shock and awe. The tactic is terror. The tactic is violence. The tactic is torture. Sadly, this administration no longer needs to work with Central American dictators to house innocent men in mega-prisons because there’s a burgeoning one here at Ft. Bliss,” said Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center.

“This year, we have witnessed people kidnapped from their communities, separated from their children, and arbitrarily detained in deplorable conditions,” said Yannick Gill, Senior Counsel at Human Rights First. “The escalating violations of U.S. and international law deny migrants and asylum seekers their rights under the law. We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government. We urge the United States to end its systematic attacks on immigrants, the dismantling of oversight mechanisms, and retaliation against advocates who seek to shine a light on its rights abuses.”

“The U.S. government is terrorizing people, destroying their physical and mental health in horrendous detention conditions, refusing to listen to their asylum claims, retaining their personal property including original ID documents, and then sending them to Mexico,” said Gretchen Kuhner, Director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI). “Once in Mexico they have no information, no documentation, and are either dumped in the streets near the Mexico-Guatemalan border or deported to their countries of origin. In just nine months, Mexico has received over 11,000 third country nationals from the U.S., many of whom have been separated from their families. We urge the IACHR to denounce these egregious human rights violations that have stripped people of their basic dignity.”

“The United States government continues to wield its outsized and unaccountable geo-political power to enact brutal, prevention-through-deterrence migration policies—where brutality towards certain people seeking lawful protections is the point—and to strong-arm other States in the Americas to do the same,” said Erik Crew, Staff Attorney at Haitian Bridge Alliance (HBA). “These policies continue to target those who should be protected by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the American Convention on Human Rights. We urge the Commission to investigate these escalating violations and hold accountable all States in the region whose bilateral agreements empower these attacks on international human rights, refugee protections, and basic human dignity.”

“As we continue to support migrant families on the U.S. side of the border looking for their relatives in immigration detention, attending to their urgent needs for pastoral and mental health care, and arranging care for their kids in the midst of the true fear of being separated, we also accompany others stranded in Mexico due to the closure of our border to those most vulnerable. This is not just a law enforcement campaign, it’s terror,” said Jesús de la Torre, Assistant Director for Global Migration at the Hope Border Institute. “We thank the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for listening to the testimonies of all the mothers, neighbors and friends who have been brutally impacted by these policies, and we encourage the Commission to keep shedding light on these systemic abuses. The borderlands know well that, in the persistent fight for human dignity, fear never has the last word. We stand committed to uphold our welcoming identity and will continue to organize to support policies that keep families together and help our communities thrive.”",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:02:11.495698

Manhattan Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a final judgment on the matter in a 28-page order that began with a solemn reference to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

“On September 11, 2001, blocks away from this courthouse, nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in a devastating terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center. In the decades since, New York City has remained a prime target for terrorist attacks,” Kaplan wrote. “Among the City’s foremost targets are its bridges, tunnels, and subway and commuter rail systems. The subways alone have been the subject of at least eight terrorist plots since.”

State Attorney General Letitia James’ office asked the courts to require FEMA, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, to grant New York $33.8 million for anti-terrorism protections through its Transit Security Grant Program and not give it to other, less at-risk applicants, upon learning the Trump administration was going to cut the funding on Sept. 30, the eve of the new federal fiscal year.

FEMA cut the funding because New York City’s sanctuary protections for undocumented immigrants do not align with the Trump administration’s hard-line policies on immigration. The decision was not based on the likelihood of the city facing another terrorist attack, as Congress intended.

“Here, Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds. To the contrary, Congress prohibited DHS from imposing such terms by requiring the selection of grant recipients to be ‘based solely on risk,’” Kaplan wrote Thursday.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the money at issue had lapsed by the time the AG’s office sought the court’s intervention and had already been fully obligated to other recipients, that there was no evidence the decision-making behind withholding the funds was arbitrary and capricious, or that the cuts would cause irreparable harm.

Since the TSG program was established in the years following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the MTA has received millions of dollars annually to protect its transportation infrastructure from terrorist attacks, including with technologies that can detect weapons of mass destruction.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch last week called the decision a “profound mistake.” She said the money had also funded canine units trained to detect explosive, chemical or radiological threats in subway stations and tunnels, the employment of undercover officers and heavy weapons teams, and the implementation of broad surveillance systems. Gov. Kathy Hochul said the supposedly law-and-order-focused Trump administration was “defunding the police.”

The White House says the new fee is necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B visa program, and to improve the job market for American workers.
Citizenship and Immigration Services estimated in 2019 that there were more than 600,000 H-1B workers in the U.S.
Fees for all H-1B employers The $100,000 fee applies both to businesses looking to hire international talent as well as non-profit research institutions.
Compete America, a coalition representing corporations, universities, research institutions, and trade associations looking to reform immigration policies for skilled workers, urged the Trump administration to reverse course.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced Thursday that it is suing the Trump administration to block the addition of a $100,000 fee on new petitions for H-1B visas, which the Chamber argues is both unlawful and misguided.

The fee also faces a separate challenge by the American Association of University Professors and a coalition of labor unions, healthcare providers, schools, and religious organizations, which sued the administration earlier this month, arguing the new fee has “already thrown employers, workers, and federal agencies into chaos.”

Both the Chamber and the AAUP lawsuits aim to block President Donald Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation modifying the H-1B program — the avenue through which many skilled workers from abroad are hired in the U.S.

Both lawsuits argue that the administration’s sudden decision to impose the extra fee — which went into effect on Sept. 21 — is unlawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. “The H-1B program has a carefully crafted fee and oversight system set by law. The president cannot rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by proclamation,” the AAUP lawsuit says.

Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the Chamber, said in a press release that the new fee would make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers to access global talent.

“The president has said he wants to educate, attract, and retain the world’s best and brightest in the U.S., and the Chamber shares that goal,” Bradley said.

The White House says the new fee is necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B visa program, and to improve the job market for American workers. “The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor,” the proclamation states. It also argues abuses of the program threaten national security by depressing wages and “discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.”

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services estimated in 2019 that there were more than 600,000 H-1B workers in the U.S. The program allows companies to hire up to 65,000 workers annually, with an additional 20,000 spots for workers with advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Non-profit research institutions, universities, and government research organizations are not subject to these caps.

Fees for all H-1B employers

The $100,000 fee applies both to businesses looking to hire international talent as well as non-profit research institutions.

Although non-profit organizations such as universities and federal labs are exempted from H-1B worker caps, the administration has given no indication that these organizations will likewise be exempt from the new fees. An analysis of federal data conducted by Inside Higher Ed suggests that U.S. colleges and universities secured approval for more than 16,000 new H-1B employees in fiscal year 2025, with 930 institutions employing at least one H-1B visa holder.

The proclamation indicates that the government may waive fees on request under a national interest clause, but these requests will be considered by the Department of Homeland Security on a case-by-case basis. The AAUP lawsuit describes this offer as “vague” with “no clear standards for fee exemptions, opening the door to arbitrary, pay-to-play decisions.”

The AAUP lawsuit also describes the administration’s decision to set the fee at $100,000 as “arbitrary and capricious” arguing that it is “untethered from the cost of adjudicating H-1B petitions or any other petitions” — a sentiment that is echoed in the Chamber’s lawsuit. Previously, H-1B petition processing fees were typically a few thousand dollars.

“When the government makes it prohibitively expensive or impossible for these professionals to come to America, or for current H-1B workers to transition to a more permanent status, universities and entire communities lose — patients wait longer for care, students have fewer teachers, and local economies miss out on the innovation and jobs these experts create,” AAUP wrote in a press release.

Some of AAUP’s members have already been affected by the policy change, with the group’s lawsuit citing a case where a university indefinitely paused the pursuit of an H-1B visa for a professor because of the new fee.

Meanwhile, some Republicans in Congress have made clear they do not think universities should receive special treatment when it comes to hiring foreign talent. In July, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) introduced a bill proposing to take away universities’ cap-exempt status, with a companion bill introduced in the House by Reps. Thomas Tiffany (R-WI) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA). In September, Cotton introduced a broader bill that would close other “loopholes” in the H-1B system.

“Colleges and universities shouldn’t get special treatment for bringing in woke and anti-American professors from around the world. My bill closes these loopholes that universities have abused for far too long,” Cotton said in a statement.

Wider impacts for foreign talent

Though the H-1B program is for skilled foreign workers, the new fee could also deter international students from pursuing study in the U.S., wrote Lindsay Milliken, associate director of public policy research and analysis at the American Institute of Physics, in an analysis of the visa policy change. (AIP’s research team is separate from FYI.)

“International students in the U.S. on F-1 visas are often interested in transitioning on to H-1Bs after the completion of their academic programs,” Milliken wrote. “This expense may cause international students in the physical sciences to lose their employment opportunities and research organizations to be unable to afford to hire international STEM graduates of U.S. universities.”

While media coverage of the new H-1B fees has largely focused on how it will affect big tech companies, advocacy groups focused on research and innovation are also starting to voice concern that visa program changes will hinder the ability of the U.S. to attract and retain talented people from abroad.

The review of Lebanon’s Welcoming Ordinance and Hanover’s Fair and Impartial Policing policy comes in response to two new anti-sanctuary city laws Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed in May. They ban communities from preventing local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Lebanon and Hanover policies both contain immigration-related provisions that could violate the new laws come Jan. 1, when most sections, including a clause that introduces financial penalties, take effect.

If the municipalities don’t amend or repeal their current policies — which both adopted in 2020 — they could face penalties of up to 25% of the total funding they receive from the state.

Both ordinances came in the wake of an immigration crackdown under the first Trump administration. In summer 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol conducted a high profile checkpoint on Interstate 89 in Lebanon and in a separate instance arrested 18 people without immigration documentation over the course of one weekend.

Neither Hanover nor Lebanon police have received any requests to assist federal immigration authorities in at least the past five years, Hanover Police Chief James Martin and Lebanon Police Chief Phil Roberts said Thursday.

On Wednesday night, the Lebanon City Council discussed how to amend the city’s “Welcoming Ordinance,” which bars city employees, volunteers and Lebanon police from asking about people’s immigration status or sharing information with federal immigration authorities. The Hanover Selectboard held a similar discussion last week.

“I think there are important provisions worth protecting that are not addressed in the new laws that have been passed in the state Legislature this year,” Lebanon Mayor Doug Whittlesey said Wednesday night. “It has been a hallmark of our community that we are welcoming to everyone.”

The City Council briefly discussed three options; to repeal the policy, amend the policy or leave it as is and face penalties. The council will hold a public hearing to discuss the options further next month.

Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting, Whittlesey drafted a revised version of the policy to remove any potentially problematic language. Voters approved the original ordinance by a narrow margin of 200 votes, or 9%, in 2020.

The draft policy introduces exceptions to the provisions throughout by including the phrase “to the extent required by State and Federal law.” Whittlesey said he added the language to make the policy flexible if the law continues to change.

The draft policy also dictates that Lebanon staff, volunteers and police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities if they are presented with a judicial warrant or a request under the state’s right to know law, RSA 91-A.

It preserves language that prohibits Lebanon staff, volunteers and police from offering federal immigration authorities access to city resources and adds language prohibiting Lebanon police from questioning people’s immigration statuses themselves.

As an alternative to Whittlesey’s proposal, Assistant Mayor Devin Wilkie presented a separate resolution “affirming the city’s commitment to the diversity and belonging of all of its residents and opposing discrimination.”

“While Lebanon must comply with the letter of state law, it will do so without surrendering its moral and ethical obligations to protect human rights, and without participating in or facilitating any acts of hate, fear or exclusion,” the resolution concludes.

Wilkie was on the original task force that produced the welcoming ordinance in 2020 and is one of two council representatives on the Lebanon Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Commission.

Wilkie said he is in favor of repealing the ordinance and creating a task force to write a new policy that better preserves the intent of the original. The draft amended ordinance could be “a really good framework” for a new policy, he said.

The City Council has met with legal counsel to review the documents and plans to have any other revisions reviewed by a lawyer, Wilkie said.

Councilor George Sykes floated the third option: Leaving the ordinance as is and facing a penalty from the state.

“We have to be looking at more than just those two options,” Sykes said Wednesday night.

The council scheduled a public hearing to discuss the ordinance on Wednesday, Nov. 5.

At Town Meeting this spring, Hanover voters supported updating the town’s 2020 policy by adding a provision explicitly calling on the town manager and police chief not to enter any agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

The item was brought before the town by a voter petition in response to a still ongoing immigration crackdown by the Trump Administration. President Trump also issued an executive order in April promising to crackdown on “sanctuary cities” across the country.

The policy, as written, prohibits Hanover Police from trying to determine a person’s immigration status or contacting ICE to inform them of a person’s immigration status, and outlaws biased policing.

Hanover Town Manager Robert Houseman asked a town attorney to review the policy and identify which portions of it violate state law. He presented the results of this conversation at a Selectboard meeting last week.

The changes would remove a brief clause prohibiting officers from contacting or notifying ICE “about the undocumented individual based solely on an individual’s undocumented status.”

It would also eliminate two larger sections, six and seven, which further prohibit Hanover Police from working with or sharing information with federal immigration authorities and from cooperating with an ICE detainer.

ICE detainers are when local law enforcement hold a person in custody after they are cleared for release in order to give ICE time to determine the person’s immigration status or take action against them.

Last week, the Hanover board briefly discussed the options of amending the policy or keeping it as is and facing a possible fine, but made no decisions on how to proceed.

As of August, a 25% state funding penalty would be about $75,000 for Hanover, according to numbers shared by Houseman.

“We are in no rush, the penalty will kick in in January,” Houseman told the Selectboard last week.

The Hanover Selectboard will hold a public hearing about the policy at its Nov. 3 meeting.",https://vnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/f29f515b-3bd6-4c87-b865-67e7078d0241.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:57:49.055842

Wasn’t there already a 'No Kings Day'?","In the latest in a series of mass protests since President Donald Trump took office, ""No Kings"" rallies and marches will be held at more than 2,500 locations nationwide on Oct. 18.

The protests are meant as a celebration of free speech, the right to assemble and the First Amendment broadly. It is also an opportunity to push back against recent moves by Trump's administration including increased immigration enforcement, organizers say.

“This, without question, will be the single biggest day of protest in American history,"" said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen, which is helping organize the rallies. “Since we last did this, people have become far more aware of what is going wrong with this administration.""

Rallies, protests and marches will be held in big cities and small towns across the country. Protesters are being urged to wear yellow.

Asked for reaction to the protests Oct. 14, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson replied “Who cares?”

Where are the events?

The biggest protests are planned for outside the Capitol in Washington, DC, Boston, New York, Atlanta, Kansas City, San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans and Bozeman, Montana.

Most states have multiple, or even hundreds of, scheduled events.

Like other mass protests this year local activists have been urged to create their own events that reflect their community.

""It is truly a grassroots effort that depends on local leaders, that is how we've tried to design this. Literally anybody can start a No King's Day event, and we encourage it,” Levin said. “If you've got to drive more than 30 minutes or an hour, consider getting a few friends together and starting your own in your own hometown.”

Who is putting this on?

Groups organizing the No Kings protests include the ACLU, American Federation of Teachers, Common Defense, 50501, Human Rights Campaign, Indivisible, League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn, National Nurses United, Public Citizen, SEIU and United We Dream.

Why is it called 'No Kings'?

The name ""No Kings"" comes from the organizers' belief that Trump is acting like a monarch rather than the leader of a democracy.

""America has no kings, and the power belongs to the people,"" their website says.

Wasn’t there already a 'No Kings Day'?

The first ""No Kings Day"" protests on June 14 were organized to coincide with Trump’s 79th birthday and Flag Day when there was a military parade in Washington, DC, in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary.

That day, there were protests in more than 1,800 communities to oppose what they saw as Trump's power grab.

Is it safe to go?

Congressional Republicans have claimed that the protests will be full of ""antifa"" and are ""hate-America"" rallies.

At a press conference Oct. 10, House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota accused Democrats of keeping the government closed at the request of activists.

“This is about one thing and one thing alone ‒ to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold … a hate America rally in DC next week,"" Emmer said.

Rally organizers told USA TODAY they expect the crowds to peacefully celebrate their First Amendment right to protest. Local organizers were required to undergo crowd safety and deescalation training.

""We are taking to the streets to exercise our First Amendment rights and speak out. We are not planning anything in any way that could be misconstrued as violence. And we are working hard to protect people, providing lots of training and preparation and creating systems and mechanisms to make sure that people who turn out are safe,"" Gilbert said.

Protests led by these same organizers over the past year, including the June 14 rally, have been peaceful.

The SSHD is accused of having an unlawful policy of only issuing proof of lawful status through eVisas, and failing to issue alternative proof of status outside of this system.

Background

On 1 January 2025, the UK Government implemented eVisas – a digital-only record of immigration status for millions of people. Since then, an eVisa is the only means by which many can prove their lawful residence in the UK and evidence their linked rights and entitlements. Previously, immigration status was verified through physical documents, such as Biometric Residence Permits.

While the Government has presented the digitalisation of immigration status as a move toward efficiency and modernisation, the eVisa system has been fraught with technical and administrative failures. Examples of the failures include individuals being unable to access their eVisa, while others have found their digital status contains inaccurate or outdated information regarding their personal details and or immigration status. These issues have often resulted in severe consequences including individuals being prevented from returning to the UK, losing employment offers, being unable to rent, facing homelessness and being denied access public funds.

While the Home Office has a number of what it refers to as ‘work arounds’ including ways for landlords, employers and others to verify immigration status using the system and provides ways to report eVisa issues so that they can be fixed, including an online form, a webchat function, and a helpline — these avenues are often inadequate due to issues such as delays which leaves individuals without proof of their lawful status and exposed to the full force of the hostile/compliant environment.

Our challenge

We have been instructed by a number of individuals who have found themselves without proof of their lawful status in the UK as a consequence of the issues with their eVisa accounts, and been exposed to the hostile/compliant environment. Two of our clients, BSC and JS, subsequent to the resolution of the issues with their eVisa accounts, have now been appointed as Lead Claimants in our the policy challenge which continues on significant wider public interest grounds.

In the case of BSC, a recognised refugee and survivor of trafficking, the eVisa displayed her trafficking name and date of birth. The consequences of this were wide ranging, but most significantly they were retraumatising and put her at risk of losing public funds she relied on to survive. Whilst in JS, a vulnerable adult, the eVisa incorrectly stated that she had no recourse to public funds. As a consequence, she was denied access to public funds and had to rely on limited asylum support payments for months longer she should have. In both cases, the eVisas were fixed months later after we issued the claims.

Unfortunately, our clients’ experiences are not isolated. According to recent reports gathered by the3million and the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA) reporting tool, some of the most common complaints about the eVisa system have included basic errors such as incorrect personal details, issues getting the Home Office to fix errors, and the inability to access eVisa at all[1].

Given the above, we have challenged the Home Secretary’s unlawful policy of only issuing proof of status, to around ten million individuals, through the eVisa system only and refusing to issue alternative proof of status outside this system (even when there are issues with individuals eVisa accounts).

Our challenge focuses on the fact that the statutory framework does not prevent the Home Secretary from issuing alternative proof of immigration status. In fact, the Home Secretary has discretion to do so where appropriate. Her refusal to do so is therefore arguably unlawful as it is a fetter of her discretion and irrational.

On 9 October 2025, the Cardiff Administrative Court granted us permission to proceed with the challenge on the basis that the grounds are arguable and in the public interest. This is a significant development which has taken us a step closer to hopefully establishing a much-needed safeguard in the eVisa system which will mean that individuals such as our clients are no longer left at the mercy of the eVisa system to prove their lawful immigration status in the UK.

We would like to thank the following orgs for their invaluable help in our clients’ challenge to the eVisa system: The 3Million, Citizens Advice Barnet, Citizens Advice Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole, Migrants Organise, Notre Dame Refugee Centre, Refugee Asylum Seeker & Migrant Action, Southwark Law Centre, and the Unity Project.

We will continue to advise and support individuals and organisations navigating eVisa issues. If you, or someone you support, are experiencing difficulties accessing or correcting your eVisa account our team is available to assist.

The fee seeks to ""strengthen oversight of the immigration parole system and deter its misuse,"" the agency said in a news release.

""The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The fees are triggered once the grant is effective, not when a parole request is filed or a travel document is received.

,Human Rights,2025-10-17 14:32:57+00:00,France 24,'I ended up losing my mind': Six days in solitary confinement at an ICE facility - France 24,"The FRANCE 24 Observers, Lise KIENNEMANN, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251017-usa-solitary-confinement-ice-detention-centre,"But it was in solitary confinement that he claims he ""ended up losing [his] mind"".
But because I was in solitary confinement, I ended up losing my mind, and I ended up requesting my bond hearing.” A bond hearing – a court proceeding to determine if a defendant can be released from jail before trial – was scheduled while John remained in solitary confinement.
Focusing on the northeastern United States, the study found that nearly three-quarters of solitary confinement placements exceeded the 15-day limit.
The detrimental health effects of prolonged solitary confinement have been extensively documented, spanning everything from posttraumatic stress disorder to self-harm, higher suicide risks, and hallucinations.
I will feel the same way I did when I was in solitary confinement.”","“The worst days of my life” – that’s how “John” (a pseudonym we use to protect his identity) describes his stay in solitary confinement.

The man, a Latin American national in his twenties, said he spent six days in isolation while requiring medical care at an ICE detention facility in South Texas. Speaking in a video call from Latin America, where he currently lives, he told our team:

“I was in a place where I was alone. It was horrible. I didn’t have the right to do anything. I was allowed to go out for one hour in a very small place with a basketball hoop. It was a cell too, where I would be by myself.""

Solitary confinement – which ICE refers to as “segregation” – is the isolation of a person in a small, individual cell without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day.

Amid an intensifying immigration crackdown since President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, human rights groups are sounding the alarm over the growing use of this practice by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – and the psychological impact on thousands of detainees.

Since Trump’s inauguration, authorities have arrested more than 220,000 people, according to data published by The Guardian. Some 59,760 were in detention as of September 22, 2025, compared with 39,700 in mid-January 2025, just before Trump took office.

Between December 2024 and the end of August 2025, the number of ICE detainees who spent at least a day in solitary confinement increased by 41%, according to an analysis by nonprofit news organisation The Marshall Project and Spanish-language network Univision. The analysis found that in August, more than 1,100 ICE detainees had spent time in solitary.

A study by Physicians for Human Rights released in September 2025 found that during the first four months of the second Trump presidency, the number of individuals placed in solitary confinement increased by an average of 6.5 per cent per month – nearly twice the average monthly increase observed from 2018 to 2023. The group noted that the trend of more frequent use of isolation by ICE had started during the Biden administration.

A ‘very small room’ with a ‘very small window’

Our Observer arrived in the US legally several years ago, but later lost his visa due to a relative’s neglect. After he was arrested by ICE in 2025, he spent three days in an ICE “hold room”, where he says he slept on the ground without a blanket in a small, overcrowded space and was denied a shower. Following this, he was transferred more than 2,000 kilometres away to the South Texas Detention facility.

From there, he recalls the ""terrible food"" and the cells holding 100 people, whose cellphones had been confiscated and had to rely on just four working phones for outside calls. But it was in solitary confinement that he claims he ""ended up losing [his] mind"".

John claims he was put in solitary confinement after he developed a painful rash, and the medical unit nurse couldn't identify it. He says he then spent a whole day in isolation without seeing a doctor.

In a call to his girlfriend, which she recorded and shared with the Observers team, John said, while sobbing, that a doctor was supposed to visit but hadn’t arrived. John said he was worried that he had been forgotten.

He was finally sent to the medical unit the following day, where he was examined and spent two days. However, he was then returned to solitary confinement, because, he says, there were too few beds in the medical unit, and people in worse condition than him. He was released from solitary five days later.

John and the other detainees referred to the solitary cells as ""el pozo"", Spanish for ""the well"". He described it as follows:

“It was a very small room: about 4 feet [1.2 metres] long and 8 feet [2.4 metres] wide. There was a toilet and a sink on top; one bed and a thin mattress; and a very, very small window. The window was above me, so I couldn't even see what was behind.

There was no space for anything. There was only a small space on the door where they were able to pass me the food.

It was just horrible. It was very, very cold. Sometimes, when I tried to sleep, I couldn't because it was too cold.”

‘They wouldn't change my clothes’

Contacted by the FRANCE 24 Observers team, ICE referred us to a directive originally issued in 2013. It indicates: “ICE shall ensure the safety, health, and welfare of detainees in segregated housing in its immigration detention facilities.” The document outlines two reasons for the use of segregation: “administrative segregation” for the safety of the detainee or other detainees and “disciplinary segregation” as punishment for “serious misconduct” following a hearing.

“At some point, the doctor went to solitary confinement and explained to me why I was there and that I was only going to be able to get out of there once I was healed. But it took me more time being there because they didn't give me medicine. The doctors only came every other day.

When you are in solitary confinement, they take everything that people may use to kill themselves. You are not allowed to have medicine. Because that place is horrible, officers are scared that people might take a lot of pills.

They wouldn't change my clothes. I spent several days in the same clothes. It was horrible.”

In a call to his girlfriend recorded just after he was sent back to solitary, he said he was receiving no medical care. He can be heard banging on the door and asking the guards to bring him medicine.

Regarding John’s allegations that he lacked adequate care during his stay, the ICE spokesperson said that without further information, the agency could not comment on his case.

‘I felt helpless’

John’s girlfriend, Lina (a pseudonym), is a Latin American national who now lives with John in his home country. She recalls the day she received his first call from solitary:

“ That day, he called me at 8am. I answered, and he said to me, ‘I need you to start recording this.’

I was desperate because he was again crying and asking me for help. And I felt helpless.

I called the centre asking them: ‘Hey, this person needs a new set of clothes.’ They would only say, ‘Oh, yeah, we're going to do it.’ And then [John] will call me, saying that he's been wearing the same clothes. He sweated for several days. His wounds were open, and he was sweating. So it made it worse.”

Just like John, dozens of detainees served one or more days in “segregation” each month at the South Texas Detention Facility in 2025, according to ICE data. In August, for instance, 129 individuals spent time in solitary. The centre has a capacity of 1,904 according to Geo Group, the company that operates the facility.

‘Inside the solitary cell is where I ended up losing my mind’

Solitary confinement also impacted John’s immigration fate:

“I was supposed to wait a few more weeks in detention because, as I came to the US with a visa, I was fighting my case [to remain in the US]. But because I was in solitary confinement, I ended up losing my mind, and I ended up requesting my bond hearing.”

A bond hearing – a court proceeding to determine if a defendant can be released from jail before trial – was scheduled while John remained in solitary confinement. His virtual presence at the hearing was granted after his girlfriend made numerous calls to both the detention centre and the court. However, his bond was denied.

That same day, he was supposed to face the first hearing of his removal proceedings. But he claims he was not allowed to attend, even virtually: “Those things started to let me down emotionally.”

Following the bond rejection, he decided to drop his efforts to stay in the US. He cited the time spent in solitary confinement as a factor in his decision to agree to be deported to his home country.

“Emotionally, I was drained. Most of the other detainees from my country decided to give up too, and in my detention centre, ICE was not letting people get out. So nobody was released from detention except if they were deported. There were people who were in that place for over a year, and I didn't want that.”

‘I have nightmares’

The United Nations has said that holding a person more than 15 days in solitary confinement constitutes torture – a threshold ICE frequently exceeds, according to the September 2025 report.

Focusing on the northeastern United States, the study found that nearly three-quarters of solitary confinement placements exceeded the 15-day limit. The report referred to the “systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes, including punishing people for filing grievances; requesting basic needs like showers; sharing food; or reporting sexual assault”.

The detrimental health effects of prolonged solitary confinement have been extensively documented, spanning everything from posttraumatic stress disorder to self-harm, higher suicide risks, and hallucinations.

However, research shows that even brief periods of isolation can be detrimental to an individual's mental health.

Months after his release, John remains haunted by his stay in that cell.

“I have a lot of nightmares. Sometimes, when I lie down, I close my eyes, and then I remember solitary confinement or the detention itself. I will feel physically in that place. I try not to think about that, but sometimes it's very hard because the picture is on my mind. I will feel the same way I did when I was in solitary confinement.”",https://s.france24.com/media/display/3d639f44-aa9d-11f0-9741-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Design-sans-titre-11.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:02:19.824126

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide.
A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.
“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call.
The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.","Nearly two dozen states are suing the Trump administration over its cancellation of a $7bn grant program aimed at expanding solar energy in low-income communities, according to court papers.

In a statement on Thursday, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, announced two lawsuits by a group of states that received grants under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced the termination of the program in August. The agency said in an email that it would not comment on pending litigation.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Some 11,000 low-income households in Arizona will see a 20% spike in energy bills after the state lost $156m for Solar for All.

The lawsuit is among dozens the country’s 23 Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration on issues ranging from suspension of federal grants to immigration and deployment of national guard troops to cities. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said in an online call.

The first complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed on Wednesday in the court of federal claims. A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.

California will lose around $250m in congressionally obligated funds for the program, Bonta said.

“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump in July eliminated the source of funding for a program Zeldin termed a “boondoggle”. The president has rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable resources expensive and unreliable.

Mayes said the program’s cancellation would hit disadvantaged communities, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona, which was slated to get a $25m award to bring electricity, often for the first time, to hundreds of homes using solar panels and battery storage systems.

The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.

In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the city of Washington DC.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75bbc39da9582cc247cabe50c239037b3152ebc4/891_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c49e1a8f7fc667d3f7231f5464312e7",N,,2025-10-17 12:04:32.804137

But courts move slowly, and the struggle over who is obligated to enforce immigration laws appears set to intensify quickly.","Donald J. Trump has been railing against sanctuary cities for a decade, describing them as hotbeds of crime and magnets for undocumented immigrants. Attacking them was a staple of both of his presidential campaigns. So it was hardly a surprise when he signed an executive order in April directing the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to “pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures” to force cities and states to implement federal immigration laws.

A White House news release that accompanied the executive order quoted a note that the president posted on Truth Social a few weeks earlier: “No more Sanctuary Cities!” he wrote. “They protect the Criminals, not the Victims. They are disgracing our Country, and are being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps to exist!!!”

In the six months since, we’ve learned what “enforcement measures” look like: hundreds of officers from several federal agencies swarming city centers, apprehending unauthorized migrants — and sometimes American citizens — during raids and traffic stops. In June, this drama unfolded in Los Angeles. In August, in Washington, D.C. It’s now happening in Chicago, and — pending court challenges — may happen in Portland, Ore.

More than 300 sanctuary jurisdictions exist in the United States — including those four cities and several entire states, according to the political scientists Loren Collingwood and Benjamin Gonzalez O’Brien. Some have passed laws barring city employees from asking individuals about their immigration status. Others will not honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people unless they are suspected of violent crimes.

The Trump administration’s campaign to “end” sanctuary cities faces steep legal hurdles. But courts move slowly, and the struggle over who is obligated to enforce immigration laws appears set to intensify quickly. On Sept. 30, when the president addressed hundreds of active-duty generals and admirals in Virginia, he suggested that the military should use American cities “as training grounds.” He poured vitriol on Democratic-led cities and said that inner cities were “a big part of war now.”

“It’s the enemy from within,” he said of civil disturbances. “And we have to handle it before it gets out of control.”

Under the 287(g) program, LVMPD officers can execute civil immigration warrants and detain individuals at the Clark County Detention Center on behalf of ICE, even when they would otherwise be released.

The lawsuit, ACLU of Nevada v. LVMPD, was filed on behalf of Morais-Hechavarria, an ACLU of Nevada client who remains in custody under an ICE hold despite a Nevada judge ordering his transfer to a treatment facility.

Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, condemned the agreement, stating that “LVMPD’s 287(g) agreement with ICE… forces Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work while simultaneously disregarding a lawfully issued order by a Nevada court.”

He added, “A person shouldn’t rot in a detention facility when ordered into treatment because the federal government has pressured local governments and local police into complicity with a disastrous… approach to immigration enforcement.”

Sadmira Ramic, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, emphasized the broader implications, saying, “This is not just a civil rights issue but has transformed into a human rights issue.” She argued that LVMPD’s cooperation with ICE “undermines our judicial system and creates unnecessary suffering,” reaffirming the ACLU’s commitment to ensuring that local entities cannot overstep their authority.

More than 170 US citizens were reportedly detained by immigration agents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration, according to an investigation by ProPublica that alleges several citizens were assaulted, restrained or held without timely release.

The report by the nonprofit investigative journalism organization comes after a Supreme Court decision allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to consider race during enforcement operations. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said citizens “shouldn’t be concerned,” since they would be released once their legal status was verified.

However, ProPublica claims its findings suggest otherwise.

It said that “Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents,” with some held outdoors in harsh conditions or detained while pregnant. Nearly 20 of those detained were reportedly children, including two with cancer.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied any wrongdoing, stating that agents “do not racially profile or target Americans.”

But Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino was quoted as acknowledging that agents may consider appearance, saying to a reporter: “How do they look compared to, say, you?”

ProPublica cited examples such as Leonardo Garcia Venegas, a construction worker in Alabama, who said agents dismissed his real ID and detained him despite confirming his citizenship, and George Retes, a disabled veteran, who said he was held for three days after a workplace raid in California.

Many of the incidents reviewed reportedly ended without charges being filed. ProPublica said that of the over 170 identified cases, nearly 50 were dismissed or resulted in no prosecution.

Civil rights advocates expressed concern that race-based enforcement practices could affect US citizens.

“Any one of us could be next,” said Cody Wofsy of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The White House told ProPublica that “anyone who assaults law enforcement will be held accountable,” emphasizing that federal agents act “with professionalism to enforce the law and protect American communities.”

ProPublica said its data was compiled from lawsuits, court records and media reports, noting that official statistics on such detentions are not publicly available.

The report adds that large-scale enforcement sweeps have increased in several states, raising debate about oversight and citizens’ constitutional protections.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/10/17/thumbs_b_c_bbc121a7662b8e75903c54f9d7d28a9f.jpg?v=074405,N,,2025-10-17 12:04:46.496673

The Department of Homeland Security says Radule Bojovic overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015. Bojovic was set to be sworn in Thursday night as a Hanover Park police officer at the village board meeting.

DHS says Bojovic was encountered during a targeted enforcement action part of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in the Chicago area.

Federal officials also said that Hanover Park police records confirm he was approved by the pension fund board of trustees in January 2025.

Bojovic was seen in a Facebook post from the police department provided by DHS, which was taken in August after the officer graduated from the suburban law enforcement academy.

DHS released a statement on the arrest Thursday afternoon, saying in part, ""Governor J.B. Pritzker doesn't just allow violent illegal aliens to terrorize Illinois's communities, he allows illegal aliens to work as sworn police officers. Radule Bojovic violated our nation's laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also commented on social media, saying ""ICE arrested an illegal alien working as a sworn police officer in Chicago suburb... radical sanctuary politicians have allowed criminal illegal aliens to infiltrate our school districts, communities and even police departments.""

The Village of Hanover Park shared the following statement Thursday afternoon:

""The Hanover Park Police Department hired Officer Bojovic in January 2025 in full compliance with federal and state law. Before hiring Officer Bojovic, the Village confirmed that he was legally authorized by the federal government to work in the United States. At the time of his hire, Officer Bojovic presented the Village with a Work Authorization Card, which was issued by the federal government's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The card was valid and recently renewed. We also conducted a full background check, including his criminal history with both the Illinois State Police and the FBI.

""The bottom line is that all information we received from the federal government indicated that Officer Bojovic is legally authorized to work in the United States as a police officer. Clearly, without that authorization, the Village would not have hired him. Additionally, the Village has not received any notice from any federal or state agency that his work authorization status has ever been revoked.

""Further, the Village also confirmed, based on a memorandum issued by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives on January 5, 2024, that his immigration status allows him to carry a firearm while on duty.

""Officer Radule Bojovic has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the immigration proceedings he is now facing. If he is permitted to remain in the United States and remains legally authorized to work in this country, he will be returned to full duty status.""

Lee",,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-trump-continue-normal-government-shutdown-rcna237846,"Like Congress, Trump has been busy with government business, holding an average of nearly an event a day since the shutdown began.
The White House has called several aides who were initially furloughed back to work in recent days.
At the same time, the White House has used the shutdown as cover to fire some federal workers.
Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance.
“Snort,” she replied when she was asked at her birthday party how Congress and the White House might reach a resolution to reopen the government.","WASHINGTON — On Day 15 of the government shutdown, a U.S. senator hosted a well-attended birthday party for his bulldog.

Dozens of Hill staffers lined up inside the Capitol on Wednesday to wish Republican Sen. Jim Justice’s pup a happy birthday as she sat under a balloon arch wearing a pink and white hat. They noshed on cakes and dozens of cake pops shaped in 6-year-old Babydog’s likeness.

At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump gathered some of the richest people in the country for dinner at the White House. There were beef Wellington, butterscotch ice cream and gold-rimmed china but no mention of the government shutdown during Trump’s 37-minute-long remarks thanking his guests for their donations for a new White House ballroom.

“This is really a knockout crowd,” Trump said Wednesday evening, noting that their collective donations have exceeded the ballroom’s $250 million price tag.

And so it has been for the power brokers in Washington during a government shutdown that appears to have no end in sight. While thousands of federal workers are furloughed — or fired — and trying to stay afloat without paychecks, the ones responsible for the shutdown are literally, and figuratively, eating cake.

The business-as-usual nature for elected officials in Washington, and some of their aides, is in contrast to the experience of others in the nation’s capital, where federal offices, as well as many parks, landmarks and museums, are closed, and of many people across the country. It also solidifies what now seems to be a bygone era of government shutdowns — one when elected officials wouldn’t want to be caught anywhere near parties or other nonessential indulgences.

“Everything still seems to be the same, except it’s not. Except most of these people aren’t getting paid,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News, noting that the Senate has continued its committee hearings, constituent meetings and normal voting schedules despite the shutdown. “I don’t think that’s right. I just don’t think that’s right. And so, yeah, it’s — and it just feels different than any other shutdown.”

The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 after Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the president, couldn’t agree on a spending bill to keep it funded.

Lawmakers have since been working, to be sure. They’re delivering floor speeches blaming the opposing party for the shutdown and repeatedly casting votes on the same two resolutions to reopen the government that they know don’t have enough support. Some lawmakers have been having informal discussions about potential ways to break the logjam, but Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told NBC News on Thursday that while those talks had been “productive ... they’re done.” Members of Congress also continue to get paid, as their pay is protected under the Constitution.

But members of their staffs and the many people who keep the Capitol operating aren’t. A congressional staffer, who asked not to be named to protect their privacy, said that while Congress doesn’t seem to be in a big hurry to reopen the government, the shutdown is urgent for them and their family.

“My husband is a federal worker too, so for us, this is definitely urgent. We have a family to support,” the staffer told NBC News.

Like Congress, Trump has been busy with government business, holding an average of nearly an event a day since the shutdown began. He has traveled to the Middle East to mark a deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. He’s hosting foreign leaders. Later this month, he is scheduled to take a multiday trip to Asia for world leader summits and meetings.

Trump also went forward this week with a previously scheduled Rose Garden ceremony honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last month, on what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. On Friday, he’ll meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss the war with Russia before he hops on a flight to Florida to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

The White House has called several aides who were initially furloughed back to work in recent days. While those staffers are working without pay, military personnel who service the presidency, such as the pilots, flight attendants and other staff members on Air Force One, are expected to continue receiving paychecks. The Defense Department shifted funding from elsewhere in its budget to ensure members of the military are paid during the shutdown.

The White House also said Thursday that federal law enforcement officers, including those from Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, will be paid during the shutdown.

Trump, too, will continue getting his paycheck under federal law, though he has said he donates his salary.

At the same time, the White House has used the shutdown as cover to fire some federal workers. The Trump administration has already issued layoff notices to more than 4,000 government employees, though a federal judge blocked the move for now. The White House has said it plans to appeal.

If the firings are allowed to go forward, White House budget chief Russell Vought said, the total could “grow higher” and “probably end up being north of 10,000.”

Millions of tourists visit the U.S. Capitol every year, but tours are closed to the public because of the shutdown. Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance. Unlike in past shutdowns, cafeterias in the Capitol are open, trash is being picked up, grandfather clocks are still being wound, and some lawmakers have yet to furlough a single staff member.

Past shutdowns have led members of Congress to frantically work weekend legislative sessions and hold late-night working pizza dinners to try to end the impasses. But this time, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept his members out of Washington since the shutdown began, and senators have consistently taken three-day weekends.

Asked about the Senate’s weekend breaks, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he will continue to allow senators to go home at the end of the week until there’s actual movement in negotiations.

“If it looks like there’s productive reason for doing it, of course I’ll do it,” Thune said of keeping members in session over a weekend. “But if, you know, if it’s just no, no, no, no, no and we’re not making any headway, then I’m not sure what the point would be. But you know, I’m open to any suggestion that would help get the government back open.”

Once the government reopens, federal workers will receive back pay to cover the shutdown, whether they worked or not. But that wasn’t always the case. In 2019, Congress passed a law that guaranteed back pay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns. That guarantee seems to have led lawmakers and the executive branch to furlough fewer staff members this time, senators said.

“I think the vibe is a little bit different this time because of the back pay guarantee,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in an interview this week.

Some Republicans, who were around for the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, said they believe that then-President Barack Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., purposefully made the Capitol complex and federal agencies less hospitable during that funding crisis, hoping the pain would lead lawmakers to end that shutdown.

“I think it was intentionally,” said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who told NBC News he hasn’t furloughed anyone on his staff for this shutdown.

Obama, he said, was focused on shutting down “as many things you can, make it as hard on everybody as you can, and Harry Reid did the same thing here in the Senate.”

And while lawmakers continue to be paid during the shutdown, Justice, R-W.Va., Babydog’s owner, said he is donating his paycheck to his state’s National Guard.

“There are people out there depending on us, and right now, it’s a dog’s mess,” Justice said in an interview Wednesday. “A government shutdown is the most ridiculous thing on the planet, and really, truly, we need to be working together and get across the finish line.”

Babydog had no better answer than the humans in the Capitol have had about when the shutdown might end.

“Snort,” she replied when she was asked at her birthday party how Congress and the White House might reach a resolution to reopen the government.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251015-jim-justice-baby-dog-mn-1615-eae998.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 06:01:14.285172

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, particularly in science and technology fields.
The new requirement would add $100,000 per new H-1B petition, representing a roughly 30- to 50-fold increase.
At the firm level, winning an H-1B lottery led to increased hiring of both immigrant and U.S.-born employees.
Implications If upheld, the $100,000 fee could reshape how U.S. employers hire and compete globally.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Trump’s new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, calling it unlawful and economically harmful. The Chamber, which represents nearly 3 million businesses, said the policy would make it “cost-prohibitive” for employers to hire the skilled foreign workers they rely on to stay competitive.

Boundless CEO Xiao Wang said the lawsuit “properly highlights that a $100,000 fee would significantly reduce participation in the program, resulting in fewer employers being able to access the highly skilled workers they need to continue to innovate and create American jobs.” He added that the policy “further tilts the balance of competition to the largest companies in the world and away from earlier-stage innovators and regional organizations.”

The Legal Challenge

Filed in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit argues that Trump’s September executive order imposing the new fee exceeds presidential authority and disrupts a visa framework established by Congress.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, particularly in science and technology fields. Employers currently pay between $2,000 and $3,600 in government fees per application. The new requirement would add $100,000 per new H-1B petition, representing a roughly 30- to 50-fold increase.

The Chamber warned that many employers “are bracing for the need to scale back or entirely walk away from the H-1B program, to the detriment of their investors, customers, and their own existing employees.”

The White House defended the policy as lawful and “a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms.” A spokesperson said the measure discourages companies from “driving down American wages” and prioritizes domestic hiring.

The administration clarified that the new fee will apply only to new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025, beginning with the next visa lottery, and that existing visa holders are exempt.

A similar lawsuit was filed earlier this month in California by a coalition of healthcare organizations, unions, and faith-based employers, arguing that the fee unlawfully restricts access to skilled labor.

What the Research Shows

The Chamber’s lawsuit points to several studies showing how high-skilled immigration drives U.S. innovation and growth.

Between 1990 and 2010, foreign STEM workers accounted for roughly one-third to one-half of productivity growth in U.S. cities.

At the firm level, winning an H-1B lottery led to increased hiring of both immigrant and U.S.-born employees.

Research also shows that from 2000 to 2015, the growing share of foreign-born STEM professionals in the U.S. economy created an estimated $103 billion in benefits for American workers, largely through innovation-driven productivity gains. Another study found that over a 12-year period, firms with high H-1B participation grew in value about three times faster than comparable firms without such hires.

Implications

If upheld, the $100,000 fee could reshape how U.S. employers hire and compete globally.

For businesses, the fee represents an unprecedented cost increase that could push small and midsize companies out of the H-1B program entirely. Larger corporations may absorb the cost, but early-stage innovators could lose access to the international talent pipelines that fuel growth.

For immigrant professionals, the fee raises barriers to entry into the U.S. workforce at a time when global competition for skilled workers is intensifying. Advocates warn that it could shift innovation and job creation abroad, as companies turn to offshore or remote teams instead.

Ultimately, the lawsuit will test how far the White House can go in changing employment-based immigration policy without congressional approval.

IN THE NEWS

A federal appeals court ruled that the federal government is allowed to take command of Illinois National Guard troops but affirmed a ban on sending them on operational assignments. The dispute stems from “Operation Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement push by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that Illinois and Chicago argue exceeds federal authority. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested National Guard support after clashes near an ICE facility outside Chicago. The Trump Administration then approved the deployment of about 300 Illinois Guard members and 200 Texas Guard members for 60 days. While the temporary court order is in place, these troops cannot do law enforcement work.

World leaders met in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to discuss President Donald J. Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted. The plan includes provisions for a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip, and deployment of an “International Stabilisation Force.” The plan specifies a timeframe for restarting humanitarian aid, proposes a special economic zone, and outlines a strategy for short-term governance by a “Board of Peace,” headed by President Trump, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, other heads of state, and qualified Palestinian experts. The leaders of Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey joined President Trump and signed a broad memorandum outlining shared commitments for peace in the region.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that lets certain visa holders’ spouses work in the United States. The 2015 rule allows H-4 visa holders, the spouses of H-1B visa holders, to obtain work authorization if their spouse is pursuing permanent residency. Save Jobs USA, an organization representing U.S. technology workers, argued that the rule unlawfully gave work permits to non-citizens who should not be eligible under federal law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected that claim last year, citing to circuit precedent that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows DHS to authorize employment for certain nonimmigrants. By refusing to hear the appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court left the rule in place.

Most major news outlets—including the New York Times, Washington Post, and The Associated Press—reportedly say they will not sign the Pentagon’s new press-access policy ahead of a Tuesday deadline. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the policy—which requires visible badges and tighter rules such as a ban on encouraging illegal acts—saying reporting access is a “privilege.” The Pentagon Press Association reportedly said that the rules will discourage routine reporting by warning Defence Department staff not to talk to journalists without approval. So far, only One America News has reportedly signed the new policy agreement.

A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated a prior court order by reimposing immigration-related grant conditions on states. The court’s earlier order, issued in September, vacated those conditions, finding that they exceeded the agency’s statutory authority and coerced states into enforcing federal immigration policy. In the new ruling, Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island found that DHS violated that order by requiring states to assist in federal immigration enforcement to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency funding. He ordered DHS to remove all contested conditions and “Compliance with Federal Immigration Law” clauses from grant award documents and to reissue them within seven days.

A federal district court temporarily prohibited the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the request made by the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Government Employees, finding the unions would likely prove that OMB’s use of reduction-in-force procedures was illegal and beyond statutory authority. Prior to the court’s decision, OMB’s counsel stated that approximately 2,751 layoffs were anticipated across several agencies, with the most planned for the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The U.S. Department of Energy (Energy Department) approved a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to American Electric Power Transmission (AEP) to replace and upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of power lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, aiming to bolster grid reliability amid rising data center and artificial intelligence demand. The Energy Department said it was the first loan under the Energy Dominance Financing program and requires utilities to pass savings to customers. Supporters—including the Energy Department and AEP—reportedly claimed the financing would save customers money, add capacity, and create about 1,100 construction jobs. Critics pointed to the Energy Department’s recent cancellations of $7.6 billion in clean energy grants and a $4.9 billion loan for a wind and solar energy project as favoring fossil fuel upgrades.

A federal judge vacated the U.S. Department of Defense’s (Defense Department) cap on university research “indirect cost” rates. Judge Brian E. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled for the university plaintiffs and declared the Defense Department’s 15 percent “Rate Cap Policy” was contrary to regulation, exceeded statutory authority, and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The policy directed the Defense Department to limit what portion of research grants universities can apply toward recovering administrative and facility costs. The ruling requires the Defense Department to stop enforcing the cap and to redesign its policy in line with federal rules.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

In a recent report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the ongoing struggle of the U.S. Patient and Trademark Office (USPTO) to balance speed and rigor and found that USPTO examiners still feel pushed to hit production targets over doing deeper reviews. GAO notes the agency has made changes, such as revising performance plans, but has not assessed whether those changes improve quality. GAO also flags a gap in USPTO’s quality metrics: even though each legal requirement shows 92 to 98 percent compliance, only about 84 percent of patents meet all four requirements at the same time. To close these gaps, GAO urges USPTO to set an overall patent-quality goal and add measures that capture the economic or scientific value of patents.

In a Brookings Institution essay, Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, argued that recent court decisions have grown the courts’ tax-making authority. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo, the U.S. Supreme Court ended court deference to federal agencies’ legal interpretations, making Treasury and Internal Revenue Service regulations easier to challenge, while in Moore v. United States the Court left unresolved whether Congress may tax unrealized income, Patel observed. She also noted upcoming litigation over whether Presidents may invoke emergency powers to impose broad tariffs that function like taxes. Patel contended that these decisions place courts at the center of defining taxing authority and increase uncertainty for agencies, businesses, and households.

In an article in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown Law School, found that Loper Bright v. Raimondo, a landmark Supreme Court ruling on administrative law, may not apply to the Clean Air Act (CAA). Loper Bright ended Chevron deference, which is judicial deference to a federal agency’s statutory interpretation. Heinzerling argued that because the decision targeted a specific section of the Administrative Procedure Act, other statutes which do not rely on that section may not actually be bound by Loper Bright. Heinzerling claimed that because the CAA “kicks out the Administrative Procedure Act in favor of an alternative framework for judicial review,” and excludes the statutory language at issue in Loper Bright, Chevron deference may still apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for the CAA. Heinzerling concluded that in spite of lack of support through statutory language, courts have incorrectly applied Loper Bright to the CAA.

EDITOR’S CHOICE

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Paul C. Light, professor emeritus at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, summarized some of the lessons learned on the federal service during the 2019 government shutdown. Light argued that the shutdown humanized federal employees and contractors, demonstrated the benefits provided by federal agencies, explored the increased risks to the public during funding lapses, and exposed issues with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Light also argued there was a “silver lining” to the shutdown—it offered an opportunity to implement bipartisan and publicly-supported reforms to “strengthen ethics in government, discipline the presidential appointments process, reduce campaign spending, improve fiscal efficiency and accountability, and streamline the bureaucracy.”",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIR.jpeg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:56.272381

These voices are not partisan. They are principled. Having served on the bench with fidelity to law over politics, these jurists now step forward—not to advocate for any party or agenda but to illuminate the constitutional architecture that protects liberty and equality for all.

Their reflections are rooted in experience, not ideology. Their warnings are grounded in precedent.

At a time when threats to judicial independence are growing more frequent and more brazen, The Fulcrum offers this series as a civic resource and a moral compass. We believe that understanding how our courts function and why their integrity is essential to preserving the democratic experiment our founders envisioned is crucial.

Today, Judge John S. Martin Jr, who served as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 2003, answered several important questions for the Fulcrum.

Judge Martin’s distinguished legal career has spanned more than six decades. Before his judicial appointment, Judge Martin served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983, leading one of the nation’s most prominent prosecutorial offices. Earlier in his career, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief Appellate Attorney in the SDNY. He also served as an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General from 1967 to 1969. Judge Martin additionally held positions in private practice at several prominent firms, including Debevoise & Plimpton and Schulte Roth & Zabel, and was a founding partner of Martin & Obermaier.

Following his retirement from the bench, Judge Martin remained active in legal practice, serving as an arbitrator and consultant in matters involving commercial contracts, executive compensation, insurance coverage, and construction claims—routinely handling disputes valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Martin is a graduate of Manhattan College (B.A., 1957) and Columbia Law School (LL.B., 1961).

His words are a reminder that the judiciary is not a tool of power; it is a bulwark against its abuse.

Why did the framers enshrine an independent judiciary—and how does that safeguard our democracy today?

The genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that it created three separate coequal branches of the government, each with an independent responsibility. Congress was to pass laws; the president was the chief executive who would execute and enforce those laws, and the judiciary was to provide a forum for citizens and others to litigate disputes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Most important, it was for the courts to have the final say as to whether either Congress or the president had overstepped their bounds and engaged in conduct that was either contradictory to or unsupported by something in the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, an important function of the federal courts is to ensure that neither Congress nor the president exercise power not granted by the Constitution.

Why are retired judges speaking out now—what compels you to break tradition and raise your voice?

The current political atmosphere has given rise to both physical threats to judges and efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Those who adopted the Constitution recognized the importance of having judges who were truly independent and who would act free from any pressure to do anything other than that which the law required. For that reason, the Constitution provided that federal judges should serve for life and could only be removed by impeachment and also provided that their compensation could not be diminished.

Why is using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions a threat to constitutional balance?

The Constitution prohibits removing a federal judge from office except by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Thus, there is no grounds for an impeachment proceeding based solely on a judge's good-faith decision in a particular case.

Even though a judge cannot be impeached for a particular decision, the commencement of such a proceeding impinges upon the independence of the judiciary for two reasons. 1) it causes the judge to have to spend time and money defending a baseless proceeding, and 2) it inflames public reaction to such a decision and thereby creates a threat that someone will seek to injure the ""offending"" judge either physically or financially.

What do you wish more Americans understood about the role of judges in preserving liberty and equality?

Because of their independence, federal judges have the freedom to decide cases solely on the merits. That gives them the ability to protect the rights of each of us from any type of prohibited discrimination or from an unwarranted criminal or civil litigation.

What moment from your time on the bench best captures the weight—or wonder—of serving justice?

For me, the most difficult and most rewarding part of my work involved sentencing individuals for violation of criminal law. It was difficult because sentencing anyone to a substantial term in prison is an awesome responsibility. Federal law requires use of a sentencing guideline system, which in many cases can result in an unjust sentence if the guideline is literally applied. However, there are cases in which a judge can impose a sentence less than that set by the guidelines if the judge can articulate the existence of some factor that was not adequately considered by the commission that set up the guidelines. I think I did my best work as a judge in several cases where I dramatically reduced the sentences the guidelines established, using this exception. I think, for example, of the case in which I reduced the sentence of the mother of three young children from 3 1/2 years to seven months, and another in which I reduced the sentence of a low-level drug dealer from 19 to 12 years. Feeling that you are doing justice to those who may not have otherwise received it is one of the greatest satisfactions you can have as a judge.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

We start today's other headlines in Chicago.

A judge says federal immigration officers operating there will be required to wear body cameras. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said today she was a little startled by clashes like these between ICE agents and protesters from earlier this week. Tensions are running high. Federal officials say they have arrested more than 1,000 immigrants there since September, and the Trump administration is trying to send in the National Guard.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker warned President Trump that Illinois, in his words, is not a place you can conquer and lashed out against the federal forces on the ground.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL):

Masked federal agents from ICE and CBP are on the ground terrorizing our communities with tear gas and rubber bullets. And some are wearing camouflage uniforms that could easily be mistaken for the military.

Geoff Bennett:

In response to the judge's order, an attorney for the Justice Department blamed the anger over the unrest in Chicago on — quote — ""one-sided and selectively edited media reports."" He added that it's not possible to get body cameras for ICE agents right away.

President Trump says he will meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss ways to end the war in Ukraine, though he did not say when. Mr. Trump announced the plan on social media following a two-hour call between the two leaders that he described as very productive.

But, first, President Trump will host Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House tomorrow. Zelenskyy is pushing the president to sell Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which would enable Kyiv to strike deep into Russia. Meantime, Ukraine's energy operator announced nationwide power cuts today after Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike overnight.

On Capitol Hill today, the Senate failed to pass a measure to reopen the government for a 10th time. And in a separate vote, lawmakers also voted down an effort to fund the Defense Department for one year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor afterwards.

Sen. John Thune (R-SD):

This is politics. If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.

Geoff Bennett:

The 50-44 vote marked the first attempt to restart partial funding, even as the stalemate continues over reopening the government as a whole. The Senate stands adjourned until next Monday, ensuring that the shutdown will stretch into next week.

President Trump announced a deal today with drugmaker EMD Serono to cut the cost of a common fertility medication related to in vitro fertilization treatments, or IVF.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The initiatives I have just announced are the boldest and most significant actions ever taken by any president to bring the miracle of life into more American homes.

Geoff Bennett:

The president also announced guidance that would encourage employers to offer fertility coverage separate from their regular medical insurance, much like dental and vision plans. It's unclear whether employers will indeed choose to offer that coverage and whether the deal announced today will result in cheaper IVF treatments.

A number of states are showing progress in the nation's battle against obesity. That's according to an analysis of CDC data by the nonpartisan group Trust for America's Health. Last year, 19 states reported adult obesity rates of 35 percent or higher. That's down from 23 states the year before, and it's the first such decline in more than a decade.

But, nationwide, rates remain high, with roughly four in 10 American adults considered obese.

Nestle is slashing 16,000 jobs as part of its broader cost-cutting efforts. The maker of Nescafe, Kit Kats and other brands said today that the cuts will take place over the next two years as it battles rising costs and President Trump's tariffs.

Meantime, stocks struggled on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average lost around 300 points. The Nasdaq gave back just over 100 points. The S&P 500 also ended in negative territory.

And the final surviving member of the team that conquered Mount Everest has died. Kanchha Sherpa was part of the 1953 expedition that saw Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reach the top of the world's highest peak. Kanchha was born in 1933 in the foothills of Everest and started his mountaineering career when he was just 19.

He joined many Everest climbs over the years, but never reached the summit himself. In his later years, he warned against overcrowding on Everest and urged people to respect the famous mountain. Kanchha Sherpa was 92 years old.

And NPR's Susan Stamberg has died. As an original staff member, Stamberg, along with Linda Wertheimer, Nina Totenberg, and the late Cokie Roberts, was considered one of the founding mothers of NPR. From humble tasks like cutting tape, Stamberg rose quickly to become co-host of ""All Things Considered"" in 1972.

She was known for making connections with listeners, famously sharing her mother-in-law's recipe for cranberry sauce or cranberry relish, as she called it. Stamberg spoke with ""News Hour"" for NPR's 50th anniversary and told us about the opportunities and challenges of those early days.

Susan Stamberg, Journalist:

NPR was a start-up. So there weren't 1,000 people ahead of you in the job you were dying to get. That makes it tough for anybody, men or women, but particularly difficult for a woman.

Cameron Arnold of Dallas and Zachary Evetts of Waxahachie, Texas, were charged on Wednesday with providing support to terrorists for their alleged role in the nonfatal shooting of a police officer at an immigration detention facility. Both were arrested in July with eight others and charged with attempted murder and weapons offences.

None of the defendants has entered a plea in the case, court records show, but Arnold and Evetts are set to do so at an October 22 court hearing.

Arnold’s lawyer, Cody Cofer, said in an email he looks forward to defending his client at trial.

Evetts’s lawyer, Patrick McLain, said his client is innocent and accused prosecutors of adding the terrorism charges for political reasons.

“I have seen no evidence from the prosecutors to support any of the charges,” McLain told the news agency Reuters.

In a post on social media, Patel wrote: “First time ever: the FBI arrested Antifa-aligned anarchist violent extremists and terrorism charges have been brought for the July 4 Prairieland ICE attack in Texas,” Patel said on social media.

Arnold and Evetts were charged with supporting terrorists generally, not the legally distinct charge of supporting a terrorist organisation.

Trump and his Republican allies have accused antifa followers of fomenting political violence following the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and amid protests against federal immigration authorities in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon.

Trump signed an executive order in September calling antifa a “terrorist” organisation, although some national security law experts said the designation was legally questionable because antifa, short for “antifascist”, has no official leadership or organisational structure.

In an indictment filed in Texas federal court on Wednesday, prosecutors allege that Arnold and Evetts were part of an antifa “cell” that carried out a July 4 attack on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Alvarado, Texas.

There had been no mention of antifa in the original charging documents or accompanying announcement by prosecutors.

Prosecutors said the alleged attackers at the Prairieland Detention Facility shot fireworks and vandalised cars before an unnamed co-conspirator allegedly opened fire on officers defending the site, striking a local police officer in the neck.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25289644515043-1760661775.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:43.157573

At least three people were detained in Woodburn and Salem on Oct. 15, according to Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste — Oregon's farm workers union and a Latino organization. Another post from Latinos Unidos Siempre, a Salem nonprofit led by youth, said it confirmed ICE activity in northeast Salem on Oct. 16. One person was detained after ICE waited for them to leave their home around 5 a.m., according to LUS.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request from the Statesman Journal for details about the law enforcement activity or arrests.

Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition said on Facebook that the coalition is seeing an increase in ICE activity across the state.

On Oct. 16, Innovational Law Lab filed a lawsuit on behalf of PCUN and Clear Clinic against ICE, CBP and DHS, challenging what they said is the agencies' practice of denying people in custody access to legal counsel before their transfer out of Oregon.

ICE, CBP and DHS on Oct. 15 ""launched a wave of coordinated assaults on the people of Oregon with arrests that swept through the Willamette Valley. Individuals caught up in these arrests were detained and swiftly transferred out of state,"" the complaint said.

The complaint stated that lawyers trying to meet clients at the Portland and Eugene field offices were denied access, and that attorneys in Portland observed federal officers loading people into vans with Washington state plates before driving away.

CLEAR Clinic immigration attorneys have responded, or tried to respond, to the detentions of 20 people over the past four or five months, according to the complaint.

In a court declaration, PCUN President Reyna Lopez said two young men were detained outside their apartment complex on Oct. 15 in Woodburn and a senior was detained on the street the same day.

The agents did not have a warrant and were not specifically looking for them, Lopez said.

Lopez said part of PCUN's team also witnessed agents parked around the block from Washington Elementary school in Woodburn. Lopez said the presence alarmed school officials and community members, worried about parents or children being detained at pick up or drop off.

“Federal agents are targeting schools, workplaces, and homes and spreading fear across Oregon,"" said Innovation Law Lab legal director Jordan Cunnings.

""Oregonians do not support ICE’s unlawful tactics. The Trump administration and its agents must abide by the same rules as everyone else,"" Cunnings said.

Cunnings reiterated that federal agents are blocking attorneys from meeting with detained Oregonians. She said they are asking the courts to ensure that ICE follows the law.

“Masked agents are snatching people from our communities and denying Oregonians their fundamental rights. We are suing today because our members are getting arrested and swept up by masked ICE agents in unmarked vehicles. All of the people detained still have due process rights and should be allowed to exercise them,"" added Lopez.

Innovation Law Lab asked for a temporary restraining order to pause the transfer of anyone arrested without a valid judicial warrant on or after Oct. 15 out of the state for three business days.

Attorneys with Innovation Law Lab are still awaiting a decision from U.S District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut in their motion for a reversal of an Aug. 22 ruling around the detention of a Woodburn farmworker. The 25-year-old, identified only as LJPL in court records, has been detained since Aug. 7 when he and three other farmworkers were arrested on their way to work at a Canby blueberry farm.

""I am concerned about our community,"" said state Rep. Lesly Muñoz, D-Woodburn.

Muñoz said she had not personally witnessed ICE activity but had received credible reports about federal agents in the area.

""Now is the time for Oregon to live up to our collective values — to stand with immigrant and refugee Oregonians and reaffirm that every person in our state deserves safety, dignity, and fairness,"" Muñoz said.

The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.
The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.
A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery.","Video that appears to show federal immigration agents using their vehicle to ram the truck of an immigrant rights activist has sparked controversy and public outrage in the city of Oxnard, an agricultural town that has been the frequent target of immigration raids.

At the center of the controversy is a claim by federal agents that the activist was the aggressor, ramming into their vehicle.

The incident began shortly before 8 a.m. Thursday when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents notified the Oxnard Police Department that their vehicle had been rammed by a civilian’s vehicle near the intersection of 8th and A streets, according to Sgt. Martin Cook.

“We responded, and ICE agents detained an individual, and a crowd started to gather,” Cook said. “We were there to keep the peace and prevent any type of altercation with ICE or any other federal agency.”

Cook said that federal agencies took control of the investigation. He did not know if the person arrested by agents requested a police report and referred all questions to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees agencies including ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

VC Defensa, an immigrant rights group that has been documenting immigration raids in the region, said on Instagram that one of its volunteers, whom the group identified as Leo Martinez, had been arrested.

The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.

“ICE intentionally struck Leo’s truck and blocked his exit while Leo was exercising his right to observe ICE activity,” the group stated in one of its Instagram posts.

The video starts with a Jeep Cherokee with tinted windows tailing a dark gray truck before ramming the passenger door on the driver’s side. The driver of the truck then pulls into a dirt lot, where the group says Martinez was arrested.

“This shameful escalation by ICE is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate those of conscience who are standing up against Trump’s assault on immigrants,” the group said on Instagram. “We will not be deterred, and we will continue to keep our communities safe.”

The incident is the latest controversy involving federal immigration agents that has not only sparked outrage among activists and residents but also raised questions about some of the claims agents made previously.

Two months ago, federal immigration officers stopped Francisco Longoria in San Bernardino. During the encounter, Longoria, who was in his truck with his 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law, said he feared for their safety and drove off after masked officers shattered his car window and an officer fired several rounds at the truck.

Homeland Security officials have said officers were injured during the encounter when Longoria tried to “run them down,” prompting one officer to “discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

Attorneys for Longoria dispute that their client injured the officers or attempted to hit them and have called for an investigation of the shooting.

In June, Arturo Hermosillo was accused of ramming his van against a federal agent’s vehicle when he was instructed by the agents to move his van back to make room for an ambulance for a woman who had been injured during an immigration sweep.

Hermosillo was reversing when he said a federal agent standing near the vehicle pushed in his side view mirror, blocking his view; Hermosillo subsequently bumped into a vehicle behind him. Shortly after, agents pulled him out of the van.

Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told The Times in an email at the time that a person “rammed his vehicle into a law enforcement vehicle” during the June 19 operation

“CBP Agents were also assaulted during the operation and verbally harassed,” she said.

Videos that day did not capture any assaults; they showed residents yelling at agents.

The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.

A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery. A pastor who was protesting at a detention center was shot in the head with a pepper ball. Troubled by the clashes between agents and the public, one federal judge is considering ordering agents to wear body cameras.

Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from The Times. In a statement to CNN, however, the department said claims that the agency is using “harsher approaches” are “smearing” federal agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

In downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, just outside the Metropolitan Detention Center where people had gathered with signs that say “Free Leo Now!” and “ICE out of L.A.,” members of the crowd listened to Martinez as he thanked them for their support and their work.

“I knew I didn’t do anything f— wrong; that’s why they released me with pending charges,” he told the crowd. “That’s what they do with pretty much a lot of our volunteers cause we didn’t do s— wrong.

“They smashed into me,” he continued as people clapped. “And then they tried to accuse me of assaulting them, what kind of bulls— is that?”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/63062ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5173x2716+0+367/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F06%2F7d0628464c1c8c74d4d6d0eade85%2F1510124-me-dhs-press-conference-lj-5156.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:01:26.079228

Federal agents detained several people at a Swap-O-Rama flea market located near 41st Street and South Ashland Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood.

""If anyone was running, that's who they grabbed,"" Swap-O-Rama vendor Noe Ochoa said. """"I saw one lady just look half-fainted, I guess. Just shocked, like, 'Why me?'""

Alderwoman Julia Ramirez of the 12th Ward says several vendors were among those detained.

The Thursday morning operation happened not far from a clash between federal agents and demonstrators near a BP gas station at West 47th Street and South Western Avenue.

Video showed multiple immigration officers wrestling a man to ground. One person appeared to be detained. The crowd then grew as federal vehicles drove off.

""A couple U.S. citizens were detained on that corner,"" Ald. Ramirez said. ""I'm still gathering more information on that, but we're seeing an escalation of force.""

Some of those same demonstrators later returned to the Back of the Yards flea market in protest.

""Terrorizing our people! We want our communities to be safe,"" anti-ICE demonstrator Elizabeth Aramas said.

Uncertainty loomed over the families who depend on the flea market for survival.

""This just scares people away,"" Ochoa said. ""We're not making any business.""

ABC7 Chicago reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Border Patrol for comment but have not heard back.

Alderwoman Ramirez says about 15 people were detained at the Swap-O-Rama.

He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban. ""
However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.
Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing.","As the weeks tick by, Ihsanullah Garay’s health is deteriorating inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention cell.

The 38-year-old asylum seeker and Afghan national has been battling stage II brain cancer, according to his cousin and lawyer, and was detained last month in eastern Massachusetts by federal agents after a chance encounter revealed he had an expired student visa.

Garay fell ill a couple years ago, following his doctoral studies in New York, and last winter, he moved to Lowell to be closer to his only local family member and his radiation therapy appointments at Boston Medical Center.

But to afford his medical bills and ensure he could attend doctors’ appointments, Garay needed flexible work. He started delivering food for apps like Grubhub and DoorDash.

His lawyer, Hans Bremer, told WBUR that Garay got lost while out on a delivery in Methuen on Sept. 14 and stopped to ask someone he thought was a police officer for directions. Bremer said the man turned out to be an ICE agent.

Garay, whose student visa expired in 2021 according to ICE, was arrested immediately. But, according to Bremer, Garay has legal permission to work in the U.S. through 2029, up-to-date paperwork and no criminal record. He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban.

"" He has an exceptionally strong asylum claim,” Bremer said. “He's doing everything correctly that we have always required for somebody who wants to seek asylum.”

Bremer said he “had every belief” Garay would be released from ICE custody at a bond hearing scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 16, in Chelmsford immigration court. However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.

It “baffles” Bremer that Garay was detained at all, but he said that what’s more striking is that the federal government has kept someone so sick in detention.

Robin Nice, former chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England, said Garay’s case reflects how the Trump administration’s immigration agenda has reshaped detention policies.

In recent months, the federal government has adopted new rules that allow agents to repeatedly relocate detainees and make it harder to get out on bond.

“ Where's the accountability?” Nice said. “Who's to say they can't transfer someone to like five different detention centers and effectively make [posting bond] impossible?”

She argued the government also can simply move detainees into jurisdictions with stricter bond standards.

""It's the government's burden [in Massachusetts] to show that someone is a flight risk or a danger to the community, but in other jurisdictions, that's not the case,” she said.

Boston ICE spokesperson James Covington said Garay will remain detained until his hearing’s outcome but did not answer questions about his medical treatment or transfer. Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing. As of Thursday afternoon, it was not clear when his next hearing would take place.

When Garay entered ICE custody, he was well enough to stand. But he now uses a wheelchair, according to his lawyer.

“ He is not a flight risk. He's not a danger,” Bremer said.“There's no reason for him to be held.”

Outside the immigration system, Garay’s cousin, Abdul Ahad Storay Niazi, has been left trying to keep track of Garay’s detainment and worrying about how he is being treated.

Storay said his cousin had major brain surgery in 2022 and often suffers from seizures.

A medical document sent to immigration officials and shared with WBUR shows Garay’s doctors say he must return in the coming months to Boston Medical Center for blood tests and scans to treat and monitor his cancer.

Storay said he hasn’t heard from Garay since Saturday, a few days before he was moved down South.

“He said, ‘I have a seizure attack every day, almost every day,’ ” Storay recalled, “ ‘so please help me.’ ”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/garay_afghan_detainee-crop-1000x742.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:52.444505

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters.

A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017.
On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.","The United States is “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to a sobering new intelligence-style assessment by former US intelligence and national security officials, who warn that democratic backsliding is accelerating under the Trump administration – and may soon become entrenched without organized resistance.

The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, was released on Thursday by the Steady State, a network of more than 340 former officers of the CIA, the NSA, the state department and other national security agencies.

To conduct the assessment, the authors applied the same analytic methods used by US intelligence agencies to assess the fragility of democracies abroad but turned them inward for what the group called a “first-of-its-kind” analysis of domestic democratic decline.

“We wrote it because the same tools we once used to assess foreign risks now show unmistakable warning signs at home,” the group said in a statement upon its release.

The authors conclude with “moderate to high confidence” that the US is moving toward what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections and courts continue to function, but are “systematically manipulated” to consolidate executive power and weaken checks and balances. According to the assessment, these trends are increasingly visible in the US, as part of a broader effort by Donald Trump in his second presidential term to “ensure loyalty and ideological conformity” across the federal government.

“The speed with which we have devolved away from a fully functioning democracy is startling to me,” Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst and a member of the Steady State, said on a call with reporters after the assessment was published on Thursday. “In most cases, it takes longer than nine months to get where we are.”

Since returning to the White House, the president has pardoned January 6 rioters who assaulted police, fired independent watchdogs, purged career officials viewed as disloyal, publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute political opponents, deployed troops to US cities, attacked judges who ruled against him, threatened universities and restricted press freedom – all while testing the boundaries of executive power in ways federal courts have repeatedly deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional.

Just last week, Trump’s justice department indicted Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued him for fraud, and separately charged the former FBI director James Comey, a longtime political adversary. He has also called for jailing the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, both Democrats who opposed his deployment of federal troops there.

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters. “We would finish a draft and then five things would happen,” he said, adding that the document was published as a “baseline” that could be updated with new developments.

While the report mirrors the “finished intelligence” model used by the US intelligence community, the assessment was prepared by former analysts who no longer work in government and relied entirely on open-source material such as news reports, public statements and independent watchdog analyses, as opposed to classified intelligence. Its authors also emphasize that they were not driven by politics, but by what they saw as a need for a “cold, analytic look” at how the indicators of democratic backsliding applied to the US.

“These are people who have seen these indicators develop in countries that shifted dramatically away from democracy towards authoritarianism,” Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior intelligence official who spent two decades at the NSA, told reporters on Thursday. “And we’re seeing those things happening in our country today.”

Among the key indicators of democratic decline identified in the report: the expansion of executive power through unilateral decrees and emergency authorities; the politicization of the civil service and federal law enforcement; attempts to erode judicial independence through strategic appointments and “noncompliance” with court rulings or investigations; a weakened and increasingly ineffective Congress; partisan manipulation of electoral systems and administration; and the deliberate undermining of civil society, the press and public trust.

“We judge that the primary driver of the US’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of executive branch overreach,” the assessment states. It also cites a “worrying” shift in public opinion among Americans, pointing to surveys that show a growing share who think “having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections” is a “very good or fairly good system”.

Political scientists and human rights activists have increasingly drawn comparisons between the US and countries like Hungary or Turkey, where elected leaders retained power by weakening institutional checks while preserving a democratic facade. Helt also drew a comparison to Italy under Benito Mussolini “because of the relationship between organized religion and the state”.

The Steady State assessment is echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses. A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017. On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.

“Absent organized resistance by institutions, civil society and the public, the United States is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad,” the assessment concludes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fee4f7a0e64df0d8620012c6bef4e69072ab45/512_0_3544_2835/master/3544.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=802095bd6b6320948eb94a2b41b53936",N,,2025-10-16 21:56:36.540016

The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11.
NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Crain’s on whether it will comply with the judge’s ruling.","A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Department of Homeland Security to send the MTA $33.9 million in counterterrorism funds that the Trump administration tried to claw back.

Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York said in his ruling that DHS had overstepped its authority late last month when it attempted to revoke Transit Security Grant Program funds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on the grounds that New York has not aided the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up immigrant deportations.

“Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds,” wrote Kaplan in his 28-page decision. “To the contrary, Congress prohibited DHS from imposing such terms by requiring the selection of grant recipients to be ‘based solely on risk.’”

New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked Kaplan to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, to reinstate the grant dollars. In court papers, the Acting Deputy Administrator for Resilience at the FEMA, David Arnold, argued that the MTA had the grants pulled “because the applicant is based in New York City, a designated Sanctuary Jurisdiction city.”

But Kaplan flatly rejected that argument as “making very little sense” because the MTA’s board is appointed by the governor. “The MTA is not an instrumentality of New York City,” he wrote.

The judge’s ruling also notes that FEMA has not withheld funding from other TSGP applicants that are located in sanctuary cities, including New Jersey Transit in Newark and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority in Philadelphia. During a Thursday news conference on the ruling Gov. Kathy Hochul said the federal government's attempt to revoke the funds is purely political.

""These are punitive measures to stick it to Democratic states,"" said Hochul. ""It's a damn shame that our efforts have to be spent on playing defense instead of offense to protect our people.""

Federal officials created the TSGP in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in Lower Manhattan and have traditionally awarded it based on the risk of terrorism agencies face.

The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11. This year, $13 million of the $33.9 million the MTA expected to receive would pay for New York Police Department units to detect explosive and chemical weapons, active shooter training and counterterrorism patrols in the subway, among other things. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.

They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.
First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.
“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases.
Labour has proposed replacing the current tribunals with a new system of “professional adjudicators” to limit the number of appeals and speed up decisions.","Sir Keir Starmer is facing a legal challenge by the House of Lords to end the secrecy over judges’ rulings on migrant deportation appeals.

Senior peers have tabled a proposed new law that would require first-tier immigration tribunals to publish their judgments on whether foreign criminals and rejected asylum seekers should be allowed to remain in Britain.

They say the public scrutiny of the decisions would “hold judges to account” and ensure they were “doing their job properly” after controversies over rulings where courts have prioritised the human rights of migrants including foreign criminals over public safety.

The Telegraph has revealed multiple cases, including a first-tier tribunal that backed an Albanian criminal’s right to stay in the UK partly because of his 10-year-old son’s distaste for eating foreign chicken nuggets. This became public only because it was overturned by an upper tribunal, which published its verdict.

‘No coherent basis for not publishing decisions’

The move comes as Labour, Reform and the Conservatives have pledged to overhaul the asylum appeals system and either quit or reform the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has been repeatedly cited by migrants in their appeals against removal from the UK.

The amendments to change the law have been put forward by Lord Murray, a former home office minister, and are backed by the Tory party as well as the Liberal Democrats. They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.

Supporters of the plan believe it could be backed by the House of Lords when it is put to a vote at the end of this month, despite opposition from the Government, which is seeking to maintain the status quo.

“There is absolutely no coherent basis for not publishing these decisions, and this is made all the worse because there is very significant public interest in this decision-making,” said Lord Murray.

Other similar courts dealing with tax, property, land and employment cases all routinely publish their decisions even though most deal with fewer cases. First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.

“Not only would it be open to a journalist or researcher to analyse the methods by which decisions are taken by the judges of the first-tier tribunal; they could analyse it by reference to the individual judge,” he said.

“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases. It does not favour one side of the argument or the other; it is simply fair and appropriate that these judgments be published.”

Other backers include Lord Faulks, a former justice minister and chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, and Lord Sandhurst, a Tory whip and former chair of the General Council of the Bar, and Lord Alton, the veteran Liberal Democrat peer.

Lord Sandhurst said: “The Human Rights Act has become a tool which forces our courts not simply to interpret UK law through the changing lens of the so-called living instrument of Strasbourg, but to change the meaning of some laws entirely.

“It is a matter of very real concern. This sort of lawfare puts our national security and sovereignty at risk. As long as these courts and tribunals exist, transparency in respect of their judgments is absolutely necessary.”

Responding to the calls for transparency for Labour, Lord Katz said the judiciary was responsible for deciding whether to publish individual judgments and the Government did not consider it necessary to legislate to change the current situation.

He said members of the public and media could still apply to the first-tier tribunal for a decision, which would be decided by the president of the immigration and asylum chamber. However, Lord Sandhurst noted that the public would be unable to make such a request if they did not know the name of the case.

(KABC) -- A spontaneous protest against immigration agents broke out after an incident in Oxnard on Thursday morning. A U.S. citizen was reportedly taken into custody by federal officials but has since been released.

Video shot by a member of the watchdog group VC Defensa shows an SUV believed to be driven by a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration agent ramming into the back of a pickup truck.

It happened in Oxnard around 8 a.m. VC Defensa heard that immigration agents were in the Oxnard area and went out to monitor their activity.

Oxnard police said they received a call that a pickup truck had collided with a vehicle with ICE agents inside.

Police stopped the pickup at the intersection of 8th Street and South A Street. They said DHS agents and members of the public then arrived, and the scene became ""boisterous.""

A crowd of approximately 80 people quickly gathered to protest at the scene.

Oxnard police then sent in officers for crowd control at the protest and to ""keep the peace.""

The department confirmed that DHS took someone into custody. The crowd eventually dispersed.

""The Oxnard Police Department had absolutely no involvement in what preceded our arrival on scene. The federal authorities asserted that the traffic collision was intentional, and because of that, it is under their jurisdiction. This means that this is a federal investigation, and not that of the Oxnard Police Department,"" the department wrote in a post on Facebook.

The organization VC Defensa identified the man taken into custody as volunteer Leo Martinez. They said he was taken to Los Robles Medical Center to be checked out.

The organization claims ICE agents intentionally struck Martinez's truck and blocked his exit as Martinez observed ICE activity.

""Leo, who is a U.S. citizen, is currently detained at the Metro Detention Center in Los Angeles. Leo was exercising his right to document the crimes ICE is inflicting on our communities, as he and many of our volunteers have done for years. This shameful escalation by ICE is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate those of conscience who are standing up against Trump's assault on immigrants. We will not be deterred, and we will continue to keep all of our communities safe,"" VC Defensa wrote in a statement.

""One of the members was observing ICE activity, which is what they do. They're a completely non-violent group. He was rammed by ICE, hit the passenger side of the car, injured and taken to Los Robles hospital,"" said nurse Christine Farrell, who works with VC Defensa.

Trump signed the proclamation last month with the intention of having companies hire American workers instead of migrant labor.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a new $1,000 immigration fee Thursday for migrants paroled in the United States.

The goal of the fee is to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” according to a statement from the department’s public affairs office. The fee would also improve oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

“Through the implementation of this new fee, President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are guaranteeing that foreign nationals, who wish to stay here, have skin in the game and do not exploit the system,” McLaughlin continued. “This immigration parole fee notice is another tool to stop the degradation of our immigration system and restore law and order to our country.”

Fees will be collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Fees are triggered once the grant is approved, not once a parole request is filed, the statement read.

The change comes as Trump has sent the National Guard to parts of the country to handle crime in some cities or help protect ICE officers while they conduct their own operations.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to approve an emergency declaration in response to the Trump administration’s immigration raids.

“We have residents afraid to leave their homes, we have constituents contacting my office because their family members never came home and they don’t know if they’ve been taken by ICE or where they’ve been taken,” County Supervisor Janice Hahn said, according to The Associated Press.

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration for trying to raise the fee for H-1B visa applications to $100,000. The chamber called the proclamation to raise the price “not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful,” according to the lawsuit. Trump signed the proclamation last month with the intention of having companies hire American workers instead of migrant labor.

The lawsuit also stated that Trump’s proclamation could not contradict Congress.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/homeland_security_DHS_02252015_AP_AP22200533951931.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 20:02:10.534406

The suit contends that the government is using AI and other methods to watch the social media posts of virtually every single non-citizen who is in the United States legally and on a valid visa, as well as many people who have obtained permanent resident status. The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.

The lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support, including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or that criticize the Trump administration or its actions.

The EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.

The lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.

While the chamber concedes that U.S. presidents have significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the country, Mr. Trump's Sept. 19 proclamation regarding H-1B visas exceeds his authority and ""blatantly contravenes the fees Congress has set"" for the program, the group said.

According to the lawsuit, ""The Proclamation is not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful.""

White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the administration's actions are ""lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step toward necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The Allies of Knoxville’s Immigrant Neighbors (AKIN) is calling for the release of one of their members who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Alejandro Guizar Lozano was detained by ICE in Putnam County Jail on Wednesday while reporting for a routine appointment near Nashville. AKIN said that Lozano is an “undocumented immigrant” from Mexico. It said he was “following the process and complying with all obligations.”

6 News reached out to ICE who said that Lozano was convicted of driving under the influence and possession of methamphetamine. It said his first arrest was in Knox County in 2011, but he was not convicted of a crime until later, according to criminal records.

6 News obtained a background check through the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which said he was charged with meth possession in January 2024 and convicted in February 2025. The TBI also said he was convicted of driving under the influence in 2022. He was on probation until last week, ICE said.

“He is being held pending proceedings and recalendaring of a notice to appear,” ICE said.

“I have known Alejandro since he was 18,” said De Ann Pendry, a founding member of AKIN. “He came to the U.S. when he was about 12, and did all of his middle and high school here in Knoxville. As a young person, he helped organize young immigrants. Alejandro is such a positive person – always willing to help out – and very focused on social justice. He has a big heart.”

AKIN added that Lozano has medical needs requiring care that they were concerned he would not receive in custody. Around noon, State Representative Gloria Johnson said he had received his medicine.

“Alejandro is not a ‘violent criminal,'” Johnson said. “He is a young man who works to help people in our community access the services they need.”

They filed suit with the backing of a former lawmaker who helped pass the law directing the state’s use of the facility.

The 24-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Red Willow County District Court, argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system, are named in the case.

“Nebraska state law is clear: The governor does not have the unilateral authority to change the purpose of any public building,” said Robert McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the case. “That’s the Legislature’s job.”

Nebraska Appleseed is a nonprofit organization advocating for people in need, including immigrants.

The district court judge assigned to the case dismissed an immediate request for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.

‘Supreme executive power’

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said Thursday that the governor “greatly appreciates” that “prompt and well-reasoned” decision.

“We expect and believe that the lawsuit is legally and substantively without merit, and we are confident that it will receive the scrutiny it deserves in our court system,” Strimple said. “Beyond that, this office has no further comment at this time on this pending legal matter.”

Pillen and state and federal officials announced plans on Aug. 19 to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp from a state prison offering rehabilitative programming for low-risk felony offenders to a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have sought to rebrand the facility as the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Pillen, at that time, said the facility would remain state-owned and operated and be operational by mid-October. Earlier this week, he said it would instead be operational by November.

“There’s some little details, but everything’s been moving in great progress,” Pillen said Tuesday, according to reporting by KETV. “We’re really excited about it.”

Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

Spokespeople for the Nebraska Governor’s Office, Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate comment on the lawsuit Thursday.

Following the money

The lead plaintiff, DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.

The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and since then, the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.

As of last year, the facility had a state budget of at least $9.5 million and about 85 staff, according to September 2024 state budget documents.

Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Corrections Department has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.

The Corrections Department contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month, with at least $187,500 already spent, according to the lawsuit.

To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”

Lawyers on behalf of Schimek and the McCook residents sent a demand letter Tuesday to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, asking that the “unlawful” actions stop. The plaintiffs had threatened to sue by Wednesday if those demands were ignored or rejected.

“Without an injunction, the plaintiffs will suffer substantial, irreparable harm, which is a hardship that outweighs any hardship the defendants may face,” the lawsuit states.

While many public records requests seeking information about the state-federal plan have been denied, documents released to a government watchdog group indicated that negotiations between Nebraska and federal officials started in March or sooner, while the Legislature was still in session.

McCook residents speak out

In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.

“I am concerned about the community that I live in becoming a more toxic environment as a result of the WEC being repurposed to become an immigration detention center,” Catherine McDowell of McCook said in her affidavit.

Dale Dueland, a 49-year resident of Red Willow County, said he is an active volunteer for community and civic organizations in McCook. He said his focus has been on building McCook into a “thriving rural community.” He wrote that he worried about “irreversible damage to the economic development and community growth that I have spent my whole life working to build.”

“Specifically, I am concerned that the repurposing of the WEC to be an immigration detention center will negatively impact local businesses, home values and create reputational harm to the organizations that I have served,” Dueland continued.

Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”

Many inmates work in the community, and multiple residents said they appreciate those connections. Will Branham, a member of the McCook Arts Council, said inmates have contributed to the growth of McCook’s arts scene. Matt Sehnert said he’s spoken with men at Work Ethic Camp about career prospects and that they appreciate being seen as “valuable human beings.”

“It was clear to me that the men took great pride in working to improve our community,” Sehnert said in his affidavit.

State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, also submitted an affidavit as part of the lawsuit regarding information he had gathered from the executive branch.

The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the state-federal plan and prevent officials from pursuing a similar plan or contract without proper legislative authority.

Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.","The Trump administration is poised to mount a two-pronged attack on refugee resettlement. The first prong is quantitative: refugee admissions would be slashed from 125,000 in the fiscal year that just ended to 7,500. The second is qualitative: selecting who among the world’s 42.7 million refugees would be chosen for rescue.

The US refugee resettlement program historically rescued persecuted people from all racial and religious backgrounds, but according to documents obtained by the New York Times, the administration may now prioritize resettlement for “refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate.” What does that mean? Well, the only groups specifically identified are white, Afrikaner South Africans, who have already been prioritized for admission, and now, specifically, Europeans supposedly persecuted because of their “opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.”

In other words, the Trump administration will prioritize the immigration of people who oppose the immigration of other people. And the racial implications of these policy shifts are easily inferred.

Refugees are defined not only as people with well-founded fears of being persecuted, but also as people who have fled their countries. But have they? US officials looking for 7,500 refugees to resettle will be hard pressed to find teeming camps in Namibia overflowing with white South Africans or right-wing xenophobes from Germany huddled for safety in Swiss camps. That’s because there aren’t any.

Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan. What has stopped many countries of first arrival from forcibly returning refugees to danger has been third-country resettlement programs that relieve some of the pressure on local host states and remind them that the world is watching.

A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Washington Post recently reported on Mursal, a 28-year-old Afghan woman who had a protection letter and resettlement offer from the US government. She is one among the many Afghans who the Pakistani authorities have forced back into Afghanistan since President Trump suspended resettlement. Now in hiding, she told the Post: “Everyone knows we worked with the U.S. … We fear what will happen if someone informs the Taliban’s intelligence unit.”

It’s bad enough that the refugee lifeline has been cut, but the insertion of nonrefugees into the few remaining refugee admission places adds deep insult to even deeper injury.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510usp_us_south_africa.jpg?h=a4573c9b&itok=wUPNMy0L,N,,2025-10-16 19:04:24.414009

The payments mark the latest in a string of unorthodox budget maneuvers by President Trump, who has stretched the limits of his power to advance his agenda and blunt the impact of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its third week.

Typically, many government workers are furloughed when federal funding lapses, while others in vital roles, including law enforcement, must report for duty without pay. Only after Congress strikes a deal do these employees receive their lost wages.

But Mr. Trump has looked to rearrange the budget to issue paychecks only for certain federal personnel, a set of maneuvers totaling billions of dollars that Congress has not authorized.

Employees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement received an email this week saying that “law enforcement officers are to be paid through the One Big Beautiful Bill (OB3) appropriation for the duration of the furlough period,” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.

The bill mentioned in the message is Mr. Trump’s signature tax law, which Republicans approved this year. Along with its large tax cuts, the package allocated vast new sums to pay for the president’s mass deportations, including $31 billion for ICE to hire new agents, train them and increase enforcement.

The message, sent by agency leaders, applied to “excepted” employees, who are required to work without pay during a government shutdown.

An official at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the plans to pay more ICE employees, and congressional aides said they believed that the payments would include a wide range of ICE workers, including investigators and deportation officers.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the payments, or how long they might last in a shutdown with no end in sight.

Broadly, the White House has also looked to provide pay for federal law enforcement during the shutdown, potentially including agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The president similarly ordered the Pentagon to rearrange its budget to pay wages to active-duty troops, and dipped into other funds for the military members of the U.S. Coast Guard.

“I live in Chicago if folks haven’t noticed,” she said on Thursday.
Agents later threw tear gas toward the crowd of protesters that had amassed.
Meanwhile, some local schoolchildren ended up obliged to stay indoors for recess after tear gas filled the streets near their playground.
“They don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety,” John Sandweg, a former acting Ice director, told Politico.","Federal immigration officers in the Chicago area have been ordered by a court to wear body cameras after they repeatedly deployed pepper balls, smoke grenades and tear gas against protesters and local police, seemingly in violation of a federal judge’s ruling from last week.

Sara Ellis, a US district judge, who had previously required immigration agents to wear badges and banned them from using riot-control techniques such as tear gas without warning, railed on Thursday against the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) continued aggressive tactics, many of which have been caught on camera, and which appear to violate her order.

“I live in Chicago if folks haven’t noticed,” she said on Thursday. “And I’m not blind, right?”

Ellis added: “I’m getting images and seeing images on the news, in the paper, reading reports where I’m having concerns about my order being followed.”

Her new requirement of immigration officers using body cameras comes as Chicago has become the latest focal point of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in recent weeks, with forceful federal enforcement, led by Ice but also including other agencies, and as DHS has been relying on extreme strategies against immigrants and citizens alike, in the Chicago area and elsewhere.

At the same time, locals in Chicago have been organizing to prevent arrests within their communities, while DHS has compared those efforts to “rioting” and said it “is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers”.

On Tuesday, after federal agents led a car chase and caused a multi-car collision, protesters chanted “Ice go home” and threw objects at the agents, who, seemingly without warning, threw tear gas in the direction of the protesters – and 13 Chicago police officers who were also on the scene.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, a masked agent cursed at protesters, ordering them to back away while pinning a 19-year-old, Warren King, to the sidewalk, while a witness shouted “he’s a citizen,” and it was unclear why King was under arrest, the New York Times reported.

On Sunday, when attorney Samay Gheewala tried to ask agents for a warrant as they detained an immigrant in his neighborhood, he was shoved to the ground so hard his hands bled. Agents later threw tear gas toward the crowd of protesters that had amassed.

Meanwhile, some local schoolchildren ended up obliged to stay indoors for recess after tear gas filled the streets near their playground.

Similar anecdotes have emerged across the country, even as former immigration officials warn that arrests appear to be indiscriminate and sweeping under the pressure that the Trump administration has imposed on officers to deport as many people as possible.

“They don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety,” John Sandweg, a former acting Ice director, told Politico. “They just say, ‘If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.’”

The Trump administration plans to withhold $40 million from California over its refusal to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday.

The move came weeks after an investigation found that an illegal immigrant truck driver, Harjinder Singh, killed three people after making an illegal U-turn on a Florida road in August. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.

Duffy cited failures by California to enforce English proficiency rules following one of President Donald Trump’s executive orders.

""California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America’s roads,"" Duffy said.

""The Golden State thinks it’s OK to ignore @USDOT English language requirements for truckers. You can play all the games you want, but not at the expense of American lives,"" Duffy wrote on X.

Duffy said the truck driver in the Florida crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status.

Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told Fox News Digital that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.

""It seems the Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson about the laws of his own roads,"" Crofts-Pelayo said. ""The reality is simple: Commercial driver's license holders in California had a fatal accident rate nearly 40% LOWER than the national average. Texas, the only state with more commercial driver's license holders, has a rate nearly 50% higher than California's.""

""The facts don't lie, although for the Trump Administration, they seem optional,"" she added.

Singh, an Indian citizen, is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

Investigators said he failed an English proficiency test but was still issued a license to drive trucks. Duffy and Florida officials have blamed California as well as Washington state for issuing him a commercial driver’s license.

However, California officials said Singh had a valid work permit at the time. Authorities said he entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 2018.

October 16, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced he secured a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented demand that states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Despite the Trump Administration’s claim to the contrary, this demand is likely for the purposes of immigration enforcement. Today’s preliminary injunction comes in the lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and a coalition of 22 states filed against the Trump Administration on July 29, alleging that USDA’s demand violates multiple federal laws and the U.S. Constitution and calling the scheme an “Orwellian surveillance campaign.”

“I’m gratified the court continues to find that this outrageous and unprecedented demand for the private and sensitive information of tens of millions of Americans should not be allowed to go ahead,” Attorney General Ellison said. “I’m proud to fight for hungry Americans who just want to feed their families and fight against Donald Trump’s inhumane, mass-surveillance agenda.”

SNAP is a federally funded, state-administered program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families across the country. SNAP applicants provide their private information on the understanding, backed by long-standing state and federal laws, that their information will not be used for unrelated purposes. In an attempt to bully states into compliance, USDA has repeatedly threatened to withhold administrative funding for the program if states fail to comply with its unprecedented demand for data — effectively forcing states to choose between protecting their residents’ privacy and providing critical nutrition assistance to those in need. Minnesota receives roughly $1.4 billion a year to administer the program to over 400,000 hungry Minnesotans.

In May 2025, USDA made an unprecedented demand that states turn over massive amounts of personal information on all SNAP applicants and recipients, including social security numbers and home addresses, dating back five years. Even a year’s worth of SNAP recipient data contains sensitive, personal identifying information on tens of millions of individuals — including over 400,000 in Minnesota. The federal government’s stated justifications for its unprecedented data demands, to “prevent fraud and abuse,” are directly contradicted by their own findings. Attorney General Ellison and the coalition sued to block the demand and keep the funds flowing to low-income and hungry Minnesotans.

On September 18, Attorney General Ellison and the coalition won a temporary restraining order that temporarily blocked USDA from withholding the funding. The preliminary injunction that they won, which comes after a court hearing last week, now blocks the Trump administration from withholding the funding for the duration of the coalition’s litigation.

Attorneys General Ellison is joined in this lawsuit by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as the state of Kentucky.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:02:33.992178

It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.
H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years.
The program is capped at 65,000 visas per year, with an additional carve out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees.
Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration imposing a $100,000 fee to the H-1B worker visas.

Last month President Donald Trump announced plans that would see U.S. companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas -- which allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations in various fields, including technology and engineering -- in an attempt to rework the program.

In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it ""overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.""

""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.

A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.

Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.

It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.

H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years.

Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.

The administration has also proposed further changes to the H-1B program's lottery selection system.

The changes have come in the months following Trump entering office and amid a push to limit immigration and see American companies hire more domestically.

""President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth.

The House remained on an extended break from Capitol Hill, where neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed motivated to talk to each other despite mounting repercussions from the funding lapse.

Federal courts, for example, reported just as the shutdown began Oct. 1, they could use “fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday, Oct. 17.

“If the shutdown continues after Judiciary funds are exhausted, the courts will then operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers,” the announcement stated. “Under this scenario, each court and federal defender’s office would determine the staffing resources necessary to support such work.”

A spokesperson for the courts wrote in an email to States Newsroom there were no updates to offer on funding or operations as of Thursday but signaled there could potentially be an announcement Friday.

Trump spending cuts, layoffs

The shutdown has had widespread ramifications across all three branches of government, including the Trump administration’s decision to cut spending approved by Congress and lay off thousands of federal employees, though that was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week.

Federal workers who are categorized as essential will not receive their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. Furloughed employees may never receive the back pay authorized in a 2019 law if the Trump administration reinterprets it, as officials have said they might.

None of the consequences produced any real sense of urgency this week on Capitol Hill, where West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice organized a birthday party for his dog, or at the White House, where President Donald Trump held a ball for donors to his ballroom and focused on foreign policy.

Just as they have for the last several weeks, members of Congress and administration officials continued holding separate press conferences and TV news appearances, lambasting their political opponents, none of which will help move the two sides closer together to reopen government.

Failed vote No. 10

Senators failed for the 10th time to advance the stopgap government spending bill on a 51-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to move forward under the chamber’s legislative filibuster. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.

The Senate was also unable to move past a procedural hurdle on the full-year Defense Department funding bill after a 50-44 vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this summer on a broadly bipartisan 26-3 vote.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that Democrats want some of the other annual appropriations bills added on to create a larger bill, though he didn’t say which of the dozen he prefers.

""It’s always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety,” Schumer said.

He added later that leaders from both political parties “have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way. Once again, they’re just going at it alone.”

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, appeared to offer a package of bills negotiated between the parties before the vote on the defense bill.

“We want this to be an open process with an opportunity to add additional bipartisan bills that address vital domestic priorities, including biomedical and scientific research and infrastructure,” Collins said. “And we want members to have a voice in the funding decisions that affect all of our states and constituents back home.”

Stopgap bills in 2025

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a floor speech earlier in the day the short-term government funding bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to negotiate final versions of the full-year spending bills.

“We're simply asking them to extend current funding bills for a few weeks while we work on full-year appropriations,” Thune said.

Congress is supposed to work out a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate on those bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but hasn’t finished on time since the 1990s.

So every September, once back from their August recess, the House and Senate write a stopgap spending bill that typically keeps the lights on until mid-December.

Those short-term measures, sometimes called continuing resolutions or CRs, were traditionally negotiated among Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers until earlier this year.

House Republicans, bolstered by a sweep in last year’s elections, decided in March to write a six-month stopgap spending bill on their own, after two bipartisan short-term bills were approved earlier in the fiscal year.

Senate Democrats voiced frustration with the process but ultimately helped Republicans get past a procedural vote that required the support of at least 60 lawmakers, allowing the March stopgap to advance toward a simple majority passage vote.

House Republicans repeated their previously successful maneuver last month, writing a stopgap spending bill on their own that would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing.

Health care standoff

Democrats maintain that Republican leaders must negotiate to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.

Republican leaders have said publicly over and over that they will, but cannot guarantee Democrats a final agreement will be able to pass both chambers. They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens.

“Despite the fact we’re only in this position because of Democrats’ poor policy choices, Republicans are ready for that discussion,” Thune said. “But only once we’ve reopened the government.”

Thune also raised concerns over what message it would send for GOP leaders to negotiate during the shutdown, which he said would endorse the use of funding lapses to achieve policy or political goals.

Shutdowns in history

Republicans forced the last two government shutdowns; the first in 2013 over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the second in 2019 over Trump’s insistence lawmakers approve more funding for the border wall. Both were unsuccessful.

Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech Thursday that Republicans drafting the stopgap spending bill on their own is a stark contrast to how things have worked for years and that they can’t expect Democrats to vote for something in which they had no say.

“For the last month, the Republican leader’s favorite number has been 13. He keeps citing 13 CRs that we passed when I was majority leader. Of course we did,” Schumer said.

“What he fails to mention — I'm not sure if he forgets, or he’s deliberately trying to ignore it — is that those 13 CRs were the product of bipartisan negotiation, of serious conversation. We had to make changes in those bills when our Republican colleagues suggested it,” he added. “They were in the minority, but they had the right to be heard, a right that has been completely shut out for Democrats under this new Republican majority.”

Schumer warned Republicans about open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace beginning on Nov. 1, saying tens of millions of Americans will soon realize what congressional inaction means for their family budgets.

He said Republicans’ unwillingness to negotiate before the shutdown began or since shows they “either don’t understand it or they’re brutally callous.”

‘I want to be happy Mike’

House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Thursday morning press conference that Republicans “have no idea” how the government shutdown will end, and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not voting to advance the stopgap bill.

House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew R. Garbarino of New York said the government shutdown is undermining the day-to-day operations of the Department of Homeland Security.

“This shutdown is making our country less safe,” he said.

Garbarino said roughly 90% of federal employees at the Department of Homeland Security are required to continue working because they have essential roles such as vetting customs at ports of entry and monitoring air space at airports.

He said those working without pay include 63,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees; more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration agents; and 8,000 Secret Service agents.

Garbarino added that he was grateful Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was using funds from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to pay the roughly 49,000 Coast Guard personnel.

In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS said it would be able to continue hiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and “deploy law enforcement across the country to make America safe again” due to funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued its aggressive immigration crackdown.

Johnson expressed his frustration that some Homeland Security employees were working without pay.

“We should not have Border Patrol agents not (being) paid right now because Chuck Schumer wants to play political games to cover his tail,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I don’t like being mad Mike, I want to be happy Mike … but I am so upset about this.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/shutdownzoo.jpg?h=2d6e2349&itok=3rDZnEqe,N,,2025-10-16 21:56:44.217133

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times.
Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons.
Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.
Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""","CHICAGO – A federal judge in the Northern District of Illinois ordered on Oct. 16 that immigration enforcement agents in the area will have to begin using body-worn cameras, according to local reports.

U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis gave the order in federal court in downtown Chicago following reports that immigration agents had clashes with residents on the city’s Southeast Side that ended with agents deploying tear gas and other chemical weapons. Ellis' decision comes after she issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 limiting how immigration agents used non-lethal weapons on civilians.

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times. ""I live in Chicago, if folks haven't noticed. And I'm not blind. … I tend to get news.""

The decision out of federal court comes amid President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area that the administration says is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Critics say innocent people are targeted and that Homeland Security’s aggressive tactics have upended life for many people in the region.

Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons. However the scene that played out on the city’s Southeast Side left her with ""serious concerns.""

Photos of the scene taken by the Sun-Times and shared by the office of Gov. JB Pritzker show federal agents in fatigues pointing non-lethal weapons directly into the faces of unarmed young people protesting enforcement actions.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin has shrugged off the optics of the photos.""This is a U.S. citizen who, along with his cousin, was arrested for assaulting and throwing rocks at law enforcement. That is a 40mm launcher that fires beanbags and rubber projectiles,"" McLaughlin said in a post on X. ""But keep making this thug your poster child.""

According to local reports, Ellis ordered a top Homeland Security official to appear in court on Oct. 20 to address the issue.

Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.

""Body-worn cameras are currently in use in ICE areas of responsibility where the agency has issued cameras and provided appropriate training,"" the statement said. ""In these areas, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy mandates the use of body-worn cameras during pre-planned enforcement actions by ICE law enforcement officers in support of the agency's mission, with limited exceptions for specific investigative operations. Agency-wide expansion of body-worn cameras is dependent on the availability of appropriated funding resources.""

An agency spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether agents in the Chicago area were using body-worn cameras.

What else does the judge’s order make ICE do?

Ellis’ order on Oct. 16 amends an order she made on Oct. 9 in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of clergy, protesters and journalists saying federal agents unreasonably deployed chemical weapons on people outside an immigration enforcement facility in the suburbs.

The immigration enforcement facility has become a hotbed of protests where agents have deployed around $100,000 worth of non-lethal weapons to stop ""rioters"" from hindering immigration enforcement, Trump administration attorney Eric Hamilton said in an Oct. 9 hearing regarding the deployment of National Guard troops to the region.

Clergy, protesters and journalists filing suit said agents fired without provocation. Among moments cited was a high-profile video of a federal agent shooting local pastor Rev. David Black in the head with a pepper ball.

Ellis in court filings said the chemical weapons use likely ""constituted excessive force"" and referred to the attack on Black as an ""unprovoked use of force.""

The original court order compels agents to wear identification, a significant step in the city where many people have chafed against masked men detaining people; and to give two warnings before using chemical weapons.

Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""

""The TRO essentially directs agents and officers to follow the training they have already received on crowd control, as well as what the Constitution demands of them,"" Ellis wrote.

Ortiz, Ju-Hyun Park, Elizabeth Weill-Greenberg, Julia Conley, Kate Morrissey, Mel Leonor Barclay, Shefali Luthra",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/more-than-170-us-citizens-have-been-held-by-immigration-agents-so-far-this-year/,"Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture.
Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers.
The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted.
Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.
To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.","When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.

So ProPublica created its own count.

We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.

Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.

These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.

Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agent pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery. In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)

In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.

The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”

A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.

Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.

We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.

Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.

In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.

When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”

Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”

When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.

Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.

Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”

Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.

Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.

This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.

DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.

Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.

Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.

“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”

George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.

The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.

Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.

Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.

Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.

“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”

Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.

Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”

DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.

The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twice ordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.

But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.

Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.

“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”

Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)

The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.

Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.

DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.

Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.

The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police. And that’s if agents can even be identified. What’s more, the administration has gutted the office that investigates allegations of abuse by agents.

“The often-inadequate guardrails that we have for state and local government — even those guardrails are nonexistent when you’re talking about federal overreach,” said Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA School of Law.

More than 50 members of Congress have also written to the administration, demanding details about Americans who’ve been detained. One is Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. After trying to question Noem about detained citizens, federal agents grabbed Padilla, pulled him to the ground and handcuffed him. The department later defended the agents, saying they “acted appropriately.”

How We Did This

Americans have reported a wide range of troubling encounters with immigration agents. To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.

Critically, there is no way to know the complete scope of these stops since the government itself does not track them. But we were still able to fill in the picture a bit more.

We reviewed more than 170 cases overall, which we sorted into two categories.

The first is Americans who were held because agents questioned their citizenship. We found more than 50 such cases. The second category is Americans arrested by immigration agents after being accused of assaulting or impeding officers at protests or during immigration arrests of others. In that category, we tallied about 130 Americans, including more than a dozen elected officials. In many of these cases, the government never charged these individuals or the cases were dismissed.

We also tracked another nine citizens who reported being concerned about racial profiling after being extensively questioned by immigration officials. This includes a Mescalero Apache tribal member who was pulled out of a store and asked for his passport, and a California man who was previously deported by mistake and got another deportation order in the mail.

We did all this by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We compiled cases from the beginning of the current Trump administration through Oct. 5. Our accounting of arrests in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago is particularly limited, since the events there are still unfolding.

We did not review cases of Americans detained in airports or at the border, where even citizens are more likely to encounter increased questioning. We also did not review cases of Americans arrested at some point after alleged encounters with immigration agents since those involved a judicial process. We similarly excluded arrests of immigration protestors by local police who, unlike many of the federal agencies, booked protesters into a local jail where they could access the legal process and their families could find them.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238859233-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:03:13.032761

RAC Acceptance East, LLC issued an early federal interpretation of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA), which became law in March 2022.

In Monteiro, the court held that the EFAA can render pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers unenforceable in sexual assault and sexual harassment cases even where much of the alleged misconduct occurred before the EFAA became law, so long as the dispute or claim “arises or accrues” on or after that date. Although the statute is not retroactive by its terms, the court’s application gives it practical retroactive effect in many employment cases.

What Is the EFAA?

The EFAA, a response to the #MeToo movement, amended the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers in disputes related to sexual assault and sexual harassment. By its terms, the statute applies to “any dispute or claim that arises or accrues on or after [March 3, 2022].”[1] In other words, if an employee signed a pre-dispute agreement requiring arbitration or waiving joint or class proceedings, that agreement will be void and unenforceable for sexual assault or sexual harassment claims after March 3, 2022.

Case Background

The plaintiff in Monteiro, a former assistant sales manager at a rent-to-own retailer, alleged that a co-worker subjected her to repeated inappropriate and sexually suggestive remarks, physical contact, and explicit messages over the course of her employment. While many of the alleged incidents occurred prior to March 3, 2022, at least one incident and the plaintiff’s subsequent termination occurred after the EFAA’s enactment.

After reporting the harassment to management and subsequently being terminated, the plaintiff filed suit in state court alleging sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation. However, because the plaintiff had signed a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims as part of her onboarding process, the defendants removed the case to federal court and moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the pre-dispute arbitration agreement.

Court’s Analysis

Judge Indira Talwani denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding that the EFAA applied to the plaintiff’s claims. The court emphasized that under the EFAA, claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault that accrue on or after March 3, 2022, are not subject to mandatory arbitration, even if some alleged misconduct occurred prior to that date.

Applying the “continuing violation” doctrine, the court determined that the plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim fell under the protections of the EFAA because at least one act contributing to the claim occurred after the statute’s effective date. The court further noted that the retaliation claim, based on the plaintiff’s termination, constituted a discrete act that accrued after March 3, 2022, and was therefore also subject to the EFAA.

The court rejected the defendants’ argument that the “primary allegations” of harassment predated the EFAA, holding that hostile work environment claims may span a series of acts over time, and the statute of limitations resets with each new act of harassment. As a result, the arbitration agreement was deemed invalid and unenforceable at the plaintiff’s election.

Why Monteiro Matters

Before the EFAA, employers routinely compelled arbitration of sexual harassment claims, rendering the allegations and proceedings confidential. Monteiro underscores that the EFAA’s protections turn on when a claim “arises or accrues,” not when the alleged underlying conduct occurred. Therefore, Judge Talwani’s decision substantially narrows the circumstances in which employers can rely on pre-EFAA arbitration agreements for sexual harassment disputes.

Takeaways and Next Steps

Arbitration agreements may be valuable risk-management tools, but employers should take special care to ensure these agreements are enforceable and aligned with the EFAA. Employers should review their arbitration clauses, update acknowledgment forms and dispute resolution policies to reflect the EFAA carve-out, and ensure internal training, reporting, and investigation protocols are robust to mitigate exposure.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:02:38.426440

The group led by lawyers Omer Shatz and Juan Branco filed a 700-page legal brief on Thursday. The Associated Press has obtained a copy of the brief.

Their case is based on six years of investigation, interviews with more than 70 senior European officials, minutes of high-level European Council meetings and other confidential documents. It follows a previous request to the ICC’s prosecutor’s office to investigate European officials for migration policies they argued led to the interception, detention, torture, killing and drowning of tens of thousands of people trying to reach European shores.

That request, filed in 2019 and admitted in 2020 as part of the ICC’s Libya investigation, did not cite any specific suspects by name.

Now, lawyers say they have identified dozens of European individuals, from high-level heads of state to lower-level bureaucrats, as “co-perpetrators” alongside Libyan suspects for the death of 25,000 asylum seekers and abuses against some 150,000 survivors who were “abducted and forcibly transferred to Libya, where they were detained, tortured, raped, and enslaved.”

European leaders, officials called out by name

“We did the work of the office of the prosecutor, we managed to get to the inside of this apparatus of power and deconstruct it to see which offices, which ministries and which individuals (are responsible),” Shatz said. “We feel confident to say that at least 122 are criminally liable.”

ICC’s prosecutor Karim Khan stepped aside earlier this year pending the outcome of a sexual misconduct investigation against him.

Lawyers published an online database with parts of their case and their “suspect list” naming each of the 122 individuals, their roles and why they believe the person to be liable. Among them is NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who was then prime minister of the Netherlands, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, then former president of the European Council, European former foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini and former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri, to cite a few.

Shatz and Branco are not the only ones to have urged the ICC to investigate abuses committed against migrants in Libya and the Mediterranean Sea. In 2023, a U.N.-backed investigation also concluded the EU’s support to Libyan forces contributed to crimes against migrants and called on EU authorities to review their policies with Libya.

“The law of the ICC was born out of European crimes but only applied so far to crimes committed outside of Europe,” Shatz told the Associated Press. “Our request is simple: to apply the law impartially, also upon European nationals.”

EU says cooperation with Libya on migration still a priority

Despite repeated calls from human rights experts for Europe to refrain from supporting Libyan forces in stopping migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, European officials remain determined to continue doing just that.

Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the chaos that followed, the country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. In recent months, there has been an increase in migrant departures from eastern Libya to Greece, which European officials have been trying to address.

The EU says it has been working with Libyan authorities “to protect migrants and refugees” in Libya, “while taking action to reduce irregular departures through border management and anti-smuggling and trafficking in human beings.”

It has repeatedly defended its cooperation with Libya and its migration policy and blames migrant deaths on people smugglers and human traffickers who profit off their misery.

“The situation in Libya is critical,” EU Commission spokesperson Markus Lammert told journalists last week. “We will continue our engagement with all actors involved.”

Rival Libyan officials visit EU border agency

Just yesterday, the EU hosted both eastern and western Libyan officials for a technical visit of the bloc’s border and coast guard agency’s headquarters in Warsaw. The visit was remarkable for bringing both sides of Libya’s rival governments into the same room.

“The atmosphere was open and constructive, and the Libyan side showed real curiosity about how Frontex and the EU work,” Chris Borowski, a spokesperson for Frontex told AP in writing. “It was a good first step toward building mutual understanding.”

Human rights groups, including non-governmental organizations that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, criticized the visit. In the past few months, Libyan patrols have been caught on camera in several incidents of aggression, including shooting at both rescue ships and migrants themselves.

“With the support of the EU and its member states, the Libyan militias have turned into a brutal border force that acts with aggression and impunity at sea,” said a statement issued this week by Alarm Phone, a network of activists who operate a hotline for migrants in distress.

Questioned last week about the recent incidents at sea and the scheduled Libyan visit to Frontex, Lammert, the EU commission spokesperson, insisted border cooperation with Libya would be “in line with human rights standards.”

There was no immediate reaction to the ICC filing.

Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion.
Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.","On Aug. 27, 2025, Rigoberto Hernandez, an Oregon firefighter, was arrested by Border Patrol agents while actively battling the Bear Gulch fire in Washington's Olympic National Forest. The arrest made national news—and occurred just 12 days before the Supreme Court would issue its Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo decision, dramatically illustrating the stark gap between legal theory and enforcement reality.

According to a habeas corpus petition filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), a nonprofit that provides free legal representation in immigration law, Border Patrol blocked the only exit, holding 40 firefighters under armed guard. Agents were ""whistling at them like they were dogs"" and forcing them into lines. When Hernandez was held for ""nearly three more hours,"" then handcuffed on the ground and held for over four hours at the initial site of his arrest.

Transported 200 miles to a Bellingham Border Patrol station, Hernandez was denied phone calls and attorney contact for over 48 hours, then transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, where he remained until Sept. 23, 2025 — 27 days in custody.

NWIRP attorneyse successfully secured a Temporary Restraining Order that the government chose not to contest, resulting in his release on Sept. 23.

""Hernandez has been living here since he was 4! He has family members who are U.S. citizens and has a pending U.S. visa application,"" Mozhdeh Oskoulan, an attorney with NWIRP, said. ""He was released due to a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) that NWIRP filed and the government did not want to respond, so they released him.""

This detention occurred during the largest fire on the Olympic Peninsula since 1951, which as of October 2025 remained only 5% contained. Hernandez worked as a federal contractor whose specialized skills were urgently needed to protect Washington communities from this massive blaze. Yet agents made no inquiry about his community ties, flight risk, or dangerousness — despite his pending U-visa application as a crime victim. The arrest also violated DHS's own policy against enforcement during disaster response: ""Absent exigent circumstances, immigration enforcement will not be conducted at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided.""

How the Supreme Court Greenlit Racial Profiling

Just 12 days after Hernandez was arrested in the middle of fighting a wildfire, on Sept. 8, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled on Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo. The Supreme Court’s decision allows ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people based solely on four specific factors: their apparent race and ethnicity, whether they speak Spanish or accented English, whether they're at worksites associated with unauthorized immigrants, or the type of work they perform (such as landscaping or construction). The Court's 6-3 decision allowed ICE to resume these racial profiling enforcement operations.

The Shadow Docket Process

Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo was decided through the Court's ""shadow docket"" — emergency orders issued without oral arguments and detailed briefings, including amicus curiae briefs (friend of the court briefs by interested parties). Shadow docket rulings prioritize speed over transparency.

The Trump administration's use of the shadow docket has been unprecedented. In the first 20 weeks of 2025, the administration filed 19 emergency applications — matching what the Biden administration filed over four years. According to Reuters, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations combined filed only eight emergency applications across 16 years. Their reporting concluded that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court has sided with Trump entirely or in part in 21 out of 24 shadow docket cases brought this year — an 87.5% success rate.

In a recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, confirmed that the Trump administration used the emergency docket far more frequently than previous administrations. When Colbert asked why, Justice Sotomayor explained: ""You know, success breeds new attempts, and to the extent that we have altered the natural course of history by granting more consideration of emergency dockets, of the emergency cases, we invite more of them.""

After Colbert noted the increase was ""significantly more,"" Sotomayor agreed. ""You know, in the past, the court was loath to grant emergency intervention most of the time. We figured if two courts below had given careful consideration to something, we shouldn't intrude until the case ended, which is the normal course of things. That has changed.""

ICE's Arrest Quota

NWIRP's lawsuit revealed a troubling context for Hernandez's arrest. According to their petition: ""In late May, Respondent Secretary Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller met with ICE leadership, setting a new arrest quota of 3,000 arrests per day and reportedly threatening job consequences if officials failed to meet arrest quotas.""

The petition continues: ""Following the directive from Noem and Miller, ICE agents were instructed in an email to 'turn the creativity knob up to 11' and aggressively 'push the envelope' in arrests, including by pursuing 'collaterals' — individuals who by definition would not have warrants. As another email put it: 'If it involves handcuffs on wrists, it's probably worth pursuing.'""

This focus on arrest quotas represents a dramatic departure from campaign promises. While Trump vowed to deport the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, ABC News reported in July 2025 that the reality looks very different: ""In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges.""

Many of those being arrested are working people whose only immigration violation may be overstaying a visa — which is a civil infraction, not a crime.

The Constitutional Standard and the Brignoni-Ponce Precedent

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo relied heavily on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce (1975), despite the fact that this case actually undermines his position. In Brignoni-Ponce, Border Patrol officers conducting a roving patrol near the Mexican border — not at a border checkpoint or the border itself — stopped a vehicle solely because the occupants ""appeared to be of Mexican descent."" The Supreme Court unanimously ruled this violated the Fourth Amendment, establishing that apparent Mexican ancestry alone cannot justify an immigration stop.

The Court in Brignoni-Ponce held that officers must have ""specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the country."" The Court emphasized that ""large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry"" and that ""even in the border area a relatively small proportion of them are aliens."" The Court noted that in California, approximately 20% of persons of Mexican origin were unauthorized immigrants, meaning about 80% were U.S. citizens or legal residents who would be affected by stops based solely on ethnic appearance. The Court stated, ""a set of facts cannot constitute reasonable suspicion if it 'describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent' people.""

This exact concern animated Justice Sotomayor's dissent in Noem. She emphasized the scale of innocent people who would be affected, noting: ""Never mind that nearly 47 percent of the Central District's population identifies as Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Never mind that over 37 percent of the population of Los Angeles County speaks Spanish at home, and over 55 percent speak a language other than English."" Just as Brignoni-Ponce recognized that profiling would ensnare ""large numbers"" of innocent citizens near the border, Sotomayor warned that ""countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.""

Justice Kavanaugh's Flawed Distinction

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledged constitutional limits, stating: ""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a 'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors."" The ""salient factors"" he identified include: that there is an ""extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area;” that individuals ""tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work;” that they ""often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork;” and that ""many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.""

In Kavanaugh's view, these circumstances ""taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion"" that would allow immigration officers to ""briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status.""

However, this distinction is constitutionally meaningless. The factors Kavanaugh relies upon are no more probative of immigration status than the ethnic appearance that Brignoni-Ponce rejected. Both involve sweeping generalizations about where undocumented immigrants might be found, casting suspicion on millions of citizens and legal residents based on their appearance, language, workplace, and occupation.

David Montes, an attorney with the ACLU of Washington, explains how profoundly Kavanaugh's reasoning departs from established Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections.

Kavanaugh's concurrence suggests that immigration stops are harmless because U.S. citizens can simply prove their status and continue on their way. But this fundamentally inverts constitutional protections. Under traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine, the government cannot stop someone unless they already have reasonable suspicion based on specific facts of criminal activity. Kavanaugh's approach reverses this: the government can stop you first, and then you have an obligation to prove you're not violating the law.

""That is the radical shift from where we were before,"" Montes explains. ""Not only is it a radical shift in terms of the Fourth Amendment — the government was supposed to have information before they stopped you — but also in terms of the Fifth Amendment. I was supposed to not have to say anything to the government, right?""

Montes warns that under Kavanaugh's reasoning, exercising your Fifth Amendment right carries a penalty: ""If I don't provide information, then they can detain me for longer.""

Montes, who conducts educational presentations for the ACLU, finds this departure unprecedented: ""I mean, I've given a hundred Know Your Rights trainings at the ACLU. It's just not what the Constitution said in any context previously. It's a wild departure from what the Fourth and Fifth Amendment have previously said.""

He summarizes the reversal: ""What Kavanaugh seems to be saying is reasonable suspicion now means the police stop the person...and [that person] has to prove to them that [they] didn't commit a crime to be released. This inverts the traditional understanding where ‘reasonable suspicion’ meant that the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed a crime and therefore they could investigate further. Kavanaugh seems to put the burden on the person being stopped to prove they are not here illegally.""

Montes concludes that Kavanaugh's error is twofold: ""I think he's both wrong in terms of what constitutes reasonable suspicion and wrong in terms of what is supposed to happen after a police officer has reasonable suspicion.""

The District Court's Actual Findings

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence repeatedly characterized ICE operations as brief stops, where individuals would be promptly released after clarifying their legal status. Yet the district court's extensive factual findings directly contradicted this portrayal. The court documented that during Operation At Large raids across Los Angeles, ""teams of armed and masked agents pulled up to car washes, tow yards, farms, and parks and began seizing individuals on sight, often before asking a single question.""

One case involved Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen working on his car at a tow yard. Despite answering that he was American three times, masked ICE agents armed with 'handguns and military-style rifles' continued their interrogation. When he couldn't immediately recall his birth hospital, agents 'racked a rifle' — audibly preparing the weapon to fire — 'grabbed his phone, shoved him against a fence while twisting his arm and forcing his hands behind his back.' He was released only after surrendering his REAL ID, which was never returned.

This bears no resemblance to the 'brief encounter' where citizens would be 'promptly' released that Kavanaugh described.

The Reality Behind ""Brief Detention""

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledges the Fourth Amendment's reasonable suspicion standard, noting that immigration officers ""may briefly detain"" an individual only if they have ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts"" of illegal presence. He assures that ""if the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Yet Kavanaugh's legal standard contradicts his own factual assertions. As attorney David Montes explained, Kavanaugh allows stops based on factors — ethnicity, language, location, type of work — that describe millions of law-abiding citizens and legal residents. These are not ""specific articulable facts"" about an individual; they are broad demographic generalizations that Brignoni-Ponce explicitly prohibited.

Kavanaugh's reassurance about ""brief"" stops and ""prompt"" releases contradicts the documented reality on the ground. NWIRP attorney Mozhdeh Oskoulan challenges both Kavanaugh's legal reasoning and his factual assumptions: ""I can tell you that the idea that a brief stop for questioning is ok is ridiculous. Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion. It is unlawful."" ""This is not what we are seeing,"" she emphasizes.

ICE Training: A Dangerous Gap in Professional Standards

ICE deportation officers previously received about 21-22 weeks of training, but The Atlantic reported in August 2025 that ""administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses."" This dramatic decrease in training helps explain the troubling incidents of violent treatment of unarmed individuals during immigration raids that are being recorded daily on cell phones.

ICE's use of masked agents in unmarked vehicles has created additional dangers for immigrant communities. The Atlantic reported that these tactics make it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement officers and criminals posing as agents, enabling impersonators to commit crimes including kidnapping, sexual assault, and extortion. These represent only reported cases; many victims likely do not report such crimes to local law enforcement.

Justice Sotomayor's Dissent

The enforcement reality — masked agents with reduced training conducting violent stops based on ethnic appearance — is exactly what Justice Sotomayor warned the Court was authorizing in her Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo dissent.

Cutting through the legal sophistry, Justice Sotomayor stated: ""Based on the evidence before it, the court held that the Government was stopping individuals based solely on four factors: (1) their apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work.""

She emphasized that the District Court found these four factors, ""even when taken together, could not satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonable suspicion."" Sotomayor argued that the District Court should have been allowed to review ""these troubling allegations in the normal course,"" but the majority felt compelled to stay the order.

""That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.""

Not the Final Word

Despite the troubling implications of the shadow docket ruling, Montes emphasizes that the fight continues: ""It's worth noting that this isn't a final decision on the issue. It's just a decision on the stay... it's back down with the Central District [of California] being litigated, and so it's possible to adjust that litigation to what Kavanaugh said, and to fully flesh out those issues to show how wrong Kavanaugh was, because this isn't ultimately a decision on the merits. It's only a decision on the stay.""

Montes explains that Kavanaugh's reasoning was preliminary — essentially his ""first blush"" assessment that doesn't bind the lower court's full consideration of the constitutional issues. The case returns to the Central District of California for continued litigation, where the ACLU will continue fighting to demonstrate the flaws in Kavanaugh's analysis.

Oskoulan similarly notes: ""Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence was just one opinion out of 9. This shadow docket ruling is unclear and not the final word on the matter as the case is now sent back to lower court.""

Montes adds: ""I hope they see that when it's more fully fleshed out in front of them and not on this very quick shadow docket and reverse themselves, but if they don't, it is a massive departure from where we were before.""

Know Your Rights — And the Risks

Despite the legal setbacks, immigrant rights attorneys like those at NWIRP and the ACLU continue working to protect vulnerable communities.

""Our Know Your Rights presentations are basically to remind our immigrant communities of their Fifth Amendment right to silence and their Fourth Amendment right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures,"" Oskoulan explains. ""For example, how ICE needs a judicial warrant, or permission of the individual, to enter a house.""

However, the current reality requires acknowledging the risks involved in asserting constitutional rights.

""In this day and age when ICE breaks car windows and doors to community members' homes and drags them out and assaults them we also make sure to tell people to gauge the level of risk of physical harm they are willing to take if and when they want to exercise their constitutional rights. But to assert them verbally nonetheless,"" advises Oskoulan.

From Constitutional Theory to Enforcement Reality

If looking Mexican near the Mexico border was insufficient for reasonable suspicion in Brignoni-Ponce, then looking Latino while working on your car at a tow lot in Los Angeles cannot possibly meet that standard. Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.

The immediate impact is devastating. The Court has effectively gutted the Fourth Amendment's protection against racial profiling in immigration enforcement. The constitutional crisis became undeniable when federal agents arrested firefighter Rigoberto Hernandez while he was battling flames to protect American communities, simply because of how he looked and because he dared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right.

Yet as both Montes and Oskoulan emphasize, this shadow docket ruling is not the final word. The ACLU of California continues to litigate the case in the Central District, working to demonstrate the constitutional flaws in Kavanaugh's reasoning. Individual victories like Hernandez's release show that legal challenges can succeed. The fight for Constitutional protections continues — and communities don't have to face it alone.

""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.","Washington — Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as ""lawless"" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.

The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.

""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News. ""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""

The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.

Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.

On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was ""a little startled"" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. ""I live in Chicago,"" Ellis said. ""And I'm not blind.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has ""not seen them cross the line yet."" Johnson told reporters that ""ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,"" adding that Republicans ""stand for law enforcement.""

Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles ""fuels impersonation of immigration officers"" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who ""understand the importance of not having government overreach.""

On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. ""CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers ""are authorized to defend themselves and others"" and that DHS ""reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.""

The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.

Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.

""I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,"" he said. ""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.

Why it matters: For all of the actions taken by the administration that pressured corporate America, from DOGE to tariffs, the proposed visa changes proved a bridge too far for the influential business lobby.

The big picture: Big businesses have been extremely reluctant to pursue litigation over Trump's policies, even as behind the scenes new regulations and orders are causing widespread discontent.

Trump's tariffs, for example, were challenged in court by a group of small businesses.

What they're saying: The Chamber, in a petition for an injunction, said the new fees would keep many American businesses from being able to hire talented foreign workers.

""These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America's economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States. That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back,"" the group wrote.

Of note: This is the first suit filed against the Trump administration this year by the Chamber.

The group sued the Biden White House on multiple occasions, frequently arguing the administration overstepped its statutory authority.

Catch up quick: In a September executive order, Trump said that employers hiring workers through the H-1B visa program would be subject to a $100,000 fee.

Prior to the announcement, it cost about $3,600 to sponsor a visa holder, and companies large and small said it was a crucial mechanism for hiring hard-to-find tech and science talent. Nonprofits like universities and hospitals also hire H-1B visa holders.

The announcement set off a panic inside American companies and among foreign workers.

Many small businesses and startups said they're unable to pay such a fee. Bigger companies were considering offshoring the work, lawyers told Axios recently.

Zoom in: The Chamber, which represents around 300,000 members including big and small employers, argues that the order is unlawful, and directly contradicts laws passed by Congress.

They're asking the court to stop the fee from taking effect.

The suit was filed in the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C. against the Department of Homeland Security and State Department. DHS secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are named defendants.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

""The Administration's actions are lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

Flashback: The Chamber also sued over this issue during the first Trump administration, arguing that a ban on entry for H-1B visa holders the White House sought to impose in 2020 was illegal.

In that case, a federal judge ruled that the administration overstepped its authority.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has locked arms with fellow Democrats nationwide in using the courts to push back on President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The potential 2028 presidential candidate has filed or joined more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the president’s efforts to reshape the federal government and slash previously allocated spending. The ones he’s joined have been championed by other Democratic officials.

Under Pennsylvania law, Republican Attorney General Dave Sunday is in charge of representing the commonwealth. But Shapiro can ask Sunday in writing to allow the governor’s Office of General Counsel to take over legal representation for the governor or other executive branch officials.

If Sunday declines Shapiro’s request — which he has not done this year, according to Shapiro’s office — the general counsel can intervene in the lawsuit to represent Shapiro and his interests as the state’s chief executive anyway.

Here is a timeline of Shapiro’s lawsuits, listed in order of filing date:

Federal funding freeze, Feb. 13

One of Trump’s first actions upon reentering the White House this year was to issue a sweeping executive order freezing the distribution of billions of dollars in federal grant money, including $2.1 billion allocated to Pennsylvania largely for environmental programs.

Shapiro then sued five federal agencies over those funds in Pennsylvania’s Eastern District Court. Since the funds were released, Shapiro has touted this case as demonstrative of his success in combating the Trump administration.

On Aug. 12, Shapiro’s office voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit “(b)ecause all previously-withheld funding at issue in this case is currently available” to Pennsylvania.

The case was Shapiro v. U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 2:25-cv-00763.

Public health grants, April 1

Shapiro joined a multistate lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for their cancellation of public health grants meant to assist states in combating infectious diseases. Those funds included $500 million for the Pennsylvania departments of Human Services, Health, and Drug and Alcohol Programs.

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled in May that Kennedy’s agency must release those funds, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected Kennedy’s appeal in July. Defendants have until Oct. 28 to respond.

The case is State of Colorado et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, No. 1:25-cv-00121.

Post-pandemic education funds, April 10

Sixteen states, including Pennsylvania (represented by Shapiro’s office), and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon over rescinded funding the agency provided to school districts after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared over.

The funding — of which $185 million was allocated to 116 Pennsylvania school districts to boost student mental health resources, support access to high-speed internet and fund HVAC installation — was reinstated by a New York federal judge in May.

The case is ongoing. In an Oct. 1 filing, Jay Clayton, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the parties “have made additional progress in reaching a consensual resolution but require additional time to finalize an agreement.”

The case is New York et al. v. U.S. Department of Education et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:25-cv-02990.

AmeriCorps, April 29

Shapiro joined more than two dozen states in suing the Corporation for National and Community Service over its cancellation of AmeriCorps, which promotes volunteerism in nonprofits, schools, faith-based organizations and public agencies.

Pennsylvania was to receive more than $6 million to support its AmeriCorps workers, and a Maryland federal judge ruled in June that the federal agency had to return those rescinded funds to the state. The case is ongoing.

The case is State of Maryland et al. v. Corporation for National and Community Service, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland, Case No. 1:25-cv-01363.

Food purchasing program, June 4

Shapiro filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Pennsylvania demanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins pay over $13 million in canceled federal funding to a program for farmers who sell products to food banks.

The case is ongoing, with Rollins’ attorneys fighting to have the lawsuit dismissed.

The case is Governor Josh Shapiro et al. v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Case No.1:25-cv-00998.

Broad grant cancellations, June 24

Shapiro joined 19 other states and Washington, D.C., in a wide-ranging lawsuit in the U.S. District of Massachusetts challenging Trump’s authority to cancel U.S. grant funding previously awarded, based on the federal administration’s argument that the grants “no longer (effectuate) the program goals or agency priorities.”

On Aug. 4, Judge Indira Talwani issued a partial summary judgment in the states’ favor, ruling the Trump administration could not cancel the grants. But on Sept. 11, Trump’s administration filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The case is ongoing.

U.S. Sen. John Fetterman weighed in on Sept. 18, joining twelve other senators in filing an amicus brief urging the court to rule against the Trump administration.

The case is State of New Jersey et al. v. U.S. Office of Management and Budget et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-11816.

Education funds, July 14

The federal Education Department canceled roughly $230 million in federal funds the Shapiro administration said would assist Pennsylvania schools with buying student technology supplies, providing after-school activities and organizing family literacy programs.

Shapiro joined another highly publicized multistate lawsuit challenging the $6 billion decision in Rhode Island’s federal court. The federal agency last month said it would release $1.3 billion of those funds. The case was dismissed on Sept. 12.

The case is State of California et al. v. McMahon et al., U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, Case No. 1:25-cv-00329.

Natural disasters, July 16

Shapiro announced on social media last month that he joined an 18-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s cancellation of disaster mitigation funds, including $130 million intended for 47 projects in Pennsylvania.

On Aug. 5, Judge Richard Stearns ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the defendant in the case, to not spend those dollars on any programs other than the disaster relief program it was intended to fund, until a final ruling in the case is made.

Citing the federal government shutdown, the agencies on Oct. 10 sought a pause in the case due to a lack of funding. On Oct. 14, Stearns denied the request. He ruled that resolving the issues are too important to delay

The case is State of Washington et al. v. Federal Emergency Management Agency et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12006.

Affordable Care Act changes, July 17

Shapiro and 20 states claim that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services illegally changed rules surrounding the Affordable Care Act’s state and federal health insurance marketplaces, including shortening enrollment periods and implementing a monthly $5 fee for patients.

The officials also challenged a rule barring transgender health care from the essential benefits requiring Affordable Care Act coverage.

The case is ongoing. It’s titled State of California, et al. v. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12019.

Planned Parenthood, July 29

Trump’s tax and spending megabill from July included a provision that would bar Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest provider of abortions, and its members from accessing Medicaid funds. Shapiro and 22 other state officials say that blockade of funds is illegal because the language of the provision is written so narrowly that it targets Planned Parenthood.

The Democratic officials’ challenge came a day after Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled to block the Trump administration’s barring of funds in a similar lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood. Talwani is also overseeing Shaprio’s lawsuit.

On Oct. 8, Talwani denied the Trump administration’s request to pause court proceedings during the government shutdown.

The case is State of California et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12118.

Gender-affirming care, Aug. 1

Shapiro and 16 other Democratic state officials sued Trump and his administration in Massachusetts over the president’s efforts to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, arguing there is no federal law banning medical care for minors.

On Oct. 1, federal Judge Angel Kelley granted the Trump administration’s request to pause proceedings while the federal government is shut down.

The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Trump et al., U.S. District Courts, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12162.

Electric vehicles, Aug. 1

The Trump administration froze some $5 billion to create a national network of electric vehicle charging stations just weeks into his second term in the White House. In May, several Democratic officials across the country filed suit attempting to unfreeze those funds.

In an amended complaint filed Aug. 1, Shapiro signed onto the lawsuit, which is ongoing.

The Department of Homeland Security says the officer, Radule Bojovic, overstayed a tourist visa that expired in 2015.

According to the department, Bojovic was “encountered during a targeted enforcement action” in ICE’s immigration-focused operation in Illinois.

The Hanover Park Police Department shared a Facebook post in August announcing Bojovic’s recent graduation from the Suburban Law Enforcement Academy, adding that he had started “an intensive 15 weeks of field training and evaluation as he continues preparing to serve the Hanover Park community.”

CNN has reached out to the Hanover Park Police for comment and has attempted to contact Bojovic.

“Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years—what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns?

However, both Mamdani and Cuomo have stated that they would defend the city’s sanctuary city status.

As a sanctuary city, New York City agencies are barred from sharing information regarding immigrants with federal authorities unless a crime has been committed. Immigration officials cannot arrest immigrants at city or state facilities such as courthouses or shelters. City law enforcement agencies are also prohibited from honoring “detainer requests” from ICE in most instances in the event of a conviction of a violent crime.

New York’s status as a sanctuary city dates back to executive orders issued by the Koch administration in 1989, but the status became official city law in 2011.

Immigrants are vital to New York’s mosaic as the city is home to 3.1 million foreign-born residents, who speak over 800 languages. Affordability, transportation, and public safety all impact immigrants, however, the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda has pushed the question of immigration and the treatment of immigrants to the forefront of city politics.

Recent high-profile arrests of city and state elected officials at immigration courts and the 400% spike in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers in New York City have left many asking how the next mayor will respond.

In June, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against New York City in an effort to dismantle the city’s sanctuary policy. Following the Trump administration’s suit, Mayor Eric Adams called for the city to modify its sanctuary protections for immigrants.

“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council — but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,” said Kayla Mamelak Altus, the mayor’s spokesperson, in a statement to The City in July.

The federal lawsuit is ongoing, and the City Council has continued to support the city’s sanctuary policies. In September, the City Council successfully blocked the Adams Administration from allowing ICE to open a field office on Rikers Island.

With New York’s status as a sanctuary city subject to intense debate and the looming threat of the Trump administration possibly deploying National Guard troops across the five boroughs, New York’s mayoral candidates have taken varying stances both in support and opposition.

Zohran Mamdani

Mayoral frontrunner and Democratic Party nominee, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, has vowed to preserve the city’s sanctuary status. A Ugandan immigrant himself, Mamdani moved to New York City with his family when he was 7 years old. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, and if elected, he would become the city’s first immigrant mayor.

“We are fighting to keep this city a sanctuary city,” he said during a rally on Staten Island in August. “We will continue to uphold that status and ensure that we do not allow ICE agents entry.”

Mamdani’s rise has added fuel to President Trump’s growing threats against the city, including the threat to deploy troops to the city if Mamdani became mayor.

However, when asked how he would deal with a hostile Trump administration last week on The New Yorker Radio Hour, Mamdani vowed to be strong — but his answer was vague.

“It’s not about Donald Trump versus myself,” he said. “It’s about Donald Trump versus the city. And that’s why you need someone leading the city that can build a front of New Yorkers who have a wide variety of politics, but are united on the question of this city, and the importance of it, and the fact that the federal government shouldn’t be attacking the very existence of it.”

As an Assemblymember from Astoria, Queens, Mamdani has co-sponsored several bills aimed at strengthening the legal rights of immigrant New Yorkers. In January, he co-sponsored a bill that would provide the right to legal counsel in immigration court proceedings. He also co-sponsored another bill, which would prevent state, county, municipal, and local government agencies from entering into or renewing immigration detention agreements or receiving payments related to immigrant detention.

Both bills are still pending.

Andrew Cuomo

Trailing behind Mamdani in the polls by 13 points is former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent on the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Like Mamdani, Cuomo also defends the city’s sanctuary status.

On June 10, Cuomo announced his 6-Point plan in response to the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles on June 8. In his plan, he vows to guarantee immediate legal defense for those targeted by ICE as well as monitoring the NYPD to ensure they enforce the city’s sanctuary laws.

During his time in Albany, Cuomo had a proven track record of supporting immigrants. In 2017, he issued an executive order prohibiting state agencies from inquiring about individuals’ immigration status. The order also restricted state agencies from sharing immigration status between state and federal authorities, as well as using state resources in immigration enforcement. A year later, in 2018, Cuomo issued another executive order prohibiting ICE from entering state facilities to arrest undocumented immigrants without a judicial warrant.

In addition to his executive orders, while governor, Cuomo suspended New York’s participation in the federal “Secure Communities” program in 2011. The federal program, which began in 2008, shared personal data of every person arrested and fingerprinted from local jails with federal immigration authorities. As a result, the program led to the deportation of over 450,000 people between 2008 and 2014.

Yet, despite his track record of supporting undocumented immigrants while he was governor, Cuomo has been criticized by the Mamdani campaign for courting the Trump base to win the election. In August, The New York Times reported that during a fundraiser with business leaders, Cuomo said he did not“personally want to fight Trump.” The story also reported that Cuomo had several phone calls with the President, discussing the race — a claim that Cuomo denied.

Curtis Sliwa

Unlike Mamdani or Cuomo, Guardian Angels founder and Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa opposes the city’s sanctuary laws. While he maintains that New York should remain a “city of compassion,” he also believes that sanctuary laws shield violent criminals from deportation.

However, Sliwa has pledged that he would not unilaterally revoke the city’s sanctuary status. Instead, he favors putting the question of the city’s sanctuary status directly to the voters through a ballot initiative, asking them if they want to repeal the city’s sanctuary status.",https://documentedny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/46639167082_e4c1bc912d_k-jpg-e1738168047802.webp,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:36.479929

She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.","OCILLA – Just four years after the Biden administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement severed ties with an Irwin County Detention Center over abuse, the facility is once again receiving immigrant detainees.

The Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Ocilla,, a south Georgia town about 60 miles east of Albany with about 3,000 residents, ended its ICE agreement in 2021 after repeated reports of abuse and medical misconduct. In 2022, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., unveiled a nearly two-year bipartisan investigation that found female detainees at the ICDC were subjected to “invasive, and often unnecessary gynecological procedures.”

On Tuesday, Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant public affairs secretary, confirmed to The Albany Herald that there is an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. Marshals and Irwin County to use up to 1,200 beds at the county detention center. It has already begun taking male, adult detainees. It will not be used for families.

In the days since finding out about the resumption of detaining migrants at ICDC, Georgia immigrant advocacy groups, many of whom fought for the ICDC’s closure, have condemned the decision.

“The re-opening of ICDC should alarm us all,” Amilcar Valencia, the executive director of El Refugio, a Stewart County hospitality home, wrote. “People at this … immigrant detention center have been subjected to horrific abuse, and their fundamental human rights have been systematically violated. We cannot let more be put at risk.”

Advocacy groups are calling upon members of Congress, local officials and community members to reject the decision.

Leeann Culbreath, an Episcopal priest and immigrant rights advocate in Tifton, called the decision to restart immigrant detention at Irwin unconscionable.

For years, Culbreath was face-to-face with immigrant detainees at ICDC and their families. She began visiting detainees in 2016 with a group of other volunteers. She said many people had been transferred from Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin and had no family or friends to visit with them in Ocilla.

“So we just started to listen to their stories,” Culbreath said. “The conditions there were inhumane for all of the years that I visited people there, and I don’t know anybody there who did not experience some kind of neglect of their rights or actual abuse: medical, physical, emotional, psychological.”

She also learned from detainees that there was no support system for their family members.

“It was a very difficult and stressful experience for people to make that trip to such a small community in the middle of nowhere with no public transportation,” Culbreath said. “They don’t know where to stay, if they’re safe, if they can get a meal.”

So Culbreath and others opened Casa Colibrí,, a hospitality home where families of immigrant detainees could rest, eat and get connected with resources. It also housed pro bono attorneys and social workers who commuted back and forth to ICDC. The group worked with a chaplain to provide deportation or release bags with clothing and toiletries.

While Casa Colibrí closed in 2020, this level of closeness with immigrant detainees and their families meant Culbreath heard first-hand tales of abuse, and she and others began advocating for ICDC’s closure.

She said when the ICE contract was severed in 2021, advocates felt a mix of emotions.

“There was elation because we believed at the time that no more people would suffer that kind of abuse at that place and that there might be a chance for justice for those who suffered abuse in that facility,” Culbreath said. “We felt like we had been screaming at a brick wall for years and finally felt heard.”

However after the closure, ICE quickly began transferring people from Irwin to the Stewart Detention Center, a privately owned prison about 100 miles away where at least 13 people have died since 2006.

“The justice that we hoped for and the care for survivors never materialized,” Culbreath said.

She said some people are still fighting cases and still do not have permanent status in the U.S., and they face the possibility of being detained again or deported.

“Women are still suffering trauma with PTSD, struggling economically, trying to rebuild their lives,” Culbreath said. “They did all the speaking out and testifying, and they haven’t gotten anything for putting themselves out there and reliving the trauma over and over again.”

She said restarting immigration detention at the ICDC just “re-traumatizes everybody.”

“The wounds are still open,” Culbreath said.

She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.

“What we do know is that advocates and formerly detained persons and their loved ones in Georgia and beyond will continue to speak out about abuses that they experience,” Culbreath said. “We want to continue to try to provide whatever support is needed for those who are detained.”

She said advocates will continue to ensure detainees have access to legal support and will work with legislators in addressing the needs of those who have been harmed.

“We’ll be monitoring it as best as we’re able,” Culbreath said.

McLaughlin said the Irwin facility will be subject to inspection by the ICE Professional Responsibility Office of Detention Oversight and additional oversight by ICE’s Enforcement Removal Operations custody management.

Culbreath said immigration detention and prolonged imprisonment shouldn’t be a part of the U.S. immigration system.

“Detention … it’s not criminal, but people are housed in prisons and they wear prison jump suits and they’re shackled when they’re transported, so they’re treated as criminals,” she said. “To not meet very basic needs, to use solitary confinement as a form of punishment or to silence dissent – that’s not humane and it can’t be made humane.”",https://d2mq8ajyfy4fws.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16134054/casa-colibri.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:04.566436

Mr. Ayala-Uribe came to the United States when he was four years old and had lived here his entire life. While detained at Adelanto, he became ill and reported having fever, pain, and worsening symptoms. Yet instead of receiving care, he was dismissed by Adelanto’s medical staff and sent back to his dormitory. For three days, his condition deteriorated without proper treatment. By the time he was finally transported to the hospital, it was too late. At just 39 years old, he died before receiving the surgery that could have saved his life.

“Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s untimely death while in ICE custody was a preventable tragedy. His pleas for help were ignored by those responsible for overseeing his care until it was far too late. This was an inexcusable failure to uphold even the most basic standards of medical care for people in federal custody,” said Rep. Chu. “But what happened to Mr. Ayala-Uribe is sadly not an isolated incident. It reflects a horrific, well-documented pattern of neglect at Adelanto, where detainees have been forced to endure conditions so dangerous and inhumane that they have led to multiple deaths. That’s why we are demanding full transparency and accountability to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.”

The letter presses DHS and ICE for a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s death, including the medical decisions made at Adelanto and what corrective actions are being implemented. The letter also underscores that the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, operated by the GEO Group, has been repeatedly cited for unsafe, unsanitary, and life-threatening conditions. Since January 2025, at least 15 people have died in federal immigration custody, marking a sharp increase from previous years, including during the first Trump administration. For more than a decade, Rep. Chu has called for the closure of Adelanto and continues to urge DHS to immediately shut down the facility, citing the long history of abuse, medical neglect, and human rights violations.

Rep. Chu’s letter was signed by 31 Members of Congress: Reps.

And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.
New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.
In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice.
Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.","Four months ago, Yessenia Ruano put her home in Wisconsin up for rent, packed a few bags and left for her native El Salvador. She had fled gang violence in her homeland, and said she had survived forced labor on her journey north. But after living and working in the United States for 14 years as she fought a deportation order, Ms. Ruano seemed to be out of options.

Legal protections that had allowed her to stay while she sought permanent residency began falling away when President Trump expanded his mass deportation effort. Even though her petition to obtain a special visa available to victims of human trafficking was still pending, federal immigration officials refused to delay their efforts to remove her from the country.

Now, Ms. Ruano and several other immigrants say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is violating the law by detaining and deporting victims of domestic violence or human trafficking who have applied for protection.

In a lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Los Angeles, lawyers for Ms. Ruano and the other plaintiffs say that the Trump administration’s policies violate the immigration relief provisions of the Violence Against Women Act and other measures that Congress established to safeguard victims and encourage them to work with the authorities.

Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, one of the nonprofits leading the case, said the government was breaking its legal bargain with vulnerable people who had taken “a dramatic and courageous step in coming forward.”

“Our government is turning its back — arresting, punishing and deporting those individuals — and what we’re going to be left with is an even more traumatized, less open membership in our community, and it’s going to make us all less safe,” Mr. Perez said in an interview.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that every unauthorized immigrant whom ICE has removed from the country has “had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

The lawsuit filed in federal court late Tuesday is one of at least five that challenge the practices of ICE agents and other officers as the federal government has intensified its immigration crackdown in major cities including Chicago; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C.

Under prior administrations, ICE agents were directed to focus on protecting victims when they were questioning unauthorized immigrants who had endured serious or violent crimes. And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.

But the agency rescinded those policies early this year. An ICE memorandum told agents to follow an executive order issued by President Trump on the day he was sworn in for his second term, calling for “total and efficient enforcement” of immigration laws.

Anti-immigrant groups and activists have long argued that some kinds of victim-based immigration relief was ripe for fraud and exploitation, and that it tied the hands of law enforcement agencies in pursuing criminals. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for Mr. Trump’s second term called for the elimination of U and T visas, which protect immigrants who are victims of domestic violence or human trafficking.

Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, said the administration’s policy changes gave “ICE more flexibility to proceed with removal proceedings, whether that is for a crime or a prior order of removal.”

Lawyers and immigrant rights groups counter that under the new ICE policies, federal officers have been putting victims in expedited removal processes, detaining them for long periods or deporting them before they have had a chance to plead their case. New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.

Prosecutors and victim services providers say that T and U visas provide important protection for people who testify in court to help hold traffickers and abusers accountable. Those prosecutions can take years to complete and involve extensive, invasive questioning, they say, and the fear stirred up by the Trump administration has made it even harder for them to persuade victims to cooperate.

“It creates more dangerous situations, because the longer the abuse goes unreported, the more we find that it escalates,” said Erin Aiello, an assistant district attorney and chief of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit at the Northwestern District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts.

Another plaintiff, Kenia Jackeline Merlos, 43, a native of Honduras, has been held at a federal detention center in Washington State since June. Ms. Merlos applied for a U visa in March 2024, citing an episode about a year earlier in which she and her husband were threatened by a man with a gun. They reported the crime and cooperated with the investigation, the lawsuit says.

Ms. Merlos and her four children, who are U.S. citizens, were rounded up over the summer at a park near the Canadian border, where they were spending time with relatives including her parents, who were visiting from Honduras on tourist visas.

Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they endured physical or sexual abuse at the hands of spouses, relatives or others, the court papers say.

In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice. The first time ended in 2011 when she was deported without being given a chance to plead for asylum. She returned that same year, fleeing gang violence in El Salvador, and on the way north, was victimized by a labor trafficking operation. Mr. Perez said the details of the trafficking case would be filed under seal to protect her against retaliation.

When she reached the United States the second time, a judge granted her permission to remain in the country and work while she pursued her asylum case, she said. She worked at a pizza factory in Milwaukee and eventually became a teacher’s aide. She married, and she and her husband, who is not a U.S. citizen, bought a small three-bedroom duplex with a yard for their white poodle mix, Copitos.

The school where she worked was so short of teachers that she was often called upon to substitute in social studies and Spanish classes, she said. “I felt really useful,” she said.

Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.

She applied in February and requested that deportation proceedings be delayed, but that request was denied. Worried about being separated from her children — 10-year-old twin girls — she felt she had no choice but to self-deport.

With the permission of a judge, she left the country with the girls in June, she said, and her husband followed with their dog a month later.

“My hope now is that we can return,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 14:02:54.014407

In recent news, a federal judge temporarily blocks the deployment of National Guardsmen to Portland following ICE protests, the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelans while a ruling vacating the termination is appealed, and a federal judge prohibits ICE from detaining unaccompanied minors in adult detention facilities upon reaching the age of 18.

On October 5th, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut of Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guardsmen from anywhere in the U.S. to Portland. Yesterday Judge Immergut extended the temporary orders for another 14 days. The court’s initial ruling came just one day after temporarily enjoining the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to the city. After receiving a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in putting “an end to the migrant invasion and these lawless riots,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the deployment of Oregon Guardsmen to the city against the wishes of Governor Tina Kotek. Though increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in June had led to protests in Portland, the court’s opinion noted “it had been months since there was any sustained level of violent or disruptive protest activity” in the city. Judge Immergut further held that Trump’s deployment “exceeds the constitutional authority that Congress granted him,” and “undermine[s] the sovereign interest of Oregon as protected by the Tenth Amendment.” Despite the injunction, the Trump administration mobilized hundreds of California and Texas National Guardsmen to Portland without an official announcement, prompting the second, more expansive restraining order. The White House plans to appeal the decision.

On October 3rd, The Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans while the government appeals a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that blocked DHS Secretary Kristi Noem from ending that status. Created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS protects eligible migrants from being detained and deported to countries that have been designated as having conditions that make it unsafe or inadequate for people to return. The Biden administration first granted TPS for Venezuelans in March 2021 and extended protections for an additional 18 months just two weeks before Trump took office. In February, the Trump administration subsequently vacated the extension and terminated TPS early for over 300,000 Venezuelans.

In May, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order pausing Judge Chen’s temporary injunction while the case was being litigated. The case reached a final judgement on September 5, when Judge Chen ruled DHS did not have the lawful authority to terminate the designation and extension. After the Ninth Circuit declined to block Chen’s ruling and the administration sought emergency relief, the Supreme Court issued another unsigned order allowing DHS to terminate TPS for Venezuelans while the Government appeals. The court noted “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed so “[t]he same result that [the Court] reached in May is appropriate here.” Justice Jackson dissented, criticizing the Court for leaving “300,000 human beings…vulnerable to job loss, family separation, and deportation” and for using its “equitable power (but not [its] opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

On October 4th, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining migrant children past their 18th birthdays. The ruling rests on an earlier case decided by Judge Contreras in 2021, which found ICE’s migrant children detention policy was a “pervasive violation” of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and issued a five-year permanent injunction. The ICE policy at issue in that case permitted unaccompanied minors, held in shelters by the Department of Health and Human Services, to be transferred to ICE adult detention facilities upon reaching their 18th birthdays. There, the court held that federal law required unaccompanied minors who reach the age of 18 to be released to the least restrictive setting available. In most cases, that setting is in the home of a relative. On October 1, 2025, ICE purportedly changed its policies to no longer allow unaccompanied minors who turn 18, even those with approved release plans, to be released and instead required them to be transferred to adult detention facilities. Responding to an emergency motion, Judge Contreras found this automatic detention contravened the earlier permanent injunction and enjoined ICE from “implementing any new directive regarding age-outs.”

The backstory:

Illinois is a sanctuary state, limiting cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities. The policy has been a frequent target of President Donald Trump and his administration’s immigration agenda.

Jayapal played an instrumental role in the original closure of the facility.

“It is deeply disturbing and dangerous that the Trump administration is choosing to reopen the private, for-profit Irwin Detention Center. In 2020, during the first Trump administration, I was the first member of Congress to speak to attorneys representing women who were detained at Irwin and subjected to forced medical procedures, including full or partial hysterectomies, without their knowledge or consent. These invasive and unnecessary procedures left multiple women without the ability to have children. Following the passage of a bipartisan resolution I led in October 2020, the Department of Homeland (DHS) Security ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

“The idea that this administration would now actively choose to detain individuals there again is unacceptable. The administration has already gutted any existing oversight mechanisms that were at least bare bones guardrails of unaccountable private, for-profit detention centers and their abuse of existing standards of care. Today, the growth of these for-profit immigrant incarceration facilities has only ballooned, with no-bid contracts being awarded to entities that have no experience, no ability, and no desire to ensure humane standards of care.

“The Trump administration’s move to reopen a facility that was the site of so many horrors, with zero oversight in place, is malicious and negligent. The reported death of the 20th person in ICE detention in just nine months of this Administration’s rule shows exactly how deeply we need to completely reform and rein in an abusive for-profit detention system.

“I call on Secretary Noem and the Trump administration to reconsider this dangerous and cruel decision.”

In September of 2020, Congresswoman Jayapal led 173 lawmakers in urging the DHS Inspector General to open an immediate investigation following a whistleblower allegation of mass hysterectomies being performed on women detained at the Irwin County Detention Center. She was also the first member to speak with attorneys representing women, during which she learned that at a minimum, 17 women had been subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures, often without appropriate consent or knowledge. Later that month, she traveled to the facility, and following that visit led 181 lawmakers in introducing a resolution to condemn the forced procedures. The resolution passed the House in early October 2020 with bipartisan support. The DHS ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

Federal agents arrested a man after an alleged crash involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in Oxnard Oct. 16.

Officers with the Oxnard Police Department stopped a Nissan Frontier truck in the area of Eighth Street and A Street around 7:48 a.m. after ICE alleged that the truck driver had collided with a Jeep Grand Cherokee and driven away, according to a written statement by Police Chief Jason Benites.

Assistant Police Chief Rocky Marquez previously said that one vehicle was an ICE vehicle and the other was not.

A video shared on Instagram by VC Defensa, a volunteer group that helps provide immigration information, showed the Jeep Grand Cherokee, allegedly belonging to an ICE agent, crashing into the Nissan Frontier, which the group said belonged to one of its volunteers.

The video shows the Nissan making a U-turn and the Jeep following close behind. As the Nissan pulls out of the turn and straightens out, the Cherokee appears to speed up, pull up along the driver's side of the Nissan and ram the truck.

While both vehicles appear close to each other at the start of the clip, it's not clear what interaction, if any, preceded the collision. A message left with ICE was not immediately returned.

Benites said federal authorities alleged that the crash was intentional and asserted a crime had been committed on a federal officer.

Oxnard Police was also asked to help keep the peace between the ICE agents and the growing crowd of about 80 protesters that gathered at the scene, authorities said.

In videos shared on social media, an empty lot in the area had been cordoned off with yellow caution tape to keep protesters out during the investigation. The live stream after the crash also shows multiple vehicles, some unmarked and some Oxnard Police SUVS with lights flashing in the lot and a number of Oxnard police officers standing in the area.

A wrongful arrest occurs when a person’s rights are potentially violated when arrested by law enforcement, for example, if someone is not given a chance to contact an attorney or told why they’ve been arrested.

Several people have also used habeas cases to win their release from the Tacoma detention center, cases with similarities to an arrest this summer that impacted a family in West Seattle.

It was late July, and Cheryl Eugenio was in the parking lot of the Department of Homeland Security building in Tukwila with her three children when she checked her phone. She had a missed call and a voicemail from her husband, Alan Phetsadakone.

“Hey, I’m getting taken in,” he said. “I’m going to be in Tacoma, the Tacoma detention center. I’ll try to call later, OK? Alright, I love you guys. Bye.”

RELATED: Tackles, projectiles and gunfire: Many fear ICE tactics are growing more violent

Phetsadakone had gone in for a routine check-in with ICE, as he had done for the past few decades. Eugenio said there was no notice, no indication at all that they were going to detain him — a red flag that a lawyer would later key in on, and a common thread in other unlawful arrest cases.

But in the moment, Eugenio didn’t know what was happening.

“I've replayed it, like, ‘Did I hear that right?’” she said.

Moments after she heard the voicemail she went into the Tukwila federal facility to find out why her husband had been arrested. Eugenio said ICE agents wouldn’t answer her questions or provide more information.

Phetsadakone was brought to the U.S. at the age of 3 as a refugee from Laos. More than 20 years ago, he was convicted of a nonviolent felony for bank fraud, for which he got a deportation order. At that time, Laos refused to accept deportees, so he was released on the condition that he check in regularly with ICE.

Sponsored

Earlier this year, the federal government began attempting to deport former refugees like Phetsadakone. Eugenio saw the stories, but didn’t expect it could happen to her husband.

“At first, I was still in shock,” she said. “It's like all these thoughts running through your head. Like, what's my next step? What do I have to do?”

Word about Phetsadakone's case spread through their community in West Seattle, and he was able to get help from the Seattle Clemency Project.

“The government [was] trying to expeditiously deport him,” said Jennie Pasquarella, the organization’s legal director.

Sponsored

Pasquarella and her team allege Phetsadakone’s arrest was unlawful, because ICE didn’t notify him of their intention to suspend his supervised release and attempt to deport him.

“He's been dutifully checking in with ICE as required under his order of supervision, and so, when he went for his check-in just this past July, he thought it would be the same as it always has been,” Pasquarella said.

Pasquarella also said Phetsadakone’s attorney during his original federal case failed to properly represent and advise him about the immigration consequences of his felony conviction. That finding could lay the groundwork to potentially throw out that conviction, the foundation of Phetsadakone’s deportation order — and he could get legal status again, this time through family members who are citizens.

In court, government attorneys argued Phetsadakone had a standing deportation order, and that they had the required documents to re-detain him and send him to Laos.

But Phetsadakone’s lawyers said those documents weren’t signed by any immigration official, and the deportation papers were only presented after he was detained — another red flag.

Sponsored

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said the inconsistencies raised serious questions of due process, suggesting ICE didn’t follow its own rules of supervised release.

“These disputed facts and gaps in the Government’s evidence undermine its claims that it followed the procedures required by its own regulations,” Whitehead wrote in a court document. “While the government has an interest in executing removal orders, agencies cannot act unlawfully even pursuing legitimate ends.”

In that same document — a temporary restraining order against the federal government — Whitehead ordered ICE to release Phetsadakone.

Before he was arrested, Phetsadakone and his wife had been taking stock of their life, putting things into their garage for donation and organizing kitchenware and home goods into piles.

They do this every time their kids move forward in a stage in their lives. One of their oldest children has started college. Their youngest is now a teenager.

Standing in front of a garage full of donations, a truck his father-in-law gave him to fix up, and a grill, Phetsadakone was clearly proud of the life he and his wife had created. Despite everything he's been through, he said he remains excited about the future.

“I don’t know how to explain it,” he said. “It’s like America in a sense.”

He’ll have to check in with ICE again this week and in the coming months. Phetsadakone still has to fight his deportation in court. But, he said, that will be a lot easier from outside of detention.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/9da526136df13c554eee770af6079f50.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-10-16 14:03:06.563579

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates?","By Howard Fletcher

In recent years, the discourse surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States has become increasingly polarized and disturbingly opaque. While policymakers tout “law and order,” the actual data on who is targeted, detained, and deported remains elusive—raising troubling questions about transparency and racial bias.

Why are comprehensive numbers on European or Asian immigrants so challenging to find? It’s a fair question to ask when the focus of enforcement seems disproportionately concentrated on Black and Brown populations, especially those from Africa and Latin America.

Reports and data often highlight the surge in deportations of nationals from Mexico, Central America, and increasingly, Venezuela and other South American nations. Meanwhile, European immigrants—whether asylum seekers or tourists overstaying visas—rarely seem to be a focus of enforcement, and comprehensive data on their numbers and treatment are notably absent.

This discrepancy is not accidental. It underscores a persistent pattern: enforcement efforts are directed more aggressively toward Black and Brown communities, reflecting racial biases rather than a balanced approach to immigration control. The lack of transparent, publicly available data on European or Asian immigrants suggests a clear double standard.

Why does this matter?

For one, it erodes trust in the fairness of immigration policies. When enforcement appears to be based on racial profiling, it fuels fear and division, undermining the very ideals of justice and equality. Moreover, the focus on Latin American and African immigrants often ignores the broader economic, cultural, and humanitarian contributions these communities make, instead framing them as “problems” to be solved.

Without proper data, policymakers and the public are left in the dark about the scope and impact of enforcement on different communities. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security does not publish detailed breakdowns of arrests and deportations by race or country of origin beyond a handful of Latin American nations. That absence makes it nearly impossible to assess whether ICE is targeting migrants equitably or disproportionately focusing on specific groups.

Consider a 2025 congressional inquiry led by Representatives Juan Vargas and Darren Soto, which revealed that nearly 90% of ICE street arrests involved people of Latin American descent—even though migrants from Europe, Asia, and Canada also make up a significant share of the undocumented population in the U.S. Though we may have our suspicions, without comprehensive demographic data, it’s impossible to determine whether or not that figure reflects accurate population proportions.

This lack of transparency doesn’t just obscure potential bias—it also prevents meaningful policy reform. If ICE and DHS released comprehensive, disaggregated statistics on all immigrant groups, the public could hold the system accountable and identify inequities early, rather than relying on scattered reports, whistleblowers, or civil rights lawsuits to reveal them years later.

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates? Are they being subjected to the same level of scrutiny? (We know they’re not.) The silence suggests that enforcement is not applied evenly but is instead used as a tool to publicly target those perceived as “other.”

This selective enforcement echoes historical patterns of racial discrimination that have long plagued our immigration policies. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the targeting of Mexican workers, the United States has a troubling legacy of marginalizing non-white populations under the guise of national security or economic necessity. The Trump administration’s policies continue this pattern, prioritizing deportations that disproportionately impact communities of color, often without transparent justification or data to support such focus.

Furthermore, the rhetoric used to justify these policies often dehumanizes the targeted populations, perpetuating racial stereotypes and undermining America’s commitment to human rights and the rule of law.

The question then becomes: why is there such a lack of transparency? The answer likely lies in political convenience. Focusing enforcement on Black and Brown communities provides a narrative that aligns with certain political agendas—one that emphasizes “securing borders” and “cracking down” on specific populations, often at the expense of truth and fairness.

To move toward a more equitable immigration system, transparency must be prioritized. Data should be publicly accessible, comprehensive, and disaggregated by country of origin, race, and ethnicity. Take California’s Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA), for example. After the state began requiring police departments to collect and publish data by race and ethnicity, analysis revealed stark racial disparities in traffic stops and searches. Those findings prompted several departments—including Los Angeles and San Francisco—to revise training protocols, limit pretextual stops, and increase oversight of enforcement practices.

If America truly aspires to be a nation of laws, it must first be a nation of truth. Transparency in data isn’t a bureaucratic demand—it’s a moral one, a measure of whether our justice system serves equality or enforces hierarchy. Until we confront who is being targeted, and why, we cannot claim that our immigration system reflects the values we so often preach to the world.",https://couriernewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/257/CHR_Thumbnail_-_2025-10-16T092732.569_2000x1125-1024x576.png,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:36.849407

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.","House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday hammered the Trump administration’s effort to provide $40 billion to help Argentina’s conservative leader weather that country’s financial crisis.

Jeffries wondered why Republicans in Washington are willing to secure so much funding for a foreign government but are balking at Democratic demands to subsidize health care for working class people at home.

“It’s perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the health care of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina,” Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol.

Hours earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the administration is seeking $20 billion in new funding for the government of Argentine President Javier Milei, a right-wing populist allied with Trump. That’s on top of $20 billion the administration has already provided to help Milei prop up a crumbling economy.

The first round of funding came earlier in the month, in the form of a direct currency swap. The second, Bessent said, would originate from sovereign funds and the private sector, not U.S. taxpayers.

“Many banks are interested in it and many sovereign funds have expressed interest,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

Argentina has come under fire from lawmakers in both parties for increasing its soybean sales to China after Beijing stopped purchasing American soybeans in response to Trump’s tariffs. Jeffries is among those lawmakers, and he criticized the administration for propping up the Argentinian economy but not U.S. farmers.

“That’s outrageous. This is corruption in real time,” Jeffries said. “It’s having serious consequences on the American people.”

On Tuesday, Milei had visited the White House to meet with Trump. Afterward, Trump said he might withhold the billions of dollars earmarked for Argentina if Milei’s party loses in national elections slated for later this month.

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.

“I think he’s going to win,” he continued. “And if he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.”

The comments were criticized by opposition leaders in Argentina, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the president of dangling the funds in an effort to influence the outcome of a foreign election.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/jeffrieshakeem_101425gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:32.569291

“You’re saying sometimes it’s acceptable for a federal district court to order a map that intentionally discriminates on the basis of race?” Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Donald Trump appointee, asked voting advocates.

Louisiana added a second majority-Black district after multiple courts concluded that its congressional maps likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory vote dilution. The conservative justices were concerned about how race played into Louisiana’s new maps, questioning whether they violated the 14th and 15th Amendments.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, said that courts can use race to create remedial maps “so long as it’s not excessive,” but he questioned whether that practice should cease.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh said. “What exactly do you think the end point should be for the intentional use of race to create districts?”

Louisiana’s first set of new maps only included one majority-Black district despite Black voters making up 30% of the adult population in the state. Civil rights groups sued Louisiana for diluting the votes of Black voters, and after a protracted legal battle and federal court ruling, the state Legislature drew new maps in 2024 with a second majority-Black district.

Litigation continued, however, after a group of “non-African American voters” sued the state — so far unsuccessfully — claiming the new maps are unconstitutional because they considered race.

In March, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether the Legislature relied too heavily on race when redrawing Louisiana’s maps. Instead of issuing a decision in June, the justices delayed a decision and scheduled an additional argument this term.

The conservative justices looked likely to throw out Louisiana’s 2024 maps. Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, was one of several justices to note that Louisiana’s remedial map was drawn based on a preliminary decision in the lower courts.

“Under protest, we drew [the 2024 map] because the threat was that the federal courts were going to do it if we didn’t,” J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, said.

To avoid violating the equal protection clause, legislatures have a compelling interest to use race when drawing maps. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, questioned whether the state’s reasoning qualified.

“The state would have to say at that point: ‘Well, we’re weighing race heavily because we have a compelling interest in avoiding a Section 2 violation,’” Barrett said. “The state’s position might be we don’t actually really think that we violated Section 2, but we have a litigation risk.”

Barrett suggested that the court clarify its prior rulings that created the standard for when race could be used to remedy a Voting Rights Act violation.

Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that the court’s prior rulings already provided exacting and robust requirements for litigating Section 2 claims. Nelson noted that the court recently reaffirmed those precedents in a 2022 case regarding redistricting in Alabama.

“This court [has] said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one,” Nelson, who argued for the voting advocates, said. “That calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a new unique way.”

Because many states have used Section 2 to draw their districts, the voting advocates warned that removing its protections would lead to a resurgence of discrimination. One report estimated that if the Supreme Court sides with Louisiana, Republicans could secure an additional 19 safe seats in the House of Representatives and cement GOP control for at least a generation.

While all the conservatives seemed to take issue with Louisiana’s 2024 maps, there wasn’t a consensus on how to fix them. The liberal justices were concerned that their colleagues’ solution would gut what’s left of the landmark law.

“The bottom line is just get rid of Section 2,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, said, describing one potential solution.

Sotomayor said the conservative justices were only looking at the use of race in a negative context.

“Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn’t deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor said.

Justice Elena Kagan, another Obama appointee, said that race was only used in response to discrimination.

“The race-based redistricting that you’re now objecting to is redistricting designed to remedy a specific, identified, proved violation of law; more, a specific, identified, proved racial discrimination by the state,” Kagan told Louisiana’s solicitor general.

The Trump administration has suggested that the justices consider whether a state’s maps depart from race-neutral principles. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden appointee, worried that solution prevented remedies for discrimination in places with a history of segregation, like Louisiana.

“I hear your test not allowing us to solve that problem when the state is continuing to present the same map under circumstances in which people are not actually able to have equal electoral opportunity,” Jackson said.

David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, predicted that the court would ultimately gut the Voting Rights Act.

“This idea that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — added to the Constitution to ensure that Black Americans would be full members of the body politic — bars legal remedies for racial vote dilution designed to cancel out Black voting strength turns the Constitution on its head,” Gans said in a statement.

He continued, “In this morning’s oral argument, the court’s conservative justices turned a blind eye to this core part of the Fifteenth Amendment’s text and history.”",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-16 12:58:15.177584

A Bucks County judge upheld Sheriff Fred Harran’s decision to partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, rejecting a legal challenge that sought to block the controversial 287(g) agreement.

The ruling, issued Tuesday by Judge Jeffrey G. Trauger of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, allows the sheriff’s office to proceed with the ICE cooperation agreement — at least for now — despite opposition from county commissioners, immigrant rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania.

The decision comes as Harran, a Republican, seeks reelection as he fends off a challenge by Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler.

Harran released a statement shortly after the decision, calling it “a victory for the law-abiding residents of Bucks County and a validation of a common-sense approach to public safety which fully leverages partnerships and resources to keep our communities safe.”

“This decision affirms our ability to use this simple tool to ensure individuals who commit crimes in our county are held fully accountable – regardless of their immigration status,” he wrote.

Stephen Loney, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU, said the “fight is far from over.”

“It’s unfortunate that the judge in this case failed to appreciate what the law clearly states; the sheriff does not have authority to sign onto a 287(g) agreement with ICE,” Loney said in a statement. “We will appeal this decision and, in the meantime, we will continue to work to hold Sheriff Harran accountable to the rule of law.”

Harran signed the 287(g) “task force” model agreement with ICE in April. Under that model, trained local deputies may act in a limited immigration enforcement capacity, including serving ICE warrants and checking individuals in custody against ICE databases.

That led to a series of protests by local activists and contentious court proceedings.

No standing

The lawsuit, filed in June, argued that Sheriff Harran lacked legal authority to enter into a 287(g) agreement without approval from the county’s Board of Commissioners. Plaintiffs, including Make the Road, NAACP Bucks County, Buxmont Unitarian Universalist Fellowship and Juan Navia, a Bucks County resident who claimed the arrangement violated Pennsylvania law and posed risks to civil rights and public trust.

However, in the 13-page decision, Judge Trauger found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the case at this stage because of a lack of harm from an agreement that is not yet in effect.

“Plaintiffs here are alleging injuries that are not immediate or substantial,” Trauger wrote. “Rather, in their complaint, they allege what are clearly only speculative future injuries based on speculative future events.”

The decision singled out Navia, who was asked to join the plaintiffs and argued in court that he and his family feared they would be subjected to an increase in racial profiling. During cross-examination, Navia said he did not know of anyone who was already affected.

Traugher wrote that Navia “baldly alleges that he is at an increased risk of profiling” but “alleges wholly subjective fears of possible future incidents, including racial profiling, warrantless searches and arrests.”

As a result, the judge said, “none of the Plaintiffs have proper standing to bring this action.”

On whose authority?

Traugher’s decision did find that the Bucks County Board of Commissioners had standing to pursue their challenge. In May, the board passed a resolution reaffirming its sole contractual authority and declaring the 287(g) agreement invalid, citing concerns about liability costs. Commissioners Diane Ellis‑Maresiglia and Bob Harvie supported the resolution; Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo dissented, voicing confidence in Harran’s approach.

The commissioners separately challenged Harran’s agreement with ICE, arguing that Harran was legally required under state law to seek approval from the county commissioners before entering into binding agreements on behalf of the county and that the sheriff cannot unilaterally bind the county to a federal partnership.

However, the judge disagreed, finding that “the documents signed by the Sheriff are not an enforceable contract and therefore were not subject to the approval” of the commissioners.

He also cited earlier agreements with federal agencies that the sheriff entered into without objection, such as those with the U.S. Marshals and ICE Homeland Security Investigations, which “did not include or require any County Commissioner approval.”

The decision also notes that Harran signed the memorandum of understanding with “limited intent,” designating only three officers to take on the outlined duties and keeping those duties limited.

What’s next?

Critics warn that the 287(g) task force model has a history of racial profiling, overreach and misuse in other jurisdictions. They argue that immigrant victims of crime may be less willing to report crimes or cooperate with law enforcement if local deputies are seen as ICE proxies.

However, Harran has emphasized that the agreement would be targeted, not sweeping. He said the program will only involve those already in custody on criminal or warrant charges and not routine traffic stops, and that he is not seeking to deputize deputies to police immigration status generally.

He has also asserted that the program would come at zero cost to county taxpayers, with ICE reimbursing equipment, vehicles and personnel expenses, though commissioners and others have expressed concern over potential liability costs borne by the county if a raid or arrest goes wrong.

The debate intersects directly with the race for sheriff, between Harran and Ceisler, the Democrat.

Ceisler has been critical of Harran’s ICE collaboration, arguing that it diverts resources, reduces trust and harms public safety. He contends that deputies should focus on county law enforcement duties rather than carrying out federal immigration tasks.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ICE-officer-immigration-immigrant-detainees.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:48.347221

NEW BEDFORD — In response to an uptick in immigration activity and “some community pushback,” Police Chief Jason Thody has issued interim guidance on how the department’s officers should interact with and respond to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they’re in the city.

“One of the main topics right now is immigration enforcement,” Thody said. “The question was, what do we do as the New Bedford Police Department? What’s the direction to the troops on what we do [during] ICE operations?”

‣ Coming tomorrow: How county sheriffs interact with ICE

Among the guidelines, the three-page document states officers must activate their body cameras when responding, and must “fully document” each incident by noting key aspects: whether NBPD was notified by ICE before the operation, what officers observed on scene, and whether any arrests occurred.

It’s a stopgap measure until the department publishes a formal policy, which it is developing with city attorneys.

The guidance addresses how police should interact with protesters who may be on scene or nearby during an ICE operation. It affirms that protesters are allowed to voice their opinion and film (activities protected by the First Amendment), but states New Bedford police must “restore order” if demonstrators interfere with law enforcement operations, block vehicles, create safety hazards, or turn violent.

“Officers should prioritize the safety of everyone involved, including agents, protesters, and bystanders, while balancing lawful order with the public’s right to observe and speak,” it says.

When responding, NBPD will send a supervisor and at least two officers. The supervisors would then be expected to verify the agents are with ICE. If federal agents do not provide that information, Thody said the department will document that, too.

Thody issued the guidance to all police personnel on Sept. 21 and published a public facing FAQ on the police website on Sept. 24.

Chief says ICE has rarely communicated with NB police

The transparency on the Police Department’s end comes amid a lack of transparency from ICE, according to local elected officials — and Thody.

Communication has been inconsistent and the department doesn’t hear much from the federal agency, Thody said. Most of the time, police learn of immigration arrests through the news or social media.

Between July and October, Thody saw one or two calls from ICE to the department’s communications division to inform them that federal agents would be in the city that day. Since July, The Light has confirmed at least 17 ICE arrests in the city. Most arrestees are originally from Guatemala.

Across Massachusetts, ICE has targeted Guatemalans. They rank second, after Brazilians, in the most arrests by country of origin from January through July in the state, according to ICE data.

“It is frustrating to not be able to have conversations that could put our community and our officers in a safer place,” said Thody, who spoke with The Light before and after the guidance was published. “There are a lot of ways I think we could be helpful to both sides without enforcing immigration laws and getting involved.”

Thody said he contacted ICE Boston Field Office Acting Director Patricia Hyde in hopes of having a conversation. He has not heard back.

“We know that they’re going to do what they’re going to do… I can’t control that. But is there a way we can — not work together — but we could create a situation that’s safe for our residents and put our immigrant population at ease,” Thody said, “whether that’s running interference or using deconfliction training.”

Communication with ICE could enhance public safety, Thody argues. Citing the window-smashing incident involving Juan Francisco Méndez in New Bedford in April, Thody said New Bedford police could assist in de-escalating similar situations. They can also offer language skills if ICE officers cannot effectively communicate with the person.

The department employs a K’iche’-speaking officer, as well as those who speak Spanish. The guidance notes this, stating officers can provide “translation services.”

But New Bedford officers may not be able to do that if they are not informed of where and when ICE agents will be operating in the city.

Ondine Gálvez Sniffin, Méndez’s attorney, challenged Thody on this in July when, just after starting the job as chief, he spoke before the immigrant community during a gathering at Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, where Méndez was in attendance.

Gálvez Sniffin said that when New Bedford police officers responded to the scene after Méndez was taken, they told her that “they would not get involved, they would not interfere, in an enforcement action.”

“How are they going to de-escalate the situation?” she asked Thody.

Thody said there is no perfect answer: ”I don’t know that we will be able to help in every situation.”

Still, it’s worth trying, he said.

Critics react

Adrian Ventura, executive director of the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, said the police guidance may well backfire.

“Now, the people are worried that the police are working with Immigration,” he said. “I don’t know anymore if they are protecting the feds or the community.”

The Light has confirmed that ICE has taken nearly 60 immigrants into custody in the New Bedford area since the start of the current presidential administration.

Thody has acknowledged that some members of the city’s Guatemalan community are fearful.

“My philosophy is still not to cooperate with them in their enforcement. I think it is important to know them and have a working relationship with them so that we can be present to help protect our residents,” Thody told a full room at the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores event in July.

New Bedford is not the first or the only police department in Massachusetts to put guidance about ICE interactions in writing. Framingham issued guidance in 2017 and Natick in 2024. Most recently, Georgetown, a town of about 8,000 people in the North Shore, and Easthampton, in Hampshire County, issued their own documents in May and June respectively.

Peter Mancina, a cultural anthropologist and visiting scholar at Rutgers Law School, said local police can exercise discretion in how they cooperate with federal agents.

“There are legitimate public safety concerns and reasons” for police to respond to an operation, Mancina said.

“Nonetheless, it makes it easier for ICE to arrest the person,” he continued. “De-escalation makes people more safe, but it affords ICE a more efficient immigration event, and one that saves their face. They don’t have to look like the aggressors.”

Amy Grunder, director of state government affairs at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA), said she viewed the transparency around Thody’s guidance as a good thing on the whole.

“Some police departments, especially those in immigrant communities, have worked really hard to earn the trust of immigrant residents and are seeing that work undermined by aggressive ICE enforcement,” she said.

Nonetheless, Grunder does have questions about the Police Department’s guidance, particularly about the portions where it emphasizes protecting ICE agents.

“It is concerning, because it does kind of give credence to the idea that ICE agents are at risk from the public,” she said.

“It’s a needless addition that sends a bad message,” added Grunder, “especially given the well documented brutality of these enforcement actions against targeted immigrants and bystanders, including journalists.”

From Thody’s perspective, though, officers on the force will have some expectations and guidance they can refer to, which they didn’t before.

“The important takeaway is that the New Bedford Police Department is not taking a political position on this,” he said. “We don’t pick and choose who to keep safe.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2448.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:31.007885

Nothing that I could see would have attracted the attention of the agents, except for the fact that the men had brown skin. After questioning them, the agents let them go.

This scene is now unfolding across Chicago every day.

Federal immigration agents have been asking people about their legal status outside churches, homeless shelters, apartment buildings, parks and even a cemetery. Officers have questioned both U.S. citizens and legal residents, asking for passports and visas as proof of identity.

The presence of officers from Border Patrol and ICE has brought forth an intense backlash. Chicagoans are shouting at immigration agents, calling them fascists and Nazis, throwing objects at them and chasing their unmarked S.U.V.s or minivans, honking their horns to warn bystanders of ICE’s presence.

In response to what a Homeland Security official called “a surge in assaults,” the officers are using increasingly aggressive tactics. In recent days, they’ve hurled tear gas, pepper balls and smoke bombs at the public, protesters, journalists and even Chicago police officers, often without warning. Today’s newsletter is about the conflict on the streets of Chicago.

The intervention

The Trump administration began a crackdown on illegal immigration here five weeks ago, promising to help the city by arresting “criminal illegal aliens.” But the tactics are unusual.

Schools. Officers are lingering just off campus in some places. So principals have ordered “soft lockdowns,” keeping students in classrooms until the agents are gone. Last month, ICE tried to arrest a father after a day care drop-off; in the confrontation, he was shot and killed. Now some schools use neighborhood volunteers, at parents’ request, so white adults can walk Latino children home.

Restaurants. Kitchens are often staffed by undocumented immigrants, and ICE knows it. Workers are afraid to leave their homes, and many have cut their hours. One Mexican spot I like keeps its door locked — even when it’s open — as a shield against ICE, allowing customers in one at a time.

Public spaces. Many people, even those with legal status, are asking friends to do their grocery shopping for them. Streets are quieter. One man with legal residency got a $130 ticket for not having his papers, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Why here? It is not surprising to people here that the administration has focused on Chicago, which calls itself a sanctuary city. That means it doesn’t help the federal government deport undocumented immigrants. Half a million Chicagoans, nearly one-fifth of the population, were born outside the United States, and support for immigrants is generally strong in the area. Local police officers won’t ask suspects about their immigration status.

Trump and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, have an adversarial relationship, and Trump regularly criticizes Chicago’s Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson. The president wrote online that they “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” City and state leaders said they were receiving no communication from the Department of Homeland Security or the White House about the operations.

The fury over immigration enforcement has expanded in the last few days. After a car chase and crash involving agents, more than 100 people came out of their homes and shouted, “ICE go home.” At least one person threw eggs at the agents, hitting an agent directly in the head. (Trump ordered National Guard troops into Illinois over Pritzker’s objections, but a federal judge blocked their deployment last week.)

In response, federal officers released tear gas on the crowd, including 13 Chicago police officers who had been called to the scene. For weeks, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have dispersed people filming and shouting at them by shooting pepper balls and tear gas.

This is very different from norms of modern policing: Officers typically release chemical agents only in extreme situations, and only after warnings. Agents have pointed guns at people who get in their way.

On Wednesday, Pritzker complained that ICE was causing “mayhem” and warned that other cities would face the same fate. In the Oval Office yesterday, Trump named San Francisco. He said, “We’re just at the start. We’re going to go into other cities.”

ASSAD’S ENFORCERS

No dictator rules alone. For two decades, and amid a 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead, the Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad relied on a network of henchmen to support his rule, writes Christiaan Triebert, a reporter on our Visual Investigations team.

These men tortured civilians. They built and used chemical weapons. They ran drugs that helped fund the government. They ordered the bombing of hospitals. And when the regime fell in December 2024, many of them simply vanished. My colleagues and I set out to uncover evidence of their alleged crimes and find out where they might be now — in Russia, for instance, or plotting revenge from Lebanon.

We chased down fragments of information — a photo of a lavish Damascus home posted to a neighborhood Facebook page, the name of a small village mentioned in a sanctions document, a phone number with a Russian country code discreetly shared with reporters — and added the normal journalistic legwork of reading legal filings, knocking on doors, calling people’s friends, family and co-workers. Read about how the officials got out, including the middle-of-the-night flight that carried many of them away.

This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education…opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

The term “287(g)” refers specifically to section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The law created a mechanism to facilitate collaboration between federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and local police.

These agreements allow state and local authorities to assume federal immigration control functions and were once rare—as of 2016, at the end of the Barack Obama administration, only 32 law enforcement agencies had active agreements. Today, more than 1,000 state and local agencies have signed on.

Some campus police departments are now also participating in the 287(g) program. This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education through local law enforcement, although still limited, opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

Campus Police in Florida Join ICE Program

Implementation of section 287(g) requires a memorandum of understanding between ICE and the interested agency, which must agree to training, federal oversight, and specific protocols.

A 287(g) agreement deputizes local agents to verify the immigration status of detained individuals, issue administrative detentions, and assist in deportation proceedings.

Immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies.

There are different models of application, including the Jail Enforcement Model, which operates within detention centers, and the Task Force Model, which enables local police to undertake specified ICE functions. Both have raised civil rights concerns due to their potential to encourage racial profiling and the criminalization of immigrant communities.

According to available information, Miami-based Florida International University’s campus police department applied to join the 287(g) program in April 2025 and executed an agreement on July 2. As of July 12, 13 universities in Florida have done the same, including the state’s flagship university, the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Mounting Internal Campus Resistance

Given the risk of surveillance on campus, exacerbated by 287(g) agreements, immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies in response.

“Right now, our anti-ICE efforts are pretty new,” said Kassandra Toussaint of Florida International University (FIU), when asked how students and the community have sought to raise awareness about the immigration enforcement role university police would play.

Toussaint, a political science undergraduate student and grassroots organizer at FIU, told NPQ, “Currently, we’re working with the ACLU of Florida for students to get training on being legal observers.”

The purpose of this ACLU-supported training is to ensure that students are equipped to legally observe and document an incident if they see someone being detained by ICE or campus police. Ideally, they can also help facilitate communication between the person being detained and their family.

Toussaint also noted that organizer training sessions are being offered to help students develop practical skills that effectively raise awareness about ICE and the impact of immigration enforcement on campus.

In September, FIU students and faculty gathered in front of the Graham Center, where the university’s President’s Council was meeting, to demand that the agreement not be implemented.

Similar demonstrations took place at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Students argued that the agreement transforms their campus into an environment of surveillance and suppression. Signs with phrases such as “No one should be afraid to learn” accompanied the protests, which were covered by media outlets such as Univision and Telemundo.

Faculty members have also expressed strong opposition to the implementation of these agreements, warning that they will erode trust in campus police and expose students to racial profiling. Immigration advocacy groups and legal experts, such as the ACLU of Florida, concur.

One effect of 287(g) agreements, the ACLU of Florida notes, is to discourage people from reporting crimes, as immigrant victims avoid contacting police out of fear that their immigration status might be questioned or revoked. Even legal residents and people holding valid international student visas still face the very real risk of arrest or deportation.

Tania Cepero López, an associate professor in the FIU English Department and president of the faculty union, told NPQ that building bridges with campus police and leaders to discourage cooperation with ICE can be valuable, even if authorities are initially resistant.

“We have made every effort to maintain consistent communication and collaboration with our chief of police, our students, and our faculty,” she said.

At a public rally in September, Cepero López told the student newspaper Panther NOW, “[The agreement is] creating safety issues on campus that are completely unnecessary. What we’re asking the FIU Police to do is withdraw from the ICE 287(g) agreement, and that the FIU Police does the work of FIU Police, and ICE agents can do the work of ICE agents—there’s no need to conflate the two.”

Thomas Kennedy, an Argentine immigrant graduate student at FIU and spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, emphasized that the agreements are voluntary, telling NPQ that Florida universities are free not to sign them.

“State law is actually quite clear—it only requires counties that operate jails or detention centers, like Miami-Dade or Broward, to sign this type of agreement. Other institutions, such as cities or universities, are not obliged to do so,” Kennedy explained.

An Opportunity Missed

Organizations such as the ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), and United We Dream have long documented the impacts of 287(g) agreements on immigrant communities and have publicly denounced the program’s contribution to racial profiling, the detention of people without criminal records, and the erosion of trust between residents and local authorities.

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice.

In June 2023, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 100 organizations—including the ACLU, NILC, and United We Dream—wrote a joint letter to then–Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, calling for all 287(g) agreements to be revoked. The letter noted that “the history of the program is riddled with unlawful forms of racial profiling and stereotyping.”

A year before that, in 2022, the ACLU published a report titled License to Abuse, detailing how the 287(g) program had empowered sheriffs with histories of racism and civil rights violations, becoming a tool for immigration persecution that undermined racial justice and community safety. The report noted that the ACLU had sought to end the 287(g) program for more than a decade due to “the racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and erosion of community trust that it spawned.”

Unfortunately, the Biden administration didn’t heed this call. Since Donald Trump’s inauguration as president in January 2025, the number of agencies participating in 287(g) agreements has increased sixfold.

The Struggle Continues

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice, but it also affects the quality of education.

As Cepero López emphasized, maintaining academic standards requires that students be safe on campus, free from fears tied to immigration status or documentation.

“We’re trying to communicate to our university that, in order to remain on a path of academic excellence, we must adopt policies that support our international students,” she said. “Policies that allow us to engage with the global community and maintain a safe learning environment.”",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Florida_University_ICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:03.153022

Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.
A record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households, lived in the United States in 2023.
Little Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s.
PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.","In Chicago’s Little Village, the Trump administration’s sweeping deportation push has paralyzed the economy.

Business owners in Little Village, which is 81% Hispanic, said customers are too frightened to walk the streets of Chicago’s second busiest commercial corridor. Sales have plunged, employees are staying home, and stores have temporarily closed since the administration’s deportation push in Chicago began on September 8. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The economic fallout from deportations is typically focused on the impact to industries with large unauthorized immigrant workforces, such as construction and agriculture. But undocumented immigrants aren’t just people who simply go to work each day. They’re consumers, too. They spent roughly $300 billion in 2023, buying goods and services that power the economy.

“It’s killing business,” said Mike Moreno, the owner of Moreno’s liquor store and speakeasy bar. His father opened the store in Little Village in the 1970s, and it was the first Latino-owned liquor store in Illinois.

He said sales have dropped 60% since September. Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.

“They’re going up and down the streets around in loops to scare us,” he said. “I never thought in a million years I’d see something like this.”

Marcela Rodriguez, a franchise operator of Los Mangos, a small Mexican-style ice cream chain, said “people are not stepping outside. Kids are not going to school. It’s unbelievable.”

Her business “just completely went downhill” beginning in September, and several fearful employees changed their schedules to prepare food when the store is locked and closed to customers.

Ice cream sales now correlate with how visible immigration agents are in the neighborhood, she said.

“On quiet days with not a lot of detainments, we see an uptick in customers.”

‘Economic lifeline’

The Trump administration said last month it’s on track to deport 600,000 unauthorized immigrants this year.

But that push is hurting businesses and local economies that rely on immigrants, both legal and undocumented, who buy everything from food to cars to homes.

A record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households, lived in the United States in 2023. Twenty-six million people live in a household with at least one person who lacks legal status.

Not only does this group spend hundreds of billions annually, they also paid more than $90 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2024, helping fund social services and programs like Social Security. Sales, property, business and other taxes they paid help prop up municipal and state budgets.

That’s why a slowdown in Little Village threatens to have a spillover effect on Chicago. The city may see lower tax revenues from retail sales, as well as store closures, reduced orders along the supply chain, and a hit to the real estate market, said Teresa Córdova, the director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Little Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. They helped stabilize the neighborhood, which had emptied out as Chicago lost manufacturing jobs and people left for the suburbs.

“Were it not for Latinos in Chicago, we would not be able to revitalize like we did,” Córdova said.

A similar story of immigrants reviving areas in decline played out in many northern industrial cities during the mid-twentieth century and later in the South, said A. K. Sandoval-Strausz, a history professor at Penn State University and author of the book “Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City.”

“The influx of immigrants to these neighborhoods has been an economic lifeline,” he said.

But White House spokesperson Kush Desai called looking at how much unauthorized immigrants spend and pay in taxes in isolation an “idiotic exercise” because “the costs that Americans pay due to illegal immigration are incalculable: crime, strained healthcare systems, inflated real estate costs, and schools being overburdened with costly ESL students.”

The White House pointed to research from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration levels, that said American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to cover costs for unauthorized immigrants.

Mazola corn oil and subprime car loans

Immigrants and families unsure of their future in the United States are sending more money to their home countries — remittances to many Latin American countries are seeing double-digit increases — and they’re tightening their wallets.

TD Bank estimated that undocumented workers who are spending less will subtract 0.7 percentage points from consumer spending growth this year.

When Tricolor, a subprime auto lender primarily for unauthorized immigrants in the Southwest, filed for bankruptcy last month, analysts said it was a sign of the pressure on the economy catering to undocumented immigrants.

Major food brands and retailers are also noticing an impact.

PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.

Sales of Mazola corn oil have dropped among Hispanic consumers in the South, parent company Associated British Foods said last month on an earnings call.

“We have a very large share of Hispanic consumers in Mazola, and there’s a lot of fear in that community,” CEO George Weston said. “We really hope that that’s temporary for all sorts of reasons.”

But the administration is ramping up its detention capabilities to reach its goal of one million deportations a year, and Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act triples the budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The further the Trump administration goes, the larger the blow will be to consumer spending, employment and taxes that boost cities and states, said Eric Rodriguez, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights group. Mass deportations have been found to reduce employment and wages for native-born citizens, too.

“There’s no sign that what we’re seeing right now is going to stop or de-escalate,” he said. “As the government builds up mass deportations, the economic effects will be greater.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2233925342.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 12:03:13.309876

CHICAGO — If there is one thing to draw hope from amid the descent of federal agents into Chicago over the past month, it’s how Chicagoans far and wide are showing up in support of one another.

Across the city, neighbors are stepping up to help kids get to school safely, picking up groceries for families who fear leaving their homes and raising money to support street vendors and others whose livelihoods have been threatened by the swarm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement patrols.

While it remains unknown how long the increased ICE presence will last — Russell Hott, ICE’s field director in Chicago, told Block Club last week that there was no planned end date — the effect of people showing up for one another will continue to reverberate for just as long, neighbors and organizers said.

Here are a few ways neighbors are supporting their communities — and how you can help, too.

Blowing The Whistle

Residents are equipping themselves with whistles by the thousands, readying neighbors to alert one another if they see ICE agents nearby.

The Little Village Community Council began handing out bright orange whistles during “know your rights” workshops in June, after getting the idea from Los Angeles residents who were reacting to their own city’s immigration raids earlier this year.

“We had the idea of coming out with a whistle so people could hear that noise, and if they don’t have legal status, go the other way — run as quickly as possible to safety and to make sure they don’t open their doors,” said Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council.

Since then, the idea has spread to other neighborhoods as well; Ravenswood Community Services gathered volunteers Monday evening to assemble 600 whistle kits to pass out to parents and students. Pilsen Arts & Community House has a tutorial how to publish and distribute its one-page whistle zine, which is available along with other printable resources online, and has been handing out whistle kits to local businesses to distribute.

Belmont Cragin United distributed 5,000 whistles at a recent event and is looking to hand out more than 12,000 by the end of October, said organizer Alonso Zaragoza. The organization recently launched Whistlemania, where volunteers assemble and distribute whistle kits across multiple Northwest Side neighborhoods. Each packet includes information on recognizing federal agents and advice from the ACLU, as well as a whistle to alert others in emergencies or during ICE encounters.

Street Vendor Support

The familiar jingle of bells from a paletas cart or a roadside offering of produce have become rarer as Chicago street vendors stay home to protect themselves from ICE.

Vendors around Chicago — from Laura Murillo of Laura’s Tamales to a tamalera in Rogers Park — have been arrested by immigration agents over the past month. In late September, neighbors and organizers pledged they would keep Murillo’s Back of the Yards stand going to support her daughters.

In a matter of weeks, the Street Vendors Association of Chicago has raised $184,000 of its $300,000 goal to provide emergency support to street vendors who are too fearful of ICE raids to go out and sell their wares.

Through her nonprofit organization The Mural Movement, Delilah Martinez launched Operation Buyout, where she and other organizers are “buying out” a vendor’s supply — giving them $500 to $1,000 along with groceries and other necessities. Since July, Operation Buyout has supported Matello’s Bakery in Pilsen, a neighborhood paleta seller, and a woman who sells chocolate in Pilsen.

How you can help: Donate to the Chicago Street Vendor Relief Fund (donations to the nonprofit organization are tax deductible); grab your bike and join CyclingxSolidarity for the Saturday’s Street Vendor Bike Tour in Little Village; attend the Kafecito with Kathy fundraiser Sunday at Latina-owned Tasa Coffee Roasters, 4136 W. North Ave. in Humboldt Park; Donate to Operation Buyout on Venmo (@TheMuralMovement), CashApp ($VaultGallerie) or Zelle or QuickPay (delilah@themuralmovement.org).

Grocery Runs

Monica Gutierrez has called Pilsen home for the majority of her life, but she’s never seen the streets of her neighborhood this empty. It’s disheartening to see the fear, violence and disrespect her community is facing, said Gutierrez, who was raised in an immigrant household.

“ICE is everywhere and doesn’t even allow us a second to breathe or to get where we need,” she said.

When Gutierrez came across Sin Título’s Neighbor to Neighbor program a few weeks ago, she jumped at the opportunity. As a volunteer, Gutierrez goes on grocery runs for community members who are afraid to leave their homes to get the basic necessities.

Sin Título co-founder Iraís Sosa started the program in hopes of creating “more moments of peace” amid the chaos.

But Sosa didn’t anticipate that 100 people would sign up within the first couple hours of opening the volunteer application. Now almost 400 people have applied, Sosa said. It was a “good problem” to have and she quickly figured out a system. The program has been capped at 200 volunteers across the Chicago area to keep it manageable.

After seeing a raid at a bus stop, Sosa also started offering Lyft gift cards for those who don’t feel safe commuting using public transportation.

Applications to receive help or nominate a loved one are still open and available in English and Spanish, Sosa said. Recipients are paired up with a volunteer and can get groceries on a recurring basis as long as funds are available. They have measures in place to ensure privacy, like confirming addresses verbally over the phone as opposed to text or email, she said.

How you can help: While Sin Título isn’t taking more volunteers right now, it is still accepting donations. They’ve raised more than $11,000 since launching the program to cover the cost of groceries and Lyft gift cards.

Cleansing Charity

Cristina Puzio is a curandera — a folk healer — born and raised in Pilsen. After seeing news of Funston Elementary being tear-gassed by federal agents in Logan Square in early October, she felt a need to do something that would honor her community and her culture.

Inheriting practices that were passed down to her from ancestors and mentors, she reached out to Evelyn Medina, owner of the Logan Square gift shop Espacio 3628, to offer “limpias” to the community.

As Puzio puts it, a limpia is a way of cleansing a person’s energy. By removing a person’s negative energies, she hopes to help them let go of burdens they carry.

“Whatever we’re carrying, whether it’s an emotion, a fear, worry,” she said. “If we don’t know how to process it, it can linger, and it can start to affect us on a deeper level.”

The specific limpia she offers is for those living with shock and fear — particularly resonant during the heightened ICE activity. Incorporating obsidian, epazote, basil, Copal, lemons and sacred waters, the ritual lasts for 10 minutes.

Cristina will continue to collaborate with Espacio 3628 and provide limpias to Logan Square residents and surrounding communities — the next event is set for Tuesday.

How you can help: Attend the next limpias fundraiser at the Logan Square shop, 3628 W. Armitage Ave., from 2:30-6 p.m. Tuesday. Espacio 3628 is also accepting donations to continue handing out whistles and Know Your Rights cards, and organizing watch patrols during neighborhood school drop-offs and pickups.

School Safety

In Belmont Cragin, school attendance has dropped by as much as 10 percent as families worry that ICE agents will show up during drop-off and pickup, said Alonso Zaragoza, who serves on a Local School Council along with his work with Belmont Cragin United.

A new “walking school bus” program aims to provide a sense of security for families as they go to and from school, Zaragoza said. Seven or eight volunteers will position themselves along school routes, mirroring Safe Passage routes established by Chicago Public Schools. Similar corner watches have launched in Irving Park and Albany Park on the Northwest Side, as well.

“It’s about having bodies out around the school, keeping an eye out and making sure everybody’s safe,” Zaragoza said. “So that the kids who haven’t been going to school in the last couple weeks feel comfortable enough to come back and finish their education.”

After early challenges, the community-led effort is gaining traction as educators and parents work together. “Now the pieces of organizing are starting to fall into place,” Zaragoza said. “Everybody’s clicking together.”

To maintain a sense of community and safety, Belmont Cragin United is continuing with events like its seventh annual “Trunk or Treat,” while also training neighbors through the Rapid Response Network to verify reports of ICE presence. He said the effort is about accuracy and care, as the group doesn’t publish anything unverified and works to keep neighbors informed.

He emphasized that all of this work is entirely community-led. “There’s no taxpayer money being involved in this. No elected official has offered to pay for this,” he said. “People need to be informed.”

How you can help: Volunteer with the Belmont Cragin United Rapid Response Network to help verify ICE activity and distribute know your rights materials; donate safety whistles, candy, or printing materials for the upcoming Trunk or Treat community event.

Turning Art Into Action

As reports of ICE raids began spreading through Chicago’s Latino neighborhoods, photographer Mari Trancoso said she felt a growing urgency to help.

“I just keep feeling this burn in my chest,” she said. “Like this angry cry wants to come out, and I just feel like I’m not doing what I need to do.”

Trancoso lives about 1½ hours west of Chicago in Dixon, but she has been photographing weddings and families across Chicago for nearly a decade.

Using her photography business and online following, she created a fundraising campaign called Art as an Offering. Proceeds from mentoring sessions, photo editing customizations known as presets and educational PDFs were given to five Chicago organizations: Instituto del Progreso Latino, ICIRR, Pilsen Food Pantry, Street Vendors Association of Chicago, and Sin Título.

“I wanted to offer something reachable for other people, not just photographers,” she said. Lower-priced resources, starting at $15, were designed to make donating accessible, and clients booking future photo sessions with Trancoso can also opt to have part of their payment directed toward the groups.

Though she has mostly used her platform for awareness in the past, this effort feels more personal — and more urgent — than before. “My family is from Mexico — my grandma is from Zacatecas, and I have cousins who are not white-passing, and are in fear,” she said. “I felt like I had this privilege that I could do more things since I don’t have that same fear as they do.”

For others who want to help, Trancoso encourages using social media to share verified information or volunteering for organizations already embedded in neighborhoods. She cited Sin Titulo as an example, noting that “even simple things like running errands for Latino families who are too scared to go out in public are very valuable.”

Wallet Warriors

Pilsen streets have been emptier than usual, and Becky Lehmann took note during a recent visit to the neighborhood. At times, she was the only customer at some of the businesses she stepped in, she said.

Lehmann, who lives in Edgewater, wanted to help, so she posted an Instagram video calling on people to support the businesses in Hispanic neighborhoods still reeling from the increased ICE presence.

“When I boil it all down, it’s just what I can do to be kind,” she said.

In the video, Lehmann encourages people to pick a neighborhood that they know is being targeted and go and contribute to the local businesses that are hurting. If they see something happening, they can record and share.

She frames it as something anyone can do. “Resistance doesn’t have to be big and noisy,” she says in the video. “It can be walking into a shop and buying a cat figurine from a neighbor.”

Others have also made the call for Chicagoans to support immigrant-owned businesses. The Hermosa Belmont Cragin Chamber of Commerce shared a list of neighborhood businesses to support. Lost Girls Vintage put out a call for commenters to share their favorite South and West side businesses. Zaragoza said Belmont Cragin has been slowly recovering from the pandemic, rebuilding its business community. But the ICE raids have caused renewed fear and kept many from dining out or even leaving their homes, he said.

“The dining scene in our neighborhoods has been decimated because of it,” he said. The neighborhood will host a Taste of Belmont Cragin event Oct. 28, with a route through four restaurants and participating street vendors.

How you can help: Many neighborhoods have chambers of commerce listing local businesses to help you plan your visit. You can also sign up by Oct. 24 to participate in the Nov. 8 Abuelita Hot Chocolate 5K Walk/Run in Riis Park in Belmont Cragin on Nov. 8 — money raised will go toward neighborhood businesses.

Detaining residents outside court has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July. Representatives said they’ve seen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations. It also has drawn lawsuits from some states and the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Asked about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done, because what’s happening with these ICE agents and courthouses and territories around courthouses is unacceptable,” Welch said. “People are afraid to go to court. They’re afraid to comply with subpoenas. We can’t allow that. These should be safe spaces.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed street chase on Chicago’s South Side.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events citywide and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three detained recently.",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2024/09/generic-legal-image-gavel-and-books-dark-brown.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:57.483053

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.","A 39-year-old man died in hospital alone, miles from his family, after being detained by US immigration officials.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, who had lived in the US since he was four, fell ill while in an immigration detention centre in California.

He complained of a fever and had a persistent cough in the weeks before he died, according to his mother Lucia.

She said he was initially treated by medical staff inside the detention centre but was returned to his cell.

He was eventually taken to hospital for a scheduled surgery to remove an abscess on his buttocks, but died before he was able to have the operation.

His family were never told he was in hospital, learning of his death via a knock on the door from police.

""They're the ones that notified us that he had passed,"" his brother, Jose Ayala, told Sky News.

""We were not even aware that he was in the hospital or even had a scheduled surgery. Then we got a knock on our door a little after 5.30 one morning.

""I believe he would still be alive today if he was never detained. He got sick while in detention, and they did not seem to take care of him.""

Why was he detained?

Mr Ayala-Uribe's death raises questions about the conditions inside the centre he was held in, and if a sudden surge of immigrants being detained by this administration has left the system stretched beyond breaking point.

He had moved to the US from Mexico with his family as a child.

He did have DACA - deferred action for childhood arrivals - status, granted to those who have arrived while under the age of 18. But this was removed in 2016, after he was convicted of drink-driving.

In August, he was arrested by immigration agents at a car wash in California where he had worked for 15 years.

He was held for five weeks at Adelanto, a privately owned, run-for-profit, immigrant detention centre. A lawyer for his family said he was, as far as they are aware, a healthy man before he was detained and had no medical need.

But Mr Ayala-Uribe's mother, who was visiting him every eight days and speaking to him on the phone a couple of times a day, said she noticed him getting progressively unwell.

""He started with lots of fever,"" Ms Ayala said. ""He said they weren't listening to him. The last time I saw him his face was drained, he told me he was not OK, he told me he couldn't take it any more.""

Beginning to cry, wiping away tears, she added: ""I feel powerless that I couldn't do anything to help my son.

""I never imagined I was going to bury one of my sons. It feels terrible, they took a piece of my heart away.

""I would like something to change. If we cannot save him, at least we can save others that are still inside.""

ICE defends detention treatment

The cause of Mr Ayala-Uribe's death is still under investigation.

Sky News requested comment from the company which owns the detention centre where he was held, and they deferred to ICE, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency.

In a statement, ICE said: ""Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.

""At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergency care.""

The Trump administration says it's targeting criminals and people in the US illegally. But campaigners say Mr Ayala-Uribe's death should not be viewed in isolation.

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.

Democrat senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote a letter to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, asking for more information about these deaths.

The senators claimed 10 people had died between January and June, and that it was the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

Sarah Houston, a lawyer for the Immigrant Defenders Law Centre, claims immigrants are being mistreated in custody.

""This administration's main goal is to harm, to torture individuals and to try to force them out,"" she said.

""The great increase we see in human rights abuses, in deaths, is a direct result of the administration's decision to pack these detention centres as much as they can.""

Mr Ayala-Uribe's funeral was held this week. Dozens of extended family and friends wore t-shirts bearing his face. A mariachi band played as his casket was lowered into the ground and his mother heaved with sobs.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a sequel of sorts: The new video — also paid for with American tax dollars and also featuring Noem in a starring role — was designed to run in domestic airports. But instead of focusing on immigration, this clip blames congressional Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown.

Almost immediately, the DHS secretary confronted a problem she should’ve seen coming: Airport administrators said they wouldn’t show Noem’s partisan video to air travelers. The list of airports refusing to go along with the Republican’s plan continues to grow. The Associated Press reported:

Airports big and small around the country are refusing to play a video with a message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on Transportation Security Administration operations. Airports in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix, Seattle and more say the video’s political content goes against their policies or regulations prohibiting political messaging in their facilities.

In fact, there are dozens of airports of various sizes in the state of New York, and according to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, Noem’s video has been “banned” from all of them.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, this week demanded an investigation into Noem’s use of public resources to create and promote a partisan video.

In a letter to acting special counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell wrote, “When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem’s video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration’s political opponents, convince Americans to blame ‘Democrats in Congress’ for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives.”

It’s easy to imagine a hypothetical video in which a homeland security secretary offers the public worthwhile information about how the shutdown might affect air travelers. That sort of message might actually help the public at a difficult time.

But Noem apparently didn’t want that. Rather, she used taxpayer money to make what amounts to a propagandistic attack ad — that a growing number of airports are rejecting anyway.

The Office of Special Counsel, which is an independent watchdog agency responsible for investigating ethical lapses like these, has not yet said whether it will examine the DHS video.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law.
Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

WASHINGTON — United We Dream (UWD), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Abundant Futures Fund (AFF), have joined forces to launch the Defending Our Neighbors Fund: a bold new initiative that will scale up crucial financial support to legal organizations all across the country. Housed within AFF, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund will help ensure immigrant families facing the threat of separation and wrongful detention and deportations have access to lawyers.

Already, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has raised over $10 million with the goal of raising a total of at least $30 million in emergency response funding. With more than 11 million U.S. citizens living in households with an undocumented family member, countless American families face imminent risk of being torn apart. Many are forced to navigate a complex and punishing system alone, without access to legal counsel. Even young children, the most vulnerable members of our communities, are facing trained prosecutors without anyone by their side. Access to legal support is a vital lifeline for families facing the threat of being separated from their loved ones.

By surging much-needed financial support to trusted organizations already providing legal assistance to communities in need, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund helps protect everyone’s right to due process, ensure families can stay together, and increase access to high-quality legal representation and, when possible, bond assistance.

Greisa Martinez Rosas, Executive Director of United We Dream, said:

“When I was 17, my father was deported and my family separated forever. That loss isn’t just personal — it is systemic and intentional, with thousands of people rendered vulnerable to mass deportation and family separation with zero access to the legal representation they deserve. I’ve spent every day since organizing and building our community’s collective power so we can protect the future of millions of American families that, just like my own, face the threat of separation.

""The Defending Our Neighbors Fund is about more than fighting for legal representation — it’s a vehicle for everyday people to move from empathy to action, from charity to solidarity in defense of their immigrant neighbors. This Fund is an opportunity for neighbors to stand with neighbors in fighting for a democracy that protects all of us.

""Together, we must invest in the infrastructure of justice - collective power, collective care and legal support. We invite everyone — philanthropists, organizers, and all our neighbors— to build with us. Donate to the Defend our Neighbors Fund.”

Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU, said:

“Deportations without due process, unjust detention, and family separation are attacks on bedrock Constitutional rights and all of our communities. The current moment calls for bold, innovative solutions to meet the most urgent needs of our immigrant neighbors and loved ones, and the Defending Our Neighbors Fund is doing just that. The Fund is the antidote to these harmful attacks, and now more than ever, we, the people, must take action to fight back.”

Chiqui Sanchez Kennedy, Executive Director of the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project (GHIRP), said:

“In March, we faced a comprehensive attack on immigrant children when legal lifelines were eliminated. In a single week, the government abruptly shut down funding for lawyers for unaccompanied children and placed children on “rocket dockets” where toddlers to pre-teens were forced to appear alone in court on an unprecedented, expedited timeline. With no notice, we were forced to halt representation for hundreds of children who depend on our advocacy. We were faced with the impossible choice of continuing to represent our clients without funding or abruptly withdrawing representation, leaving our clients vulnerable to further harm, exploitation and trafficking. Funding from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund was a lifeline for our clients, our staff, and the organization. It enabled us to find a path forward which included meeting the needs of our young clients and upholding our ethical duties as lawyers.”

Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Américas Immigrant Advocacy Center:

“As hostility towards immigration groups continues, Las Américas lost major funding and faced difficult layoffs. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund arrived at a critical moment. It helped us avoid deeper cuts, keep experienced staff on board, and respond quickly to urgent cases, including access to people detailed at new sites like Camp East Montana at Ft. Bliss.

""This funding came at a moment when everything felt uncertain. It meant we could keep showing up for people in detention, for families navigating impossible systems, and for a community that depends on us. In this environment, staying open isn’t guaranteed. Support like this lets us keep the doors open when our community needs us most.”

Mary Meg McCarthy, Executive Director of the National Immigrant Justice Center:

""The National Immigrant Justice Center has fought to continue providing life-saving legal services since this year's termination of federal programs that reached some of the most vulnerable people in the immigration system, including children who came to the United States alone to seek refuge. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has been critical to ensure NIJC can still provide counsel for immigrants who face a growing threat of being disappeared into the detention system and removed from the country without due process. In this midst of widespread family separations, the need for new funding streams for legal services is more urgent than ever.""

Throughout my reporting, I — like many journalists in the midst of an intense and complex story — wondered: Was I accurately capturing the facts? I knew that the people around Trump often justified working in his administration by saying they would serve as guardrails against his most extreme impulses, but how could I know for sure that these checks on his power were actually the force holding him back?

I had those doubts because we, as reporters, very rarely get to see the counterfactual, to test our reporting by witnessing how the world would play out if the circumstances were different.

But Trump’s second term has given us that unique opportunity.

The people who sought to restrain the president back then, like his former chief of staff John Kelly and his White House counsel Donald McGahn II, are gone, and so are the hypotheticals. We are now seeing how a truly unshackled Trump uses his power.

Nine months into Trump’s second term, he has done several things he was stopped from doing during his first term. He has exerted more direct pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges, apparently spurring prosecutors to secure an indictment against at least one target who eluded him during his first term. And he has greatly expanded presidential powers, including by deploying the military on domestic soil in more sweeping ways than he did during his first term.

In tonight’s newsletter, I’ll explain what Trump’s second term has taught us about his first: The guardrails worked, up to a point. (See: Jan 6.)

And many of the stark warnings about what would happen without them — which were issued loudly during the presidential campaign by the very people who had once sought to restrain the president — have proved true.

An eye on the Justice Department

As early as 2017, Trump tried to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute his rivals, like Hillary Clinton. But Sessions and top administration aides managed to distract Trump for months. Sessions held onto his job for nearly two years, and no charges were brought against Clinton.

At the time, Trump himself was under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller III for obstructing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump complained endlessly about why his own Justice Department was investigating him, casting a cloud over his presidency, without looking into his perceived enemies.

As the pressure built on Trump, he became more fixated on the idea of not only prosecuting his rivals, including the former F.B.I. director James Comey, but siccing the I.R.S. on them.

Repeatedly, Kelly and McGahn managed to stop Trump. They refused to order the Justice Department to investigate his rivals, telling him that what he wanted to do was potentially illegal. McGahn even wrote Trump an extraordinary memo in which he warned him that he could be defeated at the ballot box — or impeached — if he tried to meddle in prosecutions.

The Justice Department’s prosecutorial decisions remained insulated from the president. While many of his perceived enemies came under investigation, none were ever charged. This left Trump angry, convinced that his aides and political appointees had wrongly constrained him.

Trump’s allies pledged that if he ever returned to the White House, he would not have guardrails like Kelly around to try to stop him.

During the 2024 campaign, Kelly, other top generals who worked for Trump and other former aides issued a series of stark warnings. They said that not only would Trump follow through on prosecuting his rivals but he would use the military domestically on Americans. And, they said, Trump would use his power in audacious and potentially illegal ways to achieve his political goals and erode the independence of bedrock institutions of American democracy.

Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, echoed those warnings on the campaign trail.

Republicans pooh-poohed the warnings, saying that the former officials were just castoffs suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

An expansion of power

Since returning to office, Trump has largely done exactly what Kelly and the former aides warned he would. He has engaged in an aggressive retribution campaign. He has pierced the Justice Department’s prosecutorial decision-making process by publicly and privately telling Attorney General Pam Bondi — including in an apparently accidentally sent private message on Truth Social — whom to charge, including Comey.

Bondi’s department charged Comey five days later, shortly after pushing out a prosecutor who had raised concerns about a potential case against Comey. An indictment against the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, a Democrat who sued Trump for fraud, followed soon after.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to several American cities run by Democratic mayors over their objections. He has dismantled large parts of the federal bureaucracy and work force, challenging Congress’s control over spending. And his administration’s responses to some high-profile court rulings related to immigration issues have raised questions about whether they are following judges’ orders.

For this piece, I reached out to Kelly to see if he would talk about how his warnings lined up with the way Trump has governed. But Kelly declined to comment. Since Trump won, he has said little publicly, believing he already warned the country and there is nothing left for him to say.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.
Last month, investigators said a shooter targeted ICE officers at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and injuring another.

For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust.","A masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent grabbed Monica Moreta-Galarza’s hair as she clung to her husband, pleading with the agents who were detaining him. She was wrestled away from him as her crying children were held back by other agents.

Moreta-Galarza was taken to a nearby room for an unknown period before she was seen in videos captured by onlookers in the hallway of an immigration courthouse in Manhattan in late September, telling a different federal agent in Spanish: “You guys don’t care about anything!”

The agent, wearing a flannel shirt and baseball cap, replies, “Adios, adios,” as he grabs the mother and forces her several feet down the hallway, shoving her into the wall before pushing her to the ground.

Moreta-Galarza was rushed to the hospital for possible head trauma.

Her experience is a snapshot of an array of incidents nationwide caught on camera by bystanders, revealing heavy-handed tactics by federal agents since President Donald Trump took office in January, experts told CNN. Videos over the months have shown ICE agents wearing face coverings and plainclothes, driving unmarked cars and swarming worksites and streets during their deportation operations. Tensions flared again in Chicago this week when an immigration operation resulted in a crash, bringing anger from residents and tear gas.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches,” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

Echoing past statements DHS has made after many of the incidents, the agency said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and agents are facing a surge in attacks against them. Last month, investigators said a shooter targeted ICE officers at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and injuring another.

ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.

Pressures to meet deportation goals are fueling aggressive tactics, experts say

Former Homeland Security officials and immigration experts argue the aggressive tactics are a result of the immense pressure on immigration agents to ramp up arrests of undocumented immigrants as the administration tries to meet its deportation goals. Historically, the agencies charged with those arrests, like ICE, have been strained, making White House-imposed goals more difficult to meet. The administration says it’s a whole government effort.

Officers from other federal agencies, such as the FBI and CBP, the agency responsible for border security, have also been pulled into immigration enforcement efforts, flooding the streets of blue cities such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC and Chicago.

Law enforcement sources told CNN the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed from immigration agents in recent months have led to confrontations between DHS and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.

John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, said the tactics are not aimed at fighting criminality – they’re designed to increase overall arrests.

“You don’t arrest people in immigration court … who are on stays of removal unless you’re looking for cheap, fast and easy arrests,” said Sandweg, who remains in contact with current ICE and DHS personnel.

In cases like Moreta-Galarza’s, a good agent can still carry out their mission while treating people with “dignity and respect,” said Sandweg.

“Of course she’s going to have that reaction,” he said, “you just arrested her husband and the father of her children … maybe not to be seen in this country ever again.”

While DHS has largely doubled down on its defense of the tactics ICE agents have been using in many of the incidents captured on video, the agency condemned the actions of the agent who shoved Moreta-Galarza and “relieved him of his current duties,” calling his actions “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE.”

It’s unclear whether the officer is still employed by ICE. The agency did not respond to CNN’s questions about disciplinary actions against the officer, his current status or his name.

ICE and CBP resources freed up after drop in border crossings

Illegal border crossings reached “all-time lows” in July, DHS said, which allowed resources at ICE and CBP to be freed up, according to Sandweg. ICE has also referenced the steep decline in border crossings as a reason its agents are now “focused on the core mission.”

ICE is slated to receive a landmark $75 billion in federal funds through 2029 from the president’s sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents, CNN has reported.

The surge in agency resources comes at a time when ICE is aggressively trying to recruit more agents. This could make even more agents available, as they were previously tied up dealing with border cases or spending hours, sometimes days, pursuing one arrest and quietly working with local authorities to target “truly the worst of the worst,” said Sandweg.

Over the past decade, Sandweg said enhanced border activity and asylum claims were “an incredible strain on ICE resources,” as agents had their hands full with taking people into custody, processing, supervising and removing many of the migrants who were apprehended at the border.

Now, ICE and CBP resources are more available to bolster non-border operations, Sandweg said.

Both agencies have been involved in large-scale deportation efforts unfolding in areas previously protected from immigration enforcement, such as schools, churches and courthouses, which hinge on the Trump administration’s decision to roll back a 2011 policy preventing immigration enforcement in sensitive areas.

None of those operations would be possible, according to Sandweg, if border crossings hadn’t fallen drastically since last summer when former President Joe Biden issued an executive action barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a threshold of average daily crossings is met.

Trump officials have said the differing tactics stem from so-called “sanctuary policies” that have been around since the 1980s in many Democratic-controlled areas that limit prisons and jails from cooperating with ICE, so immigration arrests take place in the community rather than at a detention facility.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly cited sanctuary policies as disruptive to immigration enforcement – and threatened to have an increased presence in those cities. Homan, a veteran of immigration law enforcement, also served under the Obama administration.

Most detained immigrants don’t have serious criminal convictions, data shows

As the second Trump administration shifts how ICE has traditionally operated, Sandweg says the range of ICE’s tactics aimed at hiking up arrests and driving migrants to self-deport is working to build an agency “designed to amp up immigration enforcement to levels we’ve never seen in this country.”

While DHS did not specifically address CNN’s request for comment about whether its tactics are designed to maximize arrests, the agency said in its statement it was targeting violent criminals, including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists.

Federal data reveals most immigrants taken into custody don’t have serious criminal convictions, according to a report by CNN Investigates. More than 75% of people booked into ICE custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, according to ICE records from October through the end of May.

ICE has launched large-scale raids at worksites like Home Depot parking lots in various cities and the Hyundai Metaplant in a small southeast Georgia community last month – assisted by CBP and other federal and state agencies. Nearly 500 people, mostly Korean nationals, who worked at the manufacturing plant were arrested on suspicions they were living and working illegally in the US.

Undocumented people who have not been convicted of any crime and have been arrested in raids like the one at Hyundai have become “collateral” in the larger mission to fight criminality, says Jerry Robinette, former ICE Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge during the Obama administration who also worked for the agency under President George W. Bush.

These people get caught when an officer checks their status and discovers they’re in the country illegally, which is a civil – not criminal – offense, he added.

“As much as they want to target the worst of the worst, you look at who you end up arresting. You’re not being as successful as you would like,” Robinette said. “You are getting a lot of collateral.”

More extensive immigration raids, like the one at Hyundai, are coming, Trump’s border czar told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union: “The short answer is yes, we’re going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan replied.

Protests over immigration actions escalate into clashes

Children and adults were pulled from their homes as federal agents raided an apartment complex in Chicago last month, arresting 37 undocumented immigrants in another recent, large-scale raid.

DHS said gang members and violent criminals were among those arrested, the agency said in its statement.

It’s just one example that shows the tactics fueling protests for weeks outside the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear protesters, putting tensions on full display.

Protests at the site this month again turned into heated clashes between protesters and armed agents from CBP and ICE, leading to at least 18 arrests, including five who were charged with aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction.

In the Chicago apartment raid, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is investigating claims children were separated from their parents and “zip-tied,” as well as elderly people who were detained for three hours, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN’s Jake Tapper.

DHS rejected Pritzker’s claims in a news release, saying children were never zip-tied in the raid and added the agency has “routinely debunked the absurd claim” that it’s targeting US citizens.

The type of aggression from federal agents the public is witnessing in many of these recent incidents has some similarities to the 1950s-era federal program aimed at mass deportations, known as “Operation Wetback” under then-President Dwight Eisenhower, according to Jean Reisz, co-director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic.

The Trump administration is echoing rhetoric from that era, referring to immigrants “as being ‘the worst of the worst,’ as being dangerous, as being invaders,” Reisz said, which empowers agents in the streets to “use aggression toward those who could be viewed as resisting.”

The public fury this year over how ICE is operating is rooted in how the Trump administration is pushing the boundaries of various individual rights — such as birthright citizenship — that have been protected for over 60 years, Reisz said. Just last month, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the president’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.

DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about the comparison with the 1950s-era federal program.

This summer, tensions reached a tipping point during weeks of protests in Los Angeles after a wave of detentions in the city, when protesters’ confrontations with local police and federal officers escalated into violent clashes that prompted a controversial, federal deployment of National Guard troops. Federal agents used flash-bangs and tear gas to disperse crowds, with some hitting demonstrators, as well as protesters setting fire to self-driving cars.

Robinette said the “optics” of the tactics federal immigration agents have been using are “not good for us as an agency,” but they are a result of officers having to follow orders from top administration officials and confrontations with people resisting as they execute the orders.

The political pressures on ICE have caused “a lot of headaches” as it deals with protesters who don’t just have issues with the agency but are also driven by political grievances related to the Trump administration, Robinette said. “The job is getting difficult.”

The sweeping raids have instilled a “persistent mental anxiety” within the immigrant community when encountering local police or National Guard troops who might report them to federal immigration officers, said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock with the National Immigration Law Center.

“Even if you’ve got your papers, even though you’re a US citizen, you kind of have to check over your shoulder and that’s having a pretty negative impact on people mentally,” Whitlock said. “And then that translates to a fear or flight response that happens when you do encounter them.”

Officer anonymization fuels public mistrust

Scenes from some of the incidents captured on video in recent months have shown federal agents wearing masks or plainclothes while arresting people — something they have historically done only while performing undercover work or arresting some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, experts say.

In Los Angeles, masked agents were seen yanking a Colombian immigrant out of her vehicle and detaining her on the ground. In Washington, DC, video showed masked federal agents struggling to arrest a man before he appears to be tased and subdued on the pavement. In Massachusetts, Turkish national and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk was physically restrained by six plainclothes officers, most of whom were wearing face coverings.

There is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said federal officers are covering up to protect their families after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.

“I am sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, and their family on the line, because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is,” Lyons said.

But there is a risk of escalating encounters when people can’t identify them as federal agents, said Jeffrey Swartz, a Cooley Law School professor and former prosecutor and judge.

“We’ve never tolerated people who are engaged in law enforcement, who keep who they are and their identification secret from the people who might have complaints about the way they’re being treated,” said Swartz. “Police officers have always identified themselves.”

DHS said the “vilification” of ICE “must stop,” claiming its agents are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since Trump took office in January. ICE noted “criminal illegal aliens” have targeted its federal agents in the past.

A review of federal court records by Colorado Public Radio, however, revealed a 25% increase in people facing charges for assault against federal officers through mid-September, as compared to the same period last year.

When asked by CNN whether ICE is giving any directives for its agents to wear face coverings, DHS said: “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves and their families from being targeted” by gangs, murderers, rapists and other violent criminals.

Strong federal presence in cities impacts public ‘psyche’

The Trump administration is on pace to deport nearly 600,000 people by the end of Trump’s first year of his second term, DHS said late last month. It is not clear what the breakdown of deportations is by agency.

Including the 71,400 deportations recorded by ICE between October 2024 and the end of December before Trump took office, ICE was already on pace to surpass 300,000 deportations by September 30 – the highest number recorded in a single fiscal year since the Obama administration, when around 316,000 people were removed in fiscal year 2014, CNN reported. CBP recorded more than 132,000 deportations this year.

The agency said 70% of ICE arrests are “of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the US.”

Former ICE officials, like Sandweg and Robinette, worry about the long-term impact on the agency because of the pressures they’re facing this Trump term.

Sandweg says the lasting impact could be “devastating” for an agency that has historically worked as a close and quiet partner of state and local law enforcement.

With agents now working side-by-side with local agencies participating in the revived 287(g) program – allowing ICE to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to perform specific immigration enforcement duties under its supervision – it’s fueling tensions with local leaders, who have expressed concerns about ICE overstepping or keeping them in the dark.

“My biggest concern is … what’s going to happen for the future of the agency?” Robinette said. “This agency, since its birth, has never gone through anything like this.”

The strong presence of federal officers in communities has “impacted the psyche of the American public,” deterring people from engaging with local and federal authorities, fracturing trust and instilling fear and uncertainty, said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, an independent nonpartisan organization.

Johnson said he’s concerned the impact will undercut the legitimacy and authority of local and state agencies long after federal agents leave communities.

For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust. After she was pushed and shoved by the ICE agent, the mother told reporters she fled violence in Ecuador only to suffer “the same thing” in the US.

She and her family have open asylum claims, according to US Rep. Dan Goldman, who added they are here “lawfully but are being targeted by ICE regardless.”

“They encircled us, then they slammed me against the floor, they grabbed my kids and dragged them away,” Moreta-Galarza told CNN affiliate WXTV. “They slammed me against the floor and caused my head to slam against the floor. Everyone from ICE fell on top of me.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2236977421-blurred.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 10:04:13.585879

“This is a habeas petition that concerns the government’s authority to hold a non-citizen pending removal proceedings. Petitioner Carlos Roberto De Andrade is a citizen of Brazil who entered the United States illegally in 2021. He was arrested, detained, and placed into expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1). He was then — in apparent violation of that statute, which requires mandatory detention — released on conditional parole under §1226(a).

“Petitioner later moved to Massachusetts and married a United States citizen. In 2025, ICE arrested him when he reported for a routine check-in. The government contends that he is subject to mandatory detention under §1225(b)(1), notwithstanding his parole four years ago under §1226(a) and his undisputed compliance with the conditions of that parole. He contends that his release under conditional parole means he is no longer subject to expedited removal proceedings and that his detention under §1225(b)(1) is therefore unlawful.

“For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with petitioner, and that he is therefore being detained without lawful authority. …

“By releasing petitioner under conditional parole, the government failed to reserve its right to treat petitioner ‘in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.’ 8 U.S.C. §1182(d)(5)(A). The act of parole extinguished the legal fiction that a non-citizen who is physically present in the United States has, in fact, not effected an entry into the United States. And once having entered, petitioner can no longer be treated as an ‘applicant for admission’ subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention under §1225. He must be treated like any other unlawfully ‘present’ non-citizen — and the lawfulness of his detention is governed by 8 U.S.C. §1226.

“In substance, the government asks the Court to turn a blind eye to the circumstances of petitioner’s release and the events of the last four years. It contends that his ‘release was not an admission to the United States and did not change his status as an applicant for admission subject to expedited removal.’ … But petitioner has been residing in Massachusetts since 2021. He is not seeking parole into the United States. He was already conditionally paroled into the United States. And he is still here. Congress provided a mechanism for paroling applicants for admission into the United States without changing their status. … The government elected not to use that mechanism. It cannot now turn back the clock, and neither can the Court. …

“In short, this Court joins the many other courts in this district and across the country that have found that non-citizens who have been conditionally paroled into the United States are entitled to discretionary detention and a bond hearing under §1226(a), not mandatory detention under 1225(b). …

“Here, the petitioner does not seek — at least in this petition — the right to stay in the country. He instead seeks release pending further immigration proceedings. And while he may ‘remain subject to arrest, detention, and removal’ under §§1226(a) and 1229a(e)(2), he is not subject to detention under §1225(b)(1).

“‘The burden of proof of showing deprivation of rights leading to unlawful detention is on the petitioner.’ Espinoza v. Sabol, 558 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2009). The Court finds petitioner has met his burden. Because he cannot be detained under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1), and respondents have not established an alternative authority for detention, he is being held unlawfully. The Court will therefore grant his petition for release. …

“As brief background, Petitioner, a citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection in 2020. He has since lived in Massachusetts. In September 2024, a U.S. Border Patrol agent apprehended Petitioner driving a passenger who had just unlawfully crossed the border from Canada into the United States. Petitioner was charged in federal court with knowingly transporting a noncitizen unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii). Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge and, on August 21, 2025, was sentenced to time served.

“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) arrested Petitioner immediately following his sentencing and issued an arrest warrant. DHS also served Petitioner with a notice to appear charging him as inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) for being present without admission or parole and under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(7)(A)(i) for lacking valid entry documents.

“This conclusion does not, however, fully resolve the question of whether Petitioner is eligible for release on bond or conditional parole. …

The government contends that Petitioner’s criminal conviction under 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) constitutes an aggravated felony that triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c). Petitioner denies that his conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.

“The Court leaves the question of whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c) to the immigration judge to address in the first instance. … No immigration judge has yet addressed whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony, so the Court declines to resolve the matter. …

“Accordingly, the Court allows the habeas petition (Dkt. 1) and orders the government to provide Petitioner with a hearing before an immigration judge to consider his request for release from detention under the framework of 8 U.S.C. §1226 within seven business days from the date of this order.”

The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.
The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law.
Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin could decide on the matter as early as next month.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doj-lawsuit-1024x6821760613011.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=pWvsGRNb,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:43.320289

These California airports won't show it,"Salvador Hernandez, www.latimes.com, salvador-hernandez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-15/ca-airports-wont-show-dhs-noem-video,"Several airports in California have refused to play a video featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for delays due to the federal government shutdown.
They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.
Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.
Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate.
At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.","Several airports in California have refused to play a video featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for delays due to the federal government shutdown.

The video, playing for travelers waiting in Transportation Security Administration security lines at airports across the country, comes as the government entered a third week of a shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding legislation.

“It is TSA’s top priority to make sure you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” Noem says in the video. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government and because of this many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Officials at multiple airports in California say they are not playing the video at their locations. They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.

Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.

Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate. On Tuesday, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation called for Noem to be investigated for possibly breaking the Hatch Act by asking airports to play the video.

“Recent reports indicate DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air a video message featuring Secretary Noem, in her official capacity, making political attacks against Democratic Members of Congress,” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) wrote in a letter addressed to the Office of Special Counsel and reviewed by The Times. “This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act.”

The act, according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is to “ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,” as well as protect federal employees from political coercion at work.

Noem’s video was received by airports on Thursday and was followed up by a verbal request from DHS officials to play it at security checkpoints, multiple airport officials told The Times.

The reasons the video is not being shown for California fliers varies.

In Orange County, airport spokesperson AnnaSophia Servin said that Homeland Security requested, to the airport’s director, that the video be played, but a final decision has not yet been made. In Burbank, political messaging is prohibited, officials said. In San José, an airport spokesperson said there have been no shutdown impacts and therefore no reason to play the video.

At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.

“SFO limits messaging at our security checkpoints to information intended to help passengers be prepared to go through the security screening process,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Any content, whether in video or print form, which does not meet this standard, will not be shown.”

When The Times asked Homeland Security officials to respond to airports not playing Noem’s video, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded with Noem’s video statement blaming Democrats.

But California airports aren’t the only locations choosing not to play Noem’s message.

Airports in Oregon, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle have also opted not to play it.

“We did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,” said Molly Prescott, a spokesperson for the Port of Portland, which manages Portland International Airport, said in a statement.

Oregon law also prohibits public employees from politicking on the job.

“We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law,” she said.

Officials in New York also pushed back against airing the video.

“It is inappropriate, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the values we expect from our nation’s top public officials,” New York’s Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said in a statement. “The [Public Service Announcement] politicizes the impacts of a federal government shutdown on TSA Operations, and the County finds the tone to be unnecessarily alarmist.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46126ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+257/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F79%2F95c8e2ab486db96e3b3c75f00e0d%2F1525153-me-burbank-airport-ajs-20.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:35.905212

But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.
And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.
Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.
“And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.","In Kentucky, patients drive up to two hours to see Dr. Manikya Kuriti, one of the few endocrinologists who serve the rural communities surrounding Louisville.

Kuriti’s husband, a pulmonologist, drives from Louisville to small hospitals an hour south and north, in Indiana, to help small teams treat critically ill patients.

Rural communities have long struggled to recruit and retain doctors. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially, and have had to eliminate services or even shut down. The shortage of providers is critical in rural communities that tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and early death compared with their urban counterparts.

Many immigrant physicians help fill those gaps thanks in part to the H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign workers to come work in the U.S. Both Kuriti and her husband came to the U.S. via the H-1B visa.

But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The announcement quickly drew criticism from leading medical organizations, which note immigrant physicians make up a significant portion of the health care workforce. They’re concerned the move will hinder the flow of immigrant doctors to the U.S. and exacerbate the nation’s doctor shortage, which is expected to worsen in the coming decades.

Earlier this month, labor unions and other groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the administration over the payment. They argue that the move is unlawful and that the president doesn’t have the authority to circumvent Congress to collect such revenue. The plaintiffs — represented by the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, the Justice Action Center and others — include the AFL-CIO Committee of Interns and Residents and Global Nurse Force.

Last month, the American Medical Association and more than 50 other organizations sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the administration to exempt international medical school graduates from the fee.

According to projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by the year 2036, the groups emphasized in the letter.

National interest

The president’s order says the secretary of homeland security can, at her discretion, waive the $100,000 requirement for prospective H-1B workers in specific industries if it’s in the “national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare” of the nation.

The AMA’s joint letter urges the secretary “to clarify that all physicians, including medical residents, fellows, researchers, and those working in nonclinical settings” are “critical to our national interest” and therefore exempt.

The Department of Homeland Security referred a Stateline request for comment to the White House, which hadn’t responded as of Thursday.

1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

Dr. Tom Price, who served as secretary of health and human services during Trump’s first term, said in an interview that medical workers should be exempt from the $100,000 fee.

“A significant fee for any further H-1B visas in the area of the health care workforce will be detrimental … especially in low-served areas or rural areas,” said Price, a former Republican member of Congress.

In 2024, nearly a quarter of licensed physicians in the U.S. were foreign-trained and roughly 46% of foreign-trained physicians practiced in rural areas, according to data from the Federation of State Medical Boards cited by the AMA. And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.

Trump and other critics of H-1B visas say that some employers, especially tech companies, have abused the program by using it to replace native-born workers with foreigners who will work for less, rather than using it to fill jobs they can’t find Americans to do. But tech companies would have an easier time paying the fee than many hospitals.

Elizabeth Ricci, a Tallahassee, Florida-based immigration lawyer and national expert in immigration law, said at least one hospital in the South has asked her whether it must pay the fee itself or whether it can pass it on to the prospective physician. Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.

“It’s probably going to require litigation to get that guidance,” Ricci said. “And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.

The University of Washington said it has paused H-1B visa petitions.

“The uncertainty around visas creates a significant disruption for talented individuals who hope to train and work at UW Medicine,” Dr. Tim Dellit, CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, wrote in email to Stateline. “It represents a loss for the research and education communities, as well as for the vital clinical care we provide on behalf of our patients and the broader community.”

Iowa, West Virginia and North Dakota — conservative-leaning, largely rural states — had the largest share of physician applicants under the H-1B visa relative to total physicians, according to a study published in July in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

‘The need is there’

When Dr. Sridevi Alla arrived in Mississippi two decades ago, she was part of a small team of hospitalists at a rural clinic in Kosciusko, in the central part of the state. She now practices in Jackson, and on any given day, she could be treating patients having a stroke, complications from untreated diabetes, or someone with dangerously high blood pressure.

“In a state which already has a physician shortage, I think that’s definitely going to affect primary care,” Alla said, referring to the payment.

Alla said she considers herself a Mississippian, and that she’s always felt welcomed and valued by hospital leadership and patients.

“We never felt [like] foreigners in the medical community,” she said. “Maybe from an immigration standpoint we are, but not around being a part of health care.”

She noted Mississippi’s high rates of diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality and poverty.

“This is where I was trained. I sincerely feel like the need is there,” she said. “Even though maybe there are opportunities out [there], I never sincerely looked outside because I felt this is the home after home.”

Four-year limit proposal

Many physicians come to the U.S. under the temporary J-1 visa, which allows medical graduates to come for training and graduate medical education. They are then required to return to their home countries for at least two years. But they can apply for a waiver to stay if they work in rural or underserved communities, which allows them to transfer to an H-1B visa.

In addition to the new $100,000 fee, the administration has proposed a four-year limit on how long J-1 visa holders can stay in the U.S.

Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

AMA President Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, a Flint, Michigan, otolaryngologist, said both his parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to complete their medical residencies.

“In that same hospital where they did their training back in 1970, here in 2025, we still have 30 to 35 international medical graduates that come in,” he said.

Now, hospitals have to “figure out where we’re going to get $100,000 per doctor.”

“We need to not just have the physicians talking about this, but to add to that the understanding of our own lawmakers,” he said.

Dr. Mette Strand, an internal medicine physician at Livingston HealthCare, a 25-bed critical access hospital serving rural Montana, emigrated from Norway. Many of those who mentored her, including specialist colleagues, are immigrants, too.

“Cutting IMGs [international medical graduates], we would be in further need of doctors in an already underserved state,” she said. “I would have a hard time seeing how we would run our hospitals and our clinics.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/immigrant-doctors1760623121.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=K1O30MH0,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:24.978286
