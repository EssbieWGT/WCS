DC is under military occupation. This is not hyperbole.

Trump mobilized 800 National Guard troops on Aug. 11 to patrol DC’s streets. Now six Republican-led states, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are sending hundreds more, potentially doubling that number. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered an emergency commissioner to replace DC’s police chief, a move DC has blocked in court, and while Trump can legally sustain this intervention for only 30 days, the President is asking Congress to make the takeover indefinite. Given DC’s small size, this deployment of the National Guard is nearly twice as dense as that of Los Angeles earlier this year.

What does this look like on the ground?

ID Checkpoints on the streets, M-ATV infantry mobility vehicles rolling by Union Station, heavy patrolling of majority Black and brown neighborhoods by masked men, racial profiling and harassment of people who are working and going about their business. ICE arrests have spiked.

Disappointingly, the immediate reaction of the media and DC policymakers was to respond with logic—evidenced-based interventions and not criminalization are needed to improve the situation of unhoused people in the District, DC crime rates are actually at a 30-year low—according to Mayor Muriel Bowser—and Trump is exaggerating the numbers. DC’s Police Union even welcomed the “support” with the caveat that federal law enforcement would have to be sensitive to the local context.

To see this debate play out is like living in an alternate reality. Trump doesn’t actually care about ending homelessness, or the safety of DC residents, and logic (forget evidence-based policymaking) left the building a long time ago. To engage with the false arguments surrounding the takeover is to miss the authoritarian power grab happening before our eyes. This occupation is not about crime nor homelessness, it’s a testing ground to crack down on groups considered to be “undesirable” to a white supremacist America and a step toward large-scale militarization. We must treat Trump’s actions as part of what we know his project to be, not what he says, because while officials argue over crime statistics, federal forces continue to descend on the city with very little practical solidarity from Democrats and other national leaders.

A Testing Ground for Control

Why is this really happening in DC? Many Americans don’t know that DC’s roughly 700,000 residents, majority non-White, don’t have voting representation in Congress. DC was historically a federal district under direct Congressional jurisdiction. The city won “home rule,” that is, the right to have an elected local government, in 1973, but Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws. DC residents have fought for decades to get statehood—key to ending our systemic disenfranchisement. In DC, our license plates say, “taxation without representation.”

DC’s unique status makes it an easier target for this kind of federal takeover, but it also produces conditions for the kind of mass social crackdown that Trump is trying to justify.

In March, Congress passed a resolution mandating a federal spending freeze. While such freezes usually carve out an exemption for DC’s budget, which has to be approved by Congress, such an exemption was absent from the bill, effectively cutting the city’s budget by $1.1 billion and forcing the city to make cuts to services and important programs that protect domestic workers, renters, low-income families, and other populations particularly vulnerable to Trump’s racist and xenophobic policies. Additionally, DC bore the brunt of DOGE’s mass firings, losing an estimated 40,000 federal jobs and thus a great deal of fiscal income (estimated at another $1 billion loss over the next 3 years). National policies also have devastating local impacts. According to the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed on July 4th transfers the burden of SNAP food benefits from the federal government to the city, costing DC up to an additional $50 million. It also imposes bureaucratic barriers to Medicaid, including work requirements,that threaten health care access for up to 114,000 DC residents. The city is poised to face significant economic hardship, and Mayor Muriel Bowser’s traditional “trickle down” approach to growth will likely leave most working DC families behind. In short, the government is producing more poverty just as it intensifies its criminalization of the poor.

A Ploy for Privatization?

Occupation is seldomly just about military control; it often lays the groundwork for privatization and corporate profiteering. Trump has become a vocal supporter of “freedom” cities– a project with precedent in Honduras after a military coup d’etat in 2009 that gives tech and venture capitalists control over a special jurisdiction within the country. In Honduras, Honduras Prospera Inc., a company registered in Delaware, founded the first private city and created its own government and regulations—a takeover that Hondurans have resisted. The private cities, technically Economic Development and Employment Zones (ZEDEs), have been declared unconstitutional in Honduras, but Próspera has used an international investment tribunal to demand up to $10.7 billion from the Honduran government. The backers of the Próspera private city and a network of libertarian tech capitalists including Palantir’s Peter Thiel and other moguls have secured support from the Trump administration to create “Freedom Cities” in the U.S.—a lesser-known promise of Trump’s electoral campaign. Some in the network openly called for the Presidio Park in San Francisco to be converted to a “Freedom City,” just as Trump signed an executive order in February to eliminate the Presidio Trust responsible for protecting the park. Another private city group, Praxis, claimed to be “revitalizing Western civilization” by seeking to form a private nation in Greenland, just as Trump’s government declared its intention to annex the island.

INTERVIEW: How Donald Trump and the MAGA Movement Will Legalize and Deploy Vigilantes to Push Their Agenda, with David Noll

In Honduras, it was precisely crime rates and so-called failed government that were used as justification for private control. While Trump and DHS’s campaign to control US cities is about consolidating authoritarian power, we should also be vigilant of potential corporate takeovers like these.

The theater of control and actual political violence are interconnected phenomena. DC is being used as a testing ground not just for authoritarianism but for racist suppression of a historically Black and diverse city. But DC is a city full of vibrant and strong people. Those of us who are from and live in the district love it with all our hearts. As Washingtonians fight to keep our democratic rights, we need the active support of people across the U.S. who can pressure their Congressional representatives. Unfortunately, what happens in DC will set a precedent for the rest of the country.",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump-DC-Military-Occupation-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 21:56:27.378151

The US often works with regional partners to handle deportees, and Costa Rica has cooperated in similar situations before.
As the US pushes harder on borders, countries like Costa Rica and Panama may see more requests to take in deportees.
Whether Abrego Garcia ends up in Costa Rica depends on his next moves in court.","If you ever watch American news networks, you are probably familiar with a Salvadoran man at the center of a heated US immigration battle could end up in our neighbor Costa Rica if he accepts a guilty plea, according to court documents filed by his lawyers. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who US officials wrongly sent to a harsh prison in El Salvador earlier this year, now faces deportation to Uganda after turning down the deal. This case highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on migration and raises questions about Costa Rica’s role in accepting deportees from the US. Abrego Garcia, 30, lives in Maryland USA with his family.

He denies charges of human smuggling and ties to the MS-13 gang, which the government uses to justify their actions. Officials deported him to El Salvador in March, ignoring a court order that blocked such a move. He spent months in a maximum-security prison there before the US Supreme Court stepped in and ordered his return in June. Back in the US, authorities arrested him right away on the smuggling charges. A federal judge in Tennessee released Abrego Garcia on Friday after more than 160 days away from his family. But less than a day later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told his lawyers they plan to deport him to Uganda as early as Monday.

His team calls this a punitive tactic to force a guilty plea. The plea offer came Thursday: stay in custody, admit to the charges, serve any sentence, and get deported to Costa Rica instead of El Salvador or elsewhere. Court filings include a letter from Costa Rican officials confirming they would accept Abrego Garcia and let him live here legally. He rejected the deal, prompting the Uganda threat. This development pulls Costa Rica into the spotlight. Their country has long served as a safe haven for migrants fleeing violence in Central America. With stable politics and a focus on human rights, Costa Rica hosts thousands of refugees from Nicaragua and other neighbors.

Accepting someone like Abrego Garcia fits that pattern, but it also tests Costa Rican resources. Costa Rican migration authorities have not commented publicly on the letter or the case. Still, the agreement shows close ties between San José and Washington on immigration matters. The US often works with regional partners to handle deportees, and Costa Rica has cooperated in similar situations before. Critics in Costa Rica worry about the implications. If the US starts sending more people here under plea deals, it could strain public services already stretched by recent migrant waves. Local groups like the Defensoría de los Habitantes have raised concerns over housing and job access for newcomers.

One advocate said, “We support refugees, but we need clear plans to integrate them without overwhelming communities.” The Trump administration defends the approach as part of a broader crackdown on illegal migration. Supporters see it as tough enforcement, while opponents label it as overreach that ignores due process. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the Uganda deportation aims to coerce him, calling it “vindictive” and against the law. For those in Costa Rica, this story serves as a reminder of their position in regional migration flows. As the US pushes harder on borders, countries like Costa Rica and Panama may see more requests to take in deportees. Whether Abrego Garcia ends up in Costa Rica depends on his next moves in court. His team filed to dismiss the charges Saturday, citing government misconduct. A hearing could come soon. Meanwhile, he reunites with family in Maryland under the shadow of possible expulsion.",https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 18:56:59.204412

Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, “are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,” the lawyers argued.
“This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.
The federal law “does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process.","Calling it ""exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,"" attorneys for immigrants held at a detention center in the Everglades filed a lawsuit alleging Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration lacks the authority to run the facility.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in the federal court’s Middle District of Florida, is the third major legal challenge to the detention center, erected by the DeSantis’ administration as part of the state’s support of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

DeSantis and state officials maintain that they are operating the facility through what are known as 287(g) agreements, which local governments can enter with the federal government to provide training and authority to local police to help enforce immigration laws.

But the lawsuit filed Friday contends that the agreements do not give authority to state agencies or their contractors to run detention centers and that the officers who are working at the Everglades facility lack federally required training to participate in immigration-enforcement efforts.

“The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court,” the lawsuit said.

Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, “are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,” the lawyers argued.

The 287(g) agreements are part of a federal law known as 1357(g) that allows states to support federal immigration-enforcement efforts.

“This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,” the lawsuit said. “In the thirty years since the statute was enacted, state officers have never claimed the authority to detain people under this statute, other than the short period after an arrest during transport to an ICE facility.”

The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of a detainee identified as “M.A.” and also are seeking class-action certification in the challenge.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.

The federal law “does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process. And it certainly does not let them place detention in the hands of untrained, unsupervised private contractors who are not and cannot be deputized to perform immigration functions. By ignoring these standards, Florida has created exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,” the lawsuit said.

Questions about the state’s authority to run the facility also have been raised in two other legal challenges.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Thursday sided with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida in a lawsuit alleging that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study be conducted before the detention center was erected.

Williams’ order gave the state 60 days to begin winding down the facility. Lawyers for DeSantis quickly asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals to put her ruling on hold while the state's appeal proceeds.

Lawyers for DeSantis have argued, in part, in that case that the federal environmental law did not apply because the state is operating the facility.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning, the governor — who has fiercely defended the state’s immigrant-detention efforts — shrugged off Williams’ decision.

“We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do. This is not anything that was unexpected, but we will make sure to get the job done in the end,” he said.

In a separate lawsuit, attorneys representing detainees allege that people being held at the center have inadequate access to legal representation and confidential meetings with their attorneys.

The latest legal challenge said that court records in the other cases show the facility is “Florida-owned and Florida-operated.”

“State and federal officials have stated in court filings that Florida exercises ‘complete discretion’ over operations and over who is detained at the facility,” Thursday’s lawsuit said.

Numerous state agencies have 287(g) agreements allowing their law-enforcement officers to participate in immigration efforts, the lawsuit noted.

“But those agreements do not give any authority to the state agencies themselves — only to those individual employees who have been fully trained and certified by DHS (Department of Homeland Security),” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also said it is unknown how many state officers working at the facility have completed federally required training, which can take months.

DeSantis earlier this month announced that the state plans to convert a shuttered state prison in Baker County into a second immigrant-detention center. That facility will be staffed by members of Florida’s National Guard.

The Florida Department of Emergency Management is set to receive $605 million from the Trump administration for the state’s immigrant-detention efforts. The department hired contractors to help build and operate the Everglades facility, which can hold up to 4,000 people and is estimated to cost roughly $450 million per year.

The lawsuit alleges that federal law does not allow the private contractors to be “deputized to perform any immigration functions.”

The lawsuit also alleges that workers at the facility are pressuring detainees to sign voluntary deportation orders.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee4c87d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2Fd9%2Fb3a616404829a0ed535a5c2ae981%2Fap25185566158203.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 20:56:27.699668

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an agency inside the Department of Homeland Security that is integral to President Donald Trump’s vision of carrying out the mass deportations he promised during the campaign. Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

ICE is surging its hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

ICE is also preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. ""Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,"" he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.""

And it's beefing up specialized units for risky situations

About eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,"" Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

He said he'd like to have more such units but wouldn't put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they're also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.

ICE teaches whom agents can arrest — and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone's home. Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they're taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

As ICE sees it, Vitello said, deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency's lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.

Advocates for immigrants and the government have often disagreed about how much authority ICE has to make those arrests and where.",https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/08/GettyImages-2230156618.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-24 18:57:06.202578

Zach Womer, a Philipsburg resident who is running for the state house of representatives, was in the crowd at the protest.","A large crowd and chants of “shut it down” filled Cold Stream Dam and Recreation Park on Sunday afternoon during a protest against the nearby Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

The facility, located merely miles away from the park and just over the Centre County border in Morris Township, Clearfield County, is the largest federal detention center in Pennsylvania.

The rally was organized by several civil rights and Indivisible groups from across the state. In addition to drawing awareness to the facility that’s privately owned by the Florida-based GEO Group, organizers of the rally set out to demand the Clearfield County Commissioners end the contract between the county, ICE and the GEO Group.

The crowd of hundreds was largely a mix of people from central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Megan Guidi of the Pittsburgh Women for Democracy said they were all there as “one commonwealth united to oppose the cruelty and unnecessary detention” happening near Philipsburg.

“This isn’t just a Philipsburg issue. It’s not just a Clearfield County issue, it’s a Pennsylvania issue. And when we have a Pennsylvania issue, we stand together,” Guidi said.

Luther Gette, a Philipsburg Borough Councilmember, welcomed everyone to the borough.

“We are not only bound as Americans to do these things, we are bound as citizens of the state of Pennsylvania to do these things. Whose statue is on top of the City Hall in Philadelphia? William Penn. Did he invite the immigrants and the needy and the poor to come to Pennsylvania? He did. Now it’s up to us. It’s our generation. Many, many things have gone wrong in Pennsylvania and all over the world … but many things can also go right, if we will just insist on that right,” Gette said.

The Moshannon Valley Processing Center has been in the spotlight during President Donald Trump’s second term due to his aggressive deportation campaign for authorized immigrants, though activists have sounded the alarm about potential abuses at the facility for years.

Guidi and other speakers talked about some issues with the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, like the at least three ACLU lawsuits filed tied to it, including one related to inhumane conditions and lack of language access. She said more than 15 days in solitary confinement is torture, according to United Nations experts, but a 2024 study shows in ICE detention, the average stay in solitary confinement is 27 days.

“According to ICE’s own data, no facility makes use of solitary confinement as much as the Moshannon Valley Processing Center. As of this spring, 147 people were locked in solitary confinement every month. To put that into perspective, the next highest ICE facility held 82 per month,” Guidi said.

There have also been two deaths at the facility since it opened in 2021, including the death earlier this month of Chaofeng Ge, a 32-year-old Chinese national, was found dead by the facility’s staff, hanging by his neck in the shower room of his detention pod.

In an ICE news release focused on Ge, the agency wrote that it “remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”

Protesters called on the Clearfield County Commissioners to shut down the processing center by ending the contract, freedom for those in the detention center and not transfers into other facilities, and long term they wanted to see all detention centers shut down locally and nationwide.

Some unnamed speakers shared stories from people who had been detained there, or from their family members. They spoke of poor conditions, inadequate nutritional food options such as fresh fruit, lack of visiting information for family members and being threatened by guards.

An average of 1,374 people were at the detention center as of Aug. 4, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data distribution organization founded at Syracuse University.

As speakers shared their message with the hundreds of people gathered in the park, cars and trucks driving by honked in support and waved to the dozens of people lining the bridge and the fence of the park. There were a handful of counter protesters throughout the afternoon and some cars revved their engines and made inappropriate hand gestures out their windows.

Zach Womer, a Philipsburg resident who is running for the state house of representatives, was in the crowd at the protest. He said what brought him to the protest was faith, rather than politics. He talked about the Gospel of Matthew and welcoming strangers.

“I think that if you are a Christian and you believe the Gospel of Matthew, and you are a Protestant, you should be able to — even if it’s something that it’s controversial, I guess, I think that’s kind of the whole point, is standing up when it’s controversial, not when it’s something that’s popular or something that’s good for you to do, to get some sort of a claim. It’s just, I wanted people to see someone like me, a long bearded hillbilly, that supports what they do and cares about people,” Womer said.

He said he doesn’t necessarily agree with everyone at the protest but he was proud to see so many people out and caring about the community on a hot, Sunday afternoon. He said it was a great example of what people can do when they get together.

In an ideal world, Womer said, there would not be private prisons. But the number one thing that needs to happen is transparency, he said.

“If I’m winning a state level office, I won’t have the ability to go to the center. I won’t have the ability to shut it down, but I will always be a loud advocate for, we need to be able to see what’s happening in this prison,” he said. “...To have a prison a mile from my home where I don’t know what’s going on — there’s lots of reports of abuse. I think that represents something that’s fundamentally un-American, and I think that’s something everyone can get around. … I think the goal should be to reduce harm, and whatever gets that done is what I’m interested in.”

Sunday’s protest came after about 50 people gathered in late July outside of the Moshannon Valley Processing Center to draw awareness to the facility.

Deportation officers within a unit called Enforcement and Removal Operations are the ones who are responsible for immigration enforcement. They find and remove people from the United States who aren’t American citizens and, for a variety of reasons, no longer can stay in the country.

Some might have gone through immigration court and a judge ordered them removed. Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

ICE is surging its hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

ICE is also preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. ""Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,"" he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.""

And it's beefing up specialized units for risky situations

About eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,"" Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

He said he'd like to have more such units but wouldn't put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they're also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.

ICE teaches whom agents can arrest — and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone's home. Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they're taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

As ICE sees it, Vitello said, deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency's lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.

Advocates for immigrants and the government have often disagreed about how much authority ICE has to make those arrests and where.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/08/GettyImages-2230156618.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-24 21:56:32.613867

“It’s like one day everyone left in a puff of air,” Maria López says.

Daily life is changing in many communities across the US as President Donald Trump and his administration step up their immigration crackdowns. Officials vow they’ll carry out the largest deportation operation in American history, put more undocumented immigrants behind bars and eliminate abuse in the immigration system.

Just over seven months in, it’s too soon to say whether they’ll hit all the targets they’ve set. But their messaging as Immigration and Customs Enforcement gets a massive infusion into its budget couldn’t be clearer: This is only the beginning.

Authorities are ratcheting up arrests and detentions in highly publicized operations. And as fears of immigration raids spread, there’s also another story unfolding that’s quieter but no less dramatic.

No press releases get issued when an immigrant family slips into the shadows. But CNN reporters across the country are starting to see what that looks and feels like – and the unexpected ripple effects that can follow.

‘Everything has changed’ at a once-popular quinceañera shopping spot

For years, Lupita Batres had a front-row seat as generations of young women prepared for joyful occasions. From the stall where she sells colorful hand-woven skirts, scarves and purses at Plaza Fiesta, she’d watch girls going from store to store in search of lavish dresses for quinceañeras and confirmations. She’d see family members picking out presents. And occasionally, she’d help someone find just the right gift.

Now she says that kind of business has virtually disappeared from the mall outside Atlanta.

“I haven’t heard of anyone throwing parties, quinceañeras or weddings right now,” Batres says. “And if they do, ah Dios mio, what a risk, right? Being at a party like that.”

On a Friday afternoon, Batres carefully arranges bracelets and trinkets as she waits for customers. So far, none have shown up. On some days, she says the only faces she sees are other vendors. Some customers are even avoiding grocery stores, she says, let alone gift shops.

“They send someone else to shop for them, someone with papers,” she said. “It has changed everything, even how we eat.”

Maria López, who’s worked at a Plaza Fiesta jewelry store for 14 years, says the mall has never faced a moment like this.

López remembers when Plaza Fiesta was so popular visitors flocked here from other states across the Southeast. The once dilapidated mall’s fortunes turned in the late 1990s when developers transformed it into a marketplace catering to the growing Latino community. On weekends, the stores pulsed with life. Chatter floated through the aisles, children ran ahead of their parents to the indoor playground and lines stretched out from the food court. Now it’s eerily quiet.

“People are scared of being arrested just for being outside,” López says. “There is always this tension, this feeling that something could happen. And it is exhausting.”

At Ivan Marín’s graphic design business, a display showcases rows of sparkly and intricate quinceañera invitations. It used to be common for him to get mass orders for party invitations, and also for T-shirts for family reunions, Disney vacations and community events. But not anymore.

“Everything has changed. … Now people don’t travel. Parties at home are very restricted,” he says. “It’s just family.”

After 10 years in the US, she’s singing her last hymns with her church choir

A woman with her curly hair bunched into a bun smiles as she walks through the sanctuary of her Maryland church, where light is streaming through the stained-glass windows.

The 38-year-old undocumented immigrant, who asked to be identified by her last name, López, feels like a weight has been lifted from her shoulders. But a month ago, everything felt far darker.

López rushed to the emergency room that night. Back in El Salvador, she’d worked as a nurse. And she’d never been the kind of person to blow health problems out of proportion. Based on the pain she felt, she was convinced she was having a heart attack.

Until the next day, when doctors told her that her heart was fine. She’d had an anxiety attack, they said.

That’s when López knew she had to make a change. Worries over immigration raids were consuming her. Every daily task seemed suddenly fraught with danger.

López loved the US and once dreamed of bringing her children to live with her here. Now the risks no longer seem worth it. And López recently bought a plane ticket to return to El Salvador, where she hopes to use money she saved over more than a decade working in the US as a restaurant manager to open her own pharmacy.

“I feel so happy to be leaving,” she says. “A life with fear isn’t life.”

Father Vidal Rivas says the choir member isn’t the only person in his congregation at St. Matthew’s Episcopal Church in Hyattsville who’s decided to depart.

For weeks, he’s been looking out at the pews during noon mass and noticing far fewer people in attendance. At a service where more than 200 people once regularly gathered, these days about half that number are showing up.

The summer vacation slump could be partially to blame, he says. And many stalwarts are still coming. But Rivas says in recent days he’s heard from several families who told him they’re leaving the US. He’s also fielded calls from parishioners who are hunkering down and feel that coming to church is too risky, especially given that it’s known for having a largely immigrant congregation.

Rivas tries to reassure them. Church doors are locked during services now, no trespassing signs are on the doors and online videos of the services don’t show parishioners’ faces. And being well known, he feels, should make them safer.

“It gives us certain protection, because it’s a very visible church,” he says.

But during services, when Rivas makes announcements about upcoming church events, he also reminds churchgoers to fill out forms designating guardians for their children in case someone is detained or deported.

When he hears about families who are deciding to leave now on their own terms, he worries about the economic crisis his church could face if too many members depart. But even more, he says it’s devastating to think about all the talent the church community is losing.

The guy who always knew how to fix anything that was broken. The committee members who organized cookoffs and bake sales. The reader whose booming voice made Biblical passages come alive. And now, the always-smiling singer in the choir’s front row.

Her friends in the choir didn’t believe she was leaving until she showed them her plane ticket.

“They call me the joy of the choir, because I’m always laughing and joking,” López says.

But lately, López says, it’s been much harder to be light-hearted. Fear already stopped the choir from holding rehearsals at members’ homes. Only now, as her plans to leave fall into place, can she feel her joy returning. It was hard to share the news with the choir, she says, which has become like a family. She’s ready to leave the US behind. But this group’s love, López says, is one thing she’ll always carry with her.

Instead of picking cherries, they’re home with the shades drawn

Lisa and her three children sit with the shades drawn in their central California home.

Normally they’d be in Oregon picking cherries at this time of year. They’re among many migrant workers who travel to different locations along the US west coast as the seasons change. But this year, with immigration enforcement intensifying, they decided not to make the trek.

Lisa, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym because several members of her family are undocumented, is protected from deportation by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But her parents and husband aren’t, and they’re keenly aware that these days the slightest misstep could land them behind bars.

So this summer, rather than traveling to Oregon and enjoying the outdoors, she’s been staying inside with her three US citizen kids as much as possible. The children try to amuse themselves with TV and video games, but their boredom is clear. When CNN visited recently, one child was sitting alone and tossing a frisbee in the air.

“We love the outside, up there in Oregon. We used to go to the waterfalls, all those beautiful places that they have. It was so much fun for our kids. And for ourselves, too,” Lisa says.

Lisa knows staying inside is taking a toll on her family; with so much less time playing in the sun, her younger daughter was recently diagnosed with Vitamin D deficiency.

But even so, outside their home, Lisa feels the risks are greater. She’s thinking of homeschooling her children in the fall, just to be safe.

At his cherry orchards in northern Oregon, Ian Chandler says many migrant workers like Lisa’s family didn’t show up this year as immigration enforcement intensified in California.

“That kind of had a chilling effect on people wanting to move,” Chandler says.

The result: cherries are rotting on the trees, in what Chandler says is costing him at least $250,000 in revenue.

In Woodbridge, Virginia, Todos Supermarket owner Carlos Castro is also struggling with worker shortages, though for a different reason.

He recently had to let the butchers and bakers he’d trained to work at his store go after the Trump administration revoked their work permits when it ended humanitarian parole programs for Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

“They had important jobs…that can’t be filled very easily,” he says. “Great employees, this is the saddest thing, productive people with the desire to take care of their families, to get ahead, they take away their visas and give them a letter with the number of days they have to leave the country. And then for us as a company, we’re left scrambling to cover them.”

The butchers were trained in using the complicated heavy equipment behind the meat counter. Now the remaining staff are struggling to keep up with orders, he says.

“What could be done quickly before now takes more time, and people get discouraged, and they leave and don’t buy anything,” Castro says.

After several raids, an unexpected visitor greets workers outside a Home Depot

It’s something Ricardo never imagined would happen.

In more than a decade of regularly waiting for day labor jobs at a Home Depot parking lot in Southern California, he’s seen plenty of things.

There were the people who refused to pay him after a week of work.

There were the men who gave him checks that bounced.

But until this year, he says he’d never seen immigration authorities targeting this location. In recent months, he says, they’ve come three times.

Ricardo narrowly missed being detained; during two of the raids, he happened to be working elsewhere. And on one occasion, he’d just gotten picked up from the Home Depot for a job minutes earlier.

But despite those close calls, the 60-year-old from Mexico, who asked to be identified by his first name, says he keeps waiting for work there. Most day laborers, he says, don’t have the luxury of staying home.

“There are some people who’ve stopped going out, but I have bills to pay, I have to work,” he says.

Recent immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area have had a dramatic impact, he says. Far fewer workers have been waiting at the Home Depot, he says. And the number of people coming by with offers of work has also decreased significantly.

“People are afraid to go there and pick up people because of immigration,” he says.

On a typical day before, at least two dozen workers would wait in the parking lot, he says. Now, on some days, just three or four are there with him. Recently, though, he says the number of workers started to grow after local volunteers began waiting nearby and alerting them about anyone who looked suspicious.

On one recent summer day, his decision to stick it out paid off.

An unexpected visitor came to the Home Depot parking lot: Jesús Morales, a TikTok influencer known for surprising day laborers and street vendors with theme park visits and donations to support their work.

Morales took Ricardo and another worker to a water park that day. And a few weeks later, he raised thousands of dollars for them in a GoFundMe campaign, hoping the workers would take some time off and stay safe.

Ricardo says he was overwhelmed by the generous donation. But he still can’t afford to stop looking for work. So many jobs seem to be drying up right now, in what’s usually the busy season, and he’s worried about the months ahead.

“Imagine how it will be when we get to October, November and December. It’s scary. That’s why I have to work now and save money,” he says.

Ricardo says he’s well aware of the risks.

“You just have to believe in God,” he says, “and if it’s your turn, then that’s it.”

A school principal notices a different way her students are vanishing

Marisol loves walking with her two children to the elementary school near their home in San Antonio, Texas. But as they get ready for classes to begin this year, she’s come to a difficult realization: Walking to school isn’t safe.

Inside her car, she hopes they’ll feel more protected. But if raids in the area intensify, she says she’ll be weighing an even more stressful question: Is sending them to school at all too risky? Last year, she already kept them home twice.

“I’m always saying, ‘Go to school, go to school, don’t be afraid.’ And I try to be brave,” says Marisol, who asked to be identified by her middle name because her family is undocumented. “But in the end, you get scared, and you don’t send them, and these fears get into your head, these monsters, asking ‘What could happen if I go to get them and they grab me outside the school? Or when I’m going from home to work? What will the children do?’ It’s a constant fear.”

Hearing those fears from parents breaks Velia Cortalano’s heart.

In the last school year, she says, multiple families kept their kids home from her school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on several occasions as immigration enforcement fears spread. Each time, Cortalano would try to convince them their children were safe at school. Most of the kids returned eventually. But she says one family left and never returned.

“The kids packed up all their things,” she says, “and then they just didn’t come back.”

Just as troubling as those sudden disappearances, Cortalano says, is a different sort of absence that’s even more prevalent in her classrooms.

“Even though they might be here, they’re not able to fully engage, because there’s that fear. ‘I’m here, but where’s my mom?’ or ‘Who’s going to come and pick me up?’”

Cortalano estimates that’s the situation for about a third of the students at Cien Aguas International School, where she’s the executive director. Many students in the K-8 school are part of immigrant families, she says. The strain is bubbling up in different ways, depending on students’ ages, and it makes it more difficult for everyone to learn. Several girls told her they felt like they had to be perfect and shouldn’t speak Spanish anymore. And some kids were roleplaying as “la migra versus the immigrants” until a gym teacher intervened.

“It’s been difficult for all the kids to sift through and manage in a healthy way. … It’s a lot of pressure,” she says.

The school does what it can to help students cope, she says. Among their strategies: a designated “wellness room” that includes soft lighting, a space for meditation and yoga exercises – and a punching bag.

Between raids and rumors, some restaurants are struggling

During what used to be the lunchtime rush, many tables sit empty at Spoon & Pork in Los Angeles.

Running a restaurant has never been easy, with razor-thin margins and rising costs. Co-owner Jay Tugas says the recent increase in immigration enforcement has been another devastating dent in the Filipino restaurant’s business.

“People don’t want to spend money. They don’t want to go out … People are scared. And I know it’s not just my restaurant, it’s pretty much everyone,” he says.

And employees often are scared to come to work.

“Everybody’s legal, but they’re still afraid they’ll get hassled or taken away, just because of how they look or how they talk,” says Ray Yaptinchay, another co-owner of the restaurant. “It’s just crazy, and it’s pretty sad, and it’s disrupted pretty much our whole industry.”

After rumors about immigration raids spread on social media and messaging apps, a 20-year-old Guatemalan immigrant saw a similar slump in business at the Mexican restaurant he manages in northeast Mississippi. He asked to be identified by his initials, J.F., because he’s undocumented and fears he could be targeted for speaking out.

That week earlier this year, he says, many nearby businesses closed when workers didn’t show up. His stayed open. And all day, he braced himself.

“You had this fear, just waiting to see if they were going to come through the door,” he says.

Among employees, morale has plummeted, he says, and comments from some customers can be tough to bear. Recently, after he asked how her meal was, one woman gave him a surprising response: “I hope they deport all of you soon.”

At a Mexican restaurant in Corpus Christi, Texas, rumors of ICE raids have also affected business.

“Sometimes we’re all alone for hours,” says L.V., a Guatemalan server at the restaurant who asked to be identified by her initials.

Some regular customers have stopped showing up, she says. And those who are still coming seem more somber.

The other day, she waited on a man who used to frequent the restaurant with his wife and children. Now he’s eating alone. The rest of the family has left the country, he told her, because the risks were too great.

“You can see he’s not OK, and how much he misses them,” she says.

She’s trying to keep her family safe from behind the wheel

At first, Esmeralda thought she’d leave the country and study abroad when Trump returned to power. But seeing many places she knows targeted during recent immigration raids in the Los Angeles area sparked a new feeling in her.

“My community has been terrorized. … At first I felt fear,” she says, “but then I was angry, actually. … This is my city. This is my state. And I’m going to stay here to protect not only myself, my livelihood, but the people that I know.”

The 30-year-old, who was brought to the US from Mexico when she was 3, has DACA and a driver’s license. She asked to be identified by her first name to protect undocumented members of her family. She’d driven her parents and siblings around when asked before. But now, she says what started as something convenient has become a necessity.

“Don’t even think about taking the bus,” she warned them.

Similar concerns have been spreading in LA after reports of authorities boarding public transportation and targeting people waiting at bus stops. Ridership on the city’s bus system downtown is down 35%, officials said in a recent court filing.

LA County Supervisor Janice Hahn says it’s a telling sign that represents just “a fraction of the toll” on immigrant communities.

“People aren’t just worried about taking the bus — they are terrified of leaving their homes or going to their jobs or going to the hospital,” Hahn said in a statement to CNN.

From behind the wheel of her gray Ford SUV, Esmeralda says she’s doing what she can to help. She’s extending her efforts beyond her family, too, delivering groceries locally to people who are too scared to leave their homes.

Quiet grocery delivery networks like the one Esmeralda recently joined are popping up in communities across the country, from LA to Chicago to Philadelphia.

“They don’t advertise much, they’re using WhatsApp, and they have a good system,” says Denisse Agurto, who leads a non-profit advocacy group in the Philadelphia suburb of Norristown.

Many residents in Norristown, which is about 35% Latino, were rattled recently after immigration authorities targeted a Latino supermarket there in July. CNN affiliate KYW reported that 14 undocumented immigrants were taken into custody that day.

Now Agurto, executive director of Unides Para Servir Norristown, says Latinos in the area are terrified.

“They’re not coming out of their houses,” she says, and the community’s main business corridor looks like a ghost town.

Undocumented immigrants aren’t the only ones who are worried. US citizens like her are fearful, too, says Agurto, adding that she’s started carrying around her passport.

In a Facebook group, locals recently discussed which grocery stores could be safe to go to now. One commenter warned neighbors to be skeptical: “Given how this situation is, we can’t trust anyone. Question: Is this an infiltrator from ICE who wants to know where we’re going next?”

For some, hiding isn’t an option

Days before the Colombian heritage festival he’s been hosting for over a decade was slated to start in July, Jorge Ortega’s phone rang.

“Something happened at the museum,” the voice on the other end told him. “It looks like some federal agents showed up.”

The presence of federal law enforcement in a Chicago museum parking lot sparked a flurry of rumors and panic in the city’s immigrant communities. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman later denied authorities were targeting the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture that day, stating they merely had a quick briefing in the parking lot about a narcotics investigation, CNN affiliate WLS reported. But many in the neighborhood remained unconvinced.

The museum is in Humboldt Park, where the Great Colombian Festival also takes place every year, and Ortega knew he needed to act quickly.

In some cities, festivals have been cancelled after similar incidents. Concerts and sporting events have reported dips in attendance.

But for Ortega, calling off this festival wasn’t an option.

“I was really nervous … You think in your head, ‘What if no one shows up?’ Or the biggest worry for me was how were we going to keep the community safe?”

Fears forced organizers to take more precautions, he says, including last-minute emergency planning and increased security for the event.

And still, half the vendors who’d been slated to come to the festival didn’t show up.

“Many of the workers didn’t want to come to work. They were afraid that they would be detained,” Ortega says.

Ultimately, attendance numbers for the three-day event dropped significantly. But still, more than 6,500 people came. Restaurants and vendors who participated sold out. And Ortega says he sees an important lesson in the experience.

“We celebrated our independence, kept moving forward, presented our culture. And in the end, we won. … I think we defeated fear,” he says. “Because if you live with fear, what are we going to do? Am I going to stay locked up at home doing nothing? That’s not life.”

Next year, Ortega plans to organize the festival again. In the face of uncertainty, he’s still determined to push forward.

So are many vendors at Georgia’s Plaza Fiesta.

Miguel Pollania, a photographer who’s worked at the mall for more than two decades, remembers when his shop was so busy, he needed assistants just to handle the weekend rush.

Today he’s frustrated by false rumors about immigration enforcement at the mall that are scaring many would-be customers.

“They saw a picture online, maybe just mall security, but they think it is immigration,” he says. “And that is enough to keep them away.”

But Pollania is holding out for better times. He looks around his studio and points to a frame in the center of his display wall. It’s a series of traditional baby portraits, featuring multiple poses in circular cutouts. The infant pictured is the child of someone he took a baby portrait of 20 years ago.

“We have been here 22 years,” Pollania says. “We have seen a lot. We have survived a lot.”

And through it all, Pollania and other vendors keep coming to work at Plaza Fiesta.

They sweep the floors, open their stalls and wait, hoping that someday soon customers will return.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bus-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-24 17:56:46.143790

Act 2004, and that a fast-track system for asylum appeals was introduced by the previous Labour government in the early 2000s.","In a major announcement today, the Home Office has said it intends to implement ""some of most significant changes to the asylum system in decades"" in order to clear a growing backlog of asylum appeals.

As part of the forthcoming fast-track asylum process revealed by the Sunday Times earlier this month, the Home Office said today that a new independent body of professional adjudicators will be set up to deal with asylum appeals instead of judges in the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber).

The Home Office explained: ""The new body will be fully independent of government with safeguards to ensure high standards and is expected to use the expertise of independent professionally trained adjudicators focusing particularly on asylum appeals, and will allow capacity to be surged so cases can be cleared. It will have statutory powers to prioritise cases from those in asylum accommodation and foreign national offenders.""

Increasing numbers of asylum claims and increasing numbers of asylum decisions have pushed the backlog of asylum appeals in the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) to more than 50,000. In total, the Tribunal now faces a backlog of over 100,000 cases.

Although the number of sitting days in the First-tier Tribunal (IAC) has increased, the Home Office says it still cannot keep pace with fluctuating and growing demand. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed to provide broader and more flexible capacity.

In addition, the Home Office announced today that ministers are introducing a new legal requirement for appeals from individuals receiving asylum accommodation support, as well as appeals from foreign offenders, to be decided within a 24-week timeframe.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper MP described the asylum system as being ""in complete chaos"" when Labour took power, citing the large backlog of cases and a slow appeals process that leaves many people in the system for years. She said the Government is taking steps to restore control and order, including reducing the backlog of initial asylum decisions by 24% since the election and increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by 30%.

She added: ""But we cannot carry on with these completely unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited which mean that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at huge cost to the taxpayer. Overhauling the appeals system so that it is swift, fair and independent, with high standards in place, is a central part of our Plan for Change.""

Further details of the new fast-track asylum appeals system will be set out in the autumn.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticised the proposed changes as ""minor tweaks"" that ""go nowhere near far enough"". Philp added that a Conservative government would ""repeal the Human Rights Act for all immigration matters and deport all illegal immigrants immediately upon arrival"".

A number of experienced immigration lawyers recalled on social media that immigration judges were called adjudicators prior to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, and that a fast-track system for asylum appeals was introduced by the previous Labour government in the early 2000s. That fast-track system was found to be unlawful by the courts, as the time limits made it impossible for there to be a fair hearing of appeals in a significant number of cases.",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/tribunal-logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 16:56:37.779418

The protest is being held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Cold Stream Dam.

Of course a 90-year-old agency is unconstitutional, you rubes

It’s nice of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to give a helping hand to the ongoing destruction of a functioning administrative state and the complete collapse of protections for workers.

And it’s tough to think of a better way to do it than ruling that the structure of a 90-year-old congressionally created agency that forms the backbone of labor relations in America was probably just a ghost all along.

Yes, according to the worst federal appellate court, the structure of the National Labor Relations Board islikely unconstitutional.

The court agreed with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which had argued that the NLRB impermissibly limited the president’s ability to remove board members and the administrative law judges who handle labor cases.

The NLRB has been in the crosshairs ofcorporations like Amazon and SpaceX, which hate labor oversight and want it gone.

Lucky for them—though not for the rest of us—their interests dovetail with President Donald Trump’s goal of eliminating all restrictions on his power. And since the Supreme Court already let himillegally remove one of the appointed NLRB members months ago, the fix was pretty much in.

9th Circuit makes sure a week doesn’t go by without letting the administration kick more people out

On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appealsswept aside a lower court ruling that was barring Trump from stripping Temporary Protected Status from over 60,000 people from Nepal, Nicaragua, and Honduras.

Congress created the program to allow undocumented immigrants to legally stay in the United States if the Department of Homeland Security determines that conditions in their home country are too dangerous to return to.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance spent the 2024 campaign whipping racists into a frenzy

over Haitians with TPS status and, once they took office, set about stripping the status from everyone their racist little hobgoblin minds could think of.

Related | Vance knew Haitian immigrants weren't eating pets—and lied anyway

Of course, there has been no court ruling affirming that the administration can do this.

Instead, there are court rulings that they cannot, but since the Supreme Courtallowed Trump to strip protected status from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants while litigation continues, the administration is just going to keep throwing more people out.

The administration’s argument here was the usual: It is extremely harmed if it can’t do what it wants when it wants, and the courts can’t even review their decision to remove TPS status. Sure seems like the greater harm would be to the people who are being deported en masse.

Farewell again, Ten Commandments—but also likely not for long

Two weeks ago, it was Arkansasgetting slapped down for its unconstitutional law mandating the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. This week, it was Texas.

U.S. District Judge Fred Biery, with the patience of a saint, wrote a55-page decision to try to painstakingly explain basic civics to the state of Texas, which hasalready appealed.

The Texas law would have required the display of the King James Version of the Ten Commandments in schools, and was basically identical to a Louisiana law the 5th Circuit struck down earlier this year.

The whole point of these cases is to get something to a theocratic Supreme Court in the hopes the right-wing majority will sign off on jamming conservative evangelical Protestantism into public schools, but at least for now, we have Biery’s objectively funny decision to bring us joy:

Even though the Ten Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to answer. That is what they do. Teenage boys, being the curious hormonally driven creatures they are, might ask: “Mrs. Walker, I know about lying and I love my parents, but how do I do adultery?” Truly an awkward moment for overworked and underpaid educators, who already have to deal with sex education issues, ... and a classic example of the law of unintended consequences in legislative edicts.

Yeah, unfortunately it’s legal for military attorneys to do civilian prosecutions

As the Trump administration continues its efforts to subdue the residents of the nation’s capital, there’s news that 20 members of the Judge Advocate General Corps, known as JAG, from the Department of Defense havebeen tapped to work as special assistant United States attorneys—aka federal prosecutors—and will prosecute civilian crimes.

This seems bad, and it probably is, but unlike so many other things the administration is doing, this one isactually legal. During the first Reagan administration, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel concluded this was unlawful, but then Congress passed a law authorizing it.

Presumably, this is also in part because Jeanine Pirro, Fox News host turned United States attorney for the District of Columbia, justwhined about how her office was understaffed.

It is, indeed, thanks to the massive purge of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases. There’s an additional benefit to using JAG attorneys as your temp agency: unlike civilians, they can’t just quit.

This is likely the first time we’ve seen “Calvinball” in a Supreme Court opinion, but it won’t be the last

In an absolute messof a decision, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the administration can cancel $783 million in National Institute of Health grants.

Per the 5-4 conservative majority, the states and private plaintiffs being arbitrarily stripped of millions in public health do have recourse: They can go to the Court of Federal Claims, which is the court you go to for contractual disputes with the government.

Of course, this isn’t a contractual dispute. These are grants that have already been issued and approved.

Per a different 5-4 majority, however, the underlying reason the administration gave for the terminations—that they represented forbidden wokeness, basically—was likely unlawful. That weird result is because Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority in saying that the reason for the grant terminations is unlawful, but also joined the majority in saying they can go ahead and do it anyway. Got it.

“Calvinball” shows up in Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s blistering dissent: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.”

Takeover Is Scaring Immigrant Parents Out of Taking Kids Back to School,Jessica Washington,,,,,https://theintercept.com/2025/08/24/washington-dc-national-guard-ice-school/,"Teachers claim that the D.C. school system has been unhelpful, treating the situation as business as usual and even discouraging organizers from providing guidance to families on school grounds.
But even with added support, some families are still scared to return to school next week.
“I talked to a parent today who has been hiding in their apartment since there was a raid next to their building,” said an elementary school teacher who has been assisting with the emergency carpools.
“They’ve just been sitting on their hands,” said the elementary school teacher.
And the other elementary school teacher said that DCPS told principals “not to speak up” on the issue.","Washington, D.C.’s large immigrant population is facing a reign of terror: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have flooded neighborhoods with large Latino populations, imposing checkpoints and hanging a threat over families’ heads as kids and parents prepare to go back to school next week.

Instead of worrying about having the right notebooks for the school year, many families are now afraid of getting detained by ICE on their way to school drop-off and pickup, three school staff members and local organizers told The Intercept. Teachers claim that the D.C. school system has been unhelpful, treating the situation as business as usual and even discouraging organizers from providing guidance to families on school grounds.

“Most parents’ biggest concern is that something will happen to them on the way to school in front of their children,” said Hillary, an elementary school teacher in the city who asked to be identified by her first name because she was concerned her activism might get her school targeted by ICE, “or it’s going to happen before they’ve been able to pick up their children from school, and there will be no one to come get their kids.”

The climate of fear is fueled by multiple levels of intensified federal policing. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to deploy the National Guard to the District of Columbia. The Trump administration subsequently federalized the local police force and ordered further co-operation between them and ICE officials. And upon entering office in January, Trump revoked the sensitive zones memo that once prevented ICE from operating within schools, hospitals, and churches.

In May, Hillary and a group of other teachers, parents, and community volunteers formed a rapid response team to counter increased ICE and homeland security presence in D.C. They alerted families of suspected immigration enforcement presence and offered services like walking children to their parents’ cars. They’re anticipating they’ll need to increase their efforts as school starts in the coming week.

“[We’re] trying to get walking groups. So if parents are maybe uncomfortable walking students to school by themselves or picking students up by themselves, we might have school staff, volunteers in the neighborhood, parents in the school who are providing a safe passage,” Hillary said, adding that she knows several other schools are pursuing similar efforts.

Amy Fischer, an organizer with the D.C. group Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said she’s been working alongside volunteers like Hillary to protect immigrant families as they head back to school next week. She said undocumented parents weren’t the only immigrants who needed community protection.

“So many of the people are asylum-seekers who have pending asylum applications, they have a work permit, and under the law, should not be detained because they have a pending asylum claim,” Fischer said. “But many, many of those people are being picked up.”

Fischer said that this is all uncharted territory for D.C. residents. “We previously never had checkpoints in D.C., and the previous types of enforcement that we had were much more targeted, so they would be going after a specific individual, not just sort of random pickups on the street,” she said.

Despite the fear, Fischer said that residents have been largely stepping up to help find solutions for families, whether that’s offering to give students rides or walking them to school.

But even with added support, some families are still scared to return to school next week.

“I talked to a parent today who has been hiding in their apartment since there was a raid next to their building,” said an elementary school teacher who has been assisting with the emergency carpools. “They’ve not left their house since over a week ago. So they weren’t planning on sending their kids.”

The teacher, who requested anonymity because they were concerned about retaliation from the school district and ICE against their school, said they offered to arrange for someone else to take their child to and from school, which the parent is considering.

“A fear of being detained is kind of consistent across the board,” the teacher said. Some parents have even suggested that schools should offer remote learning, despite the evidence that it can bring worsening educational and mental health outcomes for children.

Both teachers who spoke to The Intercept said the District of Columbia Public Schools system, known as DCPS, has been slow to provide schools and teachers with guidance on how to protect their classrooms in the event of ICE activity and actively discouraged school staff from sharing information with families about their rights. “They’ve just been sitting on their hands,” said the elementary school teacher.

According to Hillary, the district is “almost acting like nothing has really changed, and that we do not have families who are in an increased amount of danger right now.”

In a statement to The Intercept, a DCPS spokesperson said, “Our leaders, educators, and staff care deeply about the safety of our students, and DCPS will continue to share safety guidance and reminders with students as they commute to and from their school campuses next week and beyond.”

Hillary added that the school district discouraged her and other teachers from providing families with information about their legal rights on school grounds. And the other elementary school teacher said that DCPS told principals “not to speak up” on the issue.

“We were doing a lot of that in May. Unfortunately, the district kind of let it be known that they were not super supportive of us doing that on school grounds,” she said. “It has had to kind of be in quieter ways that we’re getting that information out to parents, and it’s having to come a lot more through not official channels.”

The DCPS spokesperson did not comment on whether staff had been discouraged from organizing, but said the district “has not discouraged parents or caregivers from hosting information sessions or organizing carpools.”

“DCPS cooperates with law enforcement officers bearing lawful court orders,” the spokesperson said. “Our principals have been advised to alert the district’s legal team for immediate assistance and support.”

Hillary said she worried about the impact on children whose families ultimately felt they couldn’t risk sending their kids to school.

“We saw from Covid, even a couple weeks’ absence can have a really big effect on kids’ learning and on their mental health,” she said. “You’re not going to get a chance to build community with your classmates. And then we also know school is a place where a lot of kids get fed.”

She said she’s been encouraged by the outpouring of community support, but she worries about keeping up the momentum if the ICE presence remains as the year drags on.

“Right now people are really activated,” Hillary said, “but how long are we going to be able to keep that going?”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229511018-e1755879945805.jpg?fit=8138%2C4070&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-24 17:56:41.273820

Ukraine:

• Use of long-range weapons: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia. Zelensky said he hasn’t discussed the issue with the US recently. “This is news to me,” he told reporters.

• Some analysis: “I can understand why they would limit the use of certain long-range systems against Russia when they think that Russia might still be willing to make a deal. But that should be very clear not to be the case at this moment, and I hope that there will be a review of that policy,” former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said today on ABC’s “This Week.” Petraeus voiced skepticism at the idea Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Zelensky soon, saying the Russian leader is “the clear obstacle to peace at this point in time.”

Iran:

• Stalled talks: Iran will never be “obedient” to the US, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a defiant address today, according to state media. Negotiations between Iran and the US on Tehran’s nuclear program have not resumed since both the US and Israel carried out airstrikes against Iran in June.

South Korea and Japan:

• Historic summit: Trump’s presence loomed large when South Korean President Lee Jae-myung traveled to Japan — the country’s former colonizer — and issued the first joint statement with a Japanese prime minister in 17 years. Read CNN’s analysis on how the warming relations could reflect a response to Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy.

President Donald Trump has heightened his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.

In a series of social media posts, the president attacked Moore’s record on crime and tied reconstruction funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge to a political dispute over deploying the National Guard to major US cities.

The post came after Moore publicly challenged Trump to visit Baltimore in response to the president’s claims about rising crime in US cities.

Moore responded today in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” saying, “The president is spending all this time talking about me. I’m spending my time talking about the people I serve. I believe we have to be able to address the issue of crime.”

Trump has continued to group Democratic states and cities such as Baltimore with others he claims are in decline due to crime rates, though local officials have refuted some of his claims.

Bash presses Jeffries on whether New York will join redistricting war

02:03

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says Democrats are ready to ensure “Donald Trump cannot steal the midterm elections” on the back of GOP efforts to redraw congressional maps.

Pressed by CNN’s Dana Bash on the plan to redistrict in his state of New York, Jeffries said he’s spoken with Gov. Kathy Hochul about the issue, and there’s a plan to respond “in New York and in other parts of the country as the circumstances dictate.”

Jeffries also brushed off concerns that Republicans could redraw enough seats to ensure they successfully defend their House majority next year, pointing to Democrats’ sweeping pickups in the midterm elections during Trump’s first administration.

The big picture: There’s an expanding battle over partisan redistricting unfolding across the country, with President Donald Trump backing the GOP-led effort.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to soon sign into law new congressional maps that could help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in the midterms. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading an effort to redraw the state’s own congressional maps to offset the Republican gains.

What the administration is saying: Vice President JD Vance defended the Texas GOP’s move this morning, claiming in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that it was an effort to make elections “more fair” and a response to Democratic gerrymandering.

While both parties engage in the practice, Democrats have handed away their power to gerrymander in some states, including California, where a nonpartisan commission draws congressional maps. That’s why Newsom’s effort now requires a statewide referendum to succeed.

CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.

Vice President JD Vance is projecting optimism on the prospect of ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying in a new interview that Russia has made “significant concessions” and the US will “keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution.”

The vice president’s comments come as Russia-Ukraine peace talks appear to have stalled after some momentum earlier this month.

President Donald Trump said last week that he could ultimately decide to walk away from negotiations, but Vance indicated the US will continue to be involved: “We’re going to eventually be successful, or we’ll hit a brick wall, and if we hit a brick wall, then we’re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage.”

Use of long-range weapons: Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented today on a Wall Street Journal report that the Pentagon has for months been blocking the use of long-range US weapons to strike inside Russia.

“To be frank, we have not discussed such issues with the US recently,” Zelensky said, when asked about the reports at a Ukrainian Independence Day event.

“There used to be, you remember, various signals regarding our strikes in response to their strikes on our energy sector. That was a long time ago. Today, we don’t even mention it. This is news to me,” he added.

CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.

The Trump administration has been dogged by weeks of controversy over its handling of the so-called Epstein files, and that scrutiny continues this weekend.

First, a quick recap: As promised, the Justice Department started providing the House Oversight Committee with thousands of pages of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case on Friday.

The committee has vowed to release them publicly, but only after lawmakers ensure they’ve made any further redactions needed to protect the victims. We don’t currently have a timetable for that release.

The DOJ also released transcripts and audio from its interview with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell last week — though she did not make any bombshell accusations or provide much revelatory information.

Now, Democrats sound unimpressed with the new files: Members of the party on the House Oversight Committee are decrying what they say is a lack of new records provided to the panel.

Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania also claimed the DOJ’s files are “largely thousands of pages of recycled content already made available to the public.”

We’ll bring you any further comment on the Epstein files from Trump administration officials and Democrats as they make the rounds this morning on Sunday political talk shows.

As we’ve been reporting, President Donald Trump says he plans to widen the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown in Washington, DC, to include other major US cities.

Trump singled out Chicago in the Oval Office on Friday, and it has since emerged that his administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to the city, according to two officials who spoke with CNN.

Here’s how some big city mayors are responding:

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said Friday that he had not received any formal communication about the administration sending federal law enforcement or troops there, but that he takes the president’s statements “seriously.”

Federal intervention would threaten to undo local efforts that have already seen significant reductions in serious crimes, Johnson said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Trump’s move to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city in June during protests against the administration was a “test case” for further overreach, as was his DC crackdown.

“The president (can) say, ‘Well we can take over your city whenever we want and I am the commander in chief and I can use the troops whenever we want.’ I think that is an abuse of our troops, and I think it is an overreach of presidential powers,” Bass told CNN.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu responded last week to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who threatened to prosecute local officials whose cities did not comply with the White House’s immigration crackdown.

Elsewhere, there has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts — but little concrete progress — since US President Donald Trump’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

We’ve rounded up the latest lines on the conflict for you, below:

• Trump’s letter: The US president sent a letter of support to Ukraine as the country marks the anniversary of declaring itself free of Soviet rule. Zelensky shared the letter on X and delivered his own message on the country’s 34th Independence Day: We will not lose. US envoy Keith Kellogg also attended a ceremony marking the occasion in Kyiv today.

• Zelensky on security guarantees: Zelensky said Saturday that a plan for US and European security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal “will be ready in the coming days,” following calls with several world leaders.

Security guarantees have become the focal point of recent talks, with Kyiv’s western allies pledging they would provide backup for Ukraine to deter any future attacks by Russia.

• Putin on restoring US relations: Putin said Friday that the US and Russia are discussing the possibility of joint projects in Alaska and that he views recent talks as a step toward “full-scale restoration” of the countries’ relationship.

In comments reported by Russia state media TASS, Putin described his meeting with Trump in Alaska as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine, but did not mention whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.

• Trump’s deadline extended — again: The US president said Friday he will give Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart.

Asked by CNN’s Alayna Treene if there’s a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn’t come to the table, Trump said, “We’ll see. I’ll see whose fault it is.”

Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments on Donald Trump’s presidency.

The Trump administration has been planning for weeks to send the National Guard to Chicago, two officials told CNN, as the president looks to expand his anti-crime agenda and crackdown on immigration in major cities across the United States.

It is not yet clear how many troops would be sent to Chicago, or when those deployments would start.

Trump seemed to preview those plans in the Oval Office on Friday, saying, “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we’ll help with New York.”

CNN has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The Washington Post first reported on the plans.

The Trump administration might try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda in the coming days, according to a notice sent by a Department of Homeland Security official to his lawyers Friday.

The notice, made public in a court filing in Abrego Garcia’s human smuggling criminal case in Tennessee, came minutes after he was released from criminal custody pending his trial on the federal charges.

“Let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” the notice read in part.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused the government of using the notice to try to “coerce” Abergo Garcia to accept a plea deal in his case.

The big picture: The case of Abrego Garcia, who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the US in June to face his charges, has become a flashpoint in President Donald Trump’s sweeping deportation push.

Critics have pointed to the wrongful deportation as a prime example of what they say is a chaotic and cruel immigration crackdown, while the Trump administration has doubled down on its claims Abrego Garcia is a criminal with no right to remain in the US.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2231525759.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-24 14:56:33.867051

Or they were arrested or convicted of certain crimes, or they’ve repeatedly entered the country illegally or overstayed a visa. ICE also manages a growing network of immigration detention facilities around the country where it holds people suspected of immigration violations.

Overall, its activities — and how it carries them out — have polarized many Americans in recent months.

After years when the number of deportation officers largely remained even, the agency is now rapidly hiring. Congress this summer passed legislation giving ICE $76.5 billion in new money to help speed up the pace of deportations. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion is for new staff.

Last week, The Associated Press got a chance to visit the base in southern Georgia where new ICE recruits are trained and to talk to the agency's top leadership. Here are details about four things ICE is doing that came out of those conversations.

It's surging hiring

ICE currently has about 6,500 deportation officers, and it is aggressively looking to beef up those numbers. Acting Director Todd Lyons says he wants to hire an additional 10,000 by year's end.

The agency has launched a new recruiting website, offered hiring bonuses as high as $50,000, and is advertising at career expos. Lyons said the agency has already received 121,000 applications — many from former officers.

New recruits are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. That's a sprawling facility near the coast where federal law enforcement officers — not just ICE agents — from around the country live and train. ICE is looking to more than double the number of instructors who train deportation officers.

Caleb Vitello, who runs training for ICE, says it has cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks, and he's been looking for ways to streamline the training and have recruits do more at the field offices where they're assigned.

It's preparing for conflict

As Trump’s effort to deport millions of people has intensified, violent episodes have unfolded as ICE seeks to arrest people. Critics have said ICE is being too heavy-handed in carrying out arrests while ICE says its people are the ones being attacked.

Vitello said the agency tracks every time officers use force as well as any time someone attacks its officers. According to the agency's data, from Jan. 21 through Aug. 5 there were 121 reported assaults of ICE officers compared with 11 during the same period last year.

Lyons said that after recent operations in Los Angeles turned violent, ICE is making gas masks and helmets standard issue for new agents. ""Right now we’re seeing and we’re having to adapt to all different scenarios that we were never trained for in the past,"" he said.

Lyons says the agency is also starting to send out security teams to accompany agents making arrests: “We’re not gonna allow people to throw rocks anymore, because we’re going to have our own agents and officers there to protect the ones that are actually out there making that arrest.""

It's beefing up specialized units for high-risk situations

About eight deportation officers dressed in military-style camouflage uniforms, helmets and carrying an assortment of weapons stand outside a house yelling “Police! We have a warrant!” before entering and clearing the house.

They are members of a Special Response Team taking part in a demonstration at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. These officers are like a SWAT team — deportation officers with special training to assist in difficult situations. They also accompany detainees the agency deems dangerous when they are deported.

“Everybody is trained to serve a warrant,"" Vitello said. “These guys are trained to serve high-risk warrants.”

There are roughly 450 deportation officers with the special training to serve on these teams, and Lyons says they have been deployed to assist with immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Washington.

He said he'd like to have more such units but wouldn't put an exact number on how many. Vitello said they're also in the process of getting more of the specially armored vehicles.

It's teaching whom agents can arrest — and when

New recruits to ICE receive training on immigration law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful searches. Longtime officers get regular refreshers on these topics.

In limited situations, ICE agents are allowed to enter someone's home. Generally when they're seeking someone they're trying to remove from the country, they have an administrative warrant as opposed to a criminal warrant. That administrative warrant doesn't allow them to enter the house without first getting permission.

Vitello says the new recruits are taught about the different warrants and how the rules differ. And they're taught how those who allowed ICE to enter their house can change their mind.

“If somebody says ‘Get out,’ and you don’t have your target, you have to leave,” he said.

Multiple videos on social media have shown ICE officers breaking car windows to pull someone out of a vehicle and arrest that person.

The Fourth Amendment doesn't extend to someone's vehicle, so Vitello said deportation officers do have the authority to arrest someone in a car or truck. Vitello said in the rare case where a target was in a motor home, officers would talk to the agency's lawyers first to figure out what protections apply.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/24/1600x900/ICE-Training-Facility-2_1756036837186_1756036874285.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 15:56:45.024101

They began gathering at Temple Beth Hatfiloh shortly before 6:30 p.m., then marched west on Eighth Avenue, continued north on Capitol Way, turned left onto Olympia Avenue and then stopped and gathered again at Percival Landing Park near the city’s waterfront.

The “walk for immigrant justice” as it was termed was organized by the Faith Network for Immigrant Support which includes a number of Olympia area faith groups, including Temple Beth Hatfiloh and St. John/San Juan Episcopal Church.

As they walked through dowtown, some held signs that said, “Stop ICE raids,” “Our communities deserve decency,” “No more deportations,” and “ICE is Inhumane.”

The reference to “ICE” refers to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement branch of the federal government, which under the Trump Administration has become controversial for its process of detaining and deporting immigrants. Some also say that sufficient due process is not being exercised in those incidents.

Before hundreds of people embarked on their march, Temple Beth Hatfiloh’s Rabbi Seth Goldstein addressed the crowd.

“I am here, as I know many of you are, because our spiritual teachings and our values compel us to be here because we know that the commandment to love your neighbor knows no borders, and the commandment to welcome a stranger is stronger than walls,” he said.

“So let us say loud and clear to those who are in fear, who feel targeted to those who feel othered, who are hidden by force or hiding for safety: We will not remain indifferent,” Goldstein said. “We see you. We are with you, and we will protect you, and we say to those who seek to do harm, who promote policies of xenophobia and hate and intimidation and to implement these policies and carry out these arrests, you will not succeed. You will not succeed.”

Resident Lori Doron was among the many who gathered outside the temple before the march began.

“Why do I want to be here? Well, because we’re all immigrants, and we need each other, and there’s certainly no reason to perpetuate this superstition of separation,” she said.

More immigrants detained

Some also held signs of support for Muhammud Zahid Chaudhry, an area resident and Army veteran detained by ICE on Thursday during a citizenship interview, according to several media reports, including King 5 News.

“ICE records show Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, who emigrated from Pakistan and has lived in the United States for 25 years, was taken into custody at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma,” King 5 reported.

Chaudhry is a member of the Olympia chapter of Veterans for Peace, according to the report.

Olympia City Councilman Clark Gilman, who attended Saturday’s event, cited Chaudhry’s case as another reason to be there.

“For me, tonight’s walk for immigrant justice and prayer vigil is especially important as we have an active member of our own community detained the night before last at the detention center,” he said.

Janet Waggoner, lead pastor and evangelist at St. John/ San Juan Episcopal Church in Olympia, spoke in support of an area man named Fernando Rangel Saucedo, who she said has been in detention since early June.

“He’s somebody who’s been in this country, a faithful husband and father and lead construction worker for 20 years,” she said. “And so we are just hoping that he can continue to parent his daughter, who is a U.S. citizen.”

“It’s important for me to be here because we have a community of love and acceptance, a community that seeks freedom and justice for all, and I am here with many members of our congregation, not only Spanish-speaking and English-speaking, but also we have members who are descendants of folks from Africa and Asia, and so we stand together for love and peace,” Waggoner said.

Originally from El Salvador

Mabel Thackeray, who took part in the march, came to this country from El Salvador when she was 18. Today she is a licensed mental health professional who works for North Thurston Public Schools.

“I belong to many organizations, and my goal is to show and humanize who we are and what we contribute to society,” she said.

The new school year is about to begin, she added, and although students of color are excited to return to school, there’s also some fear, she said.

“Now more than ever we need to create that safe space for them,” Thackeray said.

Saturday’s walk ended at Percival Landing Park where more people spoke, including Kathy Baros Friedt, a member of the Hispanic Roundtable.

She, too, expressed her concern about Chaudhry’s detention.

“Many of you know him,” she said. “While being compliant with his (citizenship) hearing date, he was abducted and taken immediately to the detention center, with no notice to his wife and two children and supporters that were waiting for him.”

Friedt added: “You are not walking alone in this fight.”

In a classroom with desks cluttered with thick legal books about immigration law, recruits learn about how the Fourth Amendment governs their work. And on a firing range littered with shell casings, new recruits for Immigration and Customs Enforcement practice shooting their handguns.

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump's mass deportation goal. That's nearly 10 times the agency's current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They're hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they're hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour's drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don't know what might be coming at them.

""We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,"" said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,"" he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.""

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone's house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can't — and don't — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.""",https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/f682e98b-5fa6-44f7-825a-a638e03aa013/20250824T111934/f682e98b-5fa6-44f7-825a-a638e03aa013_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:57:10.906440

The Home Office was due to stop using Napier Barracks in Folkestone to accommodate migrants applying for asylum from September, but has since decided to extend its use until the end of the year.

The former military site in Folkestone has been used to accommodate asylum seekers since 2020, despite being described by a judge as ""squalid"" in 2021.

The decision to extend its use comes in the wake of a High Court judgement that barred the use of a hotel in Epping to house asylum seekers - and could pave the way for similar legal action over other hotels.

Napier Barracks started out as contingency accommodation for migrants seeking asylum at the start of the Covid pandemic.

But in 2021, following a fire and outbreak of the virus at the site, a High Court judgement found the accommodation it provided was inadequate.

Mr Justice Linden found that the barracks were overcrowded, run down with ""filthy"" facilities and contained ""detention-like"" settings for men.

The Home Office said the following year that it had made ""significant"" improvements to the site - but still faced calls from MPs for it to be closed.

Under Labour, it said in March this year that Napier Barracks would cease operating as housing for asylum seekers in September. That deadline has now been extended until December.

A Home Office spokesperson said it was continuing ""to fulfil our statutory obligations and deliver our commitments to reduce the cost of asylum accommodation, and end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament"".

The announcement comes hours after the home secretary announced an overhaul of the asylum system aimed at cutting the number of people being housed in temporary accomodation while awaiting an asylum ruling.

Yvette Cooper said a new body of independent adjudicators would fast-track decisions on appeals, which currently take just over a year on average to be heard.

During this time, asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful are accommodated at the taxpayer's expense. There are currently 32,000 asylum seekers being housed in hotels.

The city is also relying on $100 million in federal grants for other airport improvements, including a new air traffic control tower.

Fresno City Council President Mike Karbassi stressed that Congress has approved the money.","President Donald Trump and his attempts to bully public agencies, including the City of Fresno, have gone too far.

In May, the city received a letter from the U.S. Department of Transportation threatening to take away federal funding if Fresno did not drop Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) language and cooperate with immigration enforcement.

Monday, Fresno received an email from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development directing the city to remove all references to “equity,” “environmental justice” and all transgender references from its Community Development Block Grant plan or risk losing federal funding. Fresno cannot use federal grant money to “promote gender ideology” as defined in the president’s January executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”

In the city’s Housing and Community Development 2025-29 plan, the word “equity” shows up in a sentence about attracting and retaining industries that meet or exceed criteria like family-sustaining wages, investment impact, equity and resiliency.

Another sentence in the 231-page plan outlines goals to “improve housing affordability and stability, reduce racial and economic isolation and support environmental justice and sustainability.”

Those are hardly examples of a city hellbent on stamping DEI all over its planning.

The response was correct: Fresno joined several cities and counties in a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s threats.

“We are asking the courts to restore fairness, predictability, and the rule of law to the federal grants system,” said City Attorney Andrew Janz, according to Fresno Bee reporter Thaddeus Miller. “This lawsuit is not about partisan politics – it is about protecting essential federal funding that Congress previously authorized and intended for local communities.”

Mayor Jerry Dyer was understandably not happy with the email.

“Our city depends on these federal grants in order to meet our housing demand, provide reliable transportation and improve our roads,” said Dyer. “When Washington suddenly rewrites the rules, it’s our families, seniors and small businesses who suffer most and the impact is felt throughout our nation.”

Fresno stands to lose $50 million in Federal Aviation Administration grants to finish capital improvement projects at Fresno Yosemite International Airport, according to the lawsuit. The city is also relying on $100 million in federal grants for other airport improvements, including a new air traffic control tower.

The lawsuit indicates Fresno depends on more than $100 million in federal transportation grants, $11.7 million annually for housing and $2.2 million in environmental safety grants. The plaintiffs argue that Trump’s executive orders can’t override funding approved by Congress.

Fresno was joined in the lawsuit by Eureka, South Lake Tahoe, Sacramento County, St. Paul (Minnesota), Monroe County (New York) and the Monroe County Airport Authority (New York).

Why strongarm Fresno and others?

“My Administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male,” Trump said in his January 20 executive order. The problem is the president is oversimplifying the two sexes.

The Washington Post reported in February that sex can be difficult to assign for about 2% of the population.

“While there are some areas of active debate, scientists are in wide agreement that biological sex in humans as well as the rest of life on earth is much more complicated than a simple binary,” University of Iowa professor Maurine Neiman told The Post.

Trump’s efforts to reject science is dangerous not only to those who identify outside the male or female sex, but could cause harm to them. Now, his wrongful thinking – along with his assault on anything DEI – is threatening federal funding intended to make airports safer.

(AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, “A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes … underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.”

Abrego Garcia’s case became a flash point in President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,” his attorneys wrote in their filing.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.

Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead attorney in the Maryland lawsuit against the Trump administration, said in a statement Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client by “attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language.”

The findings, released Sunday, reflected striking emotional reactions to immigration enforcement.
I don’t usually see that kind of extreme fervor on a poll response.” The poll found that 69% of respondents disapprove of the way immigration enforcement is being carried out in the state.
The question comes as immigration agents have carried out raids using face coverings, unmarked cars and while wearing casual clothing.
They also split on questions about due process, birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement in sensitive locations.","Most California voters strongly disapprove of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies and believe that raids in the state have unfairly targeted Latinos, according to a new poll.

The findings, released Sunday, reflected striking emotional reactions to immigration enforcement. When voters were asked to describe their feelings about news reports or videos of immigration raids, 64% chose rage or sadness “because what is happening is unfair.”

Among Democrats, 91% felt enraged or sad. Conversely, 65% of Republicans felt hopeful, “like justice is finally being served.”

Such divisions were consistent across 11 questions about the administration’s overall immigration strategy and specific aspects of the way enforcement is playing out in the state, with divisions along partisan lines. The UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll was conducted for the Los Angeles Times.

Democrats almost unanimously oppose President Trump’s tactics on immigration, the poll showed. Most Republicans support the president, though they are not as united as Democrats in their approval.

“It was essential to show the strength of feelings because Democrats are strongly on the negative side of each of these policies,” said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Berkeley IGS Poll. “That struck me. I don’t usually see that kind of extreme fervor on a poll response.”

The poll found that 69% of respondents disapprove of the way immigration enforcement is being carried out in the state.

Among Democrats, 95% disapprove, as well as 72% of voters with no party preference or others not affiliated with the two major parties, whereas 79% of Republicans approve.

The poll was completed online in English and Spanish from Aug. 11-17 by 4,950 registered voters in California.

A question that showed the least unified support among Republican voters asked respondents whether they agree or disagree that federal agents should be required to show clear identification when carrying out their work. The question comes as immigration agents have carried out raids using face coverings, unmarked cars and while wearing casual clothing.

Some 50% of Republicans agreed that agents should have to identify themselves, while 92% of Democrats agreed.

G. Cristina Mora, IGS co-director and a sociology professor at UC Berkeley who studies race and immigration, helped develop the poll questions. She said the poll shows that Republican voters are much more nuanced than Democrats. They also split on questions about due process, birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement in sensitive locations.

“Republicans are much more fractured in their thinking about immigration across the state,” Mora said.

Mora said she developed the question about agent identification in response to the recent bill led by Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) that would require immigration officers to display their agency and name or badge number during public-facing enforcement actions, similar to police and other local law enforcement.

Padilla also spearheaded a letter last month to Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons seeking information about the agency’s policies regarding the identification of agents while on duty. ICE has justified the tactics by stating that agents are at risk of doxxing and have faced increased assault on the job.

“The public has a right to know which officials are exercising police power, and anonymous enforcement undermines both constitutional norms and democratic oversight,” Padilla and 13 other Democrats wrote in the letter.

Another poll question that garnered mixed support of Republicans asked respondents to agree or disagree with the statement, “ICE agents should expand immigration enforcement into schools, hospitals, parks and other public locations.”

Among Republicans, 53% agreed with that statement, though fewer than 1 in 3 agree strongly. Meanwhile, 94% of Democrats disagreed.

Shortly after Trump took office, his administration rescinded a 2011 memo that restricted immigration agents from making arrests in sensitive locations, such as churches, schools and hospitals. Since then, agents have been filmed entering locations that were previously considered off limits, putting immigrant communities on edge.

Schools in Los Angeles reopened this month with “safe zones” in heavily Latino neighborhoods and changed bus routes with less exposure to immigration agents. An 18-year-old high school senior, Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, was walking his family’s dog in Van Nuys when he was taken into federal immigration custody.

Mora said the varied responses illustrate how California Republicans view the Trump administration’s immigration tactics with “degrees of acceptability.” They might feel strongly that immigrants with violent criminal histories should be deported, she said, but the takeover of MacArthur Park, when a convoy of immigration agents in armored vehicles descended there in a show of force, or the enforcement actions outside of public schools “might have been a step too far.”

Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who wrote a book about how Latinos have transformed democracy, said the split among Republicans is consistent with national polling. The trend is problematic for Trump, he said, because it means he is losing big swaths of his base.

“This is becoming viewed as overreach more than it is immigration control,” he said. “The idea sets a frame for it, but the actual implementation is widely unpopular.”

Republicans were largely united in response to other questions. Asked about the Trump administration’s proposal to do away with birthright citizenship — which confers citizenship to all children born in the U.S. regardless of their parent’s legal status — 67% of GOP respondents approved, and most of them strongly approved. By contrast, 92% of Democrats disapproved, and as did seven in 10 respondents overall.

Mora said she was surprised by the fact that Latinos didn’t stand out as substantially more opposed to Trump’s actions than voters of other racial and ethnic groups. For example, 69% of Latino voters said ICE raids have unfairly targeted Latinos, just five percentage points higher than the 64% of white non-Latino voters who agreed.

“You would imagine Latinos would be through the roof here, but they’re not,” Mora said. She said this reminded her of research around the tendency for Latinos to individualize their experiences instead of seeing them as racially unjust.

Broadly, 72% of Latinos disagree with the way the Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws in California, while 25% approve and 3% have no strong opinion.

Among Latino voter subgroups, older men and third-generation (or beyond) women are the more likely to support the way immigration enforcement is being handled in California, with 38% of Latino men over age 40 in agreement compared to 11% of Latinas ages 18-39, although among both groups majorities disapprove.

Madrid said that’s consistent with national polling showing a decrease in support for Republicans among Latinos after record gains in the last presidential election. The question, he said, is whether Trump’s approval ratings among Latinos could regress substantially enough to flip control of Congress in the midterms.

Census surprises for Arizona Arizona has experienced census fallout in the past two decennial counts.
In September and November, voters in Arizona, Texas and Virginia are choosing permanent replacements to Democratic representatives who died earlier this year in left-leaning districts.","President Donald Trump has proposed a mid-decade census excluding undocumented immigrants, potentially impacting congressional seat allocation.

Experts question the legality, logistics, and cost of such a census, citing constitutional and practical challenges.

Arizona could gain a congressional seat under this proposal, but the accuracy and impact on other states are uncertain.

Arizona could gain an extra congressional seat if President Donald Trump succeeds in implementing a mid-decade census, excluding illegal immigrants, but the cost, logistics and legality of the whole idea cast doubt it will happen.

The presidential proposal calls for an unprecedented effort to count only some U.S. residents, upending the practice of counting everyone and inviting an unsettling error rate that could yield results that might not deliver as many Republican seats as Trump presumably wants, experts say.

The results of a census that seeks to count immigrants — but not illegal ones — is untested, and recent history suggests Arizona, for one, could be blindsided by actual participation levels. Even so, an Arizona Republic analysis of various demographic scenarios suggests if the state would begin any undertaking, it is likely to pick up a 10th seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.

“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Aug. 7. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

Apart from the mid-decade census proposal, the ongoing mid-decade redistricting playing out in Texas, California and perhaps other states is already giving the GOP a new edge in holding onto control of the House.

“The president I think is going through a political agenda with a lot of wishful thinking,” said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at the New York Law School and an expert on redistricting and census law.

It's an expensive idea

While mid-decade redistricting is permitted, though rare, an off-cycle census excluding people seems legally dubious to experts on the subject. Courts have affirmed counting everyone since the 14th Amendment that addressed citizenship and equal protection rights after the Civil War.

Sam Wang is a neuroscience professor at Princeton University who helped create the Princeton Gerrymandering Project that researches the outcomes of politically driven maps.

He called Trump’s proposal “a crackpot idea. First off, it’s unconstitutional to leave out people who are not citizens. Secondly, it’s logistically impossible. The Census Bureau takes a whole decade to get ready” for a decennial census.

“It would be a bridge to the 19th century,” Wang said.

Time and money pose other hurdles.

The 2020 census cost $14 billion and took a decade to plan, Wice said. Others noted the time it takes to design and execute a census, followed by apportionment — the process of reallocating House seats based on new population numbers — and concluding with a process of redrawing maps in all 50 states.

Kimball Brace was a member of the Census Bureau’s 2020 advisory panel and is president of the Virginia-based Election Data Services, which has provided technical assistance to Democrats for redistricting. He said states need granular data to redraw their maps that only a complete census, not an estimate, can provide.

“If he’s going to do something with estimates for the number of people in each county and try to claim that the way to look at this, well, you’ve got 3,000 counties and 435 districts. They’re not going to square up,” Brace said. “The way of generating estimates are real suspect, and in a short period of time, you’re not going to be doing a good job.”

Trump didn’t say whether the special census would be done ahead of the 2026 midterm elections or the 2028 presidential election, which would be just two years before the normally timed decennial census.

Congress approved the idea of a mid-decade census in the 1970s, said Margo Anderson, a history professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who has researched the census.

At the time, Congress recognized a need for more regular data than a decennial census could provide.

But the idea, which specifically ruled out using data for apportionment and required the count to be taken in years ending in five, never got funded. The mid-decade census idea eventually gave way to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which now provides extensive new demographic estimates every year.

Arizona stands apart from other states that could benefit from another population update in one key respect: It draws its political boundaries using an independent redistricting commission. In most cases, the states gaining seats use maps already drawn by Republicans.

The Republic considered Arizona’s relative standing using the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 state population estimates and subtracted the 2023 estimated illegal immigrant population as calculated by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.

The Republic also analyzed results using only U.S.-born citizens and another combining native-born citizens with naturalized citizens. Those scenarios illustrate how the results of any census could alter the results for congressional representation depending on demographic participation levels.

Red states likely would benefit from Trump idea

Trump’s preferred census is inherently speculative, in part because the illegal immigrant population is never precisely known or evenly distributed. Also, the Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigrants could discourage participation from legal immigrants or lead respondents to lie in their answers on citizenship.

Thomas Hoffeler, a now-dead Republican described by the New York Times as the “Michelangelo of gerrymandering,” urged the inclusion of a citizenship question in the census because he thought it would benefit the GOP. He urged the Trump administration to pursue it before his death in 2018.

Using the Census Bureau and Pew estimates, The Republic found that four Republican-leaning states would each gain a single seat: Arizona, Idaho, Ohio and Texas.

California would drop two seats and Illinois and New York would each lose one. All of them voted for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024.

Using the figures for natural-born citizens only and for naturalized citizens produced a wider range of possibilities.

Half the country — 25 states — could see their representation number changed by scenarios The Republic applied.

Florida, for example, would stand to lose two seats in a count using only U.S.-born citizens. It would gain a seat if everyone but unauthorized immigrants were counted, based on 2022 estimates. It wouldn’t gain or lose a seat using the 2023 estimate.

California could lose two, four or 10 seats depending on the criteria, easily making it the state with the most at stake.

In each case, Arizona’s estimated population was sufficient to gain an extra seat. Idaho is the only other state that would gain in each of those scenarios.

California, Illinois and New York would lose seats in every scenario.

Not just Texas: GOP controls more maps

The redistricting process that would follow any census also likely would benefit Republicans.

The states that could gain seats mostly use Republican-led redistricting processes.

Arizona, with nine House seats, is one of four states that use an independent redistricting commission. It is intended to create political maps that emphasize competitive political races as part of the considerations in drawing boundaries.

Idaho, which has two seats, uses a commission with partisan members.

Ohio and Texas use maps effectively drawn by GOP-led legislatures with Republican governors. They collectively have 53 House seats already.

By contrast, California uses an independent commission for its 52 House seats. Illinois and New York have maps drawn by Democratic-controlled governments and account for 43 House seats.

Even states that would not gain or lose a seat would likely have to reconsider their maps. Maps in Republican-drawn states outnumber the seats drawn by Democratic-led states.

An unprecedented mid-decade count

The Constitution calls for a census every 10 years to determine the number of seats in Congress. Its meaning then has shifted today, reflecting the end of slavery, the inclusion of all Native Americans and the 435-seat cap on the number of seats in the House since 1929.

The census is used to divide trillions in federal spending based on economic and demographic characteristics.

For congressional apportionment, every state gets one House member, and the remaining seats are divided using a complex formula that corresponds to population.

While a decennial census is mandatory, participation is always less than perfect, especially in the immigrant community, where language and cultural barriers can reduce participation.

A special census in line with Trump’s interests could be particularly fraught because of widespread anxiety about how immigrants are treated as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts daily raids across the country.

It is unclear how the raids could skew participation in a census, even for those legally permitted in the country.

Arizona had an estimated 300,000 undocumented immigrants in 2023, according to the Pew Research Center. The state had 981,000 foreign-born residents in 2023, the Census Bureau estimates.

It suggests there are more than a half-million legal immigrants in Arizona whose participation could hinge on whether they trust an oddly timed census request in an era of abrupt removals.

Wang’s calculations suggest GOP-friendly states such as Texas and North Carolina could lose seats under Trump’s plan. In other scenarios, Texas could gain seats with districts made larger than currently used to include swaths of constituents who don’t count for apportionment purposes.

“It just doesn’t seem well thought out,” he said.

The same dynamic would play out in every state, but outreach would undoubtedly vary in politically red and blue states.

Census surprises for Arizona

Arizona has experienced census fallout in the past two decennial counts.

In 2010, the formal census count was tied to April 1, within days of passage of the polarizing Senate Bill 1070 immigration-enforcement law Arizona passed.

That law helped drive off countless immigrants, both legal and illegal. It also came as the state was still shaking off the housing bust.

Arizona’s final population count was lower than expected and varied from the Census Bureau’s estimate by the widest margin in the country. That impacted the expected allotment of federal grants for a decade.

Ten years later, amid a nationwide quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic, Arizona narrowly missed out on getting a 10th congressional seat from the 2020 census. Arizona did little to encourage participation; California spent millions trying to boost it.

Arizona’s eventual 64% response rate to the census was below the 67% national average. California’s response rate was nearly 70%.

In the end, both states missed their objectives in a count made far more difficult because of COVID.

Why do it at all?

Trump is looking at bolstering Republicans’ seven-seat majority in the House by other means as well.

He encouraged Texas to redraw that state’s Republican-controlled congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and years before the 10-year interval normally used. The Republican-controlled Texas Legislature passed a map Aug. 22 that is expected to net the GOP another five House seats next year.

Democratic-controlled California passed a redrawn map of its own that would offset the Texas changes, though that process requires voter approval in November.

Other states have weighed redrawing their maps.

Beyond that, four special elections later this year could cut into the Republican advantage in the House.

In September and November, voters in Arizona, Texas and Virginia are choosing permanent replacements to Democratic representatives who died earlier this year in left-leaning districts.

A vacant seat in a safely Republican district in Tennessee won’t be filled until after a December special election.

Trump’s real aim, Wice said, may be to soften the ground ahead of adding a citizenship question to the 2030 census, something the Supreme Court shot down in his first administration for the 2020 census.

“It would be almost impossible and unaffordable to try to replicate a full-scale decennial census,” Wice said, noting that planning for the 2030 census began in 2020. “This leads me to think … there is time now for the Census Bureau, if directed by the president or Congress, to add the citizenship question.”

Anderson said seeking the upper hand through redistricting is not new. Ohio, for example, redrew its maps six consecutive election cycles between 1878 and 1890 in a reflection of the political volatility of that era.

“It happened in periods of partisan stress and when the parties are very close, when elections are won by very tiny numbers,” she said.

Wice still thinks the idea of excluding anyone should be blocked by the legal history of the 14th Amendment.","https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/22/USAT/85770161007-20250821-t-221359-z-1943143473-rc-2-ybga-4-herk-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpcrime.JPG?crop=5440,3062,x0,y88&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-24 11:57:19.813649

Dana:

Hello, I'm Dana Taylor, and this is a special episode of USA TODAY's The Excerpt.

Law enforcement officers working in plain clothes or undercover is nothing new. What is new is that some officers are now hiding their faces behind masks and refusing to show identification. Following a surge in arrests by armed masked federal immigration agents in unmarked cars, some California Democrats are backing a new bill in Congress that would bar officials from covering their faces while conducting raids, unless the masks were required for their safety or their health. What's led to the rise of masked policing, and is this what law enforcement should look like in a democracy?

Here to dig into those questions and more is former FBI agent Mike German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. Thanks for joining me, Mike.

Mike:

Thanks for having me.

Dana:

In a recent social media post on X, the Department of Homeland Security took issue with proposed legislation in California, which would ban federal law enforcement from wearing masks. DHS claims that ICE agents are facing assaults and doxing. What are your thoughts on why some officers have made the decision to wear masks? Has there been any official guidance that says officers should be masking?

Mike:

I haven't seen official guidance going out, but I have seen DHS officials justifying the agents' use of masks, and basically giving a green light to that activity through their public rhetoric.

Dana:

And what are your thoughts on why some officers have made that decision for themselves?

Mike:

I think there are probably as many reasons as there are officers. I think one of the issues is that they have detailed federal agents from other agencies to do this kind of immigration work, and they're probably respected in their communities and want to maintain their reputation in the work that they do. So I think there's probably a little hesitation to be publicly linked to this kind of immigration enforcement actions that divert resources away from true, important law enforcement missions.

And I think part of it is to create terror in the community. I mean, masked law enforcement agents is a hallmark of police states, and particularly where you see masked agents not being clearly identified as law enforcement, not identifying the agency they work with, that actually creates a greater threat to law enforcement. These DHS officials are trying to justify it as an officer safety measure, but it's actually the opposite, that when the public or the person being arrested don't know and can't clearly identify you as a law enforcement agent, their inclination would be to resist, because you look like any other criminal that is trying to harm them.

And certainly for the public at large, when they see some altercation taking place, they may want to get involved to try to protect the person being attacked. And the threat to law enforcement goes up when agents aren't properly identified. That's why, as an FBI agent, when we went on a raid, we wore these jackets with bright yellow letters saying FBI, to make it very clear to everyone that we are law enforcement acting in official capacity. That's part of the protection that agents get.

Dana:

Are there risks with having officers from other agencies, as you said, being called to do work they may not have been trained to do?

Mike:

Significant risks, particularly because different agencies have different authorities, and the authorities that an FBI agent might have on a terrorism case will be different than the authorities ICE ERO agents have enforcing civil law. So putting a bunch of people together without very clear instructions, very clear guidance, and particularly guidance that's public so the public understands what's happening, is crucial. And a lot of this is about making sure there's still public confidence in law enforcement, because law enforcement can't operate where the public no longer trusts it to actually enforce the law, rather than to engage in some kind of misconduct or abuse.

Dana:

Is there danger here, especially in communities targeted by ICE, that there's no way of knowing whether the person behind the mask has a badge?

Mike:

Certainly, there's significant danger. It's dangerous for the person being targeted, because as we have seen, unfortunately, there are people who impersonate agents and try to use the natural deference that members of the public would give to somebody who is enforcing the law to exploit and victimize that person. So because that's actually a real thing now, it's natural for people to be afraid of somebody who's dressed up in militia gear, not properly identified as law enforcement, particularly when masked and not willing to show the badge, show the authority, either a warrant or some other legal authority to engage in the conduct. And we're also seeing a lot of very aggressive actions.

And what many studies, going back to the civil unrest during the 1960s and '70s, showed that when law enforcement engages in arbitrary or poorly targeted violence, that often creates more violence. In other words, if they attack a crowd indiscriminately, the crowd will become more violent. So it's a dangerous escalation that's occurring in a lot of these raids that aren't really following proper law enforcement protocols.

Dana:

What's the significance of some officers perhaps seeing the American public as a threat?

Mike:

That's a huge problem in a democracy. In a democracy, the officials who enforce the law are supposed to remain under democratic control. Their guidelines should be public, their activities should be closely overseen and capped by strong guidelines. But unfortunately, what we've seen, particularly since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is a loosening of those kinds of guidelines, certainly in the federal system with the FBI where I used to work, but all across the country, with law enforcement taking on a greater role in federal law enforcement on task forces, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Forces, Safe Street Task Forces, the use of state and local law enforcement intelligence centers, called fusion centers, been a network of centers across the country, that this kind of activity is often done very secretively. And anything that's secret is threatening to a democracy. And because there's so little accountability, the public loses confidence in the police department, and loses confidence that they are actually working to protect public safety, rather than to engage in activities for improper purposes.

Dana:

There's no shortage of photos and videos of recent ICE raids. Social media allows for the proliferation of that and other police activity. Does this normalize masking? Is this something the public needs to see? What are your thoughts here?

Mike:

Unfortunately, masking does seem to be normalized, but I think it's less about the fact that there are cameras and more about law enforcement leaders okaying this kind of behavior. I used to be an FBI undercover agent. I know and respect that people working in particular roles need to protect their identity and their likeness. But they can make that choice and not participate. And that, again, is a leadership and a management position. If there's somebody who you don't want identified in public because of some important and dangerous undercover assignment, don't put that person on one of these task forces going out in public, engaging in activity that's likely to draw public attention.

Dana:

Mike, you previously worked undercover in white supremacist and militia groups. How might the current trend towards mass policing impact the work of real undercover agents?

Mike:

It's quite dangerous, and we saw this happening significantly during the 2020 protests, where these militia groups started dressing like soldiers, started dressing like police officers. Unfortunately, police officers were more and more also dressing like soldiers, with the bulletproof vests and the armor plates and fatigues and camouflage rather than normal police uniforms. The reason the militia groups were doing it was to identify with the police officers. They often claim to support Blue Lives Matter, and otherwise were pro-law enforcement. Now, that was never actually true, and certainly on January 6th, when a lot of the members of these militant groups went to the Capitol and attacked police officers, injuring more than 100 of them, their love for law enforcement was not genuine. So they're trying to act as if they are also bestowed with some sort of official authority to act against their political enemies, and that creates a very dangerous situation. Of course, there have been many cases of law enforcement officials associating with those groups, so not having clearly identified law enforcement creates the danger that the public will not know whether this person is acting in a legal or illegal capacity.

Dana:

What recourse do communities have to demand both transparency and accountability when federal officers conduct operations while masked and unidentified?

Mike:

Well, it's very important for our democratic processes to work, and make sure that not just your federal representatives, but your state and local representatives as well, understand that this is something that creates community harm. It creates dangers that otherwise wouldn't exist. The last thing law enforcement should be doing is engaging in actions that create a more lawless society. So it's up to these state and local leaders to make sure their police departments know what the expectation is, that it's up to the state and local police departments to make sure that, when the federal government and federal agents are operating in their territory, that they're doing it in an accountable manner.

Dana:

Are there any reforms you would prioritize right now to restore accountability in federal and local policing?

Mike:

Certainly having properly identified agents when they're going out in public, in situations where they might be making arrests or engaging in force, is critical. Now, again, there are plenty of studies about crowd control that go back to the 1960s and '70s that demonstrate safer ways to engage the public that is engaged in protest activity. So these are things that law enforcement knew in the 1990s when I was FBI agent. Somehow they seem to have forgotten that or are ignoring all that advice. But they have to seek public opinion about what it is they're doing, so that they understand why this activity is so harmful to our society.

As of mid-August 2025, the state had filed 36 suits against the administration, with a 37th added shortly thereafter, according to reporting from the Oregon Capital Chronicle. This pace—averaging five lawsuits per month since Trump’s January inauguration—dwarfs the six filed in the first year of his initial presidency, reflecting a more aggressive stance honed by years of partisan legal battles.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat who took office in 2023, has positioned his office as a bulwark against policies perceived to infringe on state rights and federal laws. In interviews, Rayfield has emphasized that decisions to sue hinge on whether administration actions harm Oregonians or violate statutes, as detailed in a July 31, 2025, Zoom briefing where he outlined criteria for litigation. This approach has seen Oregon join multistate coalitions, often led by Democratic attorneys general, targeting executive orders on immigration, environmental regulations, and voting rights.

Escalating Legal Confrontations and Multistate Alliances

One notable case, filed in April alongside Washington state, challenges a Trump executive order on election integrity, which critics argue undermines voting access and erodes public confidence in elections. The suit, announced by the Oregon Department of Justice, contends the order violates the Constitution and federal laws like the National Voter Registration Act. Legal experts, speaking to the Portland Tribune, describe this as part of a “new era” where states proactively combat perceived federal overreach, drawing on precedents from Trump’s first term.

The 37th lawsuit, lodged on August 18, targets the administration’s threat to withhold federal crime victim funds from states not cooperating with immigration enforcement. This action, as covered by oregonlive.com, highlights Oregon’s sanctuary state policies clashing with Trump’s immigration agenda, potentially affecting millions in funding for victim services. Rayfield’s team, including special counsel Dustin Buehler, has vowed continued action, stating in the Portland Tribune that if the administration “keeps skirting the law, we are going to keep suing them.”

Historical Context and Strategic Shifts

Comparing the two Trump presidencies reveals strategic evolution. During 2017, Oregon’s suits were reactive, often responding to travel bans and environmental rollbacks. Now, with a conservative Supreme Court and lessons from past wins—like blocking aspects of the 2017 Muslim ban—states are filing preemptively. Data from the Jefferson Public Radio shows Oregon partnering with over a dozen Democratic-led states in most cases, amplifying their leverage in federal courts.

This litigious fervor isn’t without costs. Experts estimate each suit drains state resources, potentially in the hundreds of thousands per case, though proponents argue the long-term protections for rights and environment justify it. Posts on X from users like legal analyst Laurence Tribe echo sentiments from past cycles, praising such actions as essential resistance, while conservative voices decry them as partisan lawfare.

Potential Outcomes and Broader Implications

Many of these cases could drag on for years, possibly reaching the Supreme Court, where Trump’s appointees hold sway. For instance, environmental suits challenge rollbacks on clean air standards, as noted in the Bend Bulletin, affecting Oregon’s timber and tech industries. Wins could set precedents limiting executive power, while losses might embolden further federal actions.

Industry insiders in legal and policy circles see Oregon’s strategy as a model for blue states, potentially reshaping federal-state dynamics. As Rayfield told reporters, per the Oregon Capital Chronicle, the focus remains on safeguarding Oregonians’ rights amid ongoing policy clashes. With more suits anticipated—on topics from reproductive rights to climate initiatives—the legal front lines of American federalism are set to intensify, testing the resilience of both state attorneys and the administration’s agenda.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-793d6bc1-4e4a-48d2-8561-47fbe6359c13.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 13:56:30.577397

Uganda’s latest deportation agreement under scrutiny

The Trump administration has deepened its migrant relocation deals with several African governments, and Uganda has emerged as a key partner.

In a temporary agreement reached this August, Uganda agreed to accept third-country nationals deported from the U.S., specifically those denied asylum or unwilling to return to their home countries.

The deal excludes individuals with criminal records or unaccompanied minors, and Uganda favors deportees of African origin. The details of numbers and implementation timelines are still being worked out.

Officials in both capitals have presented the deal as a humanitarian measure, but critics say it exposes Uganda to dangerous security risks it may not be equipped to handle.

The Uganda arrangement follows on the heels of a similar pact with Eswatini, which drew global backlash after reports confirmed that individuals with serious criminal records, including violent offenders, had been deported there.

Human rights groups caution that the U.S. is exploiting smaller African nations with limited policing capacity, using them as dumping grounds for offenders it seeks to remove.

Melusi Simelane of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) told Al Jazeera that Washington is deliberately targeting countries with weaker human rights safeguards, warning: “The US’s actions are exploitative and tantamount to treating the continent as a ‘dumping ground.’”

Rising concerns at home

Ugandan civil society activists have raised alarm over the implications of the deportation deal, warning that it could overwhelm fragile security systems and deepen public mistrust of the government.

The Associated Press reports that human rights lawyer, Nicholas Opio compared the arrangement to human trafficking, questioning the legal status of those being sent to Uganda. “Are they refugees or prisoners?” he asked.

“The proposed deal runs afoul of international law. We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency; in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” Opio said.

FORT MYERS, Fla. — Immigrants’ rights advocates filed a sweeping federal lawsuit Friday evening challenging Florida’s authority to detain people at the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a sprawling and hastily constructed encampment in the Everglades. The case, M.A. v. Guthrie, seeks a writ of habeas corpus ordering the release of hundreds of people being held there and asks the court to declare Florida’s operations unlawful.

The facility, formally located inside Big Cypress National Preserve, has been described in court documents as a makeshift camp of tents and cages surrounded by alligators, snakes, and mosquitos, vulnerable to flooding and extreme heat. Florida officials have referred to it as “Alligator Alcatraz,” boasting that the harsh conditions would pressure people into abandoning their immigration claims. Governor Ron DeSantis said in July, “You’ll have a lot of people that will deport on their own because they don’t want to end up in Alligator Alcatraz”.

The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and the National Immigrant Justice Center. It argues that Florida is violating federal law by attempting to run its own immigration detention system under the guise of 287(g) agreements — a federal program that allows local law enforcement officers, after extensive training and certification, to assist ICE with narrow immigration enforcement functions. Attorneys contend the statute does not authorize state agencies to operate independent detention centers or to delegate immigration powers to private contractors.

“This facility has already become a disaster in the first few weeks of its operations, with mounting reports of disease, wrongful removals, and people being denied all kinds of basic rights,” said Spencer Amdur, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel. “The government needs to follow the law when people’s lives and liberties are at stake. It’s time for this failed experiment to end.”

According to the complaint, detainees at Alligator Alcatraz are being held without charges for weeks, are excluded from ICE’s online detainee locator system, and are often denied custody or bond determinations. Some people have disappeared from federal tracking altogether, leaving their families and attorneys unable to locate them. In many cases, detainees have been prevented from filing petitions with immigration courts, while others report being pressured to sign “voluntary” removal orders without legal counsel.

The lawsuit describes conditions at the camp as unsafe, unsanitary, and intentionally punitive. It says detainees are housed in tents that flood during summer rains and suffer constant mosquito infestations, sewage leaks, and extreme restrictions on access to clean water. Many report being allowed to shower only once every several days and denied drinking water except at mealtimes. Respiratory illnesses have spread throughout the camp, and detainees have been hospitalized for emergency medical issues. Some have been punished by being restrained outdoors for hours in the sun, exposed to swarms of insects.

One of the named plaintiffs, identified as M.A., has lived in the United States since 2018, is married to a U.S. citizen, and has five U.S.-citizen stepchildren. He entered the country on a visa and applied for asylum, receiving a work permit, Social Security card, and driver’s license. He was arrested outside his home in July and pressured to sign an English-only form he could not read, later told it was a voluntary removal order. Since being detained at the facility, he has been hospitalized twice and is now in a wheelchair. He has never appeared in ICE’s detainee locator system.

Amy Godshall, legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney with the ACLU of Florida, said Florida’s actions have created a crisis. “Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center. Not only have the conditions been abhorrent, but the detention itself is unlawful. People are being held without charge, cut off from their attorneys, and made invisible in the immigration system. Families cannot even find out where their loved ones are. This is a crisis created entirely by the state’s reckless decision to ignore federal law and invent its own immigration jail in the middle of the Everglades.”

Miriam Haskell, senior attorney and director of litigation at Community Justice Project, emphasized that immigrant communities are directly impacted. “Our immigrant communities have always been right about this: We are Floridians, too, and deserve the same respect, compassion and due process as anyone else in this state. Florida’s authoritarian experiment cannot continue unchecked, and we are confident the court will see that there is no lawful authority for Florida to operate this immigration facility.”

Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, called Florida’s effort unprecedented. “It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system. The lack of accountability and resulting deprivation at this remote and inhumane detention camp in the Florida Everglades is exactly why Congress has made it unlawful and directed only the federal government to have custody over noncitizens as they go through the immigration system.”

The lawsuit names a wide range of defendants, including the heads of the Florida Department of Corrections, Florida Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida National Guard, Florida State Guard, and other state agencies. It also names Matthew Mordant, a private contractor employed by Critical Response Strategies who serves as the warden of Alligator Alcatraz. Florida has argued in other litigation that these officials “have legal custody over people detained at Alligator Alcatraz” and are responsible for its operations.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs are seeking a class action on behalf of all current and future detainees at the facility, which has a capacity of 3,000 people. The complaint asks the court to issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring Florida from detaining anyone at Alligator Alcatraz, followed by a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment that the state lacks legal authority to operate the detention center.

If successful, the lawsuit could shut down what critics describe as an unlawful and dangerous experiment in state-run immigration detention, one that advocates say has already inflicted irreparable harm on hundreds of people in its first weeks of operation.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, free for now from jail, could be deported to Uganda. Here's what to know

The Trump administration plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined a plea deal involving deportation to Costa Rica, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.

He was released from a Tennessee jail on Friday after his case attracted significant attention amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

Abrego Garcia's attorney's court filings show the administration requested he appear at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday and could be deported again.

As his story takes yet another turn, here’s what to know:

Doctors in Gaza say patients' protruding ribs and bony limbs offer evidence of malnutrition

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Not long after Texas surgeon Mohammed Adeel Khaleel arrived at a Gaza City hospital in early August, a 17-year-old was brought in with gunshot wounds to both legs and one hand, sustained when he went to collect food at an aid site.

In the emergency room, Khaleel said he noted the ribs protruding from the teen's emaciated torso, an indication of severe malnutrition. When doctors at Al-Ahli Hospital stabilized the patient, he raised his heavily bandaged hand and pointed to his empty mouth, Khaleel said.

“The level of hunger is really what’s heartbreaking. You know, we saw malnutrition before, back in November, already starting to happen. But now the level is just, it’s beyond imagination,” Khaleel, a spinal surgeon on his third volunteer stint in Gaza, said in an interview.

On Friday, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, the leading authority on global hunger crises, said for the first time that parts of Gaza are in famine and warned that it is spreading. For months, U.N. agencies, aid groups and experts had warned that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive were pushing the territory to the brink.

In the 24 hours following the famine announcement, eight people in Gaza died of malnutrition-related causes, bringing the overall toll of such deaths during the war to 281, according Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. A U.S. medical nonprofit working in Gaza says one in six children under 5 is affected by acute malnutrition.

Israeli strikes and gunfire kill 33 as Gaza City becomes focus of famine and a military offensive

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 33 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, including people sheltering in tents or seeking scarce food, local hospitals said as a famine in Gaza’s largest city puts new pressure on Israel over its 22-month offensive.

Israel's defense minister has warned that Gaza City could be destroyed in a new military operation perhaps just days away, even as famine spreads there.

Aid groups have long warned that the war, sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and months of Israeli restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza are causing starvation.

Israel has rejected the data-based famine declaration as “an outright lie."" Ceasefire efforts are on hold as mediators await Israel’s next steps.

Israeli strikes killed at least 17 people in southern Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to morgue records and health officials at Nasser Hospital. The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis.

Trump ran on a promise of revenge. He's making good on it

Donald Trump ran on a promise to use the powers of the government for revenge against those he believed wronged him. He now appears to be fulfilling that campaign promise while threatening to expand his powers well beyond Washington.

On Friday, the FBI searched the home of John Bolton, Trump’s first-term national security adviser-turned-critic, who last week in an interview called the administration “the retribution presidency.”

Trump's team has opened investigations of Democrat Letitia James, the New York attorney general who sued Trump’s company over alleged fraud for falsifying records, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who as a congressman led Trump's first impeachment. The Republican administration has charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., over her actions at an immigration protest in Newark, New Jersey, after arresting Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat. Under investigation, too, is former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a candidate for New York City mayor.

Trump has directed prosecutors to investigate two other members of his first administration: Miles Taylor, who wrote a book warning of what he said were Trump’s authoritarian tendencies, and Chris Krebs, who earned the president’s wrath for assuring voters that the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was secure.

The actions look like the payback Trump said he would pursue after being hit with four separate sets of criminal charges during his four years out of office. Those included an indictment for his effort to overturn the 2020 election that was gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts while in office.

Texas redistricting fight shakes up battle lines for both parties in key US Senate race

HOUSTON (AP) — Just as Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred was holding a town hall near the Mexican border as part of an “unrig Texas” campaign tour, the state’s Democratic fundraising powerhouse Beto O’Rourke rallied support in Austin for lawmakers who left the state to delay a redistricting plan led by President Donald Trump. The next morning, one of those wayward lawmakers, James Talarico, stood in the pulpit at former President Barack Obama’s old church in Chicago to say he and his fellow legislators had simply taken a leap of faith.

All three Democrats are either declared or potential contenders for the Senate seat on the ballot in next year's midterm elections. In what would typically be a quiet period in Texas politics, Republicans have roiled the state's 2026 Senate campaign with their rush to redraw congressional maps to give Trump more allies in Congress. The turmoil impacts contenders in both parties and gives Democrats fresh hope that they can capture a long-elusive seat, where an upset would dramatically improve their chances of regaining Senate control in Washington.

For Democrats, the GOP power play offers a new way to stand out as fighters against Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.

For Republicans, including incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, it’s a Trump loyalty test. Cornyn publicly called for involving the FBI in rounding up the defiant Democrats. His main primary challenger, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, used his current office to ask state courts to remove departed lawmakers from office and to jail O’Rourke for raising funds to support the Democratic legislators. The clash has also been a welcome distraction from recent questions about Paxton's private life.

Trump, meanwhile, had his eyes on the U.S. House when he openly prodded Texas Republicans this summer to give him five more GOP seats in a state he won handily last year. He hoped to avoid losing a slim House majority, as he did during his first term in 2018.

Fed Chair Powell faces fresh challenges to Fed independence amid potential rate cuts

WASHINGTON (AP) — Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.

For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.

It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.

Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is “no inflation” and saying that a cut would lower the government’s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.

Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.

Pope affirms right of people to return home after unjust exile in meeting with Chagos refugees

ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV strongly affirmed the right of people to return to their homes after an unjust exile, issuing the message during an audience Saturday with refugees from Chagos, the Indian Ocean archipelago that is home to the strategic U.S.-U.K. military base.

“No one can force them into exile,” history's first American pope said.

Leo met with a delegation of about 15 refugees from Chagos, some 2,000 of whom who were evicted from their homes by Britain in the 1960s and 1970s so the United States could build a naval and bomber base on the largest of the islands, Diego Garcia.

Displaced islanders fought for years in U.K. courts for the right to go home. In May, Britain and Mauritius signed a treaty to hand sovereignty over the islands to Mauritius that allows resettlement, while still ensuring the future of the base.

Leo told the refugees he was “delighted” the treaty had been reached, saying it represented a “significant victory” in their long battle to “repair a grave injustice. He praised in particular the role of the Chagossian women in peacefully asserting their rights to go home.

Texas Gov. Abbott says he'll swiftly sign new maps on his desk that will boost GOP in 2026

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday promised to quickly sign off on a new, Republican-leaning congressional voting map gerrymandered to help the GOP maintain its slim majority in Congress.

“One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said in a statement.

Texas lawmakers approved the final plans just hours before, inflaming an already tense battle unfolding among states as governors from both parties pledge to redraw maps with the goal of giving their political candidates a leg up in the 2026 midterm elections.

In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has approved a special election to take place in November for residents to vote on a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more House seats next year.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has pushed other Republican-controlled states, including Indiana and Missouri, to also revise their maps to add more winnable GOP seats. Ohio Republicans were also already scheduled to revise their maps to make them more partisan.

Texas lawmakers give final approval to redrawn congressional map favoring GOP, send to governor

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate gave final approval to a new, Republican-leaning congressional voting map early Saturday, sending it to Gov. Greg Abbott for his signature.

President Donald Trump has pushed for the map to help the GOP maintain its slim majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. It has five new districts that would favor Republicans.

Abbott, a Republican, is expected to quickly sign it into law, though Democrats have vowed to challenge it in court.

The effort by Trump and Texas’ Republican-majority Legislature prompted state Democrats to hold a two-week walkout and kicked off a wave of redistricting efforts across the country.

Democrats had prepared for a final show of resistance, with plans to push the Senate vote into the early morning hours in a last-ditch attempt to delay passage.",,N,,2025-08-24 11:57:25.998674

BBC News, Bristol

A group of anti-immigration protesters have been outnumbered by counter protesters as they demonstrated against hotels housing asylum seekers.

About 50 people planned to meet in Castle Park in Bristol to oppose the government scheme and march through the city, but they were met by about 250 counter protesters.

Avon and Somerset Police said there were ""moments of disturbance"" but that the protests went without ""significant incident"".

One woman was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, and officers detained other individuals at points, but they have all been de-arrested.

The main police operation has been stood down, but there will be a presence in the city centre until 07:00 BST on Sunday and a dispersal zone, which allows officers to move on groups or individuals causing, or likely to cause, harassment, alarm, or distress to others.

Mounted police held the two sides back from each other for almost two hours near The Galleries car park, blocking the road during confrontational scenes.

None of the officers suffered serious physical injury or needed hospital treatment, but the force said there will be enquiries after reports of assaults on them.

Chief Insp Keith Smith said: ""Our priority today has been to enable lawful peaceful protest for both groups.

""Our officers have dealt admirably with a really challenging situation, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank them for their professionalism.

""While there were moments of disturbance, we're pleased to say the two protests have passed without significant incident.""

He explained the force had worked with the city council to try and minimise disruption to the public and thanked people for their patience. There was a road closure, but that has been lifted.

Bristol City Council said it has no plans to challenge the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers in the city.

Councillor Tony Dyer, leader of Bristol City Council, said: ""Bristol is a long-established place of sanctuary. We are a diverse city and are proud to welcome and provide safety for people seeking sanctuary from a wide range of backgrounds.

""As a City of Sanctuary, we will continue to support and show compassion to people when they need it most.""

He added: ""Our focus is on working collaboratively to improve conditions for people seeking sanctuary and fostering compassionate and resilient communities in Bristol.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/990b/live/c1260e00-8024-11f0-b1b6-55b80ab19c47.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:56:36.357694

Wired magazine has interesting coverage on the uptick of cellphone searches at the U.S. border.

Apparently CBP searched 14,899 devices between April and June, which would be nearly 5K a month! The previous record was 12,766 devices searched January through March in 2022. (Thanks, Biden.)

Most of the recent searches have been ""basic"" as opposed to ""advanced."" Here's Wired's explanation:

Basic searches can involve a border agent manually scrolling through someone’s phone and inspecting its contents. This means an agent may be able to find some information on a device but may not have the time or ability to conduct a deep inspection of what is included in messages or buried in photo reels. Meanwhile, advanced searches involve a much more intrusive approach: connecting forensics tools to the device to extract huge reams of data.

CBP claims unrestricted authority to search electronic devices--whether they belong to citizens or noncitizens. As the ACLU advises, it's best to travel across borders with ""as little data and as few devices as possible.""

In videos circulated by immigrant rights groups, he shared long, tearful embraces with his wife, children and other family members. He expressed his gratitude to the people who had not abandoned him.

“Thank you for everything,” Mr. Abrego Garcia told his older brother, Cesar, as he wept in his arms.

But the celebration of his homecoming has been muted. For Mr. Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old immigrant who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and returned to the United States in June, the odyssey is not over: The federal government has threatened to deport him to Uganda, his lawyers said. So for now, he and his family are keeping a low profile, with Mr. Abrego Garcia required to use an ankle monitor and largely staying out of the limelight.

Mr. Abrego Garcia, who was in the United States without permission, became a defining face of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration when he was deported, prompting outrage from immigrant rights advocates and heightening fear and anxiety among other immigrants in the country.

A sheet metal worker, Mr. Abrego Garcia had been living for years in Prince George’s County in Maryland when he was sent to El Salvador, alongside more than 260 detainees, with no due process. He was sent back in June to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee, where he was held in jail until Friday. His lawyers said the Trump administration’s threat to deport him to Uganda was an attempt to “coerce” him into a guilty plea in the smuggling case.

It was not immediately clear exactly why the Trump administration chose Uganda as the place to potentially send Mr. Abrego Garcia. Initially, federal prosecutors had said that if Mr. Abrego Garcia pleaded guilty to his charges and agreed to stay in custody until Monday, they would send him to Costa Rica, where they said he could live safely, after whatever sentence he is given in that case. But after his lawyers did not agree to keeping him in jail beyond Friday, the administration said if he does not accept their plea deal by Monday, they would start the process to deport him to Uganda.

The federal government has extended its lease on a downtown Milwaukee property used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to federal lease records and the building’s owner.

The property at 310 E. Knapp St. is owned by the Milwaukee School of Engineering but will remain in use by the federal government through at least April 2026, with options to extend through 2028, said JoEllen Burdue, the college’s senior communications director.

“We do not have immediate plans for the building and will reevaluate next year when we know whether or not the government wants to extend the lease,” Burdue said.

The lease was originally scheduled to expire in April 2025.

With a new ICE facility under construction on the city’s Northwest Side, the downtown lease extension raises the possibility that the federal government is expanding local immigration infrastructure or enforcement. This would be consistent with other forms of expansion in immigration enforcement, statewide and nationally.

“I’m upset and concerned about what this means for my immigrant constituency. For my constituents, period,” said Ald. JoCasta Zamarripa, who represents the 8th District on the South Side.

Immigration infrastructure

The Knapp Street property is used by ICE as a field office for its Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to ICE.

This includes serving as a check‑in location for individuals under ICE supervision who aren’t in custody and a processing center for individuals with pending immigration cases or removal proceedings.

According to a Vera Institute of Justice analysis, the number of people held at the Knapp Street location has been increasing.

The Vera Institute is a national nonpartisan nonprofit that does research and advocates for policy concerning incarceration and public safety.

The most people held by ICE at a given time at that Knapp Street location during the Biden administration was six. On June 3, 22 people were held there – also exceeding the high of 17 during President Donald Trump’s first administration, according to data from Vera Institute.

The office generally does not detain people overnight but can facilitate transfer to detention centers that do.

The functions carried out at the Knapp Street office mirror those planned for the Northwest Side facility.

City records show the West Lake Park Drive property will be used to process non-detained people as well as detainees for transport to detention centers.

The records also state that the property will serve as the main southeastern Wisconsin office for immigration officers and staff.

The U.S. General Services Administration, the federal government’s real estate arm, initially projected the new site would open in October. However, a spokesperson said there was no update and did not confirm whether that timeline still stands.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to NNS’ requests for comment.

Rise in immigration enforcement

As local immigration enforcement grows, so does enforcement throughout the state and the rest of the country.

Nationally, the number of immigrants booked into ICE detention facilities increased in less than a year – from 24,696 in August 2024 to 36,713 in June 2025, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse is a nonprofit at Syracuse University that conducts nonpartisan research.

Not only are more people being detained, but they are being detained for longer, said Jennifer Chacón, the Bruce Tyson Mitchell professor of law at Stanford Law School.

A July 8 internal memo from ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons instructs agents to detain immigrants for the duration of their removal proceedings, effectively eliminating access to bond hearings.

Eighty-four of 181 detention facilities exceeded their contractual capacity on at least one day from October 2024 to mid-April 2025, according to a July report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The Dodge County Jail, which ICE uses to detain people apprehended in Milwaukee, is one of the facilities that exceeded its contractual capacity. On its busiest day, it held 139 individuals – four more than its 135-bed limit.

In addition to Dodge County, Brown and Sauk county jails have also entered into agreements with ICE to house detained immigrants, according to records obtained by the ACLU of Wisconsin.

ICE’s unprecedented budget

Noelle Smart, a principal research associate at the Vera Institute, notes that it remains unclear whether increased immigration enforcement drives the need for more detention infrastructure or expands to catch up with more infrastructure.

But, Smart said, with ICE’s unprecedented new budget, the question of which one drives the other becomes less relevant.

Trump’s proposed ICE budget in 2025 was $9.7 billion – a billion more than ICE’s 2024 budget. An additional $29.85 billion was made available through 2029 for enforcement and removal as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“We know this administration intends to vastly increase the number of people subject to arrests and detention, and we expect to see increases in both given this budget,” Smart said.

“The abysmally low levels of refugee resettlement reportedly under consideration would leave U.S. allies and other refugees in the U.S. resettlement pipeline stranded and at risk for even longer,” added Acer.","Washington, D.C. — In response to reports that the Trump administration is considering capping refugee resettlement at 40,000 refugees or less for fiscal year 2026, with a majority of spots given to white South Afrikaners, Human Rights First called on the administration to use refugee resettlement to bring to safety Afghan, Nicaraguan, Sudanese and other refugees facing grave risks who qualify under the law as refugees.

“The United States must not turn a blind eye to refugees who have suffered political, religious and other persecution,” said Eleanor Acer, Senior Director for Global Humanitarian Protection at Human Rights First. “The freeze on refugee admissions and the misuse of refugee resettlement for white Afrikaner migration have left thousands stranded in danger—facing violence, family separation, and prolonged uncertainty. Afghan refugees left stranded in Pakistan and other places face escalating risks of return to Taliban persecution. Refugee resettlement is not only a lifeline—it is essential to U.S. national interests, easing pressures on frontline host countries, and promoting stability. The Trump administration should honor U.S. commitments and save lives by prioritizing resettlement of refugees who face real dangers of persecution, including those in the U.S. resettlement pipeline who have been left stranded at risk for many months now. The last thing the administration should do is play politics with a program that is needed to save the lives of people who worked with and trusted the United States.”

Human Rights First urges the United States to relaunch a strong resettlement initiative for refugee populations including:

Afghan refugees in danger of Taliban persecution including family members of U.S. servicemembers, refugees with ties to the U.S. military or mission, journalists, women and girls, refugees at risk of religious persecution, and human rights advocates.

Nicaraguans targeted due to their political dissent or religious views, often unsafe even after escaping to countries nearby.

LGBTQI+ refugees who fled their country yet remain trapped facing persecution, violence and other harms due to their sexual or gender identity in the country to which they fled.

Refugees who fled political, religious and other persecution in Sudan, South Sudan, China, Venezuela, and other places.

The approximately 120,000 refugees already conditionally approved for U.S. resettlement, as well as many others who had been referred to the U.S. program.

“The abysmally low levels of refugee resettlement reportedly under consideration would leave U.S. allies and other refugees in the U.S. resettlement pipeline stranded and at risk for even longer,” added Acer. “The administration should provide a stronger resettlement goal that will save lives, fulfill U.S. commitments and demonstrate that the U.S. honors its promises to people who placed their trust in us.”",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:57:02.193665

In the letter, Pettersen requests information from DHS and ICE about recent enforcement actions, including where they occurred, who was targeted or detained, how operations were conducted, and whether agents followed established guidelines to protect families and sensitive community spaces.

According to Pettersen’s message, Chaffee is one of several communities across the country that have reported ICE activity involving masked agents, driving unmarked vehicles. They simply show up in communities with no warning to anyone, including county leadership or law enforcement.

Serious concerns have been raised by community members, local officials, and advocates, including the lack of transparency and government oversight of these operations.

In keeping with her long-standing focus on families, Pettersen added the impacts on families, including being afraid to go to school, work, or even seek medical care. She cited what occurred in aan ICE raid in 2019 in Mississippi, when children returned home to empty homes with no one to care for them.

“Across the country, ICE is terrorizing immigrant communities, conducting raids in secret, and pulling people off the streets into unmarked cars,” said Pettersen. “Unfortunately, now Chaffee County has confirmed multiple detentions, leaving our community paralyzed with fear and unanswered questions. If ICE is going to carry out their operations in our communities, then we deserve full transparency and accountability for what happened in Chaffee County – and we need it now. I’ll continue to exercise my Congressional oversight authority to get the answers we are owed.”

The full text of Pettersen’s letter, in which she asks several important questions, is below:

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons:

I write to express my deep concern about the immigration raids that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted in Chaffee County, Colorado. These raids have created widespread terror in immigrant communities.

While local law enforcement did not assist ICE in the immigration enforcement activity in Chaffee County, we know that immigration enforcement actions wreak havoc on communities and make it more difficult for state and local law enforcement to build and maintain trust with the communities they serve. According to a 2024 study by the CATO Institute, policies that increase information sharing between immigration enforcement and state and local law enforcement increased the targeting of Hispanic people for crime by 16 percent. In other words, these policies resulted in an additional 1.3 million crimes against Hispanic people over a two-year period. There is longstanding evidence that undocumented immigrants are less likely to contact the police if they have been the victim of a crime out of fear the interaction will result in immigration enforcement actions. It is for this very reason that many police chiefs and

There are an estimated 6.1 million U.S. citizen children who live in households with an undocumented family member. These children suffer tremendously when their parents or their friends’ parents are taken away. The fear of potential enforcement actions causes anxiety among children, hurting their ability to succeed in the classroom. In addition, the detention and deportation of a parent, has a profound effect on a child’s health. Children whose parents are detained and/or deported are likely to suffer from mental health issues including post-traumatic distress disorder, exhibit behavioral problems such as anxiety and withdrawal, and experience higher rates of poverty and diminished access to food.

Further, previous raids have resulted in serious harm to communities. Following raids in August 2019 in Mississippi, reports emerged of young children returning to empty homes. Sheriff’s deputies had to go door-to-door looking for kids who had no one to care for them. At the time, the local Sheriff said his agency would cooperate with the federal government if required to carry out mass deportations, but that these actions “would severely hurt this area of Mississippi” by diminishing trust between the Sheriff’s department and the community. Small businesses also reported a sharp decrease in sales.

In the interest of exercising proper Congressional oversight of DHS and ICE, I request that you immediately provide the following information:",https://arkvalleyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-07-at-11-30-08-U.S.-Representative-Brittany-Pettersen.png,N,,2025-08-24 05:57:22.389516

ET: This article has been updated with comment from an ICE spokesperson.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are not expected to be at schools in the nation's capital when classes kick off on Monday, acting director Todd Lyons recently told NBC News.

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement Saturday that ""ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at or 'raiding' schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.""

The statement continued: ""If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. The initiative has seen an intensification of ICE raids across the country, with thousands of people having been swept up, arrested, and detained. Shortly after taking office, Trump threw out Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies to limit where ICE arrests can take place, granting it the right to conduct raids in places of worship, schools, and hospitals.

The nation's capital has been in the limelight over the past few weeks after Trump said on August 11 that the city had been ""overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people."" He has deployed federal troops, officers and agents to Washington, D.C., as part of a crackdown on crime and homelessness.

What To Know

As the school year is kicking off across the U.S., the first day of class for D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) is on Monday, August 25. Lyons told NBC News in an interview earlier this week that ""day one, you're not going to see us,"" but noted that there might be circumstances when ICE officers may need to come to schools in the future.

Lyons said one of those circumstances might be to conduct safety and wellness checks on students, stating, ""We want to use our special agents and our officers to go ahead and locate these individuals. And if [there are] some we haven't, and the last known address was at a school, we just want to make sure that child is safe. If we have the opportunity to reunite that parent with that child, that's what we want to do.""

Lyons noted that under ""exigent"" circumstances would officers arrive at school, including ""something violent going on."" Nationwide, there have been several ICE arrests of parents at school property, including one at an Oregon preschool. In addition, some students, including a teenage boy in Los Angeles, have also been detained.

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement Saturday: ""In many situations, the only last known address ICE has for a child is the last school they attended. In cases where a special agent visits a school, it would be for a wellness check on the child, not to make an arrest. These visits are designed to assess whether children are receiving appropriate care and ensure they are not being trafficked, exploited or abused.""

A Stanford University researcher reported in June that ICE ""raids increased student absences from schools because parents fear being separated from their children,"" finding ""recent raids coincided with a 22 percent increase in daily student absences with particularly large increases among the youngest student.""

ICE has repeatedly maintained that it's targeting people without proper documentation and criminal histories, and is working to expand its force with an addition 10,000 agents. The agency received billions in funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill.

What People Are Saying

An ICE spokesperson told Newsweek: ""ICE Homeland Security Investigations is dedicated to locating the more than 300,000 unaccompanied children that came in through the border under the last administration. Sadly, during those four years, many of these children who came across the border unaccompanied were placed with unvetted sponsors who were actually smugglers and sex traffickers.""

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel said at a press conference this week: ""I think people who have that concern for themselves personally and for all of us who are concerned for them and their safety are making adjustments.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a previous statement shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

What Happens Next?

ICE is looking to significantly increase its force, offering signing bonuses up to $50,000, student loan payments, tuition reimbursement and starting salaries that can approach $90,000.

An ICE agent responds by claiming that having a work permit does not mean that one has legal status in the U.S.
A forest service officer says that the family was the closest in proximity to the parking lot, so officers approached them first.
Reith said that immigrant rights activists have not seen many large-scale ICE raids in Arkansas so far.
Immigrants do seem to be targeted for traffic or other minor violations, and then are questioned about their legal status, Reith said.","Immigrant advocates are expressing concern after a video began circulating on social media earlier this week that showed federal agents questioning and detaining a family at a popular swimming spot in Pope County.

In the video, officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and the U.S. Forest Service can be seen approaching the family at Long Pool Recreation Area, a park on Big Piney Creek that is managed by the Forest Service. The video shows the agents checking people’s IDs, asking about one man’s green card, and detaining at least two men and forcing them into a white van.

AIRE Arkansas, an immigrant rights activist organization, wrote in a social media post that everyone in the video had legal status and the people detained were eventually released.

A woman in the video tells ICE agents that one man being questioned has a work permit. An ICE agent responds by claiming that having a work permit does not mean that one has legal status in the U.S.

According to KATV Channel 7, a person familiar with the incident said agents came to Long Pool in response to a littering complaint, though it’s not clear why ICE would investigate supposed littering. Organizers with AIRE speculate that someone called the police on the family simply over the color of their skin and their speaking Spanish.

In the video, one woman asks why police are questioning them and not the other people in the park. A forest service officer says that the family was the closest in proximity to the parking lot, so officers approached them first. One officer says they were going to question others in the park as well, though the video does not show them doing so.

The video shows family members, including children, visibly distressed and upset over the situation, and it shows marks and cuts on the detained men’s wrists from the handcuffs after they were let go.

In a phone call Friday afternoon, Mireya Reith, executive director of the immigrant rights group Arkansas United, said the climate in the state and around the U.S. has grown more difficult due to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. In this atmosphere, people might hear others speaking Spanish and call ICE on them.

Reith said that, unfortunately, it is legal to call immigration authorities on people. But, she added, it is still illegal for law enforcement to racially profile people. And it is legal for people to document interactions with ICE and other law enforcement — including by taking videos — especially if they think they were racially profiled.

Reith said that immigrant rights activists have not seen many large-scale ICE raids in Arkansas so far. Rather, the efforts seem more individually targeted and coordinated with state and local. Immigrants do seem to be targeted for traffic or other minor violations, and then are questioned about their legal status, Reith said.",https://arktimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screen-Shot-2025-08-23-at-11.15.36-AM.png,N,,2025-08-24 05:57:25.845518

Then you see what appears to be a federal employee come up from behind him and slam him to the ground. Then others come in and drag him.

His attorney writes, “as a result of the August 16, 2025 assault and battery, Mr. Herzberg experienced memory loss, fear, confusion, pain, difficulty concentrating, nausea, suffering and interference with normal life activities.

Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, released a statement, saying: ""Kilmar Abrego García deserves his day in court, but Trump Administration officials — who continue to make public statements about his case that have been expressly repudiated by the courts — would rather insult judges and circumvent our justice system than uphold people's constitutional rights.""

Abrego Garcia has lived for years in Prince George's County with his American wife and children; he immigrated to the U.S. illegally. In 2019, an immigration judge denied his application for asylum but granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a ""well-founded fear"" of violence, according to court filings. He was required to check in yearly with ICE while Homeland Security issued him a work permit.

(AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Abrego Garcia’s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.

“The government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego’s release with outrage,” the filing reads. “Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.”

In a filing, the lawyers asked courts to dismiss the case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia on grounds that it is a vindictive attempt to punish him for challenging his initial deportation to El Salvador.

The attempt to deport Garcia to far-flung Uganda in East Africa adds a dramatic new twist to a saga that become a test case for Mr Trump’s harsh crackdown on illegal immigration – and, critics say, his trampling of the law.

His lawyers’ filing was an addition to an earlier one asking judges to dismiss the case.

Word of the new press to deport him came a day after he was freed and allowed to go home to Maryland pending trial on human smuggling charges.

This followed a tortuous saga in which he was mistakenly deported to a notoriously rough prison in El Salvador, then returned to US soil only to be detained again.

A judge ordered his release on Aug 22 but the latest news means he might again be expelled, this time to Uganda under a new, harsh Trump administration scheme of sending undocumented migrants to distant, even war-torn countries where they know no one.

Abrego Garcia denies any wrongdoing, while the administration says he is a violent MS-13 gang member who smuggled other immigrants.

On Aug 21, when it became clear Abrego Garcia would be released the following day, government officials made him a plea offer: remain in custody, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, his lawyers said in the filing.

He declined the offer.

“The government immediately responded to Mr Abrego’s release with outrage,” the filing states.

“Despite... assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) representative informed Mr Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,” it added.

The case has been a messy tug of war.

The government admitted it had mistakenly sent him

to El Salvador’s notorious maximum security prison in March.

The US Supreme Court later ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia.

He was returned in June, and then quickly arrested and charged with trafficking undocumented migrants.

On Aug 22, he was released from prison in Tennessee on a judge’s order.

At that point he had not seen his family in more than 160 days.

The case has become emblematic of Mr Trump’s rough crackdown on illegal migration.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president’s toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not notify the sheriff's office nor the man's public defender before the arrest, sparking concerns over safety and a potential for ""blue on blue"" incidents

ASHEVILLE – As a Buncombe County man walked from the county courthouse to his car in the late morning Aug. 21, armed officers working with ICE pulled up in an unmarked SUV and grabbed him in the middle of a crosswalk, multiple officials confirmed to the Citizen Times.

The sudden arrest created safety and transparency concerns, said Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller and attorneys familiar with the incident. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not notify the sheriff’s office nor the man’s public defender, Timothy Henderson, before the arrest, they said.

The arrest comes amid a sharp rise in ICE activity across the country and in North Carolina since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, with similar uncoordinated arrests outside the Mecklenburg County courthouse, according to reporting by the Charlotte Observer.

James Mills, an Asheville private defense attorney, was standing outside the courthouse on College Street, around 11 a.m. when an unmarked, gray Ford Exhibition — with 30-day tags — stopped at the median in the westbound lane, he told the Citizen Times.

Mills estimated it took “less than 3 seconds” for three officers “decked out in tactical gear” to jump out of the car and reach the man, identified by his public defender as Jediael Amaya Sanchez, 46.

At least one officer carried a ""tactical AR-15"" and two wore bulletproof vests, according to Mills. One vest displayed “U.S. Marshals” and another said some form of “police."" A photo of the interaction shows two officers in ballcaps and holstered handguns.

Standing about 20 feet away, Mills said he was not close enough to see whether the officers showed any other identification.

“It was tactical law enforcement coming after people,” Mills said. Within 4 minutes, the officers drove off with Amaya Sanchez in the unmarked SUV, he estimated.

Sheriff: could have escalated to 'blue on blue' incident

Amaya Sanchez appeared in court Aug. 21 for a hearing on a civil complaint filed Aug. 11, from someone who requested a no-contact order be entered against him, court records show.

A bailiff was asked to escort Amaya Sanchez to his car, after he expressed concern that the person who filed the complaint would find or harass him at the parking garage as she had done before, according to Henderson.

Mills said the bailiff appeared confused when the officers jumped out of the SUV, but backed away as the officers took Amaya-Sanchez.

Sheriff Miller, through his attorney, Jorge Redmond, said Aug. 22 that he was concerned about a possible “blue on blue” incident that can result from misidentification and poor communication.

A person with federal credentials had entered the courthouse and asked about courtroom locations but never notified local law enforcement before the arrest outside, Redmond said via email Aug. 22.

“As Sheriff of Buncombe County, ‘We are a community of We’ and it’s the responsibility of the Sheriff’s Office to make certain that all law enforcement actions conducted on or near the courthouse are done safely, transparently, and in coordination with our office for the safety of the community,” Miller told the Citizen Times via email.

A regional ICE spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Aug. 21 and 22.

Increase in ICE activity state- and countrywide

As the Trump administration works toward its goal to deport 1 million immigrants annually, ICE arrested 1,822 people in the North Carolina from Jan. 20 to June 26. That’s a 170% increase from the same time period in 2024, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by North Carolina Public Radio.

ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons and Deputy Director Madison D. Sheahan have said the agency is targeting removal of violent criminals and the “worst of the worst.”

But in North Carolina, ICE is arresting fewer convicted criminals. In the first six months of 2024, under the Biden administration, 67% of people arrested had criminal convictions. In 2025, that percentage dropped to 46%. About 34% of those arrested this year had no criminal convictions.

Protests against the increased ICE actions have been taking places across the country the past year, including ""No Kings"" protests that drew large turn outs in Asheville and Hendersonville.

‘I don’t know where he is’

Alexa Velen Amaya received a rushed call on Aug. 21 from her father’s number.

“Agents came for me. I’m not sure how or why. They told me they are immigration. I don’t know where I’m being sent. I don’t know what their contact number is,” Velen Amaya told the Citizen Times Aug. 21 from her home in Texas.

She said all he could share is his nine-digit identification number. Since then, all her calls and texts to her father have been left unreturned.

“I’m frustrated. I’m not OK with this,” she told the CItizen Times by phone, her voice breaking with emotion.

Velen Amaya, 22, described her father as a generous man and a meticulous mechanic. He owns a car shop in Asheville, where he’s lived for over 20 years, after leaving Mexico in search of better living conditions. She said her dad is the type of person to offer his car, his clothes, his food, even his own mobile home, to anyone who needs it.

“My dad is always trying to do the right thing, according to his community. People like that are not the type of people you need to get out of this country,” said Velen Amaya, who lived in Asheville for 10 years.

Her biggest fear is that her father will get lost in the detention system. For the 24 hours after his arrest, Velen Amaya had no idea where her father was. An ICE database shows he was moved to a detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, as of Aug. 22. Velen Amaya said she was not informed.

“He’s not the first case and he’s not going to be the last case, but I just want him to have justice,” she said.

Two weeks before ICE detained him, Amaya Sanchez was found not guilty in a Buncombe County jury trial. A man claimed that Amaya Sanchez had broken into his mobile home and assaulted him, according to his arrest warrant. A different person pleaded guilty to the crime in 2024.

After a five-day trial, a jury agreed Amaya Sanchez was innocent, records show. His only prior convictions were three traffic related charges and infractions, according to court records.

“We got a good result for a great guy. That should have been the end of the story,” Henderson told the Citizen Times Aug. 21.

The day the verdict was read Aug. 8, the man’s wife in the jury trial claimed Amaya Sanchez tried to run her over with his car in the parking deck outside the courthouse, records show. Two days later, she filed a no-contact order and a magistrate warrant, leading to Amaya Sanchez’s pending charges of assault with a deadly weapon and communicating threats.

In North Carolina, any citizen can initiate criminal charges through a magistrate. Henderson said he believes the accusation to be baseless. For Henderson, it represents a regular “abuse” of no-contact orders that drag “what are essentially neighbor disputes into a public forum.”

“He came to the courthouse seeking justice. He came to this courthouse to clear his name and that’s not enough,” Henderson said.

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) notified his lawyers that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

Later on Friday, ""the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his lawyers wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia's native El Salvador. He would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defence. An email from ICE sent to lawyers at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.

""Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),"" it states.

Trump activated the National Guard in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of an effort to slash violent crime in the nation’s capital.

Touting the operation’s success — at least 465 arrests have been made — Trump has signaled he intends to broaden the D.C. mission to other cities. ""We’re going to make it safe, and we’re going to then go on to other places,"" he told federal agents and Guard troops Thursday at a D.C. patrol center.

On Friday, Trump added, ""I think Chicago will be our next. And then we’ll help with New York.""

The White House insisted that the operations are separate.

""The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President’s actions to stop crime in DC,"" the official said.

The deployment of 1,700 National Guardsmen was first announced on July 25 in a Pentagon press release. Their roles include collecting personal data, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing detainees so ICE agents can focus on enforcement.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the use of federal armed forces for civilian law enforcement is generally prohibited. But the National Guard will operate under Title 32 Section 502F authority, which does not apply to Posse Comitatus.

At the request of DHS, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in July approved hundreds of additional forces for ICE support and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status.

""We understood ICE’s needs at that time to be more administrative in nature… as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different,"" a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

Meanwhile, 2,279 National Guard soldiers and airmen from Washington, D.C., and six states are already mobilized in the capital, having completed training, according to a Joint Task Force spokesperson.

The spokesperson described the figures as an ""estimate"" but said they are the most accurate available.

Under direct presidential authority, Guard members have been posted to monuments, checkpoints and traffic stops across all eight wards, with a mission of deterring crime and maintaining a visible security presence.

At Hegseth’s authorization, those Guard members can now carry weapons if needed. But unlike the states, where Guard forces fall under governors’ command, in D.C. they operate under direct presidential authority.

Although the Pentagon framed the mobilizations differently, as ""a support pillar to a nationwide crackdown on crime and illegal immigration,"" the White House argued that planning for National Guard activations in 19 states for DHS logistical support preceded Trump’s comments within the last 48 hours about replicating enforcement efforts seen in Washington, D.C., in other parts of the country.

""This isn’t new, nor is it tied to the President’s efforts to address violent crime in D.C. DoD announced last month that National Guard troops would assist DHS with clerical support and other logistical tasks for processing illegal aliens at ICE facilities,"" a White House official said. ""It is separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown.

""Bottom line: The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President’s actions to stop crime in D.C.,"" the official added.

National Guard forces are carrying out presence patrols across Washington, D.C., including at Metro stations, Union Station, the National Mall and alongside U.S. Park Police.

Officials have also linked the D.C. operation to beautification efforts ahead of next year’s 250th Independence Day celebration.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29 and originally from El Salvador, has been charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Tennessee with conspiring to transport illegal immigrants into the US.

He was released from federal detention on Friday after being held since March, when he was arrested and then deported back to his home country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

In a new filing to the Tennessee court on Saturday, Mr Garcia's defence lawyers said that immigration officials threatened the 29-year-old with deportation to Uganda earlier in the week.

According to the filing, while he was held in Putnam County Jail on Thursday, Mr Garcia declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and remaining in prison.

After he left jail on Friday, ICE notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

That same day, the Trump administration ""informed Mr Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning - precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office - to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever"".

Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Mr Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded in a statement and said: ""A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community.

""This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.""

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Mr Garcia's attorneys, said he would ""fight tooth and nail against any form of deportation to Uganda"" or nearby countries in Africa.

""It is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn't even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options,"" he said. ""This family has suffered enough.""

However, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg appeared to suggest that deportation to Costa Rica might be favourable for his client, saying: ""That's a pretty reasonable option, right? I mean, Costa Rica makes sense.

""It's a Spanish-speaking country. It's proximate to the United States. His family can visit him there easily.""

Mr Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his American wife and son, was deported to El Salvador under a controversial 18th-century law. He was then imprisoned in its notorious maximum security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).

This was despite an immigration judge's 2019 order granting him protection from deportation after finding he was likely to be persecuted by local gangs if he was returned to his native country.

Democrat senator Chris Van Hollen, who met Mr Garcia in CECOT, said the 29-year-old was ""traumatised"" by the experience.

The Trump administration admitted that deporting Mr Garcia was an ""administrative error"", but said at the time they could not bring him back as they do not have jurisdiction over El Salvador.

After eventually returning him to the US in June, the Trump administration detained Mr Garcia on criminal charges that were filed in May.

The criminal indictment alleges Mr Garcia worked with at least five co-conspirators to bring immigrants to the US illegally and transport them from the border to other destinations in the country.

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, US President Donald Trump, vice president JD Vance and other officials claim Mr Garcia was a member of MS-13 - an international criminal gang formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's civil war to protect Salvadoran immigrants from rival gangs.

Abrego Garcia plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family prior to his March deportation.","The Trump administration may try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda following his release from criminal custody, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official and a notice sent by government officials obtained by CBS News.

Hours after Abrego Garcia — who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year — was released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee on Friday, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, the official said.

The notice said he may be deported to the East African country ""no earlier than 72 hours from now,"" not including weekends.

Earlier in the week, CBS News was first to report that Uganda had agreed to a U.S. request to accept deportees who are not its citizens, becoming the latest ""third country"" to strike a deportation agreement with the second Trump administration.

A native of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months, before being returned to the U.S. and jailed while awaiting trial on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.

In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers revealed that the Trump administration had offered their client a ""last-ditch"" plea deal that would see him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his criminal sentence. They submitted in federal court a letter from a Costa Rican government official that said the Central American country had agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and provide him legal status there.

But after Abrego Garcia declined that deal and was released from pre-trial detention, his lawyers confirmed they were notified by the Trump administration that he could face deportation to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was also directed to show up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. His lawyers said he has been told he has until then to accept the Costa Rica deal, or it will no longer be on the table.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Uganda deportation threat bolsters their argument that the Trump administration's prosecution of their client is vindictive.

""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" they wrote in the filing Saturday.

The Trump administration has indicated for months that if Abrego Garcia is let out of jail, ICE could detain him and seek his removal from the U.S. yet again.

In 2019, an immigration judge ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country. The Trump administration said he was deported there anyway due to an ""administrative error.""

Still, the government could legally seek Abrego Garcia's deportation to Uganda or another ""third country"" other than El Salvador — a practice the Trump administration has increasingly used for undocumented immigrants in recent months.

Abrego Garcia plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family prior to his March deportation. Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled last month that the government must give him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate deportation proceedings. But she didn't prohibit the government from seeking his removal, writing that immigration agents ""may take whatever action is available to them under the law.""

The school's principal, Valerie Jurado, said in a statement to families of students that although she was unaware of any affiliation between the vehicles and any government agencies, she acknowledged how the belief made people uneasy.

""We understand how unsettling this report is and we stand with our community in our desire for ALL our students to be in a safe learning environment,"" Jurado wrote. ""Our teachers and staff remain ready to support our students and ensure a day of calm and learning.

""We encourage our parents and community to take care of one another and support one another during times of uncertainty like this. School communities should be sacred spaces where all students deserve to obtain a high quality education, and all families feel welcomed.""

Jurado reminded parents that ICE agents were not allowed on campus without a signed warrant. The San Diego Unified School District has a dedicated webpage to explain rights, regardless of immigration status: www.sdusdequity.com/protecting-students.

""At this time, there is no indication of any enforcement activity on our campus, and all students and staff are safe,"" Jurado wrote.

Patrick Divver, field officer director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in San Diego, said while the vehicles in the video were operated by ICE agents, they were not there for any operation at the school.

""At no time did ICE conduct enforcement activity on school grounds, nor did any officer exit their vehicle while briefly in the parking lot. Any suggestion otherwise is completely false,"" he told City News Service. ""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers. As a result, the officers pulled into the first available parking lot.

""The interference of activists in law enforcement operations creates unnecessary risks to themselves, the community, and our officers. These actions hinder our ability to remove individuals who pose a threat to public safety and contribute to misinformation that endangers everyone involved.""

Members of the San Diego Self-Defense Coalition, Union del Barrio and Association of Raza Educators, who responded to reports of the vehicles around 6:40 a.m. on Friday, shouting warnings to nearby communities members about an immigration action were planning to host a news conference outside the school at 4 p.m. to condemn ICE actions at schools.

""Immigration and Customs Enforcement has continuously said they are not conducting immigration enforcement actions on school properties, and today's actions contradict their statements,"" the activist groups wrote in a joint statement. ""We condemn the campaign of terror that has been unleashed in migrant working-class communities and the targeting of families with school aged children in and around school facilities.""

Earlier this week, ICE arrested a man near Park Dale Lane Elementary School in Encinitas while on his way to work.

Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.

""We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,"" a letter from the district to families said.

The immigration agencies sent KPBS a statement Wednesday night confirming the arrest and said the man was undocumented and from Guatemala. ICE said in the statement the man was alone in the car when he was stopped and that the woman and child seen in the video arrived at the scene as the arrest was taking place.

""ICE San Diego finds it unfortunate that an individual chose to insert a child into an active law enforcement situation,"" the statement read, before criticizing statements released by public officials such as ""before the facts of this case were fully known.""

Earlier this month, ICE agents arrested a parent outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista during the morning drop-off period. Cell phone footage captured by bystanders and posted online showed federal agents approaching a vehicle on the street.

Divver said in a statement that a woman who had been ordered deported in absentia by a San Diego immigration judge in 2022 was arrested.

""The arrest was part of ICE's ongoing enforcement efforts and was resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds. The school was not involved in the incident, and there was no impact on students, staff or the school premises,"" Divver said.

The arrest prompted Chula Vista Elementary School District Superintendent Eduardo Reyes to inform families and staff in a letter that protocols were in place preventing unauthorized access to schools and limiting law enforcement officials from interacting with students unless there's an active emergency or warrant.

""We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces for all students,"" Reyes wrote.

Reyes recommended that families create a plan for the district to care for their children ""in the event that you are unable to pick them up or drop them off due to unforeseen circumstances.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b76b83/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F13%2F4a%2F14ff509e45cfa39bf3825e7b1d25%2Fap25027710663013.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 22:57:52.213476

Dozens of nearby protesters held signs decrying the crackdown on immigrants, telling reporters their beef was with Noem, not the Coast Guard.","President Donald Trump’s deportation henchmen appear to have dramatically increased the use of Coast Guard aircraft to transport immigrants, according to flight data, activist flight trackers and video confirmation.

Since June 23, the majority of flights operated by the Coast Guard C-27J Spartan fleet — at least 263 flights — are likely to have been for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), transferring immigrants to and from ICE’s nexus of detention centers in Alexandria, La., Harlingen, Texas, and the Florida Everglades camp known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” according to an analysis of public flight data.

On August 13 and August 22, Rolling Stone watched as federal agents loaded shackled immigrants onto Coast Guard aircraft in Baltimore.

The Coast Guard’s larger propeller aircraft, the HC-130H Hercules and HC-130J Super Hercules, also appear to be operating ICE flights, though to a lesser degree. Flight data for the C-130 fleet show at least eight flights to and from Alexandria or Harlingen since late June.

Like federal emergency funds being used for immigrant detention centers, and agents across the federal government being directed to snatch up delivery drivers in their militarized takeover of Washington D.C., the Coast Guard flights are yet another example of the Trump administration funneling vast federal resources toward its mass deportation machine.

“A Coast Guard C-27 conducted a mission today at the request of ICE and landed at BWI airport,” a Coast Guard spokesperson says, explaining: “The Coast Guard continues to surge assets and leverage its unique capabilities to protect America’s borders, territorial integrity and sovereignty by assisting with the national transport of aliens to designated locations where the Department of Defense will transport the aliens internationally.”

The spokesperson adds that “three USCG aircraft are currently being used” for ICE, which is consistent with the flight data for August 22. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment. ICE deferred to DHS.

Editor’s picks

“It seems like a misuse of Coast Guard assets to me,” says Tom Cartwright, the retired JPMorgan executive who has been tracking ICE flights since 2020. “And you have to wonder why it’s been kept so quiet.”

The Coast Guard, which is part of DHS, has a wide-ranging purview protecting U.S. maritime interests, which includes search-and-rescue missions, disaster response, and enforcing fishing laws. It also does drug and migrant interdiction, which generally means surveilling and intercepting suspected smuggling vessels in the water.

Coast Guard aircraft have been used for a handful of ICE flights in the past, but hauling prisoners across the country is far afield from its normal duties — particularly for the C-27, which until recently was primarily used for search and rescue.

The C-27 missions follow a similar pattern, leaving their stations in Clearwater, Fla., or Sacramento, Calif., flying to the ICE hubs of Alexandria or Harlingen, and spending the next week flying out-and-back trips to midsize cities like Baltimore, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Kansas City, and Tampa — “NFL cities,” as one activist, “JJ in DC,” describes them — where ICE has been active. Of eight Coast Guard C-27s that have operated since mid-June, all but one appears to have been dedicated to ICE flights. They have landed at the tent camp in the Everglades nine times beginning on July 23 and as recently as Thursday.

The trips have become so regular that JJ in DC was able to figure out their schedule and predict their next moves.

Rolling Stone went to a public parking lot next to a loading area at the back of Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on August 13 to observe an incoming C-27.

Once it landed and taxied to the loading area, the aircraft’s back ramp opened and three vehicles pulled up toward it — an unmarked van, an unmarked SUV, and an SUV with a DHS seal. Federal agents and guards removed a shackled man from the aircraft and put him into the DHS SUV. Agents spent about an hour signing paperwork, chatting, and loading plastic bags holding immigrants’ belongings into the aircraft, while a Coast Guard pilot did a walk-around safety check for the next flight.

An agent carried an armful of chains to the van, and a short time later, seven people shackled at the hands and ankles were led from the van to the aircraft’s ramp, where they were patted down. All of them appeared to be men, ranging in age from late teens to forties. All appeared to be brown or Latino.

Once they were loaded onto the aircraft, the shackled man in the marked SUV was moved again to the unmarked van. Soon afterward, the agents appeared to notice they were being filmed from the public parking lot and put on hoodies and balaclavas. Two marched toward the fence dividing the loading area from the lot and filmed a random guy who had just parked there.

The man removed from the C-27 and one of the men loaded onto it were wearing gray sweatsuits often issued to immigrants in detention centers, while the other men were wearing their own clothes, suggesting ICE was transporting a mix of people who had been in their custody for some time and some who had been recently arrested.

On August 22, the C-27 parked in an area farther away from the public parking lot. About nine people in unidentified uniforms got off the aircraft from the boarding door and walked to a nearby charter jet. Federal agents then loaded several shackled people, at least one in a gray sweatsuit, up the back ramp. The charter jet flew to Charlotte, N.C.; the C-27 returned to Alexandria.

In addition to the midsize cities, Coast Guard has apparently operated ICE flights to these cities since late June: Biloxi, Mississippi; Columbus, Georgia; Dallas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Indianapolis; Knoxville, Tennessee; San Antonio; Springfield, Missouri; and Tallahassee. All are near ICE detention facilities.

Immigrants have long reported harsh conditions, safety problems and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by guards onboard ICE flights. Like the men in Baltimore, all adult passengers on ICE flights are shackled at the wrists and ankles. (This may be the case for some immigrant children, too.)

Flight attendants for GlobalX, which currently operates the majority of ICE flights, told ProPublica in April that when they raised concerns about how shackled passengers could safely evacuate in the event of an emergency, they were told to “just get up and leave.” In July, activists watching a Seattle airport livestream spotted ICE-contracted guards push to the ground a shackled immigrant with a hood over his head while boarding an ICE flight on Avelo Airlines.

Which detention centers people in ICE custody are transferred to is based largely on capacity, according to the agency, which often results in people being moved multiple times and hundreds or thousands of miles away from their homes. Advocacy groups say this cuts off immigrants from their families and legal assistance, and that frequent and capricious transfers can be used to punish people in ICE custody.

“We’re told that it is a question of logistics, sometimes it often appears that these transfers may be retaliatory in nature, because people are trying to access counsel,” says Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “There is also a suspicion that authorities may be transferring people for more favorable case law in different areas of the country.”

For example, when Georgetown professor Badar Khan Suri was detained in March on specious allegations of ties to Hamas, he was sent on a week-long journey to five different facilities, each farther away from his home in Arlington, Virginia, according to court documents. He ended up in a dirty, overcrowded facility in Alvarado, Texas, despite there being plenty of room at two of the facilities in Virginia where he was briefly held. (Suri was released in May and settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration earlier this month.)

In another case first reported by Capital B News, Haitian national Rony Dieujuste was moved from Palm Beach County to Miami, then to Texas, Arizona, and California. At one facility, he and other detainees had unexplained nosebleeds; at another he slept on a bare metal platform. His American partner struggled to keep tabs on him using ICE’s detainee locator system and would only find out he’d been moved when he called her from a new facility, often in the middle of the night.

“I told him to remain strong. But he is breaking,” she told Capital B in June.

“It takes a huge toll on families, especially when they’re so far away,” Cho says. “It’s as if somebody has died or has disappeared.”

It is unclear how many times on average immigrants in ICE detention are transferred before their cases are resolved, because ICE does not release this data. Nor does it release data about its massive — and growing — air operation.

It’s that lack of transparency that compelled Cartwright, the former JPMorgan exec, to start tracking ICE flights nearly six years ago. He releases meticulous monthly reports frequently cited by the media.

“I just believe the public has a right to know what the scale of this operation is,” he says. “When things are opaque like this and basically totally dark, no one thinks about the people on the planes.”

Cartwright began noticing the Coast Guard’s presence in Alexandria and Harlingen in July, but did not include those flights in his statistics for the month because he wasn’t yet sure they were ICE flights. Now he is certain, he says, and he and Human Rights First — the nonprofit he recently announced is taking over his flight-tracking operation — are working to amend the June and July reports to include them. Even before the additions, Cartwright recorded more ICE flights in July than ever before — 727 domestic transfer flights and 207 deportation and third-country removal flights — on ICE’s network of charter airlines, private jets, and a growing number of military aircraft.

Cartwright also noted that when the Coast Guard assisted ICE in the past, it released public statements about that assistance. This time, the Coast Guard appears to have adopted ICE’s stance of saying little.

On Wednesday, NBC News reported that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wanted to use billions in funding from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” for ICE to buy and operate its own fleet of 30 or more aircraft. That same day, Air Force members received an email, obtained by journalist Marisa Kabas, inviting them to take part in a program “supporting border operations.”

Noem has been living rent-free in a spacious home designated for the Coast Guard commandant, The Washington Post reported last week. Trump fired the previous commandant, Admiral Linda Fagan, on the second day of his second term, accusing her of an “excessive focus” on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

It was a big treat as I was growing up when I got to see the Ice Capades in Seattle. Somehow, I owned a pair of ice skates, which never got used. I knew I could never skate like they did in the Ice Capades; there was no ice skating rink nearby, anyway. But I was enthralled, and still am.

The governmental ICE Escapades of today are unacceptable, unAmerican, atrocious acts. People are being snatched from schools, from their homes, from their places of business, even their places of worship. And then, in most cases, deported to some third-world gulag.

My mother’s best friend in high school was carted off to a WWII internment camp. I was obliquely aware of the trauma that haunted my mother for years afterward with the loss of her friend.

Now it’s rampant throughout our Democracy, as people are whisked away, and, as far as we can tell, possibly never to return home. Parents are taken by masked marauders, leaving their children behind, or in some cases deported with their young children. I’m not sure which is worse, having children deported or merely leaving them behind, with no parent. There’s no easy answer to that.

The following YouTube video illustrates more than we want to know, yet it is imperative that we not shut our eyes.

Remember when we had that COVID outbreak? Remember who refused to wear masks? Yet, in order to. hide their identities, and to look menacing, these ICE agents are now wearing intimidating masks as they make their way through American communities.

Taylor, who served as a deputy chief of staff at DHS under Trump’s first term, was asked by MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart about the raid and whether he is concerned about the administration’s next moves.

“Yeah, we expect it. I mean, really, we expect it,” he told Capehart. “And that’s what is so surreal about this is we can all hear as we’re talking about this, be so certain of the president’s revenge campaign to know potentially who that next target might be or one of those next targets.”

The former DHS aide added, “I mean when my wife and I woke up and saw the news, she basically said to me, ‘It’s coming.'”

The FBI confirmed Friday that “court-authorized law enforcement activity” was conducted in the area of Bolton’s home in Bethesda, Md. The search was reportedly related to his handling of classified information.

The search of Bolton’s home and office marked an escalation in the feud between Trump and his former national security adviser, with critics seeing it as a potential act of retribution.

Taylor, who previously suggested the president kept a “blacklist” for persecution, said as much in his appearance Saturday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.”

“Folks don’t have to play the violin for John Bolton or Miles Taylor. Maybe they don’t like either of us. That’s fine, because it’s not about us,” he told the panel. “It’s about the criminal justice system that all Americans expect to be able to treat them fairly.”

“It’s a president of the U.S. weaponizing the tools of his office to reshape our society. And he’s doing that. He’s making sure the scales of justice tip in his favor,” he continued, adding later, “There’s no telling where this could go next.”

Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that he was not told ahead of time about the raid but expected to be briefed later. Bolton has often criticized his former boss over foreign policy decisions. He was also a witness during the president’s first impeachment probe.

Vice President Vance defended the FBI’s moves in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” which will air Sunday, pushing back on allegations that the raid is related to retribution.

His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
“It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.” 113","NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.

The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.

Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.

Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.

Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.

“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.

Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”

“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.

Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.

The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.

The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

Court documents Saturday showed President Trump’s administration plans to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he turned down an offer to be sent to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges.

His case has attracted attention amid Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges, which the Maryland resident denies.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead attorney in his lawsuit against the Trump administration, said in a statement Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client by “attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language.”

Abrego Garcia’s attorney’s court filings show the administration requested he appear at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday and could be deported again.

In a statement Friday at his release, Abrego Garcia said he saw his family for the first time in more than five months.

“We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served,” he added.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denounced the decision to free Abrego Garcia, stating that the administration will not stop fighting until he’s out of the U.S.

The Trump administration casts him as an MS-13 gang member and immigrant smuggler.

Abrego Garcia and his attorneys reject those claims. They portray him as a family man and construction worker who was arbitrarily deported and vindictively charged.

As his story takes yet another turn, here’s what to know:

The Costa Rica-Uganda offer

The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement told his attorneys he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities Monday.

Later Friday, the government told Abrego Garcia he has until first thing Monday to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table, his defense attorneys wrote.

They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.

Filed along with the court brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face the possibility of detention.

Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, “A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes ... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.”

The Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he should report to immigration authorities on Monday in Baltimore to face deportation.

Uganda has agreed to a deal to accept certain migrants being deported from the United States.

‘Well-founded fear’ of returning to El Salvador

Abrego Garcia, 30, grew up in El Salvador and fled at 16 because a local gang extorted from and terrorized his family, court records state. He traveled to Maryland, where his brother lives as a U.S. citizen, but was not authorized to stay.

Abrego Garcia found work in construction and met his future wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura. In 2018, he moved in with her and her two children after she became pregnant with their child.

In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he was detained by local police, court records state. He was suspected of being in MS-13, based on tattoos and clothing.

A criminal informant told police Abrego Garcia was in MS-13, court records state, but police did not charge him and turned him over to ICE.

A U.S. immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia’s subsequent asylum claim because more than a year had passed since his arrival. But the judge granted him protection from being deported to El Salvador, determining he had a “well-founded fear” of gang persecution there, court records state.

Abrego Garcia was released and placed under federal supervision. He received a federal work permit and checked in with ICE each year, his lawyers said.

‘Audacity to fight back’

In February, the Trump administration designated MS-13 a foreign terrorist organization. In March, it deported Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador, violating the U.S. immigration judge’s 2019 order.

Abrego Garcia later claimed in court documents that he was beaten and psychologically tortured while held at the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele denied the allegations.

The Trump administration described its violation of the immigration judge’s 2019 order as an administrative error. Trump and other officials reiterated claims that Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.

Vasquez Sura filed a lawsuit to bring her husband back. The Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in June after a Supreme Court order. But it brought human smuggling charges against him.

The smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding, during which Abrego Garcia was driving with nine passengers. Tennessee police suspected human smuggling, but allowed him to drive on and didn’t charge him.

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty.

His lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case based on “vindictive and selective prosecution.”

Deportation fears realized

U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes in Nashville ruled in June that Abrego Garcia has a right to be released from jail while he awaits trial.

But Abrego Garcia remained in a Tennessee jail at his attorneys’ request for about 11 weeks over fears that ICE would immediately try to deport him.

Thomas Giles, an assistant director for ICE, testified in July that Abrego Garcia would be detained as soon as he’s freed.

U.S. officials argued Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because an immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.

Judge provides some protections

In response to concerns Abrego Garcia would be deported without due process, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis prohibited ICE from immediately detaining him upon release in Tennessee.

Xinis, overseeing the lawsuit in Maryland, ordered restrictions on ICE in late July. She required any removal proceedings begin in Baltimore.

Xinis also ordered that ICE provide three business days’ notice if it intends to initiate removal proceedings.

The Trump administration has “done little to assure the Court that, absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected,” Xinis wrote.

Electronic monitoring and home detention

Soon after Xinis’ order, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys asked the federal judge in Tennessee to release him.

Holmes, the U.S. magistrate in Nashville, released him Friday, requiring Abrego Garcia to stay with his brother in Maryland and be subjected to electronic monitoring and home detention.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cda1f0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/10934x5740+0+774/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F29%2F17%2F6eba3c0f4869a240854c2aedeba4%2Fd735ec074dc04cf9a6b8e904c244352b.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 18:57:02.071125

The Foreign Secretary has ramped up security efforts to prevent would-be asylum seekers from reaching the UK amid concern over a “spike” in attempts.

Government officials have noted a big increase in the number of people from sub-Saharan Africa trying to enter Britain on fake student and healthcare visas.

It comes as Labour struggles to grapple with the small boats crisis, which has seen asylum applications hit a record 111,000 during its first year in office.

Sir Keir Starmer is under huge pressure to significantly cut levels of illegal migration after Reform pledged to run five deportation flights a day if it wins power.

The Foreign Office has dispatched immigration experts to countries in West Africa, including Ghana and Nigeria, to try to shut off the air route into the UK.

British officials are working with local police to crack down on people smugglers and helping airline staff to improve security checks and spot fake visas.

Mr Lammy said: “Tackling irregular migration demands cooperation across borders and industries to disrupt the pathways used by those attempting to enter the UK illegally.

“We are strengthening partnerships with our partners in West Africa, the airline industry, and enforcement agencies, to secure our borders and deliver on the Plan for Change.

“Together we are sending a clear message – air travel simply isn’t an option without proper authorisation and registration.”

‘Spike’

Ministers said that last year saw a “spike” in the number of fraudulent attempts to enter the UK by air with fake documents from sub-Saharan Africa.

More than 250 would-be asylum seekers were stopped, with student and health and social care visas amongst those that are most commonly forged.

Some of those people were then arrested and successfully prosecuted in their home countries for attempting to illegally travel to Britain.

Smuggling routes

Ministers have also stepped up joint policing efforts with Western African nations to try to take down organised crime groups running smuggling routes.

UK experts are working with the local authorities in Ghana to trace the gangs that are supplying false travel documents to migrants.

Similar work is under way in Nigeria, where an Organised Immigration Crime Unit has been set up to target smugglers exploiting the UK visa system.

It comes as Sir Keir is under growing pressure after figures showed that asylum claims and the number of migrants in hotels are up under his government.

There were 111,000 asylum claims in the year to June, up 14 per cent on the previous year and higher than the previous peak of 103,000 in 2002.

The number of migrants in hotels also rose during Labour’s first 12 months in office to 32,059, though it remains below the 2023 peak of 56,000.

Sir Keir has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels, which have become the scene of protests across the country over the last few weeks.

Nigel Farage has looked to capitalise on growing public anger over the Prime Minister’s failure so far to bear down on illegal immigration.

This weekend, the Reform leader unveiled a blueprint for the “mass deportation” of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers if he wins the next election.

He told The Times that he would pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights and launch five deportation flights every single day.

Abrego Garcia turned down a deal to be sent to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to human smuggling charges. Now the administration has requested his appearance at an immigration facility in Baltimore on Monday, at which point he would be facing a second deportation.

Why does the Trump administration care so much about Abrego Garcia?

The case of Abrego Garcia has been a messy ordeal for the government. He was initially swept up as part of Trump's war on undocumented migrants.

Abrego Garcia has a US wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. However, he immigrated to the United States illegally.

The White House depicted him as a member of the violent MS-13 gang and a people smuggler, justifying his deportation to a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador.

However, Abrego Garcia was under a court protection, issued in 2019, saying that he faced ""well-founded fears"" of violence if he was returned to his home country.

The US Supreme Court ordered the US government to ""facilitate"" his return after the Trump administration admitted it had sent him there by mistake.

He was returned in June, and then detained and charged with smuggling undocumented migrants. On Friday, he was released from the Putnam County Jail in Cookville, Tennessee, on the basis of a judge's order.

Abrego Garcia sees family again for first time in over 160 days

The legal struggle over Abrego Garcia's future has turned him, to some extent, into the face of those impacted by Trump's hardline immigrant policies.

His lawyers have called the government's continued pursuit of their client a vindictive attempt to punish his challenging of the original deportation.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reacted with anger over his release on Friday, saying the administration will continue until ""this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.""

At the same time, migrant rights organization CASA released a statement quoting Abrego Garcia as saying it was a ""very special day"" after seeing his family for the first time in almost six months.

""We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served,"" Abrego Garcia said, according to CASA, which described him as a ""symbol of strength, resistance and hope.""

The truck Francisco Longoria was driving the morning of August 16 was parked in the driveway of his home, where Friday's news conference took place. A smashed window and bullet holes could be seen on the passenger side of the vehicle.

""We're here to call upon city, county and state officials, asking them to investigate this shooting because there is a lot that we don't know,"" attorney Jason Sanchez said at the news conference.

Both parties involved, the Department of Homeland Security and Longoria, have differing versions of events on August 16.

According to an Aug. 17 DHS summary of the event, a person refused to exit his vehicle during an attempted traffic stop while a targeted immigration enforcement operation was taking place. The agency said the man ""drove his car at the officers,"" striking two.

At that point, the officers fired multiple shots at the vehicle, which had three people inside at the time. No one was struck and the driver escaped the scene.

Longoria's account, as told by his attorneys, claims that he was driving home when several people stopped him in an unmarked car. Individuals wearing different uniforms and masks approached his truck, ""some with guns drawn, and attempted to gain access to his vehicle, without identifying themselves and without presenting a warrant,"" Sanchez said. ""They then smashed the window in an attempt to gain entry to the vehicle and hit Mr. Longoria.""

Shots were allegedly fired into the passenger side of the truck where the teenager was sitting, as Longoria fled, according to attorneys. Sanchez said at the news conference that DHS has identified the masked individuals as their agents, and he said they claim they were acting in self-defense.

Longoria's family said earlier that he has lived in the United States for 23 years but has been continually denied citizenship. His three children are U.S. citizens and the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice said earlier that the man has no criminal record.

""Where is their warrant? Why were they shooting if they feared they were going to be run over? Why were they shooting at the passenger side of the vehicle? Where are those bullet casings? Where is any other video? Why if there was a shooting, hasn't there been an investigation yet?"" Sanchez said.

""Those are the answers we would like to know.""

And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors.
While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross.
Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president.
No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.","Republican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.

On Aug. 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force.

Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a white man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.

“Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won’t be mayor very long because we’ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it’s supposed to be run,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday, calling the city a “crime-infested rat hole.”

Earlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.

Using the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.

And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.

While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”

“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.

“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”

For Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit.

In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.

Though Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.

“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”

Victoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.

“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”

Wendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.

“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”

The manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.

The president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.

Crockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”

Black women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.

Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”

In Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.

“I thought: ‘Hell no,’” Collier said in a video released to the public.

Collier settled in for her long night on the House floor with a blue eye mask and white-and-red blankets and a small Texas flag that marked a page in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” She abruptly left a video call with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday after someone off screen informed her she faced a felony charge for speaking from the Capitol.

Scott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now. Mayors are able to directly communicate with constituents in ways that may have been more limited in the past. Plus, social media platforms allow the public to see the impact of troops on the streets in these heavily Democratic communities where they are not welcomed.

“There’s a narrative that’s being placed on them, but they’re able to negate those narratives by what they themselves put out there on social media,” she said. “These are folks who are not shying away from the media … they want to talk about what they’re doing.”

Ron DeSantis' administration lacks the authority to run the facility.
Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, ""are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,"" the lawyers argued.
""This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,"" the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit alleges that federal law does not allow the private contractors to be ""deputized to perform any immigration functions.""","Calling it ""exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,"" attorneys for immigrants held at a detention center in the Everglades filed a lawsuit alleging Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration lacks the authority to run the facility.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in the federal court's Middle District of Florida, is the third major legal challenge to the detention center, erected by the DeSantis administration as part of the state's support of President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

Lawsuit argues that federal agreements don't give state agencies authority to operate detention centers

DeSantis and state officials maintain that they are operating the facility through what are known as 287(g) agreements, which local governments can enter with the federal government to provide training and authority to local police to help enforce immigration laws.

But the lawsuit filed Friday contends that the agreements do not give authority to state agencies or their contractors to run detention centers and that the officers who are working at the Everglades facility lack federally required training to participate in immigration-enforcement efforts.

""The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court,"" the lawsuit said.

Operations at the Everglades center, dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by state officials, ""are in stark contrast to typical ICE (federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations,"" the lawyers argued.

The 287(g) agreements are part of a federal law known as 1357(g) that allows states to support federal immigration-enforcement efforts.

""This is an unprecedented attempt to use Section 1357(g) as authority for an independent state-run detention facility,"" the lawsuit said. ""In the thirty years since the statute was enacted, state officers have never claimed the authority to detain people under this statute, other than the short period after an arrest during transport to an ICE facility.""

The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of a detainee identified as ""M.A."" and also are seeking class-action certification in the challenge.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to bar the state from detaining people at the facility and to declare that the state lacks the authority to operate the Everglades detention center.

The federal law ""does not provide authority for state agencies to hold immigration detainees during the removal process. And it certainly does not let them place detention in the hands of untrained, unsupervised private contractors who are not and cannot be deputized to perform immigration functions. By ignoring these standards, Florida has created exactly the kind of disaster that Congress took pains to avoid,"" the lawsuit said.

Questions about Florida's authority were asked in other lawsuits

Questions about the state's authority to run the facility also have been raised in two other legal challenges.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams on Thursday sided with environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida in a lawsuit alleging that state and federal officials failed to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study be conducted before the detention center was erected.

Williams' order gave the state 60 days to begin winding down the facility. Lawyers for DeSantis quickly asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. District Court of Appeals to put her ruling on hold while the state's appeal proceeds.

Lawyers for DeSantis have argued, in part, in that case that the federal environmental law did not apply because the state is operating the facility.

Speaking to reporters Friday morning, the governor — who has fiercely defended the state's immigrant-detention efforts — shrugged off Williams' decision.

""We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do. This is not anything that was unexpected, but we will make sure to get the job done in the end,"" he said.

In a separate lawsuit, attorneys representing detainees allege that people being held at the center have inadequate access to legal representation and confidential meetings with their attorneys.

The latest legal challenge said that court records in the other cases show the facility is ""Florida-owned and Florida-operated.""

""State and federal officials have stated in court filings that Florida exercises 'complete discretion' over operations and over who is detained at the facility,"" Thursday's lawsuit said.

Numerous state agencies have 287(g) agreements allowing their law-enforcement officers to participate in immigration efforts, the lawsuit noted.

""But those agreements do not give any authority to the state agencies themselves — only to those individual employees who have been fully trained and certified by DHS (Department of Homeland Security),"" the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit also said it is unknown how many state officers working at the facility have completed federally required training, which can take months.

DeSantis earlier this month announced that the state plans to convert a shuttered state prison in Baker County into a second immigrant-detention center. That facility will be staffed by members of Florida's National Guard.

The Florida Department of Emergency Management is set to receive $605 million from the Trump administration for the state's immigrant-detention efforts. The department hired contractors to help build and operate the Everglades facility, which can hold up to 4,000 people and is estimated to cost roughly $450 million per year.

The lawsuit alleges that federal law does not allow the private contractors to be ""deputized to perform any immigration functions.""

The lawsuit also alleges that workers at the facility are pressuring detainees to sign voluntary deportation orders.

“As a dual-authority state, like others, the federal government does have the opportunity to call up the National Guard. The president has that authority,” Cox said. “What we’ve said from the very beginning is this: we are willing to work to support the efforts to remove people who are here illegally. However, with a couple caveats.”

Cox said Utah troops would only serve in support roles.

“Our National Guard will not be putting hands on people, will not be arresting people. That is not the role of the National Guard, and we would not allow that to happen,” he said.

He added that Utah has previously offered help with transportation since the state does not have an ICE facility. Moving detainees, he said, often pulls Homeland Security staff away from processing and other responsibilities.

Cox outlined two conditions for participation: The Guard would only assist with support functions, and the federal government must cover all costs.

“That’s where we would be able to help. Condition number one. Condition number two is that the federal government has to pay for this. It can’t come out of state funding,” Cox said. “We’re in active communication with the federal government, and I think that’s true of most states.”

Utah National Guard officials later confirmed they have received a request from the Department of Defense seeking volunteers.

“Yes, we can confirm Utah National Guard has received a request from the Department of Defense through normal channels for volunteers for administrative and clerical support for Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement,” said Lt. Col. Chris H. Kroeber, public affairs officer for the Utah National Guard.

He said the Guard does not yet know what that support will involve and is in the “question-and-answer stages,” working through logistics. The request still requires approval from Cox, though Kroeber said the expectation is that the governor will sign off. Funding, he added, would come from the federal government.

When asked if he would approve deploying Utah troops to other states, Cox said he does not expect that scenario.

“We’ve had the need to deploy the National Guard here before, when we’ve had riots and property damage in Utah when lives were at risk. We’re hoping we don’t need to do that here,” Cox said. “Our job is to make sure we don’t need the National Guard in Utah.”

The issue was also discussed on this week’s , who raised questions about federal authority in Washington, D.C., and whether Trump could expand his efforts to other cities.

John Dougal, former state auditor, said he is uneasy with the trend of relying on the Guard for civilian matters.

“I have serious concerns, law enforcement is trained differently than the military. I hate the fact that we keep deploying the National Guard to this, that and the other,” Dougal said. “I think they have a certain duty they should respond to, and we should not deploy them on all sorts of other matters.”

Dougal also questioned Trump’s reach.

“When the president starts talking about other cities and other places, he doesn’t have the authority to do that,” he said.

Maura Carabello of the Exoro Group said she believes this move is more about showmanship than governance.

“He deploys the military and 48 hours later says 'huzzah, problem solved, children are smarter in D.C.' He will move on to his next victory because that is part of his story arc,” Carabello said.

She argued that the approach is not geared toward long-term solutions.

“He’s not about long-term sustainable solutions; he is about his legacy and what he can do for us, and so I don’t even think he’s looking at public policy. This is not a serious attempt to solve a problem,” she said.

The Home Secretary said yesterday the Home Office will seek to appeal against the injunction forcing migrants to be removed from the Bell Hotel in Epping.

Ms Cooper warned the asylum system would be plunged into 'chaos' if migrant hotels were forced to close as a result of 'piecemeal court decisions' by councils bringing copycat litigation.

It comes after a judge ordered the hotel to temporarily shut after Epping Forest District Council argued it was necessary for 'the safety of nearby residents' and to reduce the threat of 'violent protests'.

Meanwhile, police forces were braced for a wave of protests at hotels across the country this weekend as communities seek to replicate the results of Tuesday's High Court ruling.

The first protests took place in nine towns and cities including Cardiff, Bournemouth, Leeds and Leicester last night – with a total of 32 expected to take place this Bank Holiday weekend.

'That is the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way.'

Abrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay.
His attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.
A U.S. judge in 2019 barred Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador because of concerns that he would be persecuted there.
The administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the notorious MS-13 gang, an accusation that he denies.","U.S. immigration officials have notified Kilmar Abrego Garcia of their intent to deport him to Uganda, his attorneys said in a Saturday filing that accuses the government of pressuring Abrego Garcia to accept a plea deal.

The move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. He had been held there since he was returned to the United States in June to face federal human smuggling charges, which he denies.

In the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment.

Abrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay. His attorneys write that ""within minutes of his release"" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that ""the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,"" ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning.

His attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.

""On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning—precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office—to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his attorneys say.

""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" Abrego Garcia's lawyers write.

His attorneys say in the filing that the administration's threat of deportation to Uganda supports their motion to dismiss the smuggling charges on account of vindictive and selective prosecution.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.

Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE on March 12 and deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador three days later in what the Trump administration has since called an ""administrative error.""

A U.S. judge in 2019 barred Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador because of concerns that he would be persecuted there.

Abrego Garcia's case has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's strict immigration playbook. The administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the notorious MS-13 gang, an accusation that he denies.

Legal, environmental, and reputational risks are no longer isolated incidents but systemic challenges that could reshape the sector.
For CoreCivic and GEO Group, the path forward hinges on their ability to reconcile profit motives with ethical and regulatory demands.","The U.S. immigration detention system has become a focal point of systemic risk for investors, particularly as state-federal partnerships expand under politically charged agendas. The second Trump administration's aggressive push to reopen and scale detention centers—operated by private prison giants CoreCivic (CXW) and GEO Group (GEO)—has created a volatile landscape marked by legal battles, environmental controversies, and reputational damage. For investors, the intersection of policy, profit, and public accountability demands a rigorous assessment of these risks.

Legal Liabilities: A Growing Minefield

The legal challenges facing CoreCivic and GEO Group are no longer hypothetical. The 2025 Washington State Supreme Court ruling mandating minimum wage for detainee labor forced GEO Group to replace unpaid labor with paid staff, costing the company an estimated $17.3 million in back pay and operational adjustments. This precedent, upheld by the Ninth Circuit, threatens to ripple across the industry, as similar lawsuits in California and Colorado test the applicability of state labor laws to federal contractors.

The companies' reliance on “guaranteed minimums” in contracts—where the federal government pays for beds regardless of occupancy—has also drawn scrutiny. A 2023 Office of Inspector General report revealed $160 million in payments for unused capacity at 17 facilities, exposing inefficiencies that could trigger further legal and financial penalties. Meanwhile, state-level lawsuits, such as Leavenworth, Kansas's challenge to CoreCivic's unpermitted detention center, underscore the tension between federal enforcement priorities and local governance.

Environmental and ESG Compliance: A Fragile Facade

While CoreCivic and GEO Group tout ESG initiatives, their operations remain mired in environmental and ethical controversies. The “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida, for instance, drew bipartisan condemnation in July 2025 for conditions including excessive heat, infestations, and inadequate sanitation. Despite ICE's National Detention Standards (NDS) mandating environmental health safeguards, enforcement remains inconsistent.

The lack of state-level oversight exacerbates these risks. Unlike state-run prisons, immigration detention centers are often exempt from local inspections, creating a regulatory vacuum. A 2024 GAO report highlighted ICE's failure to ensure sustained compliance with environmental standards, while Amnesty International and the ACLU documented violations such as poor air quality and unsafe temperatures. These issues not only violate ESG principles but also expose investors to reputational harm as public scrutiny intensifies.

Reputational Risks: A Booming Sector, A Shrinking Social License

The reputational toll on CoreCivic and GEO Group is evident. GEO Group's 2025 appeal of the Washington minimum wage ruling has been framed as a defense of “profit over people” by advocacy groups, while CoreCivic's Leavenworth facility has been labeled an “absolute hell hole” by a federal judge. Such narratives, amplified by media coverage and social media, erode trust and pressure institutional investors to divest.

Morningstar Sustainalytics has assigned both companies a “medium” ESG risk rating, citing persistent human rights concerns. Yet the broader market has shown resilience: CoreCivic and GEO Group's stock prices surged post-2024 amid Trump's re-election and the $45 billion immigration funding bill. This disconnect between ESG metrics and market performance raises questions about the long-term sustainability of their business models.

Investment Implications: Navigating a High-Risk Sector

For investors, the immigration detention sector presents a paradox. While political tailwinds and federal contracts offer short-term gains, the compounding risks of legal penalties, environmental violations, and reputational damage could undermine long-term value. Key considerations include:

1. Litigation Exposure: Monitor ongoing lawsuits in the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which could force nationwide wage reforms.

2. ESG Alignment: Assess how ESG rating agencies might downgrade CoreCivic and GEO Group if compliance failures persist.

3. Policy Volatility: The sector's dependence on partisan agendas (e.g., Trump's detention expansion vs. Biden's alternatives-to-detention policies) introduces political risk.

Investors should also weigh the ethical implications of funding a system criticized for exploiting vulnerable populations. While the sector's profitability is tied to political cycles, the growing emphasis on corporate accountability and ESG compliance suggests a potential reckoning. Diversification or hedging against policy shifts may be prudent strategies.

Conclusion: A Call for Prudent Caution

The expansion of state-federal immigration detention infrastructure under the Trump administration has created a high-stakes environment for investors. Legal, environmental, and reputational risks are no longer isolated incidents but systemic challenges that could reshape the sector. For CoreCivic and GEO Group, the path forward hinges on their ability to reconcile profit motives with ethical and regulatory demands. Investors, meanwhile, must navigate this landscape with a clear-eyed understanding of the risks—and the potential for a paradigm shift in how detention is funded, governed, and perceived.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 17:58:20.692598

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP’S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE The news comes as almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers from Washington DC and six states have been deployed to support law enforcement in Washington DC.
At the authorization of Secretary Hegseth, those National Guard members can now carry weapons if needed for their individual tasks.
A U.S. Defense official said while the mobilizations in 19 states and activation of DC National Guard both fall under President Trump’s larger directive protecting territorial integrity and immigration policies, the missions are distinct and separate.
""Bottom line: The National Guard mobilizing to assist ICE processing with clerical and logistical tasks in several states is not the same as the President’s actions to stop crime in D.D.,"" the official added.","Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are set to mobilize in 19 states in the coming weeks to assist the Department of Homeland Security with President Trump’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, Pentagon officials confirmed to FOX News.

Documents obtained by FOX News show planning for activations in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming – with status effective from August through mid-November. Texas is projected to host the most significant Guard presence.

The National Guard soldiers being mobilized will effectively serve as a support pillar to a sweeping federal interagency effort, while also serving as a visible deterrent force, a U.S. Defense official said. The service members supporting ICE will be preforming case management, transportation, logistical support, and clerical functions associated with the processing of illegal migrants at the facilities. ""The in-and-out processing may include personal data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing of personnel in ICE custody,"" the official said.

TRUMP JOINS POLICE AND MILITARY FORCES IN WASHINGTON STREETS

President Trump has indicated in recent days his administration aims to broaden the DC operation to other states, telling a group of federal agents and National Guard troops at a DC patrol center Thursday, ""We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places.""

On Friday in the Oval Office, Trump said, ""I think Chicago will be our next. And then we'll help with New York,"" Trump said.

A U.S. Defense official told FOX, ""We won’t speculate on further operations, but can tell you that the department is a planning organization and continues to work and plan with other agency partners to protect federal assets and personnel.""

Fewer than 2% of the authorized forces have mobilized so far, but missions coordinated under state governors are projected to expand in the coming weeks – including in Virginia, where approximately 60 soldiers and airmen will begin training August 25th to begin duty by early September, the Virginia National Guard confirmed.

""VNG personnel will not conduct law enforcement functions, and VNG support will not include making arrests,"" a spokesperson for the Virginia National Guard tells FOX. ""VNG Soldiers and Airmen will report directly to ICE leadership at their assigned duty locations but remain under the control and direction of the Virginia Governor and Adjutant General of Virginia.""

The deployment of National Guard troops — a state-controlled reserve force — will allow the U.S. military to provide a more direct role in supporting federal immigration enforcement amid as the Trump administration pushes forward with mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, use of the military for civilian law enforcement is limited – but the National Guardsmen will be mobilizing under Title 32 Section 502F authority, to which Posse Comitatus does not apply. At the request of DHS, in July, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved hundreds of additional forces for DHS-ICE Interior Enforcement support, and switched existing approvals from Title 10 to Title 32 status.

""We understood ICE’s needs at that time to be more administrative in nature…as planning continued, working with our partners, it became clear more that ICE needed something different,"" a U.S. defense official told FOX.

Service members supporting ICE will be performing case management, transportation, clerical functions, and logistical support – which may include data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swapping, and photographing of personnel in ICE custody.

""As you can imagine and appreciate, some of those start to get close to that law enforcement line. So it's best that these people are in a Title 32 status so that we are absolutely staying within the law of what we're doing and providing the appropriate support,"" the official said.

Most deployments remain in the planning and coordination stage with DHS and governors, but documents show operations beginning in Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nevada during the first week of September.

""Under Title 32, the guardsmen are under the command and control of their governors. So, it's up to the governors when they'll bring those forces …as the governors and the states coordinate with DHS, that timeline will differ state by state,"" the defense official said. Vermont declined to activate its National Guardsmen, despite the authorization from the Pentagon to assist the DHS-ICE Interior Enforcement Mission.

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP’S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE

The news comes as almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers from Washington DC and six states have been deployed to support law enforcement in Washington DC. Under direct presidential authority, Guard members were assigned to posts at monuments, checkpoints, and traffic stops in all eight wards, with a mission focused on deterring crime and keeping a visible security presence around the city.

At the authorization of Secretary Hegseth, those National Guard members can now carry weapons if needed for their individual tasks. But DC is different under Title 32. For the states it would be up to the individual governors who act as command and control.

A U.S. Defense official said while the mobilizations in 19 states and activation of DC National Guard both fall under President Trump’s larger directive protecting territorial integrity and immigration policies, the missions are distinct and separate.

""The big question is how long do we stay? Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.

Officials have tied the effort in Washington DC to beautification ahead of next year's 250th Independence Day celebration. But President Trump has hinted he may request the Guard stay in DC for an extended period of time, and then take the operation to other parts of the country.

""We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places,"" Trump said to a crowd of National Guardsmen and federal law enforcement at a DC patrol center this week.

The White House emphasized that planning for National Guard activations in 19 states for DHS logistical support preceded President Trump’s comments within the last 48 hours about replicating enforcement efforts seen in Washington, D.C., in other parts of the country.

Many people, including some of the president’s “Make America Great Again” base have pressured Trump’s DOJ to release more files.","President Trump on Friday said he wouldn’t object to the release of all files tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as requested by the House Oversight Committee.

“I’m in support of them keeping it open. Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, when asked how he felt about the release of documents. “I couldn’t care less.”

“You’ve got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be, you know, people, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach,” he added.

His comments came as the Department of Justice (DOJ) released its first batch of Epstein files to Congress. The move came in response to a subpoena from the Oversight Committee seeking transparency around the documents following weeks of turmoil over the Trump administration’s handling of the case.

The Epstein saga came back into light last month after DOJ and the FBI issued a joint memo concluding that the disgraced financier did not keep a “client list” and that additional documents did not need to be released to the public. The findings rivaled what Attorney General Pam Bondi had suggested months prior, which raised questions on both sides of the aisle around the administration’s vow to be transparent with its probe.

Epstein, who died in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was known to hang out in circles with wealthy businessmen, celebrities and powerful politicians. A Wall Street Journal article earlier this year shed light on Trump’s relationship with the late financier, which the president has brushed off.

Trump said Friday that he’s directed Bondi to provide Congress members with “everything you can give them” amid the narrative that his administration is hiding information.

“The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax,” he added. “So, we had the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency, and the Democrats don’t know what to do, so they keep bringing up that stuff. But it affected them.”

Former President Clinton’s name has also been tied to Epstein, after he allegedly flew more than a dozen times on the convicted sex offender’s plane. Comer said he will be a “prime suspect” in its probe, as lawmakers review the documents.

Polling has shown that most U.S. adults disapprove of the way the Trump administration has handled the Epstein investigation. Many people, including some of the president’s “Make America Great Again” base have pressured Trump’s DOJ to release more files.

The department, at the president’s request, asked the courts to release the grand jury testimonies from Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell — who is serving a 20-year sentence. However, all three requests have been rejected.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has met twice with Maxwell, who was moved to a lower-security prison last month, and the transcript from their conversations were also made public on Friday.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Donald-Trump-Epstein-files-08.23.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-23 14:56:33.139022

The Fort Bliss facility known locally as Camp East Montana rises like a white tent city on a flat desert plain. It falls within the confines of the military base but is visible from El Paso's bustling Montana Avenue and sits adjacent to an unmarked building that is the local headquarters of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

At a cost of $1.2 billion, the camp has capacity to detain 5,000 people. Roughly 1,000 men were being held there in mid-August, according to U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, an El Paso Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, called comparisons between detention centers for people in the country illegally and World War II internment camps “deranged and lazy.”

""The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst – including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists"" she said in a statement.

A Cato Institute analysis of government data in June found ICE was arresting four times more non-criminals each week on the streets than people with convictions. ICE's own data show that 45% of the roughly 59,000 people in custody in mid-August had no criminal record or charges.

Mike Ishii, executive director and co-founder of Tsuru for Solidarity, an immigrant rights advocacy group, said he sees parallels with the current administration “coming in and removing people from their homes, from their workplaces, often with no explanations.”

Ishii, whose family was held at the Minidoka concentration camp in Idaho, said, “Right now, it's very frightening for people,” he said. “In 1941, it was also frightening.”

'No accounts of wrongdoing'

Eighty years ago, Fort Bliss housed dozens of people labeled ""alien enemies"" by the government in a detention camp that included two compounds surrounded by double barbed wire fences, according to Densho.

Smaller numbers of immigrants from Germany and Italy were also sent there after the United States joined European Allies and declared war against those countries.

At least 113 first-generation Japanese Americans were shipped to the base before being sent to other holding areas across the country, according to records compiled by Ireizō, a nonprofit database of Japanese Americans held in internment.

The people detained at Bliss were immigrants. They would be the first in the eventual internment of over 125,000 Japanese Americans across the country, most of them U.S. citizens.

For the vast majority, ""there were no accounts of wrongdoing other than being seen as 'enemy aliens,'"" said Karen Umemoto, director of the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The 1798 Alien Enemies Act

After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the American government viewed Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans as potential traitors, Umemoto said. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt immediately invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to detain people and confiscate their property.

Trump invoked the same law this year to designate some immigrants as ""alien enemies"" and target them for rapid deportation. The Supreme Court has blocked him on certain removals.

The Biden administration also used Fort Bliss to house migrants who crossed the border as unaccompanied children.

Under Biden, the Fort Bliss ""emergency intake site"" run by a private contractor was used to process the children for admission into the United States – not for deportation. Still, survivors and descendants of Japanese internment staged a protest at the facility in 2021 to call attention to the poor conditions there, including problems related to child safety and case management that were later documented in a 2022 federal report.

Asked about the base's history of internment, the Pentagon referred USA TODAY to an Aug. 7 news briefing in which spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson said Fort Bliss would ""be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission, the deportation of illegal aliens.""

Learning lessons from history

At midday on Aug. 21, construction and passenger vehicles came and went from the Fort Bliss camp. Puffy, storybook clouds hung in a pale blue sky.

There was no signage on the road in to announce the facility, other than warnings affixed to plywood: ""All vehicles subject to search. No cameras, cellphones or video recorders allowed.""

The court filing on Saturday said the idea of sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda came after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.

He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation from the US to El Salvador earlier this year.

Abrego Garcia’s case has become a flashpoint in Trump’s hardline, anti-immigration agenda after the Salvadoran national was mistakenly deported in March.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the US in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.

The Costa Rica offer came late on Thursday, after it was clear that Abrego Garcia would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day.

Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family.

Later that day, the US Department of Homeland Security notified his lawyers that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.

“The government immediately responded to Mr Abrego’s release with outrage,” Saturday’s filing by Abrego Garcia’s lawyers reads.

“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning.”

The filing also accuses US officials of “using their collective powers to force Mr Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat”.

“It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness,” it says.

Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his lawyers, who feared the Trump administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a defence.

Questions on due process

Abrego Garcia had been living in the US under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison as part of Trump’s crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers in the US.

But Department of Justice lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran citizen had been wrongly deported due to an “administrative error”.

Abrego Garcia – who denies any wrongdoing – now stands accused of involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and other countries into the US between 2016 and earlier this year.

His trial in his human smuggling case is set to begin in January 2027.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said in a social media post on Saturday that “no matter what you think about Mr Abrego Garcia, if you believe in due process, you should be infuriated” by the effort to send him to Uganda.

“The Trump admin is threatening to dump him in Africa as punishment for not pleading guilty to criminal charges they brought to avoid complying with a court order,” Reichlin-Melnick wrote on X.

The Trump administration has defended its policies, saying the US president was elected on a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in the country’s history.

But Washington’s push to deport people has drawn widespread criticism, with removals to third countries, in particular, fuelling fears that those being sent abroad could face human rights abuses and other dangers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25092821230554_wide-1744658478.jpg?resize=1920%2C1080&quality=80,N,,2025-08-23 13:56:53.992092

The full statement from Patrick Divver, field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in San Diego, is below:

""This is another case of misinformed activists who do not know the breadth and/or have understanding of the lawful enforcement actions taking place inserting themselves and creating unnecessary risks to themselves, the community, and our officers.

Diaz violently resisted arrest and continued to become so combative that officers were forced to fully restrain him, including securing his legs, to protect officer safety and the public. Diaz is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

A new Pew Research Center analysis of census data found about 1.5 million immigrants have left the U.S. this year.

The data doesn't say exactly who is leaving, but the report notes the drop is likely driven by a fall in the number of unauthorized immigrants amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The White House tells Scripps News the data shows President Trump is ""Delivering on his promise"" to carry out mass deportation.

""Fewer immigrants means more job opportunities, higher wages, better benefits, better job security,"" said Kevin Lynn, with the Institute for Sound Public Policy, which opposes increased immigration.

But some economists worry a declining immigrant population could have a negative economic impact.

""Immigrants are generally good for the economy,"" said economics professor Tarek Hassan.

Hassan has researched how immigration impacts the labor market.

""When you deport a large number of people, they essentially take the jobs that they had with them,"" Hassan said.

Immigrants generated $1.7 trillion in spending in 2023, according to the American Immigration Council, and made up nearly one fifth of the total U.S. workforce.

Hassan also says the administration's posture on foreign-born students could hamper economic growth in the future.

Arrests motivated by racial bias are not mistakes on the part of ICE, Rosenbaum says, but illegal acts.","Over half of the immigrants arrested by ICE in that time have had no prior criminal record.

As ICE — facing a quota administration officials have put at 3,000 arrests per day — is carrying out raids in more public places, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a series of statements describing what it says are escalating levels of risk its officers now face. ICE said assaults on officers increased 500% in June, then in July said the increase was 700%. Earlier this month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed ICE now faces a 1,000% increase in assaults. To date, the agency has not shared data to back up these claims.

Individual news reports document various cases of people accused of interfering with ICE officers.

On June 19, Arturo Hermosillo was detained after filming an ICE raid in a parking lot. He said agents told him that he obstructed their path by not moving his car correctly. He was held for several hours in the Department of Homeland Security building in Los Angeles and released without charges.

Job Garcia, a grad student, was detained while filming a raid at a Home Depot after he shouted at an undocumented truck driver not to open the door when agents approached. He was held in a federal jail in Los Angeles for over 24 hours before he was released with no explanation or charges, according to a federal civil claim he later filed.

Adrian Martínez, an employee at a Walmart in Pico Rivera, was jailed for three days after he attempted to intervene to keep ICE from arresting an elderly janitor. A U.S. attorney originally claimed that Martínez punched an ICE agent in the face, but security footage from the Walmart showed the agents throwing Martínez to the ground instead. Martínez is facing a felony charge of impeding or interfering with a federal agent and is working to get the case dismissed in court.

Rosenbaum says that ICE agents are not always following the law, but bystanders’ rights to observe them couldn’t be more clear, regardless of their immigration status.

“Even if you’re a citizen of Mars, you’re allowed to film the government,” he says.

Thornier, though, is the question of what constitutes interference.

Any physical contact with an officer could be considered assault, and any loud noise or disturbance, like shouting or blocking an ICE vehicle, is similarly classified as obstruction, Rosenbaum says.

Any U.S. citizen who is detained has the right to swift processing and access to a lawyer, even if they are not under arrest. This detention should last only a “reasonable” amount of time, with the sole purpose of determining whether a crime occurred.

And unless your phone holds potential evidence related to a crime, it would be against the Fourth Amendment for ICE agents to seize it. “It’s hard to imagine a circumstance in which it would be reasonable to take the phone,” Rosenbaum says.

These rights apply to everyone, in any place where a raid occurs, Rosenbaum says.

Whether authorities follow the law is another question altogether.

ICE arrests others too — and starts deportation efforts

ICE has arrested U.S. citizens who say they were not bystanders filming a raid — they just happened to be in the area — and processed them as if they were undocumented immigrants.

On June 24, agents tackled Andrea Velez, a marketing designer, to the ground as she walked to work in Los Angeles. “They were just telling me that I was being arrested for interfering or resisting arrest,” Velez told reporters. “I don’t think I was. I was just resisting because I didn’t know where I was going to end up or who was taking me,” she said.

She was held in immigration detention for over 24 hours before her citizenship was confirmed to authorities. She says she repeatedly told the ICE agents that she was a citizen, but they doubted her claims. ICE originally charged Velez with assault, but the Department of Justice dropped the charges.

On July 10, ICE agents dragged a U.S. army veteran, George Retes, out of his car at gunpoint and held him for three days in immigration detention, without the opportunity to change clothes, call his family or meet with a lawyer. Retes worked as a security guard at a farm in Camarillo, where ICE agents arrested dozens of undocumented workers. “What happened to me wasn’t just a mistake — it was a violation of my civil rights,” Retes wrote in a statement.

In July, Rosenbaum was part of a group that successfully argued for a temporary restraining order to stop raids in seven Southern California counties due to racial profiling on the part of ICE agents. In a news conference, Secretary Noem called the judge in the case “an idiot” and said: “None of our operations are going to change.”

Even before the current Trump administration’s deportation push, federal auditors found that immigration systems make it possible to deport citizens erroneously. The climate of aggressive enforcement may be enough to make some citizens unsure how they’ll prove their legal status if they encounter ICE.

Rosenbaum says that while people shouldn’t have to carry a passport, anyone concerned about being profiled could consider carrying a photocopy to ease their worries.

More importantly, he says, people whose rights have been violated should file legal complaints in their cases. Arrests motivated by racial bias are not mistakes on the part of ICE, Rosenbaum says, but illegal acts. “The government isn’t supposed to accidentally do anything,” he says.

Even though the government has now acknowledged that it is not heeding all court orders, Rosenbaum says anyone who is the victim of an illegal arrest or detention should seek relief through the legal system, in an attempt to hold law enforcement accountable. There are numerous pro bono civil rights law groups operating in Southern California to avoid legal fees.

“When law enforcement is out of control, as it is right now, it’s not unreasonable to be worried, but you’re better protected by understanding your legal rights than you are by avoiding it for fear of reprisals,” Rosenbaum says. “Your security and the security of the nation depends on you.”

Arrests have lingering effects

Barbara Stone was held in the same room for eight hours. Despite asking for a lawyer “about 15 times,” she says, she was not permitted to talk to one. She was not under arrest, but she was also not allowed to leave.

Rosenbaum called these actions “unconstitutional” and “egregious.”

Then, without issuing charges, the officers released her.

Stone says while she was in custody, she imagined what that same situation would feel like for one of the immigrants she saw arrested outside the courtroom.

“I’m not a victim,” she says, noting how she knew even in the worst case scenario, she would be shielded by systems that would not protect deportees. “I just cannot believe seeing these defenseless people being dragged away in the elevator,” she says. “How can we ever get used to this?”

At first, she thought she would return to immigration court to observe ICE. Now, she has decided to express her support in other ways. She is not afraid of ICE, she says, but does not want to be the center of attention.

Arrests of bystanders have changed the way other activists interact with agents too. The group Stone was with still observes in court, but gives the agents a wider berth when they arrest immigrants.

“I see them with their masks on and I want to say something, but I know that I can’t do that, so I stay silent and I just try to look them in the eye,” says Gretchen Bitterlin, an observer at the San Diego immigration court who volunteers with a different interfaith coalition.

She says she “won’t take the chance” to film the ICE raids she witnesses.

Since returning home, Stone says, the bruises from the agents grabbing her and the scrapes from the handcuffs have faded, but that did not signal the end of the ordeal. After her case was broadcast on national news, Stone’s husband received an anonymous phone call with an AI-modified voice, threatening the couple. They have since decided to add extra security lights to their home. Stone says she is plagued by recurring nightmares, in which people break into her home and she cannot escape.

When agents released Stone at the courthouse after her eight-hour detention, they returned her purse, but not the phone she had used to record video that day. The phone was “a weapon,” they told her. Nearly two months later, she still has not gotten it back.

Abrego was released Friday from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee, where he had been held since his return to the U.S. in June after being mistakenly deported to El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

Immigration authorities were expected to attempt to deport Abrego upon his release. Abrego “may be removed to Uganda no less than 72 hours absent weekends,” a source familiar with the case told NBC News on Saturday.

That is in line with standard procedure that ICE must give immigrants 72 hours notice before removing them to third countries.

Abrego, originally from El Salvador, had a withholding of removal order from 2019 that prevents his deportation to his home country due to concerns that he would be persecuted by violent gangs.

The removal order was violated when the Trump administration accidentally deported Abrego to the El Salvador’s CECOT prison, notorious for its harsh conditions, in March. However, the 2019 protective order does not bar Abrego from being deported to another country.

Abrego’s lawyers have now notified the judge in the Middle District of Tennessee that ICE has informed Abrego of its intent to deport him to Uganda. Abrego could not face the criminal charges of human smuggling brought against him by DOJ in that case if he is out of the country.

Abrego, a father of three, was reunited with his family on Friday after spending nearly half a year away from home. Images of the reunification, released by advocates, show a teary-eyed Abrego holding his youngest son, who was with his father when Abrego was picked up by immigration authorities in March.

“Today has been a very special day because I have seen my family for the first time in more than 160 days,” he said in a statement on Friday.

“I’d like to thank all the people who have supported me because after this long time I have witnessed that so many people have been by my side with such positivity,” he added. “Today I am grateful to God because He has heard me and today I am out. We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served.”

Immediately upon his return to the United States in June, Abrego was charged with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.

He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

“Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center.
“It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system.","FORT MYERS, Fla.— Immigrants’ rights advocates filed a federal lawsuit Friday evening challenging Florida’s authority to detain people at the notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center, a hastily constructed facility in the middle of the Everglades, which is surrounded by alligators, snakes, mosquitos, and swampland at risk of dangerous flooding. The case focuses on the state’s expansive and unlawful use of 287(g) agreements to assert independent state control over immigration detainees, which is still at issue after yesterday’s court ruling ending transfers of people to the facility.

The lack of authority to operate the facility has resulted in unprecedented challenges that people in immigration detention typically do not face, including being held without charge, not receiving initial custody or bond determinations, not appearing in the detainee locator system, and not being able to access their attorneys or immigration court.

The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Florida, Community Justice Project, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed the lawsuit on behalf of people detained at the Everglades facility.

The 287(g) program allows individual state and local officers to help with a narrow set of immigration enforcement tasks, subject to rigorous training and close supervision by federal officials. It does not allow them to set up their own independent detention operations. And it does not let state officers sub-delegate immigration authority to private contractors who do not and cannot participate in the 287(g) program. Florida officers are also acting without adequate training in the many complex facets of immigration law. Many are only spending a few hours online, compared to equivalent federal officers who receive multiple weeks of in person training.

These unprecedented violations of the 287(g) statute have immediately led to a host of real-world problems. Physical conditions at the facility are atrocious and dangerous. Detainees are going “off the grid” and being taken out of the normal systems for immigration detention and removal proceedings. Congress required the Department of Homeland Security to maintain custody of immigration detainees, and it imposed tight limits on the 287(g) program, precisely to avoid these kinds of problems.

“This facility has already become a disaster in the first few weeks of its operations, with mounting reports of disease, wrongful removals, and people being denied all kinds of basic rights. This is exactly why Congress did not allow states to set up their own immigration facilities. The government needs to follow the law when people’s lives and liberties are at stake. It’s time for this failed experiment to end,” said Spencer Amdur, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel.

“Florida has wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to unlawfully detain people in this abusive immigration detention center. Not only have the conditions been abhorrent, but the detention itself is unlawful. People are being held without charge, cut off from their attorneys, and made invisible in the immigration system. Families cannot even find out where their loved ones are. This is a crisis created entirely by the state’s reckless decision to ignore federal law and invent its own immigration jail in the middle of the Everglades. The harm being inflicted on our clients is immediate and irreparable, and it underscores why states are not allowed to overstep into federal immigration processes,” said Amy Godshall, legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney with the ACLU of Florida.

“Our immigrant communities have always been right about this: We are Floridians, too, and deserve the same respect, compassion and due process as anyone else in this state. Florida’s authoritarian experiment cannot continue unchecked, and we are confident the court will see that there is no lawful authority for Florida to operate this immigration facility,” said Miriam Haskell, senior attorney and director of litigation at Community Justice Project.

“It is truly unprecedented for a state to claim authority to operate its own, independent immigration detention system. The lack of accountability and resulting deprivation at this remote and inhumane detention camp in the Florida Everglades is exactly why Congress has made it unlawful and directed only the federal government to have custody over noncitizens as they go through the immigration system,” said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center.

The DOJ’s Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO) has issued four decisions over the past year regarding alleged violations of U.S. immigration law.

The decisions concern the valuation of I-9 penalties, subpoena disputes, and the calculation of interest on penalties.

From May 2024 through June 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO)—which is responsible for adjudicating violations of Form I-9, unlawful employment of unauthorized workers, and unfair immigration-related employment practices—has issued only four decisions. Of the four, two decisions concerned the valuation of I-9 penalties, one concerned subpoena disputes, and the final decision addressed calculation of interest on penalties. This year’s summary once again highlights the downward trend in published substantive OCAHO decisions.1 This continued trend appears to be caused by the introduction of a Settlement Officer Program, which has assisted litigants to reach a resolution of a case without further litigation.

OCAHO Continues to Decline to Use ICE’s Matrix

As can be seen in prior Littler articles,2 OCAHO has consistently declined to follow the matrix (a tool that determines the amount of the penalty per the percentage of I-9 violations found in the audit) used by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is based upon the percentage of Forms I-9 with substantive errors.

In United States v. John Ferguson Moving & Storage, 21 OCAHO no. 1651 (Mar. 12, 2025), Respondent failed to prepare any Forms I-9 for its 23 employees; thus, it did not provide any in response to ICE’s Notice of Inspection (NOI). ICE calculated a civil monetary penalty of $45,586 for failure to prepare and/or present 23 Forms I-9. It used $1,982 per I-9 violation, which ICE stated was the highest amount permissible.

Respondent asserted it provided 16 Forms I-9, but they were completed after service of the NOI; thus, they were not considered in the decision-making. It also raised an affirmative defense of good faith. However, good faith is only reviewed for technical errors, hiring employees, and as a statutory factor; thus, it is misplaced as a defense to a substantive violation.

Since ICE used the highest assessment of penalties allowed at that time, it did not use the five mitigating/aggravating factors.3 However, OCAHO did consider the factors and found Respondent was a small employer, which provides for a 5% mitigating factor. Concerning seriousness of the violations, OCAHO found this was a 5% aggravating factor. The other three factors, good faith/bad faith, no employment of unauthorized workers and no history of violations, were determined to be neutral.

OCAHO concluded that it was going to exercise its discretion and find a reduction in the proposed penalty amount that was just and reasonable. Here, OCAHO held:

[The government] proposes a penalty of $1,982 per violation, which is approximately 71% of the maximum of the penalty range the court can consider for these violations.4 Penalties at or near the maximum permissible fine amount should be reserved for more egregious circumstances. Here, the court weighs most heavily the seriousness of the violations for failure to prepare and/or present Forms I-9 and considers that the violations include all of Respondent’s employees…. After considering the remaining statutory factors, the court finds that the violations do not warrant a penalty toward the high end of the penalty range. Rather, the court exercises its de novo authority and finds that a penalty slightly above the mid-range is warranted.

Thus, the ALJ reduced the penalties from ICE’s proposed $45,586 to $36,179.

In United States v. Pasquel Hermanos, Inc., 18 OCAHO no. 1506f (May 27, 2025), Respondent was charged with failure to prepare and/or present Forms I-9 for 22 of the 23 employees. In its defense, Respondent asserted all its employees were authorized to be employed; therefore, there were no substantiative violations. OCAHO summarily dismissed that defense. In reviewing the penalties, OCAHO stated, “The civil penalties for violations of Section 1324s are intended to set a meaningful fine to promote the future compliance.”

OCAHO determined the penalties by reviewing the five statutory aggravating/mitigating factors. In so doing, OCAHO found the employer’s small size was a mitigating factor. Concerning whether there was bad faith, OCAHO stated:

[T]his employer had a poor compliance rate - demonstrating it took virtually no steps to comply with the law before the inspection. However, there is nothing to indicate that during the inspection and in the time preceding the receipt of the Notice of Intent to Fine this employer engaged in any concerning behavior; rather, the record shows the employer was forthcoming about the number of Forms I-9 available for inspection, and seemed otherwise comply expeditiously with the HSI auditors request. Without more, the statutory factor is duly considered, but it does not serve, in this case, to aggravate or mitigate the penalty.

The seriousness factor was met and determined to be an aggravating factor. The final two factors, no employment of unauthorized workers and no history of violations, were found to be neutral.

OCAHO decided to use a mid-range of penalties, not the matrix, in assessing $1,450 per violation for a total of $31,900, rather than ICE’s proposed penalties of $42,856.

On average, OCAHO reduced the penalties by 23% in these two published decisions.

Subpoena Disputes

A subpoena dispute arose in In re Investigation of Adobe, Inc., 21 OCAHO no. 1669 (June 25, 2025). During an investigation of a charge by Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) of the Department of Justice, IER issued a subpoena requesting from Abode information concerning applicants for positions that Charging Party applied, including PERM applicants, information about Charging Party, and personnel files for applicants.

Adobe raised two principal objections. First, IER exceeded its statutory authority in continuing an investigation when there was no reasonable cause for the charge. In response, OCAHO concluded, “A determination on whether IER has conducted a sufficient investigation is beyond this ALJ's authority; nor would this ALJ be aware of whether IER has expanded the scope of the investigation, which has the authority to do.... Further, a resolution of the merits of the case is outside the scope of these proceedings and would be improper in any event without a full evidentiary submission.”

Second, Abode asserts attorney-client privilege and work-product privilege on presenting many documents. However, Adobe failed to present a privilege log under Rule 25(b)(5). As OCAHO stated:

A properly crafted privilege log has the potential to resolve disputes without Court intervention in that it helps the opposing side evaluate whether it should challenge the asserted privileges. When Court intervention is required, that same privilege log allows the court to understand the propriety of the party’s position on privileges. In this case the Court has no basis upon which to resolve the dispute as there is no privilege law and thus no way for the court to evaluate whether it was properly asserted.

The Court orders Petitioner (Adobe) to create a privilege log for any responsive documents it intends to withhold based on a privilege…. [T]he Court asks IER to review the privileged log, meet and confer with the Petitioner, and if any asserted privilege cannot be resolved, the parties may then bring the dispute to this Court to resolve with an in camera review of the withheld documents.

Calculation of Interest on Penalties

In United States v. Majestic Petroleum Services, LLC, 21 OCAHO no. 1641b (April 3, 2025), the parties, ICE and Respondent, reached a settlement agreement for an installment payment plan. Thereafter, a dispute arose on the amount of monthly payment based on calculation of monthly interest. The pertinent language is as follows:

It is financially unable to pay the amount due in one lump sum payment, Respondent will pay its $95,000 debt in 108-monthly installments and also agrees to pay interest on the outstanding balance. Each monthly billing set by the FSCB will be for an amount which represents an amount of principal plus the interest….

The interest due will be amortized over the 108-month payment period and will be added to the principal amount due each month.

Respondent asserts that the agreement’s terms, “fixed” and “amortized over the 108-month payment period” with respect to the rate and payment of interest mean that it should have a fixed monthly payment including principal and interest.

OCAHO disagreed with Respondent’s interpretation and stated, “The phrase ‘monthly installments’ is only used in reference to the payment of the principal, separate from the distinct agreement to pay interest on the outstanding balance…. Were this provision to state that both debt and interest on it would be paid in monthly installments, such language would support Respondent’s interpretation that both the principal and interest payment would be one fixed monthly payment; however, such is not the case here.”

Conclusion

There is a continuing trend of OCAHO decreasing the penalties between 23% and 40%. Therefore, it is often beneficial to litigate before OCAHO, rather than accept ICE’s proposed penalties. Alternatively, after a Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF) is filed but before a Complaint is issued, employers should consider using the possibility of litigation before OCAHO to negotiate lower penalties with ICE.

The other two cited OCAHO decisions help employers to understand the subpoena process as well as calculation of interest in settlements.

Employers seeking more information on trends in I-9 compliance can contact immigration counsel.

“And we’re going to have this place beautified within a period of 12 months,” Trump said.

Asked later Friday how he would come up with the money, Trump said he had already spoken to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and that it would not be a significant amount.

Uganda’s agreement to accept US deportees is a multifaceted development wrapped in both opportunity and challenge.","In August 2025, Uganda announced a ""temporary"" agreement with the United States to accept deportees under a “third-country” deportation policy—a plan where migrants who do not qualify for asylum in the US but are unwilling or unable to return to their home countries are sent to a third nation. This development has sparked intense debate involving government officials, human rights groups, and local communities in Uganda, as the country already hosts one of the largest refugee populations in Africa. This analysis dissects what Uganda stands to gain and face from accepting these deportees, the intricacies of the deal, and the diverse statements from involved stakeholders.

The Nature of the Agreement and Its Scope

The agreement between Uganda and the United States is tailored for migrants deported from the US who do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors. The Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that

“the two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented""

but the agreement is understood to be ""concluded"". The targets of this repatriation program primarily include Africans and Asians who sought asylum at the US-Mexico border but did not qualify for refugee status. Uganda has explicitly expressed preference for migrants who are African nationals.

However, some ambiguity remains as to the exact number of deportees Uganda will accept. While the US has deported small numbers to other African countries like Eswatini and South Sudan, Uganda’s eventual intake remains unspecified. The agreement strictly excludes those with criminal histories, a point Uganda underscores to assure the public that the country is not accepting ""illegal aliens.""

Uganda’s Refugee Context and Capacity Challenges

Uganda is renowned for its refugee-friendly immigration policy and currently hosts between 1.7 to 1.8 million refugees—mostly from neighboring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Sudan. This substantial existing population of refugees already places considerable demand on Uganda’s resources, health services, and social infrastructure.

Henry Okello Oryem, Uganda’s State Minister for Foreign Affairs, has voiced the country’s concerns candidly:

“We do not have the capacity to accommodate such foreign deportees from the United States in Uganda”.

He further questioned the wisdom of taking in people whom their own countries have rejected, stating,

“We are talking about cartels: people who are unwanted in their own countries. How can we integrate them into local communities in Uganda?”.

This position illustrates Uganda’s cautious stance, emphasizing that while Uganda’s refugee policy is benevolent, practical limits must be recognized.

The government is actively negotiating related issues such as visas, tariffs, and sanctions to ensure deportations do not unfairly burden host communities. These concerns reflect broader anxieties within Uganda about the economic and social impact of potentially inflating the population of non-citizens who might strain public services and job markets.

Statements from Stakeholders

The Ugandan government’s communications reflect a dual narrative. On one side, officials confirm a legal, structured agreement exists or is being finalized to accept deportees. Uganda’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, through Permanent Secretary Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, explained the deal applies only to migrants rejected for asylum in the US but reluctant to return home. However, other officials, including Henry Okello Oryem, have publicly denied any finalized deal or capacity to accept deportees, highlighting an internal tension or messaging strategy possibly designed to manage public opinion amid criticism.

From the US side, this policy forms part of a broader strategy initiated under former President Donald Trump, aiming to rigorously enforce immigration laws and reduce illegal immigration by deporting millions, including by using third countries to take individuals who cannot be returned directly to their origin countries. U.S. officials describe third-country deportations as necessary for migrants lacking citizenship but remaining in the US illegally, as diplomatic or political obstacles bar simple repatriation.

Human rights organizations have strongly criticized this approach, warning deportees face risks in countries with less regulatory oversight or hostile environments. They argue these deportations may violate international law and expose migrants to harm, especially given the limited transparency and safeguards in some host countries.

What Will Uganda Gain?

Several analysts propose that Uganda’s acceptance of US deportees may be motivated by geopolitical and economic considerations beyond humanitarian logic. There is speculation that Uganda is positioning itself to gain favor with the US administration to unlock better trade deals and attract foreign investment, potentially leveraging the agreement as a diplomatic bargaining chip.

Accepting deportees can also be viewed as Uganda demonstrating cooperation with global powers on immigration and security matters, which could enhance its international standing. Furthermore, Uganda might negotiate financial or infrastructural support from the US and other donors to offset the costs of integrating or housing deportees.

While these potential gains exist, they must be weighed against the significant social and economic risks linked to adding to an already large refugee population with limited resources. This includes possible strain on Uganda’s infrastructure, public services, and labor market competition.

Complexities and Ethical Dilemmas

Uganda's position reveals a tension between international cooperation and national interests. The government’s explicit rejection of criminal deportees and unaccompanied minors reflects efforts to manage social risks and public perceptions. Local Ugandans express wariness about the impact of more migrants on their resources, fearing inadequate support or social friction.

Moreover, Uganda's acceptance of deportees from various African nations raises ethical questions about the accountability of home countries rejecting their nationals and the fairness of placing the burden on third countries. This approach risks outsourcing immigration challenges without addressing root causes like poverty, conflict, and instability in migrants’ countries of origin.

Uganda’s agreement to accept US deportees is a multifaceted development wrapped in both opportunity and challenge. The nation stands to potentially benefit through improved bilateral relations with the US and possible economic incentives but faces substantial social, economic, and ethical dilemmas. The agreement’s ""temporary"" and conditional nature, excluding criminals and unaccompanied minors, seeks to balance Uganda’s humanitarian commitments with practical limits.

Ugandan officials have articulated concerns about capacity and community integration, signaling caution despite public statements confirming the deal.

“They had nothing to do with this restaurant,” Mahadevan told The Enquirer on Aug. 22, the day after the Fairfield Police Department announced the arrests. “They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Now Ortiz Soto is detained at the Butler County Jail and her boyfriend, Daniel Flores, is charged with obstruction of official business.

Shootings prompted arrests, officials said

ICE and local officials ""conducted an operation in and around the Sabor Peruano Night Club” in response to recent violence there, Fairfield police said in an Aug. 21 press release.

In the prior two months, two shootings were linked to the business, the press release said, and “investigations revealed that many of the individuals involved were in the country illegally.”

Those circumstances led officials to the restaurant Aug. 16, where they made the arrests and and then transported the individuals to the Butler County Jail.

Fairfield police did not disclose the exact location of the arrests, the charges against those arrested or details about the shootings. They did not respond to a request for additional information Aug. 22.

Business owner: 'I don't know what's going on'

Sabor Peruano is located at the end of a strip mall that used to be anchored by a Van Leunens department store and is now dominated by the Ohio Valley Antique Mall.

At midday Aug. 22, the restaurant was open, but the parking lot was mostly empty. At the back of the establishment, another entrance is marked with a sign for Rumba Bar. State business records indicate the ownership of the two businesses overlap.

Employees at Sabor Peruano – ""Peruvian flavor"" in English − said the manager was not on site and they were not authorized to speak about what happened.

Owner Mary Ticacala picked up the phone earlier in the day.

“Police haven’t been in the building,” she said when asked about the arrests. “I don’t know what’s going on.”

She declined to answer additional questions, saying she was busy with her lunch business.

Workers at the other businesses in the strip, which includes an African grocery and leatherworking shop, said they hadn't noticed anything unusual about Sabor Peruano. However, nearly all of the other nearby businesses are closed in the evenings.

Sabor Peruano has operated at 7245 Dixie Highway since 2015, in business from a site about a half-mile away the prior eight years. The business moved after its original home was destroyed in a November 2014 fire.

The business Facebook page is dominated by promotions for its music and dancing, starting at 9 p.m. The restaurant, where traditional Peruvian entrées are priced at $16-$18, closes at 9.

Mostly men arrested over 24-hour period

Officials arrested mostly men, ranging in age from about 20 to 40, during the Aug. 16 sweep in Fairfield.

They were picked up over about 24 hours, from about 8 p.m. Aug. 16 to 8 p.m. Aug. 17, according to records from the Butler County Jail.

Around the same time, the Butler County Sheriff’s Office took five more people into custody during a separate traffic enforcement operation. The five “were identified as being in the United States illegally,” Sheriff Richard Jones said in a news release.

Eight of the total 39 no longer appeared on the jail’s roster as of Aug. 22.

Of the still-detained individuals, just two are women. One is Mahadevan’s client, Marlen Jamileth Ortiz Soto.

Woman still 'confused about why she was detained'

Ortiz Soto, a Honduran, came to the United States in January 2019, her attorney said. She lives in Hamilton with her mother and siblings.

Her mother applied for asylum status for herself and her children in 2020, with another hearing in her case before the Cleveland Immigration Court scheduled next month, Mahadevan said.

Ortiz Soto has a valid work permit and operates a cleaning business, the attorney said. She and Flores, a U.S. citizen, are considering getting married, he said.

She remains in good spirits in detention, he said.

“Obviously, she is still a little confused about why she was detained,” he said. “She asked the ICE officers who detained her ... and was never given a reason.”

He has filed a bond request for her release, but said the immigration court won’t likely take that up until early next month.","https://www.cincinnati.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/22/PCIN/85781445007-img-5781.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-23 10:57:01.390455

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email.

Why It Matters

Cases such as those involving Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was arrested over involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, have drawn scrutiny toward the Trump administration's immigration policy. Legal experts have sounded the alarms that green card holders are being targeted for deportation over reasons connected to their speech.

This could have implications for more than 10 million green card holders living in the United States.

What to Know

Khalil's case is perhaps the most prominent that has led to questions about green card holders' free speech rights, protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. He was detained in March after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged he was a national security threat, which he has denied.

Other cases that have raised these concerns include that of Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student who was arrested after she penned an opinion piece criticizing the university's approach to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, or Yunseo Chung, another Columbia student arrested after participating in pro-Palestinian protests.

The administration has argued that these detainments and deportations are necessary to protect the national security interests of the U.S. But critics say those two individuals have not demonstrated any threats to national security and that their arrests are tied to constitutionally protected speech that the Trump administration does not agree with.

Conor Fitzpatrick, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), is among those filing legal challenges against the administration for allegedly moving to deport people for their protected speech.

""This isn't theoretical right now to green card holders,"" he said. ""This is an active threat to their freedom of speech.""

Fitzpatrick said the idea that individual graduate students are ""somehow imperiling"" national security or foreign policy is ""absurd.""

""They're just airing opinions,"" he said. ""That means that they're airing views that Americans can air without fear. And so at the point that you're punishing someone for voicing an opinion that more than 300 million other people in the United States would be able to air and there wouldn't be a problem, it really shows that this is about the ideas that they voice rather than any sort of serious security concern.""

In a court filing, FIRE accused Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio of ""trying to turn the inalienable human right of free speech into a privilege contingent upon the whims of a federal bureaucrat, triggering deportation proceedings against noncitizens residing lawfully in this country for their protected political speech regarding American and Israeli foreign policy.""

Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia University, in an interview with Newsweek cast doubt on that justification, noting that green-card holders like Khalil or Chung do not have criminal records.

The First Amendment ""protects all people on U.S. soil, regardless of their citizenship status,"" and that has been affirmed in Supreme Court cases ""over decades,"" she said.

Many of the immigrants and green card holders targeted so far have been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, but there are concerns the administration could use the foreign policy justification to target others as well, Mukherjee said, describing it as a ""slippery slope.""

""While today, the secretary of state may be invoking the foreign policy deportability ground against those who are speaking out in favor of Palestinian rights, tomorrow, next week, next month, the secretary of state could invoke that same ground, the foreign-policy-deportability ground to target economists who don't believe in tariffs on countries that have been levied by the administration or could use the foreign policy deportability ground to target climate scientists who are outspoken about the Trump administration's destruction of climate policies,"" she said.

The foreign policy deportation ground has historically been used in cases involving individuals convicted of serious crimes elsewhere in the world such as terrorism—not cases involving people attending protests or writing articles about U.S. foreign policy.

""Those cases are worlds apart from what we are seeing today,"" she said.

Many green card holders living in the United States are asking questions about how they should navigate the difficult situation. Mukherjee is providing counsel to some of these individuals who have asked questions about whether they should refrain from participating in protests or sharing their views on social media.

""Unfortunately, I am urging people to proceed with caution given this administration's disregard for the protections that should be offered to all people on U.S. soil under the First Amendment,"" she said.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services this week announced in August that immigration officers have been ordered to apply a more holistic assessment of ""good moral character"" when deciding on naturalization applications—this has fueled concerns about what this may mean for some green card holders.

Gautam Hans, director of Cornell Law School's Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Clinic, told Newsweek the State Department generally has ""extensive leeway"" over questions of deportations.

""The First Amendment arguments are very persuasive, but the courts also often defer to State on issues of immigration,"" he said.

He warned that the administration may be using deportations against pro-Palestinian activists as a ""trial balloon for more draconian measures.""

Former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg told Newsweek the change ""would appear to give immigration officers discretion to evaluate social media posts, or even subscriptions to certain podcasts, as grounds for deportation.""

USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser previously told Newsweek the new process ""ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character.""

""This memo ensures that USCIS officers are accounting for an alien's positive contributions to American society—including community involvement, achievements, and financial responsibility rather than the absence of their misconduct. USCIS will continue to restore integrity in the nation's immigration system—especially when it comes to the prestigious privilege of citizenship,"" he said.

Rubio, however, has said the case involving Khalil is not about free speech.

""This is not about free speech. This is about people that don't have a right to be in the United States to begin with. No one has a right to a student visa. No one has a right to a green card, by the way,"" he told reporters in March.

He continued, ""So when you apply for a student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down and being complicit in what are clearly crimes of vandalization, complicit in shutting down learning institutions – there are kids at these schools that can't go to class.""

What People Are Saying

Former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg told Newsweek: ""While the First Amendment absolutely should provide protection for any green card holder, the administration has shown, repeatedly, that they do not care about, and will not respect, these constitutional protections,"" he said. ""While a judge may very well, ultimately, rule in favor of the green card holder, in the meantime he/she could be detained in a detention camp in a Florida swamp. At that point, many green card holders may choose to voluntarily self-deport.""

The Department of Homeland Security wrote in an X post this week: ""If you hate America, you have no business demanding to live in America.""

What Happens Next

Trump's immigration policies continue to face legal challenges. Hans said some of the cases involving deportations and the First Amendment are likely to eventually make it to the Supreme Court.

Hawaii, I am not optimistic that the Court will do the right thing as a matter of law and protect immigrants and non-citizens,"" he said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2708348/mahmoud-khalil-protests-free-speech.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:49.492453

Hall owns Coyote Container. He believes immigrant truck drivers have lead to an oversupply of drivers and suppressed wages.

""If you're paying a truck driver minimum wage and you can get away with it because they're here... then that's an unfair competitive advantage that they have,"" Hall said.

In addition to the new rules regarding truckers, the Trump administration also announced Thursday an expanded review process for as many as 55 million other immigrants, too.

The State Department says it will now have a continuous vetting process for all valid U.S. visa holders.

So what do these new policies actually mean for people who are here on visas?

Some immigration attorneys say the answer to that question is still unclear.

""The administration often comes up with a new policy without providing a lot of details, which makes it difficult to ascertain how to comply with the new policy,"" said immigration attorney Fabiano Valerio.

Valerio believes the new vetting process is likely to cause confusion and panic among legal immigrants.

Adding another layer of complexity in an already daunting American immigration process.

And as for the folks at the trucking yards in Oakland, several say many here are just trying to find their American dream.

Witnesses generally have a right to film an encounter with ICE in public as long as they are not interfering with the arrest, experts told CNN.
Bystanders can try to ask ICE agents questions as long as they’re not interfering, Rose said.
This distinction sets the tone for how ICE agents interact with the people they’ve apprehended, he said.
“(ICE agents) don’t need probable cause to briefly detain and question someone, they just need ‘reasonable suspicion,’” Homan told CNN last month.","As the Trump administration ramps up efforts to detain and deport undocumented people, dramatic videos of immigration arrests from California to New York have sparked reactions from applause to backlash across the nation’s broad political spectrum.

The Department of Homeland Security received over 100,000 applications in recent weeks “from patriotic Americans who want to join ICE and help remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the United States,” Secretary Kristi Noem said.

“This is a defining moment in our nation’s history,” she said in a news release.

Her agency also has faced sharp criticism and legal setbacks over its enforcement tactics, which have become a key piece of the Trump administration’s broader and unpopular immigration crackdown.

Still, the Department of Homeland Security – which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and Customs and Border Protection, or CBP – is set to expand arrests, often in places undocumented immigrants used to feel safe and in plain view of anyone with a cell phone camera.

CNN asked immigration and legal experts and Trump administration officials to explain the rights of witnesses and immigrants during an ICE encounter. Here’s what we learned:

Q. Are bystanders allowed to film ICE interactions?

Witnesses generally have a right to film an encounter with ICE in public as long as they are not interfering with the arrest, experts told CNN.

Some states, however, have sought to restrict recording of law enforcement by passing buffer zone laws that mandate bystanders keep a certain distance from police activity. Some of those laws face court challenges on First Amendment grounds.

Even apart from that issue, recording an ICE encounter is not without risk.

“I understand that some bystanders might feel less able to intervene,” said Austin Rose, managing attorney at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “And the reality is that you’re not going to prevent (the arrest) from happening in the vast majority of situations.”

“There are real risks,” he added. “I think filming is really helpful … it’s important that people know what’s going on.”

Q. Can anyone warn someone about ICE?

Noem has suggested apps that crowdsource ICE activity or flag ICE sightings could interfere with federal law enforcement – and threatened to punish users.

“This sure looks like obstruction of justice,” the secretary wrote in a June social media post. “If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

But any effort to prosecute someone for warning of a potential arrest would run afoul of a considerable body of legal precedent that holds alerting people of a possible arrest is First Amendment-protected speech.

Q. What questions can witnesses ask as someone is being detained?

If someone sees an ICE arrest, it could be useful to learn a detainee’s biographical information – name, date of birth and country of origin – if the witness wants to keep up with the case using public databases or help someone like a reporter, lawyer or relative do so, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center.

“Try and get someone’s name.” he suggested. “Try and say, ‘Is there somebody you want me to call?’”

Still, “sometimes there’s not a chance to do that,” Luken said, warning that bystanders should also assess their own risk – especially if they are undocumented – and adding that no one has the right to directly interfere with an ICE operation.

Bystanders can try to ask ICE agents questions as long as they’re not interfering, Rose said. But, he added, they’re under no obligation to respond.

“ICE is likely not to answer your questions,” he said, “but I think an important thing to ask about is (whether they have) a warrant.”

Q. How serious an offense is it to be undocumented in the United States?

The Trump administration has made clear it views being an undocumented immigrant in the United States as a crime.

“We’re going to enforce the immigration law,” border czar Tom Homan told CNN’s Dana Bash last month. “It’s not OK to be in this country illegally. It’s not OK to enter this country illegally. It’s a crime.”

But when it comes to how immigration arrests are conducted – and what rights a detained person has – the legal basis for the arrest matters, immigrant rights and legal experts told CNN.

It’s important to understand that crossing the border and being undocumented in the United States generally is a civil infraction, not a criminal offense, Lukens said.

This distinction sets the tone for how ICE agents interact with the people they’ve apprehended, he said.

For instance, agents “do not have to Mirandize someone because it’s not a criminal arrest,” Lukens said, referring to the practice of informing someone of their legal rights once they’re in custody.

The civil offense also affects the type of judge who will hear the case, whether an arrestee is entitled to legal representation and how quickly the Department of Homeland Security can remove someone from the United States. (More on that later.)

Notably, re-entering the United States after being deported is a felony, and a conviction could result in a fine and up to two years in prison, the US Criminal Code states. Those penalties increase if the person is also charged with a drug-related or other criminal offense, which could land someone found guilty up to 20 years in prison.

Q. What are an immigrant’s rights during an ICE encounter?

No matter their legal status, everyone is entitled to protection from unreasonable search and seizure and excessive use of force under the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, said Jenn Borchetta, deputy director of the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project.

“There needs to be a reasonable basis to believe the person they’re stopping is either in the country illegally or otherwise is committing some kind of immigration violation,” she told CNN.

Meanwhile, “the unnecessarily aggressive conduct we’ve seen from immigration agents is really an escalation and outgrowth of police tactics that are usually confined only to certain neighborhoods,” Borchetta said.

For example, footage of CBP agents opening fire on and smashing the windows of a family’s truck in San Bernadino, California, during a targeted immigration enforcement operation this week has drawn criticism from activists and immigration attorneys. The officers acted in self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

Constitutional protections “only exist if they apply to everyone,” Borchetta said. “If federal agents don’t need reasonable suspicion to detain people, they can go out and stop anybody on the street. That means they can stop citizens.”

“Every ICE officer goes through Fourth Amendment training every six months and (is) reminded what their authorities are for arrest, detention and questioning so the officers (are) very well-trained,” Homan told CNN.

Q. How does ICE typically identify someone agents are going to question or detain?

ICE is “conducting intelligence-based, targeted enforcement operations,” an agency spokesperson told CNN in a recent statement.

Under past White House administrations, ICE would apprehend someone if they were aware the person had committed a crime or were caught at the border or because a judge granted a warrant for their removal, Lukens told CNN.

While apprehending such a person, he added, it was “not odd for (ICE agents) to also walk down the hallway of the apartment building and say, ‘Do you have your status? Do you have your papers?’”

Anyone who said no could also be detained, Lukens said.

Under the second Trump administration, however, ICE tactics have gotten more aggressive, with workplace raids – like those this summer at Los Angeles-area farms and Home Depot sites – becoming increasingly common, he said.

Trump’s border czar defended the agency’s tactics after a judge blocked the administration from conducting immigration stops and arrests in Southern California over concerns agents were engaging in profiling and lacked probable cause.

“(ICE agents) don’t need probable cause to briefly detain and question someone, they just need ‘reasonable suspicion,’” Homan told CNN last month. “Physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody … It’s a myriad of factors. Every situation is different.”

After Homan vowed to “litigate” the order, a federal appeals court upheld the halting of immigration sweeps.

Q. Does someone have to show ID or answer questions during an ICE encounter?

While state laws require a motorist stopped by police to show a driver’s license upon request, there is otherwise no legal obligation to carry and show an ID – including citizenship papers or a passport – to law enforcement upon request, Rose said.

“You’re under no constitutional obligation to give your name or to give any papers,” he said. “The problem, though, is that you don’t feel you’re free to leave in this situation. And so, I think people understandably try to comply.”

However, the onus changes once someone is in custody or has been arrested, he added.

“Once you’re arrested, you arguably have to provide ID and information, and so timing there can kind of matter and be a little tricky.”

Over the years, Rose has seen “a difference between what the law is and should be, and what the reality is,” he said.

“In general, the law is that noncitizens do have the same constitutional rights with respect to the due process clause (of the Fifth Amendment) and other provisions of the Constitution, as citizens,” he said. “But the practical reality is often different.”

Q. Do immigrants have a right to an attorney?

Because being undocumented is often a civil infraction, immigrants are not automatically provided an attorney as they would be in a criminal case, Borchetta said: “Unfortunately, access to counsel can be a problem. Your access to the outside isn’t as protected as in a criminal context.”

However, some states, like New York, are working to pass laws requiring those who are facing deportation to have access to an attorney. “That’s why you see people getting detained in New York and sent to Louisiana,” Borchetta said.

Attorneys and immigration rights advocates often offer legal services to those in detention, but such organizations are struggling to keep up with the “firehose” of demand, Lukens said.

Further complicating matters, the Department of Homeland Security takes the position it does not have to let attorneys into detention centers, though that stance is contested.

“We’re not in the jails as much as we used to be because they don’t have to let us in,” Lukens said. “So, it’s harder to do the work.”

Q. ICE agents have been wearing masks and driving unmarked cars. Do they have to identify themselves?

Citing concerns over online doxxing and officers’ safety, many ICE agents have begun wearing balaclavas and neck gaiters to cover their faces while conducting immigration sweeps. ICE did not immediately respond to CNN’s questions about its mask policy and whether and how agents should identify themselves.

For now, there is no legal requirement for federal agents to identify themselves, experts told CNN.

“At the same time, it puts both agents and the public at risk if they don’t,” Borchetta said. “If someone is legitimately confused about who is detaining them, then that could cause the person to legitimately respond with force or other reactions that escalate a situation and put everyone at risk.”

Q. How can a loved one or lawyer find someone they believe has been detained over an immigration issue?

Locating someone who’s been apprehended over an immigration issue can be incredibly difficult. The Department of Homeland Security and its agents are not obligated to answer questions from family members, journalists or citizens, experts told CNN.

There are publicly available databases – such as the online detainee locator – where anyone can search for people held in ICE facilities, Rose said.

“All noncitizens, if they’ve had any contact with the immigration system – whether that’s border patrol or ICE – will have a nine-digit ‘A-number,’” he said. “You can use that to find out where they’re detained.”

An A-number can also be used to look up the basics of a pending immigration case, including whether someone has an order for removal or an immigration hearing has been scheduled.

“Having those numbers is pivotal,” Rose said, cautioning the databases rely on information submitted by ICE and Department of Homeland Security employees that, given the increased rate of apprehensions and detentions, may not be up to date.

The ICE detainee database also can be searched using someone’s first and last name, country of origin and exact birthdate.

U visa applicants must also be willing to assist law enforcement in their investigation of these crimes.
Denials can leave T visa applicants vulnerable to deportation.
These policies, alongside escalated coordination between law enforcement and other agencies, have heightened fear among survivors applying for the T visa, Dahlstrom explained.
“We are seeing in real time the results of including requirements around law enforcement engagement, especially when there’s greater cooperation with ICE and greater concerns about deportation,” Dahlstrom said.","The T visa, an underutilized lifeline for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, is experiencing a sharp rise in applications, despite increasing processing times and deportation risks.

Also known as T nonimmigrant status, the visa allows people who have experienced severe forms of human trafficking to remain in the country for up to four years if they are helpful to law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of their trafficker. Approved applicants can work in the U.S., are eligible for certain state and federal benefits, and can apply for a green card after three years on the visa (or earlier if the criminal case is closed).

Julie Dahlstrom, founder and director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at Boston University, said increased awareness of the visa and the courts’ expanding definitions of trafficking may have contributed to the increase, along with mounting barriers to other pathways for immigrant relief.

Congress created the T visa in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, intending to bolster law enforcement agencies’ capabilities to prosecute human trafficking crimes while offering protections to survivors. The same law also established the U visa, which provides legal status for victims who have suffered substantial abuse as a result of serious crimes including trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault. U visa applicants must also be willing to assist law enforcement in their investigation of these crimes.

“Many [applicants] are eligible for the U visa as well, but they’re taking now over 20 years for an individual to get access … so I think that has influenced lawyers and survivors, if they are eligible for the T visa … to go ahead and also file T visa applications,” Dahlstrom said. “Especially under the Trump administration, we’ve seen more barriers to asylum access, special immigrant juvenile status access, so I expect we’ll continue to see that move.”

USCIS updated the T visa rules in August 2024 with a process called called bona fide determination that gave survivors earlier access to benefits while their application is pending approval. It also granted them deferred action, which places individuals on a lower priority for removal proceedings.

Erika Gonzalez, training and technical assistance managing attorney from the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking, explained that although early access to benefits had existed in the federal statute, it was never implemented because applications were processing fast enough to not need it.

“They have updated the [bona fide determination] process to now have a formal process to engage with, and it does parallel with the sharp increases in filing,” Gonzalez said.

As T visa applications rose, so too did approvals. Last year, the number of approvals broke 3,000 for the first time though it still fell short of the 5,000 cap.

Processing times for T visas have also increased, jumping from a median of 5.9 months in 2014 to 19.9 months this fiscal year.

Denial rates for T visas, meanwhile, have fluctuated.

“We were seeing increased denial rates under the prior Trump administration and then improved rates under Biden,” Dahlstrom said.

Denials can leave T visa applicants vulnerable to deportation. In 2018, USCIS began allowing removal proceedings if an application was rejected with a notice to appear (NTA).

According to a 2022 report co-written by Dahlstrom, which obtained USCIS data through Freedom of Information Act litigation, USCIS issued a total of 236 NTAs to denied T visa applicants from 2019 to 2021. President Biden rescinded this policy with a January 2021 executive order, but last February, USCIS published new guidance once more expanding the circumstances where the agency could issue NTAs.

These policies, alongside escalated coordination between law enforcement and other agencies, have heightened fear among survivors applying for the T visa, Dahlstrom explained.

“We are seeing in real time the results of including requirements around law enforcement engagement, especially when there’s greater cooperation with ICE and greater concerns about deportation,” Dahlstrom said. “These programs are being politicized and, in some ways, weaponized if you’re denied and you’re placed in proceedings.”

Since February’s policy update, at least one person has self-deported after Immigration and Customs Enforcement denied her stay despite her pending T visa application.

So far in the fiscal year 2025, USCIS has approved 1,035 T-visas and rejected 693, which surpasses the number rejected in each of the last four years.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/024d363/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4482x2353+0+356/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F50%2Fca490cfe4027800418cdae9582aa%2Fhuman-trafficking.JPEG,N,,2025-08-23 10:56:57.206008

But as I placed the pump in the gas tank, I noticed a man running full tilt toward me. I’d barely registered that he looked panicked – Maybe he was going to miss the bus? – when several things happened at once.

As he skidded to a halt in front of pump 1, a black Kia peeled into the station and pulled up level with him. Instantly, the passenger door opened and a man in khakis, a full-face balaclava and a tactical vest jumped out.

“Why were you running?” he asked repeatedly in Spanish. He continued to fire off questions, but I only heard the man he was chasing clearly give one answer.

“What’s your name?” the masked man asked.

“Samuel,” he replied.

I glanced over the roof of the Kia to see the driver had stepped out and was standing there with a rifle. As we made eye contact, he slid a gaiter over the bridge of his nose. Still, it took my brain a few beats to process what I was seeing:

This was an ICE apprehension.

‘The new world we live in’

My morning commute had just placed me in the middle of President Donald Trump’s immigration and deportation crackdown.

I’d never seen an ICE arrest in person – only on the news and in videos online. And while it’s true I didn’t know anything about Samuel – or witness the interaction that led to him sprinting through the parking lot – nothing about this encounter felt official.

For one, the masked men were driving a Kia – a family car I don’t typically associate with law enforcement. And the SUV had generic Maryland flag license tags. Though they appeared to be law enforcement, I didn’t hear them identify themselves. Their tactical gear said “police,” but they didn’t seem to be linked to a particular department or agency, and I couldn’t see any badges.

While I watched the driver stash the rifle in the trunk of the SUV, I considered grabbing my phone to start recording. But almost as soon as the thought occurred to me, I pushed it away.

I’m a Black woman in America. I’ve seen how filming the cops can escalate even the calmest of situations – and this already felt charged.

So, as the first agent cuffed Samuel and demanded to know whether he was “legal or illegal,” I stood between the pumps and decided to make it overtly clear that I was watching.

I rankled when they asked to see Samuel’s papers. There was once a time when masked men could’ve cornered my grandparents and demanded they prove they had a right to be in their own neighborhood. The entire scene felt like history repeating.

The pop of the pump disengaging startled me, and I noticed the driver of the only other car at the station had started recording. Emboldened, I slid into my driver’s seat, cranked the car and pulled around to take my own pictures.

But within seconds, the agents had put Samuel into the back of the Kia and sped away.

I got out of my car and walked over to the other witness. Suffice it to say we were both stunned.

“I think he said his name was Samuel?” I said.

The man, who told me he was an attorney with a public defender’s office, scribbled the name on a legal pad. We both stood there for a beat before he said, “This is the new world we live in.”

I forgot to ask the lawyer his name.

What I saw of the arrest lasted less than five minutes, but it felt terrifying and surreal. I never heard the agents tell Samuel why he was being detained. As the masked men put him in the back of the blacked-out SUV, I felt like I was watching someone being kidnapped.

I dictated notes on my phone as I drove to work and then immediately told my editor and colleagues what I’d seen. We agreed it would be a good idea to get the footage from the lawyer and that’s when reality began to set in.

In my panic and fear, I’d forgotten to ask any of the normal journalistic follow-up questions. I only knew the detainee’s first name, where he was apprehended and that the other bystander said he was a public defender.

With little to go on, I began searching for Samuel.

‘Everybody is scared’

I reached out to ICE to see if they could confirm whether their agents had been active in the area that morning and if they’d detained a man named Samuel.

I also emailed the public defender’s office for Washington, DC, the state of Maryland and nearby Montgomery County. They all agreed to ask around and see if my description of the attorney matched a colleague.

Then, I drove back to the gas station. Until recently, I’d lived less than 5 miles from where Samuel was apprehended. This side of Takoma Park is a suburban, close-knit, predominately immigrant community. It’s also not far from where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once apprehended at a local Home Depot.

The gas station is the kind of place where the attendants warmly greet their regular customers and there’s a table for locals to sit and chat while they play the lottery.

But the people I spoke to inside weren’t aware that ICE had been in the area or that someone had been arrested at pump 1. I drove to the U-Haul rental center across the street and asked two day laborers nearby if they’d heard about the incident.

“Yes,” they said.

Although neither man felt comfortable sharing his name with a reporter, both told me they’d heard ICE had apprehended three people in the area that morning. One man was buying coffee when agents stopped him, they said. Another was “just looking for work.”

“Everybody is scared – everybody,” one of them told me. The other showed me a grainy photo of the arrests that were circulating online. Neither knew Samuel.

As I drove away, I was struck by the fact that Samuel probably had family and friends in the area who might not hear from him for days or even weeks.

He’d left home that morning and essentially disappeared.

‘An extraordinarily abnormal thing to witness’

On Friday, I returned to the station to see if the manager had any surveillance footage of the incident. That’s where I met Solomon, an Ethiopian immigrant who won the State Department’s diversity visa program lottery 25 years ago and emigrated to America on a green card.

CNN agreed not to share his last name because of his concerns about the current climate toward immigrants. But since arriving in the US, Solomon said he’s earned a master’s degree and now owns a business. That, he added, is the beauty of America.

“If somebody comes (and) by chance they can get into this land, let’s properly treat them like a human being,” he said, adding some people who seek refuge in the US are fleeing war, starvation and poverty.

“They don’t have any hope,” Solomon said, “but this is a great country – it’s big (on) hope. If people are disciplined and stay away from trouble, you can benefit from that.”

Later that afternoon, my phone rang. Although I didn’t recognize the number, I instantly recognized the man’s voice. It was the attorney I’d met at the gas station, Sagar Vyas.

After a proper introduction this time, we began comparing notes on what we’d seen.

“It definitely seemed like – one of those old terms from the post-9/11 time – like a rendition was happening,” Vyas said, referring to the government’s extrajudicial practice of capturing and transferring suspects to foreign locations during the war on terror.

Vyas told me he typically sits in the driver’s seat while he’s filling the tank, and he only noticed the men in neck gaiters and camo when he went to hang up the pump.

As he grabbed the pen and paper from his briefcase, Vyas said he, as a South Asian man, also debated whether to record the incident.

But Vyas said he felt a sense of responsibility.

“Your parents say when you grow up, ‘When you see an injustice, stand up for them,’” he said. “Those sort of soft voices were in the back of my head.”

Still, he said he was deliberate about every move he made. While I was moving my car, Vyas said he’d asked Samuel for his name, but the agents scolded him.

“The two agents said something to each other, and they decided to just throw him in the car and take off,” he said. “It’s an extraordinarily abnormal thing to witness.”

But, Vyas said, later that night he and his wife agreed there is power in simply bearing witness. It’s like the adage, “a watched pot never boils,” he told me.

“We all need to be pot watchers – as a community, as a people, as citizens of this country,” he said.

If someone’s not monitoring the situation, he said, it’s going to boil over.

‘Targeted enforcement operations’

When I got to my desk on Monday, I had an email from an ICE spokesperson.

It read, in part, “Samuel Antonio Garcia Apilcano, 35, is an illegal alien from Honduras.”

According to ICE, he’d entered the country in 2023 and, after he’d failed to appear at a court date, a judge ordered his removal in absentia. ICE did not state if Samuel had any criminal history, or previous interactions with law enforcement. A CNN public records search didn’t return any information on him either.

“ICE is conducting intelligence-based, targeted enforcement operations in and around the district in an effort to make Washington, D.C. and surrounding communities safe and beautiful again,” the statement said.

It took a few days, but it was a small comfort to know ICE officials had located Samuel, given the sparse information I gave them. And ICE impersonations have also been on the rise, so I found it reassuring to know the men I saw were, in fact, DHS agents.

But the encounter has made me more curious about ICE enforcement tactics, immigrant rights and what bystanders are legally able to do when they’re caught in the middle.

As the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown, it’s becoming increasingly likely that more Americans could have the same experience I did in their own neighborhoods.

Candidly, I’m still shocked by what I witnessed. Though I live just outside the district – where it’s not uncommon to see armed federal agents – no one expects to see masked men in an unmarked car chasing and detaining someone on their morning commute.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21880541-350-772-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-23 06:56:38.841497

“It is unusual for people to be taken into custody at a citizenship interview,” said Hannah Vickner Hough, legal director for the Washington chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations.

Chaudhry’s wife, Melissa, a 2024 congressional candidate in Washington’s 9th District, said her husband arrived at the interview in “good faith.” She described him as a decorated Army veteran and a member of the Olympia chapter of Veterans for Peace.

Court describes fraud, lies; Chaudhry family contests record

Chaudhry has a complicated immigration history. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services notified him of intent to rescind his permanent resident status in 2003, setting off a lengthy legal battle. He applied for naturalization in 2013, but a federal court ruled against him. He has an appeal before the 9th Circuit.

Court records say Chaudhry used aliases, was convicted of fraud in Australia and failed to disclose his criminal history when applying for visas and jobs. In 1996, while living in Sydney, he impersonated a passenger using the man’s passport to apply for a Medicare card, state ID and bank account. Police also found he had used a stolen American Express card more than two dozen times. He pleaded guilty to multiple fraud charges that year.

According to those same documents, he later attempted to re-enter Australia with a fraudulent passport in 2000 before entering the U.S. on a tourist visa and settling in Yakima, Washington. Within months, he married a U.S.-born woman who filed a visa petition on his behalf. On his status application, Chaudhry falsely claimed he had no prior arrests. He later enlisted in the Washington Army National Guard and applied for a reserve officer position with the Yakima Police Department, again submitting false information.

In 2003, his Guard unit was activated for Operation Iraqi Freedom, but he reported a back injury during training before any deployment. That same year, immigration officials moved to rescind his permanent resident status but abandoned the case under the mistaken belief he was serving overseas.

Melissa Chaudhry declined to answer questions about her husband’s misrepresentation of his identity but told KING 5 his charges “never should have been entered into the docket,” and argued that the judge in question should have recused himself. She pointed to a website, keepzahidhome.org, for additional context.

Melissa said her husband’s pending federal appeal likely triggered the interview where he was arrested, saying the nature of the most recent order signaled a favorable outcome for Chaudhry, which ICE wanted to avoid.

By TODD RICHMOND and SCOTT BAUER Associated Press

MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee judge charged with obstructing a federal agency and concealing a wanted person who was in the country illegally told police days after the incident in her courtroom that “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

The comments were captured on body camera footage by Milwaukee police inside Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan’s home three days before her arrest in April. Dugan told officers she was not aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct.

Dugan was indicted in May and faces charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrived to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Four days later, on April 22, Dugan called police to her house about a flyer from an anti-government group that she, her mother and her sister found at their homes. Police photographs of the flyer show it included a religious screed about how to pronounce the name of God and assertions that Wisconsin residents can legally carry concealed knives.

Her conversation with officers, as captured on their body cameras, was released by police to The Associated Press on Friday. It was first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The footage shows Dugan telling police that media reports had been swirling about how she supposedly “hid” Flores-Ruiz in her courtroom. She goes on to that she didn’t know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty and is fighting to have the charges against her thrown out. The charges against her underscore a clash between Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make an example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.

Dugan has not publicly commented on the allegations.

She told police that she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz’s immigration status.

“I don’t know if he’s an illegal immigrant, which is what they’re claiming,” Dugan said. “I’m not supposed to know that. When they come in front of me, I’m not supposed to know that.”

Dugan denied hiding Flores-Ruiz who federal agents came into her courtroom to arrest.

“I did not hide this migrant in the jury room or in my chambers,” she said. “I had him leave out the back door, which I do when the circumstances warrant it.”

Video from the hallway showed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney leaving through a side door about 12 feet (3.6 meters) from the main entrance.

According to an FBI affidavit, witnesses heard Dugan say something to the effect of “wait, come with me” before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, the affidavit alleges.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that her conduct amounted to directing people’s movement in and around her courtroom, and that she enjoys legal immunity for official acts she performs as a judge.

Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents “down the hall to the administrative offices. What happened after that is their business.”

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers. “We all know that. Very difficult.”

Dugan’s defense attorneys released a statement noting that her comments to police came before she was aware of the criminal investigation.

“Her comments reinforced that she did nothing wrong in this matter and treated the misdemeanor case like any other in her courtroom,” her attorneys said in the statement.

Dugan could face up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/judge-dugan-outside-courthouse.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 14:56:48.928100

""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers.
Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.
His letter continued, ""The Chula Vista Elementary School District is committed to serving every student, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.""","Two unmarked vehicles driven by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers left the parking lot of Herbert Ibarra Elementary School Friday following a confrontation by ""community patrols,"" although ICE officials deny the agency was conducting an operation on school property.

The school's principal, Valerie Jurado, said in a statement to families of students that although she was unaware of any affiliation between the vehicles and any government agencies, she acknowledged how the belief made people uneasy.

""We understand how unsettling this report is and we stand with our community in our desire for ALL our students to be in a safe learning environment,"" Jurado wrote. ""Our teachers and staff remain ready to support our students and ensure a day of calm and learning.

""We encourage our parents and community to take care of one another and support one another during times of uncertainty like this. School communities should be sacred spaces where all students deserve to obtain a high quality education, and all families feel welcomed.""

Jurado reminded parents that ICE agents were not allowed on campus without a signed warrant. The San Diego Unified School District has a dedicated webpage to explain rights, regardless of immigration status: www.sdusdequity.com/protecting-students.

""At this time, there is no indication of any enforcement activity on our campus, and all students and staff are safe,"" Jurado wrote.

Patrick Divver, field officer director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in San Diego, said while the vehicles in the video were operated by ICE agents, they were not there for any operation at the school.

""At no time did ICE conduct enforcement activity on school grounds, nor did any officer exit their vehicle while briefly in the parking lot. Any suggestion otherwise is completely false,"" he told City News Service. ""ICE San Diego officers were conducting a targeted enforcement operation in the City Heights area when activists began harassing our officers. As a result, the officers pulled into the first available parking lot.

""The interference of activists in law enforcement operations creates unnecessary risks to themselves, the community, and our officers. These actions hinder our ability to remove individuals who pose a threat to public safety and contribute to misinformation that endangers everyone involved.""

Members of the San Diego Self-Defense Coalition, Union del Barrio and Association of Raza Educators, who responded to reports of the vehicles around 6:40 a.m. on Friday, shouting warnings to nearby communities members about an immigration action were planning to host a news conference outside the school at 4 p.m. to condemn ICE actions at schools.

""Immigration and Customs Enforcement has continuously said they are not conducting immigration enforcement actions on school properties, and today's actions contradict their statements,"" the activist groups wrote in a joint statement. ""We condemn the campaign of terror that has been unleashed in migrant working-class communities and the targeting of families with school aged children in and around school facilities.""

Earlier this week, ICE arrested a man near Park Dale Lane Elementary School in Encinitas while on his way to work.

Encinitas Union School District officials confirmed the man's daughter is a student in the district.

""We are alarmed and disturbed by this event and its impact on children and families,"" a letter from the district to families said.

The immigration agencies sent KPBS a statement Wednesday night confirming the arrest and said the man was undocumented and from Guatemala. ICE said in the statement the man was alone in the car when he was stopped and that the woman and child seen in the video arrived at the scene as the arrest was taking place.

""ICE San Diego finds it unfortunate that an individual chose to insert a child into an active law enforcement situation,"" the statement read, before criticizing statements released by public officials such as ""before the facts of this case were fully known.""

Earlier this month, ICE agents arrested a parent outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista during the morning drop-off period. Cell phone footage captured by bystanders and posted online showed federal agents approaching a vehicle on the street.

Divver said in a statement that a woman who had been ordered deported in absentia by a San Diego immigration judge in 2022 was arrested.

""The arrest was part of ICE's ongoing enforcement efforts and was resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds. The school was not involved in the incident, and there was no impact on students, staff or the school premises,"" Divver said.

The arrest prompted Chula Vista Elementary School District Superintendent Eduardo Reyes to inform families and staff in a letter that protocols were in place preventing unauthorized access to schools and limiting law enforcement officials from interacting with students unless there's an active emergency or warrant.

""We understand this may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that our schools remain safe spaces for all students,"" Reyes wrote.

Reyes recommended that families create a plan for the district to care for their children ""in the event that you are unable to pick them up or drop them off due to unforeseen circumstances.""

PEOPLE reached out to school administrators for the southwest Portland public charter school following reports from local KATU, KGW8, and KPTV, which first reported the decision to relocate amid responses from ICE agents against local protesters outside its facility.

“Cottonwood is currently in the process of an emergency move,” an email message from Laura Cartwright, the interim executive director of the Cottonwood School, read Friday, explaining that it could take multiple days to respond amid the school’s relocation efforts.

Cartwright told KATU earlier Friday that school officials decided to move the school out of concern for their students’ safety, as ICE agents continue using tear gas that neighbors have complained is both toxic and dangerous to the local community.

The charter school’s interim executive director also explained that educators have also routinely found “munitions” on its playground outside.

“In terms of our impact, we have been impacted mostly by chemical weapons that are being used against protesters in the vicinity of our school,” Cartwright told KATU. “So daily, we were finding munitions on our play yard, we were getting footage in the evenings of green gases, and gases being used near our gardens and enveloping our area.”

The school official told KGW8 that Cottonwood moved to a school building owned by Bridges Middle School more than a mile away, which recently moved to a new building for an unrelated reason.

Cottonwood Schools teaches students between kindergarten and eighth grade, according to the outlet. Cartwright told KGW8 that school officials first noticed an uptick in violent clashes and the use of dangerous tear gas towards the end of the last school year, telling the outlet the school was “losing enrollment regularly” due to its proximity to the ICE facility.

""Our garden was enveloped in gases one evening and we started to think we might not be able to mediate this in the school year and open on time,” Cartwright explained to KGW8.

Cartwright told KPTV in another interview that the persistent issues stemming from the ICE agents were “making it unsafe for the future” of the school, which begins its next school year in two weeks as teachers are still moving in to its new location across town.

Newsweek has confirmed in the ICE detention database that he is being held at the Northwest Detention Center. Newsweek reached out to ICE for comment via email on Friday.

Why It Matters

Chaudhry's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, with the president having pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in United States history.

Immigrants residing in the country both illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. Many with past convictions, even from decades ago, have found themselves in ICE custody despite spending years without facing serious immigration problems. Some U.S. citizens and those with valid visas have reportedly been swept up in immigration efforts as well.

What To Know

Chaudhry has lived in the U.S. for about 25 years, having served in the U.S. Army in the 1990s until the early 2000s, his wife Melissa Chaudhry told The Seattle Times. During his service, he sustained an injury that still affects his back and neck, leaving him wheelchair-bound, his wife said. He was discharged for medical reasons.

On Thursday, Chaudhry went to a ""naturalization hearing"" in Tukwila, Washington, as he is reportedly already a green card holder and has been working to obtain citizenship for years, Fox 13 Seattle reported.

Chaudhry reportedly faced deportation charges over a decade ago, when ICE sought to remove Chaudhry over a misdemeanor fraud charge from Australia, as reported by The Olympian. The local outlet also noted that he did not acknowledge that charge on his 2001 visa application, and in addition, he reportedly misrepresented his citizenship status on an application to become a reserve officer at the Yakima Police Department.

At the time, The Olympian reported that Chaudhry said he didn't understand the ramifications of the Australia fraud charge and did not recall misrepresenting his citizenship on the reserve officer application.

Chaudhry has two young children with his wife, Melissa, who ran for Congress in 2024.

What People Are Saying

Melissa Chaudhry, Zahid's wife and 2024 Candidate for Congress in Washington's 9th District, said, in a statement: ""ICE has stolen a beloved husband, a fiercely tender father, and a passionately patriotic American. We are all the poorer for it. My family will suffer every day he is apart from us and I have no idea when I will see Zahid again. In the truest spirit of Islam, Zahid has always stood for uplifting humanity. For doing good. For believing the best of people, and striving for peace. He came to this interview in good faith. ICE must release this decorated, disabled American veteran—return the heart of my family—and show the world that America still stands for justice and peace.""

Hannah Vickner Hough, Legal Director at Council on American-Islamic Relations' (CAIR) Washington Chapter, said in a statement: ""It is unusual for people to be taken into custody at a citizenship interview. However, we have seen that under this administration, Muslims are being targeted for unusually harsh immigration enforcement. Whatever the circumstances of an individual's immigration process, the government needs to provide the due process protections when an individual is working their way through the immigration system.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a previous statement shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

Shortly after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) officially declared that conditions in Gaza constituted a famine, Türk laid the blame for the humanitarian disaster directly at the feet of Israel.

""The famine declared today in Gaza... is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli Government,"" he said. ""It has unlawfully restricted the entry and distribution of humanitarian assistance and other goods necessary for the survival of the civilian population in the Gaza strip.""

Türk noted that the Israeli military had ""destroyed critical civilian infrastructure and almost all agricultural land, banned fishing, and forcibly displaced the population,"" all of which resulted in the starvation crisis in Gaza.

""It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,"" Türk continued. ""Israeli authorities must take immediate steps to end the famine in the Gaza Governorate and prevent further loss of life across the Gaza strip. They must ensure immediate entry of humanitarian assistance in sufficient amounts, and full access to UN and other humanitarian organizations.""

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the IPC report confirmed that the starvation in Gaza is a ""man-made disaster, a moral indictment—and a failure of humanity itself.""

""Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,"" Guterres emphasized. ""As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law—including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population... No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow—it is now.""

The IPC report emphasized that, as bad as the situation in Gaza currently is, it is projected to get even worse in the coming weeks.

""Between mid-August and the end of September 2025, conditions are expected to further worsen with famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis,"" the IPC stated.

For more than 30 years, she has been settled in Santa Cruz, Calif.

In March, returning home from a visit to Youghal, County Cork, where she had been caring for her ailing father, immigration officials flagged her re-entry because of two minor drug possession charges and other offenses from her past. They had been expunged from her record by the State of California but were still showing up in a federal database. A green-card holder, her residency assured until 2033, she was nonetheless detained for almost three weeks by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and feared deportation.

Ms. Ward is a trusted employee of a Christian charity that teaches children about environmental sustainability. She supports an adult child who suffers from a chronic illness. Through intense lobbying from her family, her trade union—Service Employees International Union—and elected representatives, Ms. Ward was eventually released from ICE custody.

She has been allowed to return to the life she built for herself in Santa Cruz as a valued member of her community. But the same cannot be said for many others who, though resident for years in the United States, may face deportation this year.

The deportation dragnet

Just about no one in Ireland would say that Irish citizens living in the United States are being treated as badly or being picked off as cruelly as immigrant residents from Latin America, South Asia or Africa. But consternation is on the rise about U.S. policy on immigrant residents and its escalating use of deportation.

Just five undocumented Irish immigrants were deported from the United States to Ireland in the whole of 2021. By the end of July in 2025, that number had already reached 56.

The issue has even been raised in the Dáil, the Irish parliament. There is a sense that the new attention to undocumented Irish, long previously tolerated on U.S. shores, represents another symbolic collapse suggesting that the United States is not the ally it used to be anymore.

Simon Harris, the minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, sought to underline how the official numbers are potentially underestimating the problem. “It is important to note that this figure only relates to cases where a citizen or their family has requested consular assistance and does not necessarily reflect all deportations to Ireland or where a citizen is currently being detained by ICE,” he said.

The rich connection between Ireland and the United States has been forged by more than a century of Irish emigration. There had been a time when Irish immigrants were viewed mostly positively both by the communities where they landed and the U.S. authorities that they interacted with. Increasingly, this is no longer the case. What happens when the system that was once welcoming turns hostile? And how is that experience reflected in how Irish people now treat those seeking refuge on the Emerald Isle?

Lena Deevy, a member of the Little Sisters of the Assumption, is perhaps uniquely placed to speak to both issues. Trained originally as a nurse, Sister Lena worked for almost 20 years in one of Dublin’s most disadvantaged communities, Ballymun. The neighborhood became nationally famous as host to the Ballymun Flats, an experimental public housing project built in the 1960s within utopian ambitions that ran aground on some hard economic realities and practical design flaws. High crime and social marginalization followed.

“Wherever I was,” she explains, “I was always interested in people on the edges.”

Her work in assisting the residents of Ballymun bore fruit but wore her out. And when it came time to take a sabbatical, she was encouraged on a path she never expected—pursuing a Master’s Degree in Education from Harvard University.

Exchanging the tower blocks of Ballymun for the ivory towers of Cambridge, Mass., in the late 1980s was a culture shock, but Sister Lena found her feet supporting the vulnerable Irish migrants who had made a home in the Boston area. The situation they faced then highlights the changes that have taken place in American attitudes to immigrants since the 1990s.

When she began her work at the Boston Irish Immigration Center (now the Rian Immigrant Center), Irish immigrants were protected by targeted visa schemes that had been sponsored by prominent U.S. politicians like two former Democratic members of the U.S. House, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and the late Brian Donnelly of Massachusetts. The programs allowed thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants to regularize their status.

Although she could have easily forged links by making the center a church-related body, Sister Lena chose not to go that route. It was important for her to reach out to those “people who left Ireland because the society had left them behind. Some of them left Ireland because they were gay. Or some of them left an Ireland where they were not wanted, seen variously as undesirable.”

While others celebrated a sanitized version of Irish emigration, Sister Lena confronted the racial and structural privileges that allowed Irish migrants to blend in while other immigrants were hunted. Whiteness offered Irish migrants a kind of conditional invisibility. That same privilege was not extended to Black and Latino migrants, who were much more energetically surveilled and then deported. “You blended in unless you spoke,” she says.

Under her leadership, the center quietly reoriented the landscape of Irish-American immigration advocacy. It began to offer legal aid, trauma-informed support and pathways to stability to all comers.

A historic reversal in Ireland

While her work unfolded in Boston, it carried lessons far beyond the American context. When Sister Lena returned home to Ireland, she found a society shifting from being a migrant-sending nation to becoming a migrant-receiving one. The change has exposed deep inconsistencies in how Irish society understands justice and belonging.

If whiteness once offered Irish migrants a kind of cover abroad, it now risks becoming the lens through which hospitality at home is rationed. The question becomes not just how others treat the Irish abroad, but how the Irish treat people seeking refuge in their midst.

Both the United States and Ireland “now treat the people they don’t want one way and those they do want another,” Sister Lena concludes. And both nations “are classifying whole groups of people as ‘undesirable.’”

Ireland absorbed waves of immigrants from Poland and other new E.U. member states from the late 1990s onwards without much civic uproar, but the more recent arrivals of Chinese, south Asian and African immigrants, joined by thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge, has provoked an “Ireland First” movement similar to the resistance to immigration emerging in the United States.

But there are institutions that push back. Most notably, perhaps, is the hugely influential organization for “Gaelic games,” the Gaelic Athletic Association, which explicitly presents its mission in terms of being “where we all belong.” This year the G.A.A. made its landmark stadium, Croke Park in Dublin, available for the celebration of the Muslim holiday of Eid Al-Adha.

When new G.A.A. clubs like Columbus Gaelic are established in Dublin entirely by migrants to Ireland who seek to embed themselves more fully in their new home, they replicate in a way the role the G.A.A. had long served for Irish immigrants to the shores of America and elsewhere. The G.A.A. is a common first port of call whether an Irish immigrant lands in Knoxville, Dubai or even Kampala to find a group who play the ancient Irish sports.

The Irish Catholic Church has also played a role in confronting a surge of xenophobia in Ireland. The episcopal conference issued a 2024 pastoral letter, “A Hundred Thousand Welcomes? Exploring what hospitality for migrant people means in contemporary Ireland,” which forcefully argued that hospitality was a Christian virtue and responsibility.

Michael O’Sullivan has spent decades working at the intersection of migration and public policy in Ireland. As one of the founders of the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, he has been involved in advocacy since the early 2000s.

He cautions against easy narratives of decline or backlash. “I don’t think Irish attitudes have changed that much,” he argues. “There’s no innate or culturally fixed antipathy toward migration. But there’s also no deeply ingrained hospitality either.”

The welcome that exists, he suggests, has always been patchy, shaped more by context and opportunity than by deep-seated conviction. And behind even the most generous public discourse, the Irish state’s approach has long been shaped by what he calls a “security manager” mindset—cautious, gatekeeping and risk-averse.

Sister Lena agrees, noting that in both the United States and Ireland “what alarms me is that in many ways we are more and more seeing migrants as a threat, missing out the rich opportunities and gifts that they bring us.”

Security trumps solidarity

There are significant successes that the Migrant Rights Centre can point to. An ambitious amnesty for undocumented migrants in 2022 allowed more than 8,000 workers to regularize their status in Ireland. But there have also been serious setbacks, most notably a constitutional referendum that successfully changed citizenship laws to make it harder for the children of immigrants to establish themselves as Irish citizens.

Mr. O’Sullivan is clear that progress in Ireland has often depended on the persistence of civil society rather than the emergence of comprehensive state vision. “The Department of Justice always saw immigration as something to be controlled, not something to be engaged with creatively,” he says.

The 2022 amnesty was a breakthrough, but “it was successful because it was exceptional, not because the underlying [immigration] system had changed.”

That system continues to operate according to a logic of deterrence. In recent months, asylum seekers arriving in Ireland have been left to sleep on the streets while awaiting accommodation. And the Irish government, responding to a small but vocal bloc of voters, has begun to quietly reduce social supports like housing assistance for immigrant arrivals. Its deportation orders have been dispatched more rapidly.

“What we’re seeing,” Mr. O’Sullivan warns, “is a quiet sidelining of the 1951 Refugee Convention.” That U.N. agreement created historic protections for asylum seekers and mandated obligations for receiving nations.

According to Mr. O’Sullivan, Irish officials are not abandoning the convention “as loudly” as other E.U. states, “but it’s doing it.”

As in the United States, the official language around migration in Ireland is increasingly shaped by ideas of risk, order and control rather than solidarity or shared humanity. Ireland may continue to tell a proud story about its emigrant past, but it is increasingly distancing itself from its obligations to migrants in the present. The country that once sent its people across oceans to build bridges and skyscrapers now builds bureaucratic walls against those who arrive by ferry.

Irish society aspires to hospitality as an abstraction, Mr. O’Sullivan says, but when push comes to shove, the welcome is often threadbare.

“We’re good at being good,” he says, “until it’s past our door.”

Perhaps that is what makes Cliona Ward’s story so unsettling, exposing how precarious even a “desirable” immigrant’s security can be. The Bible repeatedly insists that solidarity must be expressed for resident aliens, people entitled to particular protections precisely because of their vulnerability. When solidarity can be hard to find and the ground seems to be shifting on a daily basis, large populations in both Ireland and the United States find themselves exposed.

Those lucky to be thoroughly settled in a new homeland must remain vigilant to the temptation to separate what Sister Lena categorizes as the “acceptable people” from the “unacceptable” ones. To do that is to forget how our own histories have so often been shaped by exclusion and flight.

“We need to remember,” she says, “we all belong to each other.”

Today, when we speak of migration, we no longer picture the awe-inspiring journeys of Herodotus, Xuanzang, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, or James Cook, men who ventured across oceans and deserts, through empires and unknown lands without needing a permit to enter and sometimes even received an audience with curious royalties.[1] We forget that their stories represent countless others, unnamed, unrecorded. We overlook the migration of the earliest human, homo erectus and homo sapiens, those bold crossings over mountains and plains, rivers and seas, islands and continents, by people who knew no boundaries, only the pull of necessity, survival, and discovery. They exercised the most ancient human freedom: the freedom to migrate.

Now, when we hear the word migration, our minds leap not to the journey, but to borders, passports, patrols, visas. We ask whether someone’s movement is legal or illegal, allowed or forbidden. We debate thresholds and quotas, risks and threats. Rarely do we ask the more human question: Does a person have the right to move freely? Doesn’t a person have the right to seek safety, pursue happiness, or simply adventure elsewhere?

What once seemed instinctive is now seen as impermissible, unnatural, even immoral. But this distorted view of movement is astonishingly new. It is newer than carriages and clocks, than spectacles and telescopes. For most of human history, the idea that one needed permission to move would have been absurd. Questioning human migration was questioning human nature—it still is. For over 90% of our existence as hunter-gatherers, humans were entirely dependent on movement.

Even with the rise of agriculture and the building of cities, migration between spaces remained natural to individual and social life. Entire communities shifted with the seasons. Trade and travel routes like the Silk Road, the trans-Saharan highways were arteries of constant movement. Nomadic peoples endured. Even the settled recognized migration as a response to drought, war, or opportunity. One needed no reason, or any reason would suffice.

This right to move is older than nearly all others. It predates the right to property, that most revered right in American political mythology. Property only became relevant when humans began to fence off land. Even the American settlers who enshrined property rights had to first migrate across oceans and continents to claim the land often by force. The right to the ‘pursuit of happiness’, enshrined in the US Declaration of Independence (1776), presupposes freedom of movement. Before there was freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, or the right to due process, there was the right to migrate. Kings and empires might silence your tongue, outlaw your prayers, chain your thoughts, but they rarely questioned your decision to migrate. To migrate was beyond question. Often, it was the only freedom you could use to protect other personal rights by going to a new place. As the most respected freedom, it was the guardian of all other rights and freedoms.

Ancient thinkers, and traditions revered it as a sacred endeavour. Herodotus wrote, “Human prosperity never abides long in one place.” Aristotle saw migration as part of the natural order, while Socrates found it preceded new polities and civilizations. Religious traditions elevated migration into a moral duty: Abraham’s journey across deserts, the Exodus of the Israelites, the disciples’ missions across lands and cultures, and the Prophet Muhammad’s Hijra from Mecca to Medina were not mere detours or escapes. They were profound tales of faith, survival, and liberation in these traditions. Similarly, the Buddha’s Great Renunciation, the exiles in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and the Anishinaabe migration were considered sacred journeys in these traditions shaping both the self and the world.

And yet today, that great engine of human history has been stalled. The rise of modern nation-states, colonial cartographies, and rigid immigration regimes has replaced this freedom with control. The invention of passports, visa systems, and surveillance bureaucracies has shackled what was once humanity’s most basic instinct. A species that roamed the earth for millennia now finds itself trapped inside boxes, walled by citizenship papers, embassies, fences, and checkpoints.

Ironically, it was the very colonial powers who once championed expeditions, economic and political adventurism, and settlement expansion that later rebranded rather more peaceful and kinder versions as a threat. The same empires that moved freely across oceans and continents in search of resources and dominion turned around to criminalize movement when it came from the margins. They eagerly promoted a pantheon of liberal rights, including free speech, religion, property, and even humanitarian intervention, but withheld the most ancient and universal of them all: the freedom of movement.

When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, freedom of movement was included but subtly severed from the act of migration. A quiet sleight of hand. The right to leave was affirmed; the right to enter was not. It was a masterstroke of legal illusion, a political magic trick from the Western sleeve that has since cast a spell over global consciousness. A disillusion so complete, we forgot that the right to move was indeed the right to migrate; and it was never theirs to define, give or take. It was ours all along.

They even manufactured some baseless rights like preemptive self-defence, preemptive strikes, trade liberalization, and economic embargo, but somehow framed the right to migrate as too unrealistic, too disruptive, too dangerous to recognize. Denying the right to free movement has never been merely a matter of security or order; it reflects much deeper structural concerns. Facilitating and even coercing the flow of capital and resources from the Global South while restricting the movement of people ensures that global inequality remains entrenched, locking entire populations into structural disadvantage. These deeply embedded, often racialized, immigration systems have historically privileged certain regions and populations over others.

This redefinition has traveled far beyond its Western origins. For example, it is not only the United States or Germany that now deport Afghans, the very people they once claimed to protect. So too does Pakistan, Iran, and Tajikistan, who call Afghans their ‘Muslim brethren’, their ‘cultural kin’, their ‘linguistic neighbours’. Yet all these words evaporate at the border. Solidarity collapses at the gate.

Today, we no longer speak of migration as a right. We speak of it as a problem. A crime, a disruption to be managed. The image of the migrant has shifted from that of a seeker or survivor to that of an invader. We no longer greet them with wonder. We do not ask about their journeys, their struggles, their dreams. We fear them. Our attention has shifted from people to policies, from humanity to geography. We have created a world where those most in need of movement are the most forbidden to move. People are trapped in war zones, failing economies, and ecological disasters, not because they cannot escape, but because they are not allowed to. The powerful still glide across borders with ease; the vulnerable are held hostage by the coordinates of their birth. Worse still, this system has seeded hatred and xenophobia, nationalism, and exploitation. It has enabled trafficking where safe passage is denied. It has weaponized difference and built moral hierarchies out of geography. Borders are no longer lines; they are Great Walls of China, dividing people, excluding them.

To forget this freedom is not only to forget our past; it is to endanger our future. In boxing humanity into artificial lines, we have betrayed the very idea of freedom. We have turned a natural preservation instinct, a birthright, into a crime. We have silenced the journey. And in doing so, we have not only lost sight of our first freedom; we have lost a piece of what it means to be human.

The order prohibited President Trump from denying funding to more than additional 30 cities and counties in far-flung corners of the country, including Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Baltimore, Chicago and Columbus. The issue was their status as so-called sanctuary cities, with local laws that limit assistance to federal immigration agents.

It followed a previous order Judge William H. Orrick of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida issued in April, barring the government from withholding the funding to 16 other cities and counties. The original set was heavily concentrated in California but also included several larger cities such as Seattle, Portland and Minneapolis.

Judge Orrick wrote on Friday that the government had not objected to the motion by the coalition of local governments that brought the lawsuit to widen its reach. He noted that the government had only disputed the legal reasoning of the original decision and was in the process of appealing it.

The funding at issue included federal grants that amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. In their original complaint, the groups suing said they had been forced to consider putting on hold an array of capital projects and vital services, unsure of whether federal funding could dry up.

“The new plaintiffs have each alleged similar reliance on federal funding as the cities and counties and filed declarations showing similar harms to community health, welfare and social services and to their budgetary processes that depend on the regularly authorized grants of federal funding for a variety of critical needs,” Judge Orrick wrote.

The decision on Friday also came as the Trump administration ratcheted up immigration operations over the summer, steering unprecedented resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with an eye to drastically scaling up deportations.

In the past week, the Trump administration has increasingly embedded immigration agents with more than a dozen law enforcement agencies and city police that it has ordered to blanket the District of Columbia, having agents check the immigration status of people arrested over minor offenses or briefly held up during routine traffic stops.

While cutting funding across the federal government, the administration also vastly expanded funding for ICE through the tax and spending bill Congress passed in July.

It has simultaneously knocked down barriers that prohibited the sharing of sensitive data stored at agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Education Department for use in immigration enforcement, in what multiple lawsuits have claimed was a breach of federal privacy laws.

The lawsuit before Judge Orrick is one of the most ambitious cases against the Trump administration this year trying to resist the president’s immigration policy.

After the Supreme Court limited the power of federal judges in June to impose sweeping injunctions blocking policies across the country, outside groups have struggled to secure rulings that apply to more than a narrow subset of individuals, organizations or cities and states involved in the litigation.

By moving to include more than 30 additional cities and counties in the earlier decision, the local governments suing to halt the president’s attacks on sanctuary cities effectively brought about a comparable result.

In all, the order reached two dozen additional cities and 10 additional counties across 13 states, including 19 more cities and counties in California that were left out in the original order in April.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/22/multimedia/22trump-news-sanctuary-cities-bfzh/22trump-news-sanctuary-cities-bfzh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 01:56:31.220291

On Monday, protesters gathered outside the San Bernardino Police Department, carrying signs and denouncing the actions of federal agents.","A San Bernardino family is calling for a criminal investigation after federal immigration agents fired at their car last week, an encounter that escalated into a tense standoff and days of protest in the neighborhood.

On Aug. 16, Francisco Longoria was driving home with his teenage son and his daughter’s boyfriend when, according to attorneys for the family, several masked individuals in mismatched uniforms jumped out of an unmarked vehicle and surrounded them. The family said they asked for identification but received no response. Without warning, one of the men smashed the driver’s side window and struck Longoria, who then drove away in fear. Moments later, shots rang out. At least three bullets struck the car door near where Longoria’s son was seated, the family’s attorneys said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have confirmed that agents were involved in the incident but offered a different account. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Longoria refused to exit his vehicle and drove toward officers, injuring two. That, the spokesperson said, “forced a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

No one in the family’s vehicle was struck by the gunfire.

The confrontation set off a chain of events that lasted most of the day. After leaving the scene, Longoria called police, telling dispatchers that “masked men” had broken his window and shot at his car.

San Bernardino police said officers responded but did not intervene directly, citing state law that limits local participation in federal immigration enforcement. By late morning, multiple law enforcement vehicles surrounded the family’s home, where advocates said the family feared leaving after the shooting. Agents ultimately departed hours later without making an arrest.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which has been working with the family, said Longoria has no criminal record and was targeted without legal justification. The group has demanded accountability from federal officials and local police.

The incident has already sparked visible community backlash. On Monday, protesters gathered outside the San Bernardino Police Department, carrying signs and denouncing the actions of federal agents. “It doesn’t seem they’re protecting us,” one advocate said. “It seems they’re protecting these bounty hunters and kidnappers.”

Attorneys for the Longoria family plan to present new evidence Friday at a press conference in San Bernardino, where the damaged vehicle will be displayed. “This was a ruthless and violent attack,” attorney Robert Simon of the Justice Team said in a statement. “The family feels they were targeted, racially profiled, and nearly kidnapped by unknown individuals.”

The family is now demanding a full criminal investigation into the shooting. “Mr. Longoria and his family have been here for decades,” the attorneys said. “They are hardworking people without any criminal record. They deserve answers.”",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/snapshot-5-13.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-23 03:56:52.725814

On August 20, ICE agents were conducting targeted immigration enforcement at 100 Montgomery Street. As law enforcement attempted to carry out its sworn duties, anti-ICE rioters surrounded and assaulted four federal agents outside the building. The agents sustained injuries from pepper spray deployed by rioters and a jammed finger.

One individual, Adrian Guerrero—a U.S. citizen—was charged with assaults and destruction of federal property. According to court filings, Guerrero slashed the tire of a government vehicle and threatened to stab a law enforcement officer.

While standing arms length from the officer, Guerrero made repeated threats against stating: “I’m going to fuck you up,” “I’m going to go after your family,” and “I’m going to stab you.”

At the time of his arrest, Guerrero was in possession of the black knife and the patterned headscarf and orange-tinged goggles visible in the attack.

The United States operates the largest immigrant detention system in the world. A record-breaking 60,000 immigrants are currently detained in U.S. facilities. The recent opening of the largest U.S. federal migrant detention center on a military base indicates the intent of the Trump Administration to increase its detention figures through aggressive tactics such as workplace raids and courthouse arrests.

At the same time, advocates warn that the conditions in U.S. immigration detention centers have become increasingly dire. Rounded up through workplace raids and arrests at immigration courts, the number of immigrants in government custody is rapidly exceeding U.S. institutional capacity. Detainees, lawyers, family members, and lawmakers report overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate food, with at least 10 immigrants dying in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody since the beginning of 2025.

The Trump Administration’s aggressive detention tactics have met significant pushback: a federal judge temporarily halted new construction of “Alligator Alcatraz,” an immigration detention facility in Florida, and a New York federal judge ordered the Trump Administration to remedy conditions in New York City migrant holding cells.

Immigration detention is governed by a complex patchwork of federal statutes and regulations, such as the Immigration and Nationality Act, which grants the U.S. government broad detention authority. The Department of Homeland Security and its component, ICE, are primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing these regulations. Yet, the rapid evolution of policy directives, coupled with the distinctive characteristics of detained immigration courts have led legal experts to question the legality of the federal government’s mandate over the detention of immigrants.

The ongoing debate over immigration detention policy raises the fundamental issue of due process as it applies to noncitizens in immigration courts. Although the American Bar Association recently urged the federal government to ensure that immigrants receive due process, lawyers, advocates, and policymakers disagree over how to balance national security and border management with the constitutional and human rights protections owed to noncitizens.

In this week’s Saturday Seminar, scholars discuss the evolving legal landscape surrounding immigration detention centers.

In an article in the Stanford Law Review, Paulina Arnold of the University of Michigan Law School traces how U.S. immigration detention became an exceptional regulatory carveout from ordinary civil confinement rules. Arnold claims that immigration detention’s lack of bond hearings and due process is a modern invention rather than a historical norm. Arnold explains that immigration detention was once part of a broad civil confinement system with few constitutional limits, but a mid-20th-century pause in immigration detention spared it from later judicial reforms, leaving courts to rely on outdated precedent. Arnold argues that this history undercuts jurisprudence that defends immigration detention as exceptional and bolsters calls to align detention policy with constitutional safeguards.

In an article in the Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Azadeh Shahshahani of Project South and Kyleen Burke of Suffolk County Legal Aid Society, argue that U.S. immigration detention centers exploit detainees through work programs, coercing labor for pennies an hour in violation of international prohibitions on forced labor. Although challenges to these practices are often brought under federal law, Shahshahani and Burke note, parties could benefit from invoking international law, particularly treaties ratified by the U.S. Shahshahani and Burke explain that these treaties prohibit civil detention centers from engaging in forced labor and other internationally condemned practices. Shahshahani and Burke contend that incorporating arguments from these international legal frameworks could promote accountability and end inhumane conditions in detention centers.

In an article in the Brooklyn Law School’s Journal of Law and Policy, Sabrina Balgamwalla of Wayne State University Law School argues that ICE’s unchecked power to transfer detainees causes harms that existing procedures cannot remedy. Balgamwalla explains that these transfers—from public to private facilities, across state lines, and beyond individual courts’ jurisdiction—often place detainees in remote areas, intensifying the obstacles of defending against removal. Balgamwalla attributes this disproportionate authority to systemic failures across all branches of government: statutory and regulatory gaps that fail to constrain ICE, and jurisdiction-stripping laws that block judicial review. Balgamwalla concludes that rather than reforming transfer policies, the entire immigration enforcement model must be redone to embed meaningful safeguards for noncitizens.

Current immigration detention jurisprudence fails to protect the substantive rights of detained immigrants, argues Alina Das of New York University School of Law in a Harvard Law Review article. Das explains that some courts have rejected legal challenges made by detained immigrants out of a reluctance to contradict the political branches. Das asserts that by assuming that the sole interest of the political branches in detention is to seclude and deport immigrants, U.S. courts fail to consider the interests of immigrants. Das contends that the political branches indeed have an interest in ensuring civil conditions for detained immigrants. Das maintains that the failure of the U.S. government to effectuate its “civil detention interest” underscores the lawlessness of the current system.

In an article in the Virginia Law Review, Ingrid Ealy of the UCLA School of Law and Steven Shafer of the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project argue that the unregulated design of detained immigration courts erodes due process and fundamental fairness by creating a segregated court system that systematically disadvantages detainees. The authors emphasize that detained immigration courts prioritize speedy proceedings with minimal representation by counsel, heavy reliance on video adjudication, and limited public access. Ealy and Shafer contend that the rules of these courts give the government immense power over where immigration cases are held. The authors maintain that an understanding of the structure and function of the detained immigration court system is crucial to efforts to research and reform immigration detention policy.

In an article in the Scholarly Commons at Boston University School of Law, Sarah Sherman-Stokes of Boston University School of Law contends that the U.S. government’s “Alternatives to Detention” program entrenches rather than alleviates the harms of immigration enforcement. Sherman-Stokes warns against treating digital surveillance as a humane reform, explaining that such “digital cages” extend a punitive immigration system’s reach into communities. Sherman-Stokes emphasizes that electronic monitoring inflicts a hidden but serious harm and normalizes an expanded enforcement infrastructure. Sherman-Stokes calls for abolishing not only immigration detention but also its digital substitutes, insisting that true reform requires dismantling this carceral surveillance regime.

The lawsuit before Judge Orrick is one of the most ambitious cases against the Trump administration this year trying to resist the president’s immigration policy.

After the Supreme Court limited the power of federal judges in June to impose sweeping injunctions blocking policies across the country, outside groups have struggled to secure rulings that apply to more than a narrow subset of individuals, organizations or cities and states involved in the litigation.

By moving to include more than 30 additional cities and counties in the earlier decision, the local governments suing to halt the president’s attacks on sanctuary cities effectively brought about a comparable result.

In all, the order reached two dozen additional cities and 10 additional counties across 13 states, including 19 more cities and counties in California that were left out in the original order in April.

She also insisted that a “client list” of the rich and powerful associated with Mr. Epstein did not exist, and denied any scheme to blackmail his associates. The Justice Department and the F.B.I. had concluded in July that there was no specific “client list” for Mr. Epstein’s trafficking ring, and no credible evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”

Mr. Epstein’s victims and their families had objected to the interview, and Ms. Maxwell’s subsequent transfer to a cushier prison, accusing Mr. Trump of offering a sweetheart deal to someone prosecutors say has a history of self-serving falsehoods.

Here’s what happened:

Maxwell praised Trump and distanced him from Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell acknowledged the social relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein but denied any connection between Mr. Trump and the sex-trafficking ring. She also denied recruiting an underage victim of Mr. Epstein who said she had been recruited while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s Florida estate and club, in 2000.

“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago,” Ms. Maxwell said. Virginia Giuffre, who was 16 at the time, said she was approached by Ms. Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago and invited to become Mr. Epstein’s traveling masseuse. She said the two of them then groomed her to perform sexual services and passed her around “like a platter of fruit” to rich and powerful predators in Mr. Epstein’s circle, including Prince Andrew of Britain.

Neither Ms. Maxwell nor Mr. Blanche, who was Mr. Trump’s trial lawyer before becoming deputy attorney general, mentioned Ms. Giuffre by name during the interview. But Ms. Maxwell denied a specific allegation made by Ms. Giuffre — that Andrew had forced her to have sex at Ms. Maxwell’s home in London — as “absolute rubbish.” Ms. Giuffre died by suicide this year.

Ms. Maxwell, who is seeking a pardon or reduction of her sentence, downplayed Mr. Trump’s long friendship with Mr. Epstein and went out of her way to praise the president. Mr. Trump, asked whether he would consider pardoning Ms. Maxwell last month, said, “I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I haven’t thought about.”

“I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Ms. Maxwell said during the interview. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Maxwell said she believed Epstein didn’t kill himself.

Ms. Maxwell, who was not present for Mr. Epstein’s death, speculated that Mr. Epstein did not commit suicide. She did not offer any particular theory of what had instead happened, but downplayed the possibility that someone had Mr. Epstein killed with the intention of eliminating evidence of the sex-trafficking ring.

“I don’t see that,” Ms. Maxwell said. “I think, is it possible? Of course it’s possible. But I don’t know of any reason why, and I don’t believe in the blackmail or in any of this, I don’t think Epstein had a hit on like that. If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.”

A yearslong Justice Department investigation concluded that Mr. Epstein, who was found dead in his cell with a bedsheet tied around his neck in 2019, died by suicide, not foul play.

Blanche appeared to play political favorites with his questions.

At several crucial moments in the expansive interview, Mr. Blanche peppered Ms. Maxwell with questions about some of Mr. Epstein’s associates, while dropping other lines of questioning when the conversation appeared to be politically inconvenient.

Mr. Blanche, for example, asked many more questions about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with former President Bill Clinton than he did about Mr. Epstein’s relationship with Mr. Trump. In the end, Ms. Maxwell denied that either had engaged in sexual misconduct or other inappropriate behavior, and said neither had visited Mr. Epstein’s private islands.

At one point, as Ms. Maxwell defended Mr. Epstein and denied the allegations of sex trafficking, she said associates of Mr. Epstein had been unfairly vilified for their relationships with him.

“Some are in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers,” Ms. Maxwell said. She did not make clear whom she meant, but at another point she said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, once joined Mr. Epstein on a trip to hunt for dinosaur bones in the Dakotas. She added that there was no way Mr. Epstein’s associates “would be with him if he was a creep or because they wanted sexual favors.”

Mr. Blanche immediately moved on, and the claim that other associates of Mr. Epstein work in the Trump administration was never brought up again.

In other exchanges, Mr. Blanche came across as unusually deferential. At one point, he reassured Ms. Maxwell that “if I think that you’re not being honest, or that you’re missing something, I’m not going to — this isn’t ‘got you.’” When he ended the second day of the interview with Ms. Maxwell, he complimented her for going through with the interview and said that “we’ll be in touch soon.”

Maxwell discussed her and Epstein’s connections to the rich and powerful.

Mr. Blanche asked Ms. Maxwell about many of the rich and powerful figures in Mr. Epstein’s orbit, but got little out of her. She named many celebrities, businessmen and politicians — Elon Musk, Andrew M. Cuomo, John F. Kerry, Edward M. Kennedy, Sarah Ferguson, Naomi Campbell, Alan Dershowitz, Kevin Spacey and Larry Summers — but said they were simply friends or had business relationships with her and Mr. Epstein.

She described, for instance, how she and Mr. Musk had met in 2010 or 2011 at a party for Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, and said that she had learned through legal discovery that Mr. Musk and Mr. Epstein had communicated by email. Mr. Musk, in the midst of a public spat with Mr. Trump earlier this year, had said that the president’s name was “in the Epstein files” and “that is why they have not been made public”

Ms. Maxwell also said Mr. Epstein had been close to Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel, but under further questioning she said she remembered little of their encounters, or why he had been close to Mr. Epstein.

Maxwell denied working with intelligence agencies.

One of the conspiracy theories surrounding Mr. Epstein is the unfounded accusation that the sex trafficking was a means to collect blackmail material on his powerful and influential associates. Particularly in right-wing circles, the theory goes further to suggest that Mr. Epstein was being paid for the blackmail effort in connection with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, like the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and even the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.

Ms. Maxwell emphatically denied most of those accusations, and said she had no knowledge of others. In one particularly noteworthy exchange, Mr. Blanche asked if she had ever had contact with a Mossad agent.

“Well, not deliberately,” Ms. Maxwell said.

“Pardon me?” Mr. Blanche asked.

She repeated, “Not deliberately.”

Mr. Blanche did not ask what she meant by that, and moved on.

“I am pleased to announce that I am promoting Sergio Gor to be our next United States Ambassador to the Republic of India, and Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

He claimed that Mr. Gor and his team had placed nearly 4,000 people across government, a figure that could not be independently verified, and called him a “great friend, who has been at my side for many years.”

The president also said that “for the most populous region in the world, it is important that I have someone I can fully trust to deliver on my agenda.”

Mr. Gor would need to be confirmed by the Senate for the ambassadorship, although the special envoy role can be made simply by appointment. His nomination to the ambassadorship comes as a sudden rift has developed between the United States and India amid Mr. Trump’s threats of punishing tariffs, rocking a friendship between the world’s two largest democracies that had seemed to be flourishing just months ago.

Mr. Gor was valued by the president for his perceived loyalty, and his willingness to freeze out of government people he considered insufficiently pure in that regard. But he was also criticized by others as capricious in his decisions. And he fought bitterly with Elon Musk, Mr. Trump’s billionaire adviser who ran an effort that ripped through existing government systems in the name of cutting costs and who himself often fought with others in the government.

Mr. Gor was involved in providing Mr. Trump information that Jared Isaacman, a businessman and ally of Mr. Musk whom Mr. Trump picked in late 2024 to lead NASA on Mr. Musk’s recommendation, had donated money to Democrats in the recent past. Mr. Trump decided to pull the nomination from the Senate confirmation process on Mr. Musk’s last day working at the White House. Mr. Isaacman had directly told Mr. Trump about those donations in their 2024 meeting during the presidential transition, according to two people with knowledge of the events, but Mr. Trump claimed to be learning of them for the first time.

Several people, including Mr. Trump, were later said to have been unhappy about how the situation had played out that day, according to a person familiar with the remarks.

Mr. Gor has also been a focus of a crush of negative news stories that have raised questions about his personal back story and how he rose to prominence in Mr. Trump’s world.

Mr. Gor previously worked for Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. He has over several years had close relationships with a number of people in the president’s extended orbit, including his son Donald Trump Jr. In 2024, the super PAC he ran was heavily backed by the former Marvel Entertainment executive Isaac Perlmutter, a friend and member of Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club in Florida.

“We haven’t had to bring in the regular military, which we’re willing to do if we have to,” Mr. Trump said. “After we do this, we’ll go to another location, and we’ll make it safe.”

Mr. Trump then called Chicago “a mess” and said that “we’ll straighten that one out.”

“Probably next, that will be our next one after this, and it won’t even be tough,” he said, adding, “I think Chicago will be our next and then we’ll help with New York.”

Later, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if he had taken any concrete steps toward bringing a federal crackdown to Chicago. The president said he had not.

“When we’re ready, we’ll go in and we’ll straighten out Chicago, just like we did D.C.,” he said.

Mr. Trump’s comments suggest he will use the crackdown on Washington as a template for other cities around the country. But he would have limited ability to deploy the show of force in the same way he did in D.C.

Its unique status as a federal district, not a state, means Mr. Trump can wield greater control in Washington than in other cities. While the Home Rule Act allowed the president to take temporary control of D.C.’s police force during what he portrayed as an emergency, similar laws do not exist for other cities.

And while Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard, governors typically command the Guards in their states.

That said, Mr. Trump would have a number of ways to display a show of force. Courts have already upheld his federalization of National Guard troops in California, most likely emboldening the president to deploy other states’ Guard troops.

Mr. Trump could also order a surge of federal law enforcement officers from the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies to descend on Chicago.

But the most extreme step Mr. Trump could take would be to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the active-duty military for civilian law enforcement in American cities. Mr. Trump has mulled doing so in the past, in response to protests, but said on Monday that such a step had not been necessary.

The president has been suggesting for weeks that he might deploy National Guard troops to other cities, including Chicago, which is experiencing a historic drop in homicides. The city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, responded to Mr. Trump’s comments, calling a potential deployment of National Guard troops “unlawful” and “unsustainable.”

Mr. Johnson, a Democrat, said he had not received any communication from the Trump administration about a plan.

“There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,” Mr. Johnson said.

Murders, shootings and robberies have fallen significantly in Chicago in 2025, police statistics show.

Crime in Washington was already declining before Mr. Trump ordered a takeover of the city’s police force.

Mr. Trump said on Monday that the takeover had produced a week without a homicide and that it was “the first time in memory that that’s happened.”

But D.C. has already had several weeks this year without a homicide, including a stretch in late February and early March in which the city did not experience a homicide for more than two weeks, according to police statistics.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also fired Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as Rear Adm. Jamie Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversaw Naval Special Warfare Command, a Defense Department official said on Friday. The Pentagon offered no immediate explanation why.

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the firing of General Kruse, who had a long career of nonpartisan service, was troubling.

“The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration’s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,” Mr. Warner said.

The Defense Intelligence Agency is in charge of collecting intelligence on foreign militaries, including the size, position and strength of their forces. The agency provides the information to the military’s combatant commands and planners at the Pentagon.

The senior defense official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that General Kruse would no longer serve as the intelligence agency’s director, although it was not clear if he would be offered a different position in the Air Force or if he would retire. Two congressional officials said lawmakers were notified on Friday that Mr. Hegseth had fired General Kruse because of “a loss of confidence” in the senior officer.

Days after U.S. military strikes hit three of Iran’s nuclear sites in June, the Defense Intelligence Agency drafted a preliminary assessment that suggested Tehran’s nuclear program was set back only by months. Reports about the assessment by CNN and The New York Times prompted a fierce backlash from the White House.

In the days that followed, the White House and senior intelligence officials tried to paint a different picture, of a more successful operation against Iran.

Mr. Warner linked Mr. Kruse’s firing directly to his agency’s assessment of that operation.

“That kind of honest, fact-based analysis is exactly what we should want from our intelligence agencies, regardless of whether it flatters the White House narrative,” Mr. Warner said. “When expertise is cast aside and intelligence is distorted or silenced, our adversaries gain the upper hand and America is left less safe.”

General Kruse’s firing was earlier reported by The Washington Post.

It was unclear who would replace General Kruse, a 34-year Air Force veteran who had served in numerous senior intelligence jobs in Washington and overseas, including positions overseeing military intelligence operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Indo-Pacific region.

The agency’s deputy director, Christine Bordine, will serve as acting director until General Kruse’s successor is approved by the Senate.

Several former senior intelligence officials said General Kruse has had a target on his back since the early days of the second Trump administration.

A visit by members of Elon Musk’s government efficiency team to D.I.A. headquarters earlier this year was disastrous, with DOGE members concluding the agency was bloated and its missions ill-defined, one former senior official said.

Another official said the Trump administration was upset with the agency’s slow development of a database tool and wanted General Kruse to ditch it in favor of commercial systems. The tool, known as MARS, is meant to make managing intelligence data easier. It has been under development for years, under multiple administrations.

After the agency’s preliminary assessment of the military strikes in Iran became public, some White House officials began focusing on the fact that General Kruse had been appointed during the Biden administration. Some Trump administration officials want to replace all military leaders appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the official said.

Other Trump administration officials viewed D.I.A. as too large, and were impatient for quick change.

The agency was created to be the military’s primary all-source intelligence shop, and many hoped it would replace the intelligence efforts of individual armed services. But the Pentagon never shut down the other service intelligence agencies.

So the Defense Intelligence Agency became the home of the misfit toys — missions and assignments no one else wanted or needed, the former defense official said.

Ms. Maxwell has been seeking to overturn or reduce her 20-year sentence, giving her a powerful incentive to tell Mr. Trump’s team what it wanted to hear.

Mr. Epstein’s victims and their families vehemently objected to the interview, and her subsequent transfer to a cushier prison, accusing Mr. Trump of offering a sweetheart deal to a convicted sex offender who would say anything to protect herself, and him.

In fact, many of Ms. Maxwell’s statements appeared to buttress Mr. Trump’s contention that the Epstein case is old news. He has urged supporters to drop their obsession with uncovering new evidence of a sinister conspiracy involving wealthy and powerful men.

During the interview, Ms. Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for aiding in Mr. Epstein’s trafficking of underage girls, calmly swatted down any suggestion that there were significant details in the government’s investigative files that had not already been made public.

“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,” Ms. Maxwell said in a muffled English accent in the conference room of a Florida courthouse. “I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way.”

Ms. Maxwell — who, according to prosecutors, has a history of self-serving falsehoods — knocked down the central pillars of the Epstein conspiracy theories, one by one. “There is no list” of powerful clients, she said, no blackmail campaign by Mr. Epstein to extort money or favors, and no dark secrets about Mr. Trump, who once considered Mr. Epstein a close friend.

She disputed the official narrative on only one point, but it was an essential one — the government’s finding that Mr. Epstein’s jailhouse death by hanging in 2019 was self-inflicted.

“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she told Mr. Blanche, adding that she had no idea who killed her onetime lover and employer. “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay somebody, a prisoner, to kill you for $25 worth of commissary” items.

Mr. Blanche’s highly unusual sit-down with Ms. Maxwell, 63, was followed by her transfer from a restrictive prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas.

Ms. Maxwell, who is seeking a pardon or reduction of her long prison sentence for sex trafficking, downplayed the president’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. She went out of her way to tread lightly when the subject turned to Mr. Trump, who has not ruled out issuing her a pardon.

“President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” she told Mr. Blanche. “I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.”

She described Mr. Trump as “a gentleman in all respects.”

Ms. Maxwell also denied recruiting an underage victim of Mr. Epstein who said that she had been recruited while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 2000.

“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago,” Ms. Maxwell said. The victim, Virginia Giuffre, who was 16 at the time, said she was approached by Ms. Maxwell at the resort and invited to become Mr. Epstein’s traveling masseuse.

Whatever Ms. Maxwell’s motives, or the veracity of her statements, the audio provides a glimpse into the life of a woman who lived in the shadow, and service, of powerful and profoundly troubled men — first her father, the British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, and then Mr. Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell, now confined to a cell and prison togs, relayed to Mr. Blanche, with an air of detachment that at times suggested she was talking about someone else, details of her former life with Mr. Epstein, adjacent to fame and power, without material want or guardrails.

At one point, she casually described how Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the health and human services secretary, once joined Mr. Epstein on a trip to hunt for dinosaur bones in the Dakotas. At another, she dismissed the suggestion that former President Bill Clinton was among the men who received massages in her presence.

When Mr. Blanche asked her if there were “any international businessmen or politicians” whose close relationship with Mr. Epstein had not received sufficient public scrutiny, she replied: “Off the top of my, head, I can think of Ehud Barak,” the former Israeli prime minister.

Pressed about many famous people in Mr. Epstein’s orbit, Ms. Maxwell disclosed very little. Over and over, she said that the celebrities — Elon Musk, Andrew M. Cuomo, John F. Kerry, Ted M. Kennedy, Sarah Ferguson, Naomi Campbell, Kevin Spacey and Larry Summers — were just friends with her and Mr. Epstein.

At times, she defended Mr. Epstein, suggesting his behavior changed after he began taking testosterone in the late 1990s. “That altered his character,” she said. “He became more aggressive.”

She described her amazement at how the myth of Mr. Epstein still had such a hold on the American public — more than 15 years after he was first charged.

“So that narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what —basically this is like a Salem witch trial,” she said. “People have gone and lost their minds for this thing. I understand that. But the issue is, how do you satisfy a mob who can’t understand the lifestyle because it’s like P. Diddy in Redux on TV with Clintons and Trump. I mean, it’s — it’s bananas.”

Ms. Maxwell was dismissive of Mr. Epstein’s documented history of preying on young women and underage girls, despite her own conviction on enabling his behavior. She said she never saw Mr. Epstein encourage men to have inappropriate contact with his masseuses, minors or young women.

Asked if she knowingly selected girls for Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell replied, “I never ever checked their age and I never checked their credentials.”

For the most part, she remained composed. But she became momentarily rattled, it seemed, when Mr. Blanche asked her to discuss the intimate details of her own relationship with Mr. Epstein, particularly whether she suspected that he was cheating on her.

“I’m not stupid, I’m very bright, I’ve had an excellent education, I traveled all over the world, I had had boyfriends,” Ms. Maxwell said, appearing to struggle to find the right words. “But I had never met or understood that somebody could be so — would lie to me.”

In the interviews, Mr. Blanche, an experienced and polished trial lawyer, appeared at times to be conducting a not-unfriendly direct examination of Ms. Maxwell, guiding her through a series of tough questions but seldom following up on her evasions or statements that conflicted with established facts about the Epstein case.

Ms. Maxwell went so far as to suggest that none of the famous men who hung out with Mr. Epstein came for sex.

“If you met Epstein, there is no way that this cast of characters, of which it’s extraordinary, and some are in your cabinet, who you value as your co-workers, and you know, would be with him if he was a creep or because they wanted sexual favors,” she said. “A man wants sexual favors, he will find that. They didn’t have to come to Epstein for that.”

Mr. Blanche did not press her.

The release of the transcripts and the audio came on the same day the Justice Department sent Congress thousands of pages of documents related to its investigation into Mr. Epstein in response to a subpoena from a House committee.

This spring, Mr. Trump was told by Attorney General Pam Bondi that his name appeared in unreleased files from the investigation. The president has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to the case, and the files are likely to contain references to many people who came in contact with Mr. Epstein.

In the end, Ms. Maxwell said nothing to challenge those conclusions, and even pushed back on the idea that the two men were actually friends.

Mr. Trump has denied that he sent an enigmatic and affectionate note for a book compiled by Ms. Maxwell to celebrate Mr. Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.

When Mr. Blanche asked if she remembered “President Trump submitting a letter or a card,” she responded, “I don’t.”

Asked to define their relationship, Ms. Maxwell replied, “I don’t think they were close friends.”

Michael Gold contributed reporting.

Still, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican who chairs the Oversight Committee, praised the department, writing on social media that it was “moving at a pace far faster than anything ever produced by the Biden” administration’s Justice Department.

It was not known what was in the files provided to the panel, which have not been publicly released. A spokeswoman said the committee intended to do so after a thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material were redacted, and after consulting with the Justice Department to ensure that any documents released would not damage ongoing criminal cases and investigations.

Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the panel, said on social media that his team was “beginning a careful review process” of the material that was provided and would “share additional information as we learn more.”

The move was the most significant release of material from the case since the Justice Department and F.B.I. announced in early July that they were concluding the Epstein investigation, prompting intense backlash from President Trump’s supporters on the right.

On Friday, Mr. Trump, who last month threatened to cast supporters out of his political movement over their continued demands to see the Epstein files, seemed to endorse the Justice Department’s handover of the material to Congress.

He told reporters that he had directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to “give them everything you can give them.” Still, the president, who has often fueled conspiracy theories when they have benefited him, continued to insist that any remaining fixation over the Epstein case was a partisan plot stoked by Democrats.

Democrats and a few Republicans on the House Oversight Committee banded together last month to approve a subpoena for the files, forcing Mr. Comer to issue it.

The action was one of the last things lawmakers did before leaving Washington for their August recess, as the G.O.P. faced outrage within its base and a growing divide about how to address the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein investigation. The dilemma had effectively frozen the House floor as Democrats sought to force votes at nearly every turn on whether to release the material and Republicans toiled to avoid having to register a position.

House Republican leaders had hoped that developments during their five-week summer recess away from Washington might curb the fervor from their constituents over the files. But courts blocked the release of grand jury testimony, and Ms. Maxwell’s relocation to a minimum-security prison camp prompted further outcry and questions from lawmakers.

The new release of records may do little to help, given the timing and the fact that the release was only partial. More records are expected to be provided in the coming months. But the delay will most likely prompt continued demands for the files.

At the same time, many lawmakers have continued to call for the full release of Epstein-related material not just to the committee but also to the public.

And House Republican leaders still appear likely to face a bipartisan effort early next month to force a floor vote on a public release of the files. Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican and frequent Trump critic, and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, plan to use a procedural maneuver to bring up their measure, which has bipartisan support, requiring the Justice Department to release its records to the public.

Newsweek reached out to Abrego Garcia's attorney Sean Hecker for comment via email Friday afternoon.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem told Newsweek in a statement that Abrego Garcia's release was a ""complete disregard for the safety of the American people.

Why It Matters

The administration of President Donald Trump has argued that, despite the administrative error that led to Abrego Garcia's deportation, he should be removed from the U.S. anyway because of alleged ties to the MS-13 criminal gang and human trafficking charges.

His case was among several challenges brought against the use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to rapidly send immigrants to the Salvadoran prison.

What To Know

Abrego Garcia has been in custody since the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

The Department of Justice said Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager, had transported undocumented immigrants across the country along with co-conspirators. He has denied the allegations, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop.

In late July, two federal judges ruled that Abrego Garcia must be released from custody and returned to Maryland while his trial is pending. His attorneys raised concerns that DHS would immediately detain him again on immigration grounds.

Friday's release comes after a lengthy battle to get Abrego Garcia back to his family after his arrest by federal agents in early March.

He was swiftly taken south before being placed on one of two planes that landed in El Salvador on March 15, despite a court order barring the removals, and a 2019 order preventing his deportation to his home country.

Abrego Garcia's family and Democrats in Congress fought for his return, which the Trump administration maintained for several weeks was not in their power, despite the U.S. Supreme Court stepping in.

What People Are Saying

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, in a statement to Newsweek on Friday: ""Activist liberal judges have attempted to obstruct our law enforcement every step of the way in removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country. Today, we reached a new low with this publicity hungry Maryland judge mandating this illegal alien who is a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator be allowed free.

""By ordering this monster loose on America's streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people. We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.""

U.S. Democratic Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, in a statement shared with Newsweek: ""Despite the Trump Administration's relentless efforts to defy our Constitution, our legal system has worked its will and is upholding Kilmar Abrego Garcia's right to due process. Following the court's ruling, I'm glad that he is being returned to his home and his family, where he rightly belongs.

""While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia's rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained – because due process in this case does not end with his release. Mr. Abrego Garcia must continue to be allowed to defend himself in court, where the Trump Administration must make its case before taking any further action against him. This is a matter that's greater than just this one case or one man – if one person's rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk.""

Hecker Fink, the law firm representing Abrego Garcia, in a press release August 19 on a motion to dismiss: ""The filing argues that the government has engaged in a vindictive prosecution, seeking to penalize Abrego Garcia for asserting his rights, rather than accepting an unjust outcome.

""Our motion makes clear that such tactics are inconsistent with principles of fairness and justice, and that the prosecution should be dismissed.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to Newsweek in June: ""Abrego Garcia was never an innocent 'Maryland Man'– Abrego Garcia is an illegal alien terrorist, gang member, and human trafficker who has spent his entire life abusing innocent people, especially women and the most vulnerable. Abrego Garcia will now return to the United States to answer for his crimes and meet the full force of American justice.""

What Happens Next

The DHS has made it clear that it intends to deport Abrego Garcia once his criminal trial concludes.

Ahead of his release, citing concerns that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would detain him on his return to Maryland—rather than honor an order that he remain under observation instead—his attorneys said they had obtained private security for Abrego Garcia.

So while I'm standing there waiting for them to come up to us, ICE agents came out of this side gate here sprinting and speared me in the back and knocked me into the ground, landed on my shoulder, messed up my chest. I'm still having a bit of a hard time breathing,” said Herzberg.

Next door to the ICE building is the Cottonwood School.

because of what they say are the impacts of ICE tactics.

“Well, in terms of our impact, we have been impacted mostly by chemical weapons that are being used against protesters in the vicinity of our school. So daily, we were finding munitions on our play yard, we were getting footage in the evenings of green gases, and gases being used near our gardens and enveloping our area,” said Laura Cartwright, the interim executive director of the Cottonwood School.

A couple blocks away from the ICE building is where Elle George lives. After about a month of protests, she too is on her way out.

“I started experiencing negative effects from all the gases they're using. And my doctor determined that it was medically necessary for me to relocate. I'm disabled, so when things trigger problems in my body, there could be serious consequences,” said George.

We've been trying to get a hold of ICE for their side of the story, but we haven’t heard back. We asked about the tactics they've used. On Thursday afternoon we asked about the use of gas that allegedly impacted the Cottonwood School. On Thursday evening we reached out about the alleged impacts of gas deployment in the surrounding community.

That being said, there's been tension on both sides of the picket line.

A few neighbors have been about noise from some protesters. One even filed a lawsuit hoping that the city could crack down on the noise.

According to ICE officials, border czar Tom Homan visited Portland on Wednesday to let ICE agents know that the federal government ""has their back.""

Mayor Keith Wilson and the Portland Police Bureau say they did not organize Homan's visit.

Wilson put out a statement reading in part, ""The masked and armed federal officers roaming the streets in unmarked vans touted by 'Border Czar' Tom Homan are chilling symbols of fear and oppression, not the freedom, liberty, or opportunity we cherish."" He also said that ""Portland stands firm in protecting our sanctuary city status.""",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/986/center/90/71b002c6-298d-48f7-b770-0acd0636cb6b-ICEFACILITYATTACKcaptioned.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:56:34.031074

Dugan told police that she didn't know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.
“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers.
Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents ""down the hall to the administrative offices.
“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers.","MILWAUKEE — A Milwaukee judge charged with obstructing a federal agency and concealing a wanted person who was in the country illegally told police days after the incident in her courtroom that “I didn't do anything that they're saying.”

The comments were captured on body camera footage by Milwaukee police inside Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan's home three days before her arrest in April. Dugan told officers she was not aware of a criminal investigation into her conduct.

Dugan was indicted in May and faces charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had arrived to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.

Four days later, on April 22, Dugan called police to her house about a flyer from an anti-government group family members had received at their homes and workplaces.

Her conversation with officers, as captured on their body cameras, was released Friday by police to The Associated Press.

Dugan told police that she didn't know the person in her courtroom that day was in the country illegally and she denied giving him special treatment.

“It’s all lies,” Dugan told officers. She later said, “I didn’t do anything that they’re saying.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty and is fighting to have the charges against her thrown out. The charges against her underscore a clash between President Donald Trump’s administration and local authorities over the Republican president’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make an example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.

Dugan has not publicly commented on the allegations.

She told police that she didn’t know Flores-Ruiz’s immigration status.

“I don’t know if he’s an illegal immigrant, which is what they’re claiming,” Dugan said. “I’m not supposed to know that. When they come in front of me, I’m not supposed to know that.”

Dugan denied hiding Flores-Ruiz, who federal agents came into her courtroom to arrest.

“I did not hide this migrant in the jury room or in my chambers,” she said. ""I had him leave out the back door, which I do when the circumstances warrant it.”

Video from the hallway showed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney leaving through a side door about 12 feet (3.6 meters) from the main entrance.

According to an FBI affidavit, witnesses heard Dugan say something to the effect of “wait, come with me” before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, the affidavit alleges.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that her conduct amounted to directing people’s movement in and around her courtroom and that she enjoys legal immunity for official acts she performs as a judge.

Dugan told Milwaukee police that she directed federal agents ""down the hall to the administrative offices. What happened after that is their business.”

Agents arrested Flores-Ruiz outside the courthouse after a brief foot chase.

“We live in very difficult times,” Dugan told the officers. “We all know that. Very difficult.”

Dugan's defense attorneys released a statement noting that her comments to police came before she was aware of the criminal investigation.

“Her comments reinforced that she did nothing wrong in this matter and treated the misdemeanor case like any other in her courtroom,” her attorneys said in the statement.

Dugan could face up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Hannah_Dugan_AP_051525_crop,N,,2025-08-22 23:56:28.073221

He is now being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.

As of Friday afternoon officials with ICE had not explained to Muhammed Zahid Chaudhry's family why he was detained. ICE has not responded to KUOW’s requests for comment.

Chaudhry's wife Melissa said her husband had spent the past two decades trying to get U.S. citizenship. The last time she saw him was when she pushed his wheelchair into a windowless room for his appointment on Thursday.

“This is a microcosm,” she said. “This is a little, teeny, tiny individual situation that is a reflection of what is at stake for us as a nation.”

Melissa Chaudhry spoke to KUOW over the phone while she was nursing the couple's 8-month-old baby. She had words of encouragement for anyone who goes through a similar ordeal.

“I hope that you decide to do more than you ever thought possible, that you decide to do what you would do if the soul of your soul was taken from you with no warning and no mercy and no explanation,” she said.

The U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Service enacted new policies this week that increase the level of scrutiny people face as they try to navigate the citizenship and naturalization process. The new policies include increased scrutiny of anything officials deem “anti-American.”

Muhammed Chaudhry served in the military as a mental health specialist. His wife said after the Sept. 11 attacks, he was approached to work in intelligence for the military, and he refused. She said Chaudhry was told he would not be getting his citizenship anytime soon as a result.

“Intelligence work was to throw somebody under the bus, give them a name, and he said, ‘No.’ He said he didn't want the money, he didn't want the job. He was not going to ruin someone's life like that, an innocent person,” she said. “That violated his moral code, and he wouldn't do it.”

RELATED: Under Trump’s ICE, people without criminal history increasingly targeted in WA

Chaudhry continued to serve in the military until he was medically retired in 2005.

The Chaundrys and their family and friends suspect he has been put on a USCIS government list called the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program or CARRP.

The list reportedly targets people from Muslim-majority countries, people who speak other languages, and have advanced degrees, all based on frequently vague associations with people on a separate U.S. terrorism watchlist.

People who are targeted by CARRP face a delayed naturalization process under what’s called ""extreme vetting,” sometimes becoming undocumented and eligible for deportation.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled earlier this year that the federal government’s use of the program was “arbitrary and capricious,” and violated federal laws.

In its announcement this week, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service enacted new policies to increase scrutiny of people with legal status who support what officials consider anti-Semitic views, or who are supportive of terrorist organizations.

In her campaign to unseat Washington state Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat, Melissa Chaudhry was critical of what she considers the ethnic cleansing and genocide happening in the Gaza Strip, and what she characterized as Smith’s lack of action. Muhammed Chaudhry has also been vocal about his opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza as a member of a Washington Chapter of Veterans for Peace.

In their announcement this week, USCIS officials said they are also taking a closer look at instances of applications the federal government considers fraudulent, or misrepresented.

According to The Olympian, in 2013 ICE officials wanted Muhammed Chaudhry removed for misrepresenting two incidents to officials. In one incident, he was convicted in Australia of using an Australian’s passport to open a bank account and get medical benefits. An Australian man had given him that passport to keep until the Australian man could pay Muhammed back for an unpaid taxi fare.

The other incident alleges that Chaudhry misrepresented his citizenship when he applied to become a reserve officer for the Yakima Police Department.

Chaudhry told The Olympian in 2013 he doesn’t remember misrepresenting his citizenship to Yakima Police. He also said he wasn’t clear about the incident in Australia, to which he pleaded guilty. Other than these two instances, his wife said he has a clean record.

Despite attempts to remove him from the country, ICE records show Chaudhry was allowed to continue moving forward in his immigration case in 2018.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/c9fe29cd34bf4596d2f883f8a9f2e9e8.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-08-23 00:56:35.225616

On August 20, Border Patrol Agents initiated a vehicle stop based on their observations, but Valenzuela-Caldera failed to yield, taking several turns and driving through Nogales, Arizona. As he drove, Valenzuela-Caldera struck a civilian vehicle, and then attempted to push the vehicle out of the way by pressing the accelerator of his truck. He then reversed and drove away, ending up on a dead-end road. As agents followed him, Valenzuela-Caldera reversed into one of their Border Patrol vehicles, then got out of his truck and fled on foot.

But he said there may be circumstances when ICE comes on school campuses in the future.

“Day one, you’re not going to see us,” Lyons told NBC News in an interview on Thursday.

But he did not rule out the possibility of ICE needing to come on school campuses in the future in special circumstances. Lyons said ICE officers may need to make welfare checks on students in the district or anywhere in the U.S. if they were identified as an unaccompanied child when they crossed the southern border.

“We want to use our special agents and our officers to go ahead and locate these individuals. And if [there are] some we haven’t, and the last known address was at a school, we just want to make sure that child is safe,” Lyons said. “If we have the opportunity to reunite that parent with that child, that’s what we want to do.”

Lyons also said there could be an “exigent circumstance” that would require ICE to go onto a school campus.

“If it’s an exigent circumstance, something violent going on, yeah, we’ll respond to that,” Lyons said.

At a press conference this week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was asked to address fears by some parents that they could be detained by immigration officials.

“I think people who have that concern for themselves personally and for all of us who are concerned for them and their safety are making adjustments,"" Bowser said.

Recently, educators in California have raised concerns about ICE activity near schools. The Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent recently noted at a press conference that a 15-year-old boy was handcuffed by immigration authorities outside Arleta High School in Los Angeles.

A June analysis by a researcher at Stanford University showed that amid ICE activity last spring, there was a 22% increase in absences in California’s Central Valley, an agricultural area that’s home to many immigrant farmworkers. The increase was especially pronounced among the youngest students, according to the research.

In March, a group representing 78 large school districts across the country said the rescission of ICE’s sensitive location policy, which limited enforcement action around schools, was leading to an increase in absenteeism and anxiety among students.

In the NBC interview, Lyons also addressed reports that some U.S. citizens have recently been arrested by ICE agents. Some were arrested for allegedly assaulting ICE officers, while others have been arrested in cases of mistaken identity and later released.

“A lot of that stuff you are hearing about U.S. citizens being arrested, right? That is a training issue that we are working on. But people don’t have to worry about walking down the street and being asked for their papers or being asked for their passport,"" Lyons said. ""When ICE is going after an individual, it’s a targeted operation.""

He spoke to NBC News from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, which trains new recruits for 130 government agencies in Brunswick, Georgia.

ICE is under pressure to boost its workforce of deportation officers from 6,500 to 16,500 by the end of the year, after the agency received $75 billion from Congress to supercharge deportations of undocumented immigrants. ICE recently signed contracts to support a $40 million ICE officer recruitment campaign and is advertising $50,000 in signing bonuses.

Lyons said the agency has received over 121,000 applications and he believes they can hire 10,000 new agents by the end of the year. Vetting and training ICE agents previously took up to a year, including at a 13-week course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, according to former DHS officials.

To speed up the onboarding process, ICE is shortening that training to eight weeks by eliminating classes deemed repetitive and cutting back on Spanish classes. Firearms training and classroom instruction has also been shortened. Lyons said new recruits will now take classes six days a week instead of five days a week to condense their training into a shorter time period.

“We’re not going to sacrifice the level of commitment we have to the recruits or the level of education training that they get,” Lyons said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250822-ice-federal-agents-washington-dc-ew-419p-69a896.jpg",N,,2025-08-22 20:56:52.936931

AURORA — Congressman Jason Crow (CO-06) is leading Colorado’s Democratic congressional delegation, including Representatives Diana DeGette (CO-01), Joe Neguse (CO-02), and Brittany Pettersen (CO-07), in sending a new letter to the Trump administration seeking answers to questions related to the operations of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) federal detention facility in Aurora.

The new effort follows an oversight visit by Crow and other Members of Congress to the GEO-operated facility on August 11, where ICE and U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials were unable to answer many of the Members of Congress’ basic questions regarding the facility, including the number of individuals being held at the facility, how many detainees entered the facility in the week preceding the visit, and what percentage of detainees in the facility have a conviction for a violent crime.

In the letter, Crow, DeGette, Neguse, and Pettersen said: “In making our intent to visit known, we also requested that ICE personnel attend the visit in order to receive and respond to our questions in a fulsome manner. Despite the Department ‘vetting’ this request and sending multiple staff from ICE to this visit, they failed to have staff present who could answer the majority of the questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations (OCR). The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.”

The Members Continued: “Whether an oversight visit is announced or unannounced, ICE is seemingly more prepared to ensure the spaces we see are mopped - in our case by detainees themselves - than they are with answering members’ questions regarding the treatment of individuals held in detention. We expect your prompt and thorough reply no later than September 5, 2025.”

Since being elected to Congress, Crow has conducted critical oversight of federal facilities to ensure proper use of taxpayer dollars and promote transparency, including Veterans Affairs’ facilities, military bases, and immigration detention centers. Crow has regularly conducted oversight of the GEO ICE detention facility in Aurora. Since 2019, he’s successfully visited the facility 10 times, and his staff have visited over 70 times. Crow also publishes public reports on his website of oversight visits and conditions at the facility.

Crow recently sued(link is external) the Trump Administration after DHS unlawfully denied(link is external) him access for an unannounced visit to the same facility in July, violating a federal law. Members of Congress have the right to conduct unannounced or announced oversight visits of federal facilities. Crow and the Colorado Democratic delegation’s visit to the GEO ICE detention facility this month, in August, was an announced visit.

Congressman Crow introduced the Public Oversight of Detention Centers (POD) Act, which would codify existing protections for Members of Congress and designated staff to conduct critical oversight visits to oversee facility operations, including any concerns related to public health and the humane treatment of detained individuals. He also led the push for these existing protections through the FY2020 appropriations process, and though included in annual appropriations legislation, the POD Act would formally codify these protections into law.

A PDF of the letter can be found here, with full text appearing below:

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons:

On August 11, 2025, we conducted a congressional oversight visit of the Denver Contract Detention Facility located in Aurora, Colorado. Although the right of Members of Congress to conduct immediate, unannounced oversight visits of facilities operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is established in U.S. law, we provided advance notice of this visit.[1] Despite the advance notice of this visit, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel were unable to answer many of our questions, and we request answers to those and additional questions outlined in this letter no later than September 5, 2025.

In the Department’s denials to Members of Congress who have attempted unannounced oversight of immigration detention facilities in recent months, the Department has stated that advanced notice is required to “vet visit requests to ensure they are for legitimate purposes.” In making our intent to visit known, we also requested that ICE personnel attend the visit in order to receive and respond to our questions in a fulsome manner. Despite the Department “vetting” this request and sending multiple staff from ICE to this visit, they failed to answer many of our questions and repeatedly encouraged us to instead email ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations (OCR). The inevitable delays caused by routing our questions through OCR, rather than the ICE employee leading the oversight visit, prevent meaningful oversight from taking place in a timely manner.

We request that you address the following:

What are the top five countries of origin for individuals currently detained at the facility?

Please confirm the total population of detainees detained at the facility disaggregated by gender.

How many detainees entered the facility in the week preceding our visit?

How many detainees left the facility in the week preceding our visit? Of those, how many were deported and how many were released into the community?

Detainees in the facility are classified using a color-coded system that is, in part, based on an individual’s criminal record. Please confirm the number of detainees belonging to each classification at this facility, including high, medium/high, medium/low, and low.

Please describe the system the Department uses to award points and whether the classification system has changed in the last year.

Of the individuals detained at this facility, what percentage do not have a record that includes conviction(s) for a violent crime?

The air conditioning in at least one of the housing pods was not functioning for a period of time in July. How long was the air conditioning not in operation?

When was the decision made to move detainees out of the B2 housing pod as a result, and what other steps were taken to manage the temperature in the facility during that time?

What other housing pods were impacted by this outage?

Did ICE require that GEO staff track the temperature in the housing pods while the air conditioning was not functioning properly? If so, please provide that information.

We have received reports on several occasions of water outages in the facility, including in July and August of this year. On each occasion, how long was the water system not in operation and what was determined to be the cause of the outage?

What efforts were made to provide potable water to impacted detainees?

Was the water provided safe for drinking and personal hygiene?

We understand from GEO staff that counts are occurring in the facility four times per day and that the timing recently changed. During these counts, detainees are in lockdown and may lack access to legal assistance and other resources. Was ICE involved in the decision to change when these counts are conducted and does ICE track how long counts take?

How many counts are contract facilities required to conduct per day?

Has the number of counts completed at this facility increased in recent months? If so, for what reasons?

Why did the timing of these counts change?

Detention standards require that detainees in ICE facilities be able to make calls for free to a specific list of free legal service providers, but otherwise the cost per minute of each call varies by facility. What is the cost, per minute, of domestic and international calls made from this facility?

Is this rate determined by ICE, the GEO Group, or the phone company contracted to provide service at this facility?

Which phone company is contracted to provide service at this facility?

Are detainees provided notice in advance when their access to phones will be limited and under what circumstances is access to phones limited?

Upon entering the facility, detainees are provided with a detention handbook and view a video about their right to legal counsel. In recent months, local legal organizations have been prohibited from conducting regular legal orientation programs that they were previously permitted to hold in this facility. For what reason has ICE prevented the resumption of these programs?

Have previously approved local legal organizations been prohibited from conducting such legal orientation programs at other facilities elsewhere in the U.S.?

If so, please list the facilities and the previously approved local legal organizations.

Posted in multiple places in this facility is a sign reading, “Do You want to Return Home? . . . Requesting to return home now may give you the opportunity to legally enter the United States in the future.” These posters include a phone number to call or the option to speak with an ICE officer. If detainees choose to speak with an ICE officer at this facility, is there a script that the officer follows or a document that outlines the self-deportation process?

If the detainee calls that number, are they connected with an ICE officer?

If so, does the ICE officer on that phone line follow a script or document to explain the self-deportation process, including a potential 3 to 10-year bar from reentry, abandonment of pending adjustment of status applications, and the impact on future visa petitions?

What languages is this service available in?

We have received numerous reports from detainees that they are being pressured to self-deport, including repeat visits by ICE staff – some during the early morning or late-night hours. Are ICE employees directed to initiate conversations with detainees about self-deportation?

If so, please provide the ICE policy guidance that outlines when and how often these conversations are to occur and what information is to be provided to detainees.

An ICE employee confirmed reporting that the former Hudson Correctional Facility in Weld County, Colorado, is under contract with ICE for the purpose of immigration detention. Congressional staff submitted an inquiry to DHS OCR about the status of this facility over two weeks ago and have not received a response. Please confirm when this facility will begin operations.

Will the facility be operated by ICE or by a contract company?

If it is privately operated, which contract company will operate this facility?

What is the contracted capacity and what is the maximum detainee capacity at this facility?

What is the annual value of this contract, and what is the source of funds that will be used to fund this facility’s operations?

Are there any other facilities in Colorado that are under contract, or under consideration for contract, with ICE for the purpose of immigration detention?

Recent reporting by The Washington Post includes the potential use of both the former Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg, owned by CoreCivic, and the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio as additional potential immigration detention centers in Colorado.

Will these facilities be operated by ICE or by a contract company?

If they are privately operated, which contract company will operate each new facility?

What is the contracted capacity and what is the maximum detainee capacity at these facilities?

What is the annual value of such contracts, and what is the source of funds that will be used to fund such contracts?

Under the same reported expansion plans, the Denver Contract Detention Facility would see an expansion of beds from 1,360 to a maximum capacity of 1,530. Is this true, and if so, when would this expansion take effect?

How many total beds would these expansion plans bring to the state of Colorado?

In order for our offices to complete casework and help detained individuals communicate with a federal agency, they must sign ICE Form 60-001, commonly referred to as a privacy release form. In recent weeks, ICE officials have prevented Congressional staff from completing privacy release forms during regular oversight visits, stating that “requests for and completion of privacy waivers must be accomplished of the detainee’s own volitation [sic].” Information provided to our staff has been conflicting and has impeded our ability to complete congressional casework. Is it now ICE policy that congressional staff be prohibited from getting completed Form 60-001’s during the course of an oversight visit?

Is it ICE policy that, in order to complete this form prior to a visit from congressional staff, a detainee must either access the form during their time in the legal library and remit it to a congressional office, or have a congressional office mail them the form?

Does ICE policy permit congressional offices to schedule a visitation, or legal visitation, with a detainee in order for our offices to complete Form 60-001? If so, how many days’ notice is required for these visits? If not, why not?

In the absence of an in-person meeting with congressional staff or Members of Congress for the purpose of obtaining signed privacy waivers, who is expected to complete the witness signature section?

On average, how often are detainees being transferred between different facilities and for what purposes are those transfers conducted?

Are transfers conducted on a regular schedule?

If a detainee is going to be transferred, how much notice are they provided before being moved to a new facility?

When detainees are transferred from Aurora to another facility by bus, what is the average length of that journey? Under what length of journey are detainees provided with food, water, or access to a restroom?

Please confirm the current number of medical and mental health staff assigned to the facility, broken down by role (i.e. physician, licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, dentist, psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.)?

What is the average wait time for detainees to access medical and mental health care after submitting the request?

How many detainees have been taken by ambulance for emergency treatment over the past six months?

If a detainee has been prescribed medication prior to entering the facility, what steps are taken to ensure continuity of care?

If a detainee presents with a mental health condition upon entry, what services are required to be provided while they are detained at this facility?

How many detainees are currently in segregation/housed in the Restricted Housing Unit, for what stated reasons, and what is the average duration of their stay in segregation?

Please provide that data for the last six months.

What is the current number of ICE and contract staff at the facility assigned to legal visitation coordination, case management, and detainee intake/release?

In the written statement attributed to the ICE Assistant Director of Public Affairs Emily Covington sent to CBS News Colorado on Tuesday, August 12, two local constituents being held at the facility were publicly named. Is this a violation of The Privacy Act of 1974 and/or ICE policy?

Oversight of these federal institutions is a fundamental responsibility for each of us as members of Congress, and immigration detention facilities demand oversight and accountability to ensure that detainees are treated with dignity and respect. However, the administration is creating greater bureaucratic hurdles for our office when attempting to complete casework on behalf of individuals detained at these facilities. Detainees may have legitimate claims for protection and efforts to create lags in the time it takes for members, and our staff, to gain access to this facility or to mail privacy release forms back and forth between detainees and congressional offices, solely serves to delay this process until an individual has inevitably been transferred to another facility or been discouraged from seeking assistance they have every right to.

Whether an oversight visit is announced or unannounced, ICE is seemingly more prepared to ensure the spaces we see are mopped – in our case by detainees themselves – than they are with answering Members’ questions regarding the treatment of individuals held in detention. We expect your prompt and thorough reply no later than September 5, 2025.

According to Abrego Garcia's lawyers a private security firm will now transport him back to Maryland.
Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15, and upon his return to the U.S. on June 6, he was immediately detained on criminal charges.
Earlier this week, Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a motion before district Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the criminal smuggling charges against him, calling them vindictive and political.
There, Abrego Garcia met and married his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and is raising three kids with her.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to a notorious El Salvador prison and later returned to the U.S., was released today from criminal custody in Tennessee while he awaits trial on federal human smuggling charges.

One of his attorneys, Sean Hecker, said Abrego Garcia was now en route back to his family in Maryland, ""after being unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government's vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back against the Administration's continuing assault on the rule of law.""

Abrego Garcia's case raised basic questions about due process under president Trump's ongoing crackdown on immigrants in the country illegally after he was arrested and sent to El Salvador's CECOT prison in March of this year, violating a U.S. immigration judge's 2019 order that Abrego Garcia had a ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution there. The White House called that deportation an ""administrative error."" He was returned to the U.S. in June.

""He is grateful that his access to American courts has provided meaningful due process,"" attorney Hecker said in an email.

According to Abrego Garcia's lawyers a private security firm will now transport him back to Maryland.

Abrego Garcia's freedom could be short-lived. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could try to detain him upon his return to Maryland. But a federal judge last month said that, should he be released from detention, ICE is not allowed to immediately take him into custody. Instead he has to be transferred to the Baltimore ICE jurisdiction and his attorneys must be given 72 hours notice prior to his deportation.

Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15, and upon his return to the U.S. on June 6, he was immediately detained on criminal charges. He was in U.S. detention for over two months.

The government accused him of transporting migrants without legal status from Texas to other parts of the U.S. for years starting in 2016. He pleaded not guilty on June 13. He's also been accused of being a member of the MS-13 gang, allegations he denies.

Earlier this week, Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a motion before district Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the criminal smuggling charges against him, calling them vindictive and political.

Abrego Garcia was born in El Salvador but had been living in Maryland, after entering the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16. According to court documents, he was escaping gang death threats in his native country. He ended up living in Maryland, where his brother lives. There, Abrego Garcia met and married his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen, and is raising three kids with her.

He was deported in March back to his home country and immediately imprisoned there, despite a 2019 court order blocking his removal there. His attorneys say he had permission to work in the U.S.

Administration officials now argue that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he crossed into the U.S. illegally and an immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not back to his native El Salvador.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes of Tennessee, in a lengthy opinion in June, questioned the merits of the smuggling claims, saying the government's accusations of how many alleged smuggling trips he took ""approach physical impossibility.""

His lawyers in a court filing wrote that the smuggling charges amounted to ""the government's concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2048x1152+0+107/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2F25%2F923444c94beaaaaeff3aa1840bd6%2Fvan-hollen-garcia.jfif,N,,2025-08-22 18:56:58.015769

Community members confronted federal agents outside a home, as they attempted to make arrests.

Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora responded to the area and explained what happened.

""Because they were not able to effectuate a warrant, they chased the person to the house from a couple blocks over and there was a standoff in the street and behind their house,"" said Gusciora.

This all happened on Bayard Street in the Chambersburg neighborhood, a section of Trenton known for having a large migrant population.

There are likely more cases than the 16 included in the Center for Human Rights’ report, Godoy said.","The University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights is warning that federal immigration action has crossed a new boundary and is now breaking international humanitarian law.

The report zeroes in on 16 cases where people have been arrested by government agents and held for extended periods of time without access to a lawyer, or to the outside world. The legal term for such detentions is “enforced disappearance.”

“What I'm talking about is cases where days or even weeks go by that families still don't know where their loved one is,” said Center for Human Rights Director Angelina Godoy.

All of the cases covered in the center’s report have connections to Washington state. The people involved were either Washington residents, they were held at federal facilities in the state, or they were deported through Tacoma’s ICE immigrant lockup.

“The level of secrecy is what's different in these cases,” Godoy said.

The report highlights two families who were held in Customs and Border Patrol custody at different facilities in Washington state.

One family of asylum seekers from Africa was held for 24 days at the Ferndale Customs and Border Patrol office in Whatcom County. During their detention, family members were not allowed to make phone calls. Human rights advocates and concerned community members were refused information about the family’s presence at the facility, according to the report.

The other family was split up. While visiting family from Canada at Peace Arch Park on the U.S.-Canada border, a woman from Honduras and her U.S. citizen children were taken into Customs and Border Patrol custody in Ferndale. Meanwhile, her husband was arrested in Portland and held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. They were held for an estimated two weeks without the ability to contact lawyers and obtain legal help.

“The case raises obvious concerns about forced disappearance,” the report said. “The family did not appear in the ICE Locator, they appear to have been moved to avoid detection.”

RELATED: 10 Americans are freed from Venezuela in a prisoner swap for migrants in El Salvador

Most of what the report called forced disappearances are people deported to third countries, some to a prison in El Salvador in violation of a federal court order.

In addition to the two families, the report focuses on 14 cases where people were either sent to an immigrant lockup in Guantanamo Bay, the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo in El Salvador (the Terrorism Confinement Center) also known as CECOT, or to a third country.

In many cases immigrants were deported to situations that were unsafe, which is another human rights violation called ""refoulement.""

At least seven men either lived or passed through Washington state who were held in CECOT in El Salvador. They joined more than 200 other Venezuelan nationals who faced abuse and torture at the center, including allegedly being shot at with rubber bullets.

According to a report from Propublica, the Trump administration knew more than half of the over 200 Venezuelan deportees held in CECOT had no criminal record, and had only violated immigration laws. Venezuela and El Salvador would later hold a prison swap freeing the more than 200 men.

“Although their return to Venezuela is a positive development, it does not erase the responsibility of the U.S. government, GEO Group, King County, Signature Aviation, and Global X for their roles in transporting prisoners to a site where their disappearance and torture was a foreseeable outcome,” the report states.

There are likely more cases than the 16 included in the Center for Human Rights’ report, Godoy said.

She acknowledged that local and state governments cannot actively prevent the federal government from enforcing immigration laws.

But Godoy suggested that people who are concerned about the violations documented in the report should get creative about how to best protect people in their communities and how to respond to human rights abuses they witness or hear about.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/69791b28e67bcd4bf3e0a54bca0dcf68.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:45.108047

ICE agents can make arrests only in “extremely specific circumstances,” Chan said.","Federal agents arrested a protester outside the San Francisco immigration court on Wednesday and charged the protester with two federal misdemeanors: Destruction of property and assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer.

Bay Area attorneys say this is the first time they can remember Department of Homeland Security authorities filing such charges filed against a citizen in San Francisco. While protesters have been charged by federal agents in Los Angeles, moving the practice north is a sign of “escalation,” said Angela Chan, the city’s assistant chief public defender.

The protester, a U.S. citizen who asked to be identified by her first name, Angélica, was arrested around 10 a.m. yesterday during a chaotic street scene: Video showed ICE agents tackling several protesters to the ground after a crowd tried to stop ICE from transporting an asylum-seeker whom agents had arrested that morning.

Angélica, a trans woman from an immigrant family, was one of those filmed being zip-tied and led away, her head wrapped in a keffiyeh and held down by officers. Angélica was brought into the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters at 630 Sansome St. without a cellphone, her partner, Renee, said.

A day passed before her family heard from Angélica again.

Holding a citizen at an ICE building is “unheard of,” Chan said. Earlier this month, ICE agents detained two protesters in downtown San Francisco for the first time in recent memory.

Supporters spent the rest of Wednesday checking the inmate logs of every jail in the area, Renee said, trying to find Angélica. The gym Angélica works at in Oakland closed to let her co-workers join the search. One supporter reached out to Nancy Pelosi’s office.

Around midnight, Renee said, Angélica’s name finally appeared on a list of people held at Santa Rita jail in Alameda County. Angélica told family members that there was no access to a phone or an attorney in the holding cell.

Angélica said the sheriff’s deputies appeared confused: They did not seem to know what to do with someone brought over by federal agents.

At 7 a.m. on Thursday, Angélica’s name disappeared from the Santa Rita logs, Renee said. Two hours later, Angélica’s supporters learned that she was scheduled to appear at the federal courthouse at 450 Golden Gate Ave. at 10:30 a.m.

Unlike most defendants who are arrested on federal charges, Angélica was never in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, and was brought to Santa Rita instead by officers with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of ICE. ICE officers also took Angélica to federal court.

Angélica, a born and raised San Franciscan, was represented by federal public defender Samantha Jaffe, who declined to comment. U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim ordered Angélica be released until a pending court date in September.

ICE agents can make arrests only in “extremely specific circumstances,” Chan said. “They must witness a federal felony offense in front of them while engaging in immigration-related enforcement and have completed requisite training.”

Angélica has been ordered to stay away from the immigration courts at 100 Montgomery St. and 630 Sansome St. Federal prosecutors had requested an order to keep Angélica from all federal buildings and officers, Renee said, but Judge Kim noted that this would be impractical — Angélica has to attend her own hearings, after all, and federal agents aren’t always visible.

Her case has caused an outcry among labor, immigrant, queer and trans community groups.

“SEIU 1021 members were outraged to learn that Angélica, a U.S. citizen and the child of one of our own members, was violently arrested by ICE in San Francisco while exercising her First Amendment rights,” wrote Theresa Rutherford, the president of the service employees’ union.

Renee said that Angélica was “standing up for all the things the mayor says he supports, but has been silent on.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-0820-10.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:57:30.947286

The author contrasts Trump's record with previous Nobel Peace Prize winners, who were focused on human rights and humanitarian work.

Donald Trump wants the Nobel Peace Prize. I do not know why, unless it’s because former President Barack Obama has one and Trump’s apparent jealousy toward his predecessor has again reared its ugly head.

I would be surprised if the committee of Norwegians who select the Peace Prize honoree would choose Trump, who, by even the most favorable of characterizations, is a divisive bully. But if I have learned anything in our topsy-turvy political era, it is that anything is possible.

Meanwhile, Trump and his minions are shamelessly campaigning for the honor, typically announced in October. Trump even told Norway’s finance minister he wanted the prize in a discussion about tariffs, according to a Norwegian business daily.

The national media is having a field day speculating about Trump’s chances. As parlor games go, I guess there are worse ones.

But as for the reasons I think the event is unlikely … well, where to start?

Trump aid cuts have led to starvation deaths

The first thing to know is that Trump’s actions, which are controversial in the U.S., are judged even more harshly abroad.

One of the first major acts of his second term has been to kill the U.S. Agency for International Development, breaking commitments to more than 100 nations and cutting in midstream funding to humanitarian efforts that served millions of people. Nonprofits on the ground say the abrupt cuts to food aid in places such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria has directly caused children's death from malnourishment. We learned last month the U.S. State Department will incinerate 500 tons of food initially intended to feed starving people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Too many Americans either don’t know, don’t care or have already forgotten these unnecessary cruelties. However, the Peace Prize committee that, by definition, must consider international affairs, would very much know what happened.

Abusive immigration enforcement presents ugly U.S. image

Trump’s treatment of immigrants, too, can’t have gone unnoticed by people in other countries. After all, it has affected those nations’ expatriates living in the U.S. as well as their citizens who get into trouble with immigration enforcement while just vacationing. Several countries have issued travel advisories for the U.S., an uncommon move, and the U.S. is the only country where tourism declined from the same point last year.

Videos from some of the immigration arrests show a pattern of abuse, and Trump’s administration has gone far beyond its stated goal of only going after the worst criminals. We have seen teachers, veterans, students, business owners, landscapers, farm workers, police officers, medical workers and plenty of other regular folk arrested by masked men and often, taken off of their (tax-paying) jobs.

Many of the immigrants have lived here peacefully for years, even decades, and are pillars of their community. A number of those arrested are here legally, or held documentation that was just fine before Trump’s team changed the rules. Now we learn that the administration plans to plumb the backgrounds of all 55 million U.S. visa holders, looking for reasons to expel people from our country.

How might all this look to a foreign Peace Prize committee?

‘Peace’ in Ukraine and Gaza? Not at all.

Trump and his peons’ chief claim that Trump should win the prize is that he has negotiated six (or seven, depending on who is doing the spin that day) peace deals. This dubious claim has been challenged.

He most wants credit for are his alleged peacekeeping skills in the Israeli-Gaza conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war — thus he took part in separate meetings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accompanied by other European leaders, to attempt progress on the latter.

The meetings yielded no tangible results, which itself highlights why these two conflicts are not exactly strong parts of Trump’s peacekeeping resume: Neither is in any way resolved, and people are dying regularly in both. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is currently preparing plans to take over and occupy Gaza, where famine has been declared, while Putin continues drone strikes against Ukraine's civilian populace. In both situations, these Trump allies are taking advantage of Trump's agnosticism on how “peace” is achieved.

One of these is not like the others

A glance at the list of past Nobel Peace Prize laureates is made up of a bunch of people who don’t sound anything like Trump. Recent winners include Narges Mohammadi of Iran, who champions women's rights; Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, a fighter for human rights and democracy; Maria Ressa of the Philippines, an advocate for press freedom; and the World Food Programme, which, like the name sounds, provides food to the hungry.

Compare that to Trump, whose resume is like a mirror image reverse of the people just mentioned. His resume includes felony convictions in a case where he paid hush money to a porn star and an adjudicated sexual assault of another woman, who he also defamed. His use of the federal government to target people with whom he disagrees and his lies about the 2020 election are among examples of his clear and present danger to free speech and democracy. He considers the free press an enemy. His actions toward USAID and support for Congress' ""big beautiful bill, which cuts food benefits — that speaks to where he is on hunger.

I would wager that Trump and his cultists would dismiss nearly all laureates on the list as hopelessly “woke” — even as Trump seeks to join their number.

Does the world want more Trumpism?

If we are being honest, the only reason a committee would award the prize to Trump would be to encourage him or appease him in some way — perhaps under the belief it will lead to changes in a selfish man who by most accounts has changed little from back when he was a racially discriminatory landlord in New York City in the 1970s.

Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in the first year of his first term. At the time it was believed by many that it was Europe’s way to illustrate to the world the kind of thoughtful, broad-minded America the world wanted, a notion the Peace Prize committee strongly hinted at when it said Obama had spurred a “new climate” in international relations.

I can’t imagine the America Trump represents is what the rest of the world wants to see more of.

But again, anything’s possible.

How to address the DACA population will be among the more immediate decisions confronting state policymakers, given the August 25 effective date, absent injunctive relief in California v. Kennedy.
Strategic Considerations for the Plaintiffs Given the constraint imposed by Trump v. CASA, the plaintiffs in California v. Kennedy may consider one or more of the following strategies: Seek Class Certification.
Conclusion California v. Kennedy presents a significant test case not only for the legality of HHS’s Proposed Rule but also for the federal judiciary’s evolving role in administrative oversight after Trump v. CASA.
As the plaintiffs state, ”The result of the implementation of the Final Rule’s provisions is that millions of Americans will lose health coverage.","On July 17, 2025, the State of California joined by 20 states, including New York,1 as well as advocacy organizations,2 filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts against US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and other federal officials and agencies.3 The plaintiffs in the case, California v. Kennedy, are seeking injunctive relief (a court order requiring a party to either take or not take a specific action) to block the implementation of a finalized federal rule, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Marketplace Integrity and Affordability (hereafter referred to as the Rule. That Rule will otherwise go into effect August 25, 2025, nationwide and significantly alter key regulations implementing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Central to this litigation is the legality of the and what power and scope the courts have to limit federal agency rules Trump v. CASA.4

The Rule imposes a series of restrictions on coverage under the ACA that HHS estimates will result in up to 1.8 million enrollees losing coverage nationally in plan year 2026.5 Changes to coverage from the Rule are expected to most directly impact the roughly 226,000 New Yorkers who are enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the NY State of Health (NYSOH)—New York’s state-based ACA marketplace. Through NYSOH, New Yorkers can receive federal tax credits that help reduce their premium payments on a sliding scale up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).6 Certain changes are likely to impact New Yorkers who have health coverage through their employer as well. However, because New York is both a state that has expanded Medicaid coverage eligibility under the ACA and currently operates a Basic Health Plan option, known as the Essential Plan, individuals with incomes up to 250 percent FPL in New York should be less significantly impacted.

In addition to analysis from both the Rockefeller Institute7 and others regarding various federal health policy changes, as well as broader analysis8 about the Rule itself, we recently posted a separate summary of the Rule focused particularly on the impact for New York.9 This blog discusses the arguments raised in California v. Kennedy and how the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA may constrain the Massachusetts federal district court’s authority to issue nationwide injunctive relief.

Changes to coverage from the Rule are expected to most directly impact the roughly 226,000 New Yorkers who are enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the NY State of Health (NYSOH)—New York’s state-based ACA marketplace.

The ACA and HHS Rule

Enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) created sweeping reforms in the private health insurance market, including the creation of health insurance exchanges,10 advance premium tax credits, and protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.11 In addition to the ACA, subsequent companion federal regulations12 have filled in critical administrative details, governing everything from eligibility verification to enrollment timing and grace periods for lapsed coverage.

As noted above, the Rule at issue in California v. Kennedy is discussed in more detail in other analyses, including one by the Rockefeller Institute.13 In summary, the Rule includes both permanent and temporary effects and changes for impacted health plan enrollees.

Permanent Effects14 Temporary Effects15 (only for 2026 plan year) Fewer benefits Significant new paperwork verification requirements such as presenting original paperwork as proof of tax and citizenship instead of the current automated verification process More expensive coverage Newly allowing insurers to deny coverage for past-due premiums Shorter enrollment periods Adopting a $5 monthly premium payment for certain enrollees who are currently eligible for a $0 premium Limiting automatic re-enrollment for certain enrollees Requiring the Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to verify eligibility for new special enrollment period (SEP) enrollments Eliminating coverage for certain deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) individuals Prohibiting coverage of gender-affirming care

The Rule includes provisions that were struck from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) by the Senate parliamentarian before it was passed because the provisions did not comply with the rules for passing a budget reconciliation bill with a simple majority. 16 The Rule, therefore, essentially allows the Trump administration to accomplish a similar result through different means (regulation). Because rulemaking is generally easier to modify than statute, however, the Rule’s provisions could be modified by a future administration without consent from Congress.

Arguments by Plaintiff States and Defendant Federal Government

Arguments by Plaintiff States

California and its 20 co-plaintiffs, including New York, have raised multiple statutory and constitutional claims challenging the Rule. Chief among them are:

Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs contend that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious under provisions of the federal APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)), which establishes a standard for federal agencies to follow when creating rules and making decisions. Plaintiffs contend that HHS failed to adequately consider the interests of states and enrollees, did not provide sufficient evidentiary support for the need to change existing rules, and failed to account for adverse impacts on low-income populations. Plaintiffs have also argued that HHS did not provide sufficient time for public comment—only 23 days instead of the typical 30-day period.

Contravention of the ACA. Plaintiffs argue that the Rule contradicts express provisions of the ACA, including statutory definitions of “minimum essential coverage” and congressional intent to broaden—not restrict—access to health insurance.

Federalism and Tenth Amendment Concerns. Several plaintiff states further assert that the Rule unlawfully interferes with their state-administered Medicaid and Basic Health Programs by altering eligibility standards and coverage definitions in ways that exceed HHS’s statutory authority.17

In particular, plaintiffs have raised six grounds, or causes of action, in their request for relief to the federal District Court. In the first cause of action, plaintiffs contend that the 23-day comment period was inadequate under the Administrative Procedures Act, which they assert should have provided at least 30 days.

The second cause of action is the most detailed, alleging that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. In essence, plaintiffs contend that HHS failed to provide adequate reasons for numerous changes in the Rule, nor did they meaningfully respond to comments about those proposed changes as required under the APA. In particular, plaintiffs cite the following changes, noting the lack of sufficient rationale by HHS for each:

the $5 premium penalty on automatic re-enrollees with no premium under ACA tax credits;

the shortened annual open enrollment period during which individuals are able to sign up for coverage;

requirements for states using the Federal Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) to conduct certain eligibility verification for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP), which allows enrollment outside the annual open enrollment period for individuals with life-changing events such as loss of employment, divorce, birth of a child;

revocation of the guaranteed issuance of coverage for individuals with past-due premiums, allowing insurers to deny enrollment for failure to pay premiums in the past; and

revisions to the ranges for actuarial value (the overall value of benefit coverage afforded to an average population with that plan), which allow insurers to lower the value of the benefits provided.

In the third cause of action, plaintiffs argue that exclusion of coverage for gender affirming care as a benefit for the required minimum level of comprehensive coverage—known as the Essential Health Benefits (EHB)—is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.

In the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, plaintiffs contend that HHS acted in excess of the statutory authority granted by Congress, also in violation of the APA. The plaintiffs focus on two provisions in the Rule. First, plaintiffs argue that the $5 premium penalty on re-enrollees who have no premiums under the ACA violates the ACA, and that Congress gave HHS no authority to institute such a premium penalty. Further, plaintiffs note that, under the ACA, HHS must make certain that the scope of mandatory benefits (called “Essential Health Benefits” or EHB) is determined by a survey of employer-sponsored coverage, and HHS failed to do this when barring coverage of gender dysphoria treatment for EHB. Here, the plaintiffs cite case law noting that an executive agency “has no power to act… unless and until Congress confers power upon it”.

Arguments by HHS

In opposition, HHS has argued against any preliminary order by the court on the grounds that the plaintiff states are not likely to succeed at the end of the day. HHS contends that it gave enough notice under the APA, counting the time HHS posted the proposed Rule on the agency’s website days before the proposed Rule was officially published in the Federal Register. Similar to published comments on the Rule, HHS broadly justified the Rule as necessary to prevent fraud, reduce improper payments, and ensure program integrity18—a lens through which many of the recent health-related federal policy changes have been framed by Congress and the Trump administration. In this case, HHS has suggested the Rule is needed at least in substantial part to address a perceived improper enrollment problem. As to the exclusion of EHB coverage for gender-affirming care, HHS addressed its failure to conduct the ACA-required survey by contending that its original survey, when EHB standards were first adopted after the ACA was enacted, is enough, and further surveying should not be required for specific changes regarding particular benefits. In addition, HHS relies on the fact that many other states have selected EHB plans that do not include coverage of gender-affirming care. With regard to DACA coverage, HHS argues that the change is necessary given the immigration policies of Congress and the Trump administration.

The plaintiffs are requesting a preliminary and permanent injunction to halt the implementation of the Rule nationwide. This is where Trump v. CASA is important, as the application of injunctive relief may be limited following the Supreme Court’s decision in that case.

The Supreme Court’s Decision in Trump v. CASA

Decided in June 2025, the decision in Trump v. CASA reshapes the landscape of injunctive relief issued by federal district courts. In a 6–3 decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that federal district courts lack authority to issue universal (nationwide) injunctions absent a specific statutory grant or authorization to do so vis-à-vis a law enacted by a legislative body. In its decision, the Court emphasized that the customary ability of courts to order someone to do (or stop doing) something is generally applicable to parties to the lawsuit under Article III19 of the US Constitution. The Court further warned against federal courts overreaching in a way that effectively transforms individual cases into legislative vetoes, a power constitutionally granted to the president. The decision formally overturned a series of lower court precedents that had permitted nationwide injunctions in Administrative Procedures Act (APA) cases. The majority held that even where a rule is facially invalid, meaning it cannot be enforced constitutionally under any circumstances, under the APA, district courts must limit their orders to addressing the injuries of the parties before them. Writing for the dissent, Justice Sotomayor expressed concern for a “patchwork of legality” where some jurisdictions are bound by invalid regulations while others are not, undermining the uniform application of federal law.20

In light of Trump v. CASA, the Massachusetts district court will need to carefully tailor any injunctive relief it grants in California v. Kennedy. As a result, several implications follow:

No Nationwide Injunction. Even if the court agrees with the plaintiffs that the Proposed Rule is unlawful under the APA, Trump v. CASA precludes it from ordering HHS to stop the Rule’s application to nonparty states or entities. Any such court injunction is likely to extend only to the named plaintiffs—California, New York, and the other plaintiff states and organizations.

Geographic Fragmentation. The decision could lead to a scenario where the Proposed Rule is blocked in plaintiff states but enforced elsewhere, resulting in uneven access to ACA benefits and compliance burdens for insurers operating across state lines. This raises complex questions about the operational feasibility of the Rule, especially for national insurers and multistate exchanges. For example, the DACA change could cost New York approximately $80 million annually, should the state provide equivalent care to the DACA population, raising new questions to those already posed by the OBBBA for New York lawmakers regarding coverage for noncitizens. The DACA population is the subject of a related federal case, Kansas v. United States, brought by Republican states challenging a Biden-era rule related to DACA coverage. If the Rule is implemented, the Kansas v. United States case will be unnecessary. How to address the DACA population will be among the more immediate decisions confronting state policymakers, given the August 25 effective date, absent injunctive relief in California v. Kennedy.

Increased Role for Appellate Courts and Inter-Circuit Conflicts. Because no single district court can block the Rule nationwide, the case is likely to become part of a broader litigation mosaic. Other states may file parallel suits in other districts, and eventual resolution may come only through the appellate courts or the Supreme Court.

Enforcement and Administrative Discretion. Even within the plaintiff states, the scope of relief may be contested. For example, the district court may order HHS not to enforce the Rule only as it applies to state agencies or residents enrolled in certain programs. HHS may respond with guidance or “selective enforcement” policies designed to mitigate the disruption—though such moves could themselves become legally contentious. How the District Court will handle the administrative discretion will be instructive. In another relatively recent decision, Loper Bright v. Raimondo,21 the US Supreme Court overruled a longstanding legal doctrine under which federal courts afforded broad discretion to federal agencies. The Loper decision requires federal courts to use their independent judgment in deciding whether a federal agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency’s interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.

Strategic Considerations for the Plaintiffs

Given the constraint imposed by Trump v. CASA, the plaintiffs in California v. Kennedy may consider one or more of the following strategies:

Seek Class Certification. By certifying a nationwide class of affected individuals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, plaintiffs may attempt to achieve functionally broad relief while staying within the bounds of party-specific adjudication established by the decision in Trump v. CASA.

Rely on APA § 706(2) Arguments. Plaintiffs may argue that invalidating the Proposed Rule under the APA naturally compels vacatur—whereby the court vacates or sets aside a regulation, effectively removing or voiding its legal force—as a remedy that applies nationally. However, Trump v. CASA suggests that courts must distinguish between vacatur and injunction, potentially limiting even APA-based remedies to plaintiff-specific outcomes.

Coordinate Parallel Litigation. Blue states and advocacy groups not party to this case may file copycat suits in sympathetic jurisdictions, aiming to build a critical mass of adverse rulings that compel HHS to withdraw or revise the Rule.

Appellate Review. If relief is denied or limited, plaintiffs may seek review by the First Circuit and ultimately the Supreme Court, potentially testing the outer limits of Trump v. CASA in the context of nationwide programs like the ACA.

Conclusion

California v. Kennedy presents a significant test case not only for the legality of HHS’s Proposed Rule but also for the federal judiciary’s evolving role in administrative oversight after Trump v. CASA. While plaintiffs have some substantive arguments under the APA and ACA, the Supreme Court’s recent curtailment of nationwide injunctions will likely restrict the Massachusetts district court’s ability to provide sweeping national relief.

Interestingly, some states that are most impacted by the Rule are not party to the case and, therefore, are unlikely to benefit from potential injunctive relief. Nevertheless, New York and other plaintiff states have a greater likelihood of being awarded injunctive relief for the portions of the Rule most applicable to New York, should the district court decide in the plaintiffs’ favor. These components include: fewer benefits, shortened open enrollment periods, increased premiums and out-of-pocket costs for consumers, stricter documentation requirements, limits on DACA enrollment, and the coverage of gender-affirming care. These changes will result in loss of coverage, new costs to the state, and the potential for increased costs to purchase less coverage, among other things.

HHS’s decision to provide flexibility to the 13 state-based exchanges and New York’s unique coverage options, such as the Basic Health Plan, automatically creates a dichotomy in application between states. In addition, the limitations on judicial action outlined in the CASA ruling may result in the California v. Kennedy decision further exacerbating differences in a uniform application of marketplace rules, potentially undermining the intent of the ACA. Therefore, this case underscores the emerging tension between the need for uniform regulatory rules in national programs like the ACA and the judiciary’s increasingly fragmented capacity to adjudicate administrative disputes. Unless Congress amends the APA or the Supreme Court revisits its stance, the path forward for challengers to federal rules will require creative litigation strategies. The Rockefeller Institute of Government will continue to monitor key developments as this and other cases unfold with respect to their impacts on the healthcare of New Yorkers.

4 According to a University of Michigan, Michigan Law analysis, “In its June 27 decision in Trump v. CASA, the US Supreme Court limited the scope of federal courts to block presidential policies nationwide. The issue before the justices was whether federal courts in three cases could issue universal injunctions against President Trump’s Executive Order 14160 limiting birthright citizenship. The majority opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not address the merits of the birthright citizenship order.”

5 HHS estimates a reduction in marketplace coverage between 725 million (lower bound) to 1.8 billion (upper bound) individuals. HHS details the complexity in estimating the impact of the Rule here, but in short, they note that they believe a significant amount of the impact is concentrated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah, where they believe there were “improper enrollments.”

6 The federal poverty level (FPL) in 2025 is $15,650 for an individual and $32,150 for a family of four; 400 percent of the FPL is $62,600 for a single person and $128,600 for a family of four (https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dd73d4f00d8a819d10b2fdb70d254f7b/detailed-guidelines-2025.pdf).

9 The Rockefeller Institute of Government is closely monitoring activity at the federal level that could have implications for New York. In addition to enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), summarized in a recent blog post, the Trump administration has taken administrative actions that have additional impacts to New York, which have also been summarized in our recent policy brief.

10 Sixteen states, including New York, operate a state-based health insurance exchange. In New York, the health insurance exchange is called New York State of Health.

11 According to HHS, a preexisting condition is: “A health problem, like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, you had before the date that new health coverage starts. Insurance companies can’t refuse to cover treatment for your pre-existing condition or charge you more.”

12 There are many federal regulations implementing the ACA from multiple agencies. Some of the core regulations were promulgated by HHS in 45 CRF Parts 155 and 156 (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/06/04/2013-13149/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-establishment-of-exchanges-and-qualified-health-plans; https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-B/part-156?toc=1 ).

17 Complaint of Plaintiffs in California v.

As the plaintiffs state, ”The result of the implementation of the Final Rule’s provisions is that millions of Americans will lose health coverage. Those who maintain coverage will pay higher premiums for diminished coverage and will spend more on out-of-pocket costs to use that coverage (in the form of co-pays and deductibles). And when these newly uninsured individuals need healthcare—as everyone eventually will—the States will bear the cost. State and local governments will pay for the dramatic increase in uncompensated care costs for individuals who become uninsured as a result of the Final Rule. State Medicaid expenditures will balloon as people who lose their subsidized marketplace coverage will turn to publicly funded healthcare as a backstop. And States will lose tax revenue derived from insurance premiums no longer paid by those who have dropped or lost coverage as a result of these changes.” (Complaint, at paragraph 243, page 70-71).

Almost all of those additional immigrants were unauthorized immigrants who had arrived since 2021.","Between 2021 and 2023, the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States grew from an estimated 10.5 million to 14 million, according to a new Pew Research Center report. That is the largest two-year increase in more than 30 years of our estimates. The 14 million figure is also a new high, though preliminary data shows the population likely continued to grow and peaked in 2024.

In this Q&A, we speak with Senior Demographer Jeffrey S. Passel about how the Center estimates the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

How does Pew Research Center define ‘unauthorized immigrants’?

Unauthorized immigrants are those who are not members of any of the groups the U.S. has approved for legal immigration: legal permanent residents, refugees, people granted asylum and legal temporary migrants (e.g., foreign students).

The term “unauthorized immigrants” combines immigrants whose status is impermanent, precarious or both. For example, many unauthorized immigrants entered the country illegally. Others entered legally with a work or tourist visa but stayed longer than allowed. And others entered the U.S. legally with a temporary, precarious status.

Though the term isn’t perfect, it’s been used for decades by researchers to estimate the size of this population and is generally preferred over terms like “undocumented immigrant” or “illegal immigrant.”

Why is it important to know how many unauthorized immigrants are in the country?

Unauthorized immigrants make up about 4% of the U.S. population. It’s important to have a sense of their number, who they are and what their roles are in the economy when government policies affect them. Our estimates help provide insight into these factors, as well as how their population size has changed over time, where they’re from, where they live in the U.S. and how long they’ve been here.

One example of what we can learn from these estimates is that many U.S. families include both unauthorized immigrants and U.S. citizens. About 12 million people who are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants live in households with at least one unauthorized immigrant.

How do unauthorized immigrants enter the country?

As mentioned earlier, unauthorized immigrants enter the country in different ways. For many years, there were two main categories of unauthorized immigrants:

People who enter the U.S. illegally

People who enter the U.S. legally but overstay their visa or otherwise violate the terms of their admission

Historically, the majority of unauthorized immigrants entered the country illegally. The share who had overstayed visas grew in the 2010s.

In recent years, a third, but smaller, category of unauthorized immigrants has emerged as the federal government has created new programs:

People who enter the U.S. legally with temporary protection from deportation that the government can revoke if immigration policy shifts

This third group includes migrants from certain countries facing war, natural disasters or other crises, as well as individuals who are paroled or released at the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2023, about 2 million of the 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country had been admitted into the U.S. with precarious statuses.

Why is someone who was given permission to come to the United States or to live and work here considered an unauthorized immigrant?

In recent years, an increasing number of immigrants have had temporary statuses that protect them from deportation. They are grouped as unauthorized immigrants because their statuses can be revoked, sometimes quickly, by the president or Congress.

The Trump administration has revoked the protections of many unauthorized immigrants this year. More than 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were paroled into the U.S. between October 2022 and November 2024 had their temporary protection removed and work permits invalidated in 2025. The administration also allowed Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program protections to expire for 350,000 Venezuelans and 350,000 Haitians.

How many immigrants had these protections in 2023?

In 2023, more than 40% of unauthorized immigrants had some protection from deportation – about 6 million of our estimated 14 million total. This figure is up significantly from 500,000 (or 4% of the total) in 2007 and 2.7 million in 2021.

Protected groups include:

Asylum applicants (2.6 million in 2023)

Immigrants who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole (700,000)

Victims of crimes or violence (700,000)

Those with TPS (650,000)

Enrollees in Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children (600,000)

Migrants who the U.S. Border Patrol released into the U.S. (1.0 million)

How did you estimate the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States?

Conceptually, our method for estimating the size of this population is fairly straightforward.

Estimate the number of immigrants who are in the country legally.

Use data from a national survey or census to estimate the total number of immigrants (legal and unauthorized) living in the country.

Subtract the number of legal immigrants from the total.

Our methodology includes many more details and refinements, but the basic calculation comes from this simple relationship.

Data for the total immigrant population comes from national Census Bureau surveys that ask respondents where they were born. (They do not ask about immigration status.) These surveys have large samples and have been conducted for many years.

Annual data on the number of people admitted to the U.S. as legal permanent residents (also called LPRs or green card holders), refugees or people granted asylum is available mainly from the Department of Homeland Security. So counting this group is more straightforward than trying to count the number of unauthorized immigrants directly. We use the annual totals to estimate the current population of immigrants in the country legally, after accounting for deaths and departures.

In December 2024, the Census Bureau changed its U.S. population estimates, acknowledging much larger immigration flows than it had previously measured. Has this affected your estimates?

Yes. Since 2005, the American Community Survey (ACS) has provided the data we use to estimate the total number of immigrants living in the U.S. The population figures (or survey weights in the ACS) rely on another Census Bureau program that provides national and state-level population estimates each year.

Population estimates are released every December for the current year and all years since the most recent decennial census. Sometimes the bureau also changes the method for its estimates. It did that for its estimates released in December 2024, which covered 2021-24.

The new estimates changed how the bureau measured net international immigration in a major way. The updated national population estimates for 2023 included about 2 million more immigrants than the previous methodology had indicated. Almost all of those additional immigrants were unauthorized immigrants who had arrived since 2021.

Though the bureau updated its U.S. population estimates for 2022 and 2023, it did not retroactively adjust its surveys for those years or for the weights we use to estimate the number of immigrants. That means the data the bureau had previously released for those years is not consistent with its newer, better estimates.

For our new estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population, we reweighted the data for the 2022 and 2023 ACS so the estimates are comparable across years and align with the newer data on international migration. As a result, we revised our estimate of the unauthorized immigrant population for 2022 upward, from 11.0 million to 11.8 million.

Why are your most recent estimates from 2023? Isn’t there data for 2024 and 2025?

While there is some data for 2024 and 2025 that can shed light on trends in the unauthorized immigrant population, it’s less comprehensive and complete.

The ACS, our main data source, is not released until September and October of the year following the survey. As a result, the most recent ACS data we currently have is for 2023.

The Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS) is a more timely source, as it comes out monthly. But its scope is much more limited, and it samples only about 3% as many people as the ACS. That greatly limits its usefulness for estimating the size of the unauthorized immigrant population.

Nonetheless, CPS data and other federal sources can provide limited information about possible trends and changes in the total immigrant and unauthorized immigrant populations:

For 2024, administrative data on arrivals of immigrants and CPS data on trends in the total immigrant population point to continued growth in the unauthorized immigrant population through the early part of the year. In the last half of 2024, that growth likely slowed.

For 2025, monthly CPS data shows that the total immigrant population decreased by June, which implies that the unauthorized immigrant population did as well.

While we can’t definitively estimate the size of the unauthorized immigrant population from this data, the trends suggest that the unauthorized immigrant population was probably larger in mid-2025 than in 2023.

Can I calculate the number of unauthorized immigrants for 2024 and 2025 by adding the number of people that Border Patrol reported coming into the U.S. to your estimates?

No. It is correct that the people Border Patrol “releases” or “paroles” into the U.S. do count as unauthorized immigrants. However, adding these counts to our estimates will result in inaccurate totals because this does not account for other ways that the number of unauthorized immigrants can change.

Historically, the number of unauthorized immigrants has been very dynamic. The number can increase as more people enter the U.S. without authorization, overstay visas or are paroled into the country. It can also decrease as immigrants:

Leave the U.S., either voluntarily or through deportation

Die

Become an LPR or get asylum

From 2007 through 2019, the number of unauthorized immigrants decreased by more than 2 million as more people left than entered the unauthorized immigrant population. On the other hand, it increased by nearly 4 million from 2019 through 2023.

How do you ensure your estimates are accurate?

We’ve changed our methodology over the years as more and better data has become available. Both parts of our estimate – the number of legal immigrants and the number of total immigrants – are based on data from reliable sources.

We also adjust our estimates to account for immigrants, both legal and unauthorized, who are missed in the national surveys. We use Census Bureau studies of undercount to make these adjustments.

We also use other data sources to assess the accuracy of our estimates, including data on birth rates and death rates as well as surveys and censuses in other countries. For example, Mexico, which accounts for the largest number of unauthorized immigrants to the U.S., has its own census and surveys that give us a better idea of how many unauthorized immigrants from Mexico we might be missing. We can then apply what we learn to the broader unauthorized immigrant population.

Finally, the ACS can be compared with the CPS, a smaller but more timely Census Bureau survey, to check the comparability of our estimates.",https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/SR_25.08.22_immigration-q-and-a_featured.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-08-22 19:57:11.575307

“The fundamental provisions as to the protection of Caymanians and their society have always continued in the legislation.","Cayman Islands’ immigration and employment problems could be solved by enforcing existing laws rather than passing new ones, says a leading immigration lawyer.

Nick Joseph of Reside Cayman has worked in immigration law in Cayman for 15 years and said he was worried that “history was being rewritten” by government plans to bring back the Caymanian Protection Act.

Enforcing laws

“The law was never fundamentally changed. My perception is that we just stopped following it,” Joseph said.

“We didn’t get rid of the Caymanian Protection Law,” he added. “The fundamental provisions as to the protection of Caymanians and their society have always continued in the legislation. We just renamed the law…the real question is, why haven’t we been consistently applying the law?”

The coalition government’s plan to bring back the Caymanian Protection Act was outlined by Caymanian Employment and Immigration Minister Michael Myles at the 100 days in office celebration on 15 Aug.

“We’re going back to the Caymanian Protection Act,” Myles said. “The goal is that Caymanians have to be protected. Fifty years ago, we had a legislation that protected Caymanians. We’ve gotten rid of it because we turned immigration into a bank. It can’t be that. It has to still be a protection for people and a screening instrument to protect our way of life.”

But Joseph said that the problem was not a lack of legislation, but the failure to enforce it.

“What has happened is it appears that for the last 15 years is that we’ve acted as if the Caymanian Protection Law was no longer the law of the Cayman Islands – but it was, and for half a century, always has been,” he said.

“The damage that that has caused in the society is manifest: the abject reframing of our culture and the displacement of Caymanians from appropriate participation in aspects of our economy and even from geographic areas of our community has seemingly been allowed to happen in breach of our laws.”

He added, “The fundamental problem is not that we did away with … the Caymanian Protection Law; it’s because we stopped enforcing it.”

Joseph suggested that a problem might be the way government is structured.

“There’s a lot of very hard working, very competent civil servants, but if they’re working in silos, there needs to be more joined up thinking,” he said. “Everybody in the civil service knows that there’s a jigsaw puzzle that needs to be put together, but it can appear each one of them is working on their own piece, without regard to how it’s going to fit with the one next door.”

Joseph added, “Maybe this is where the laws need to be rewritten, and that the pyramids of control need to be more directly assigned to somebody. So, for example, you can’t have WORC in one silo and Customs and Border Control in a different silo, and Business Licensing in a different silo…because they all have to intersect and join up perfectly with one another and run like a single well-oiled machine.”

The issue of enforcement was raised by Minister Myles during the 100 days event when outlining plans for immigration reform.

“We need to do [immigration reform] in phases and then we need to make sure that people are comfortable with what that first phase is and then putting the enforcement in place,” he said.

“Because just understand, we are a country of laws. We don’t enforce many of them. We have to be able to enforce the laws. So part of the first phase is looking at how we enforce it.”

Myles said on a Facebook post on Thursday that he was proud to take “swift action” on immigration.

“Our current immigration, labour and pension laws and processes are not as protective or sustainable for Caymanians as they need to be and our NCFC coalition is committed to Caymanians first,” he wrote.

“That does not mean Caymanians only. We will not fix decades of ineffective immigration policy with one bill. NCFC is committed to a multi-faced approach and the approach will be balanced overall but to get to the right balance some changes will need to move significantly more towards protecting Caymanians.”

The hospitality industry in particular was singled out by Myles for needing to employ more Caymanians rather than recruiting from overseas and making sure that local workers were being offered the same salaries as expats.

Hermes Cuello, general manager of the Grand Cayman Marriott Resort, said, “The hiring of local talent and having Caymanians in the front lines has been always our objective in our industry and we have been highlighted as one of those model hotels in that aspect.”

He said the Marriott would continue to work on identifying local talent and that it had extensive internship programmes at the hotel and worked closely with the Department of Labour.

He added, “We know that to source every single employee in a hotel locally is extremely difficult, but we need to make more efforts to bring as many Caymanians as possible as well, and that’s our main objective.”

But in June, the Trump administration rolled back a policy that shielded SIJS recipients from being removed from the country.
Once that court order is received, applicants are eligible to file for the special status before they turn 21.
In fiscal year 2016, there were 142 petitions for the special status.
For now, Regina said she is holding out hope to one day receive her green card as she files for the special status.","In Regina’s bedroom, there’s a collection of shoes – about 26, she counted – lined up neatly beneath her bed. There’s a bookshelf tucked away in a corner filled with spines that read Jane Austen and Sylvia Plath, and there’s a whole lot of pink. As she likes to put it, it’s a “girly mess.”

Regina, 19, is one of hundreds of migrant youth in Connecticut who are applying for permanent legal residency through a special juvenile immigration program.

“They say a lot of the times when you aren't able to express yourself when you're little and have a lot of toys, you grow up to have a lot of toys, and that's definitely me,” Regina said.

Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) is a classification available under the federal immigration system for migrants under 21 who have been abused, neglected or abandoned by a parent. It gives many a chance to escape harrowing situations and live legally in the United States.

For Regina, expressing herself in her own space is healing after living a tumultuous childhood in her home country, Mexico, where she endured physical abuse and neglect from her mother.

Young migrants with SIJS have been afforded protection from deportation in the past while they wait for their green card. Regina hopes the status will give her more stability in the years ahead.

But in June, the Trump administration rolled back a policy that shielded SIJS recipients from being removed from the country. She and others could now face deportation, even after documenting the harm they were exposed to by parents.

“I think about all the horrible things these kids have been through,” Regina said. “All the challenges they had to go through, and trauma, to be here… to be at a safe place and then be slapped in the face for wanting to release their dreams. It's so beyond words.”

Growing up in Mexico

Regina’s memories of Mexico involve a lot of moving around. She was born there and lived mostly with her mother and younger brother while her father was living and working in New England.

Connecticut Public is identifying Regina by her first name for her and her family’s safety.

Growing up, Regina said her mother constantly neglected her. At one point, she said, her mother left her and her younger brother home alone for five consecutive days.

Connecticut Public reviewed reports submitted to the probate court by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF) that detailed some of the abuse, including the probate court study and a family case plan.

According to the reports, a DCF social worker determined Regina’s mother was “not an appropriate support or caretaker” because of abuse and neglect.

Regina’s mother “would allegedly beat Regina daily and due to bouts of depression would subject both [children] to lack of food and supervision,” the social worker wrote.

“She wasn’t ever at home. She never took care of us,” Regina said. “To me, it felt like it didn't matter whether we lived or died.”

Regina recalls moments where as a child, she’d climb up onto the kitchen counter with the help of her brother to reach the cereal and milk so they could eat.

“It was a lot of fending for yourself and going about it the way you know how to go about it,” she said.

Oftentimes, Regina said, family members or her mother’s friends would take care of her and her brother. Being home with her mother was also challenging.

“I don't remember my earliest memory with her,” Regina said, speaking about her mom. “I just remember getting yelled at and being hit.”

The DCF report details the alleged abuse through Regina’s testimony, stating that Regina’s mother would beat Regina daily by hitting her with objects, pinching her, clawing her arms, and bruising her.

“I kept thinking this to myself, I was like, next time she hits me, I'm moving with my dad. Next time she hits me, I'm calling my dad,” Regina said. “Every time she hit me, it'd be like, the next time she does it, I'm actually gonna tell her I want to leave. Every single time.”

Regina eventually came to live with her father in Connecticut when she was around 10.

The social worker who reviewed her case determined it isn’t possible to reunite Regina with her mother because of an absence of a parent-child relationship, and because Regina didn’t feel safe with her.

Regina said she and her father tried to find ways to get legal immigration status once she decided to stay in the US with him, but at every consultation with an immigration attorney, they were told they had no good options and turned away.

However, last year, she learned about SIJS from immigration attorney Erin O’Neil, who practices in East Hartford. Regina started the process, and recently reached an important milestone, receiving orders from a probate court judge that grant her father sole guardianship over Regina, and certify her case is eligible to move forward.

What is Special Immigrant Juvenile Status?

Congress created the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status classification in 1990. Those who receive it can become legal permanent residents.

Most people filing for SIJS are in the country without legal status. While a small number may have entered with a visa, the majority have crossed the border without inspection, according to O’Neil.

Before someone can apply, they must first obtain a state court order. In Connecticut, the court order comes after an investigation into the alleged abuse, which is typically conducted by DCF. A state probate judge then reviews the evidence, hears testimony and decides whether the findings support granting an order.

Once that court order is received, applicants are eligible to file for the special status before they turn 21. Officials from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) review the court order and ensure the SIJS classification isn’t primarily being sought to obtain an immigration benefit. If they approve, applicants are then eligible to apply for a green card.

However, most face a long wait. The green card application can't be filed until an immigrant visa is available, a condition that can delay the process by four years or more.

Because of the long wait times, the Biden administration in 2022 implemented a policy that protected SIJS recipients from deportation by automatically granting most deferred action and authorization to work.

But in June, USCIS rolled back the policy, announcing it would no longer automatically consider granting deferred action to new SIJS recipients. The protection remains in place for those who already have it, though federal officials can revoke it at their discretion, and it may expire before a visa becomes available.

Criticisms of the program

The policy change comes amid criticism from the Trump administration that migrants are exploiting the program.

Petitions for SIJS have surged since 2022, both nationwide and in Connecticut.

Nationally, petitions for SIJS went from around 22,000 in fiscal year 2017 to about 68,000 in fiscal year 2024, according to a USCIS report on the program.

Connecticut’s probate courts have seen a similar spike. In fiscal year 2016, there were 142 petitions for the special status. By fiscal year 2024, that number grew to 1,730.

The increase was particularly sharp in recent years. In fiscal year 2022, the period when the Biden-era policy was enacted, there were 783 petitions, and in the following fiscal year the number of petitions jumped to 1,423, according to data provided by the Office of the Probate Court Administrator.

Records show courts in Stamford, Danbury and New Haven recently saw the highest volume of special immigrant juvenile cases, receiving more than 200 petitions each in a single year.

Last month, federal immigration authorities released a report detailing alleged abuses of the program.

It highlighted the drastic increase in petitions and raised concerns about age and identity fraud and false claims of parental maltreatment. USCIS said it also identified 853 known or suspected gang members who filed for SIJS.

“This report exposes how the open border lobby and activist judges are exploiting loopholes in the name of aiding helpless children,” USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a written statement.

The report also pointed out that more than half of applicants are over the age of 18, implying that the program is not helping the children it’s meant to.

“Right now, this program is growing way farther than it should have been allowed to and allowing people to take advantage of this visa for purposes that are far from the cases of abused kids,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington D.C. think tank that advocates for less immigration.

“They're just using it to get a green card when they wouldn't otherwise qualify in any other way,” Vaughan said.

But O’Neil, Regina’s immigration lawyer, disagrees. She said SIJS cases are thoroughly vetted by an independent state court.

“It's not something that's forged,” O’Neil said. “It's not something that's made up.""

Maegan Faitsch, an attorney who works with SIJS applicants at Connecticut Legal Services, said she was discouraged by the report. She said most of her clients are unaware of the program before she meets them.

“I'm sure that there are people that have used the program in a way that it was not set out for, but I think that in my mind, that does not mean that the program should not exist,” Faitsch said. “It means that there should be qualified attorneys helping people access the program.”

David Marantz, an attorney of child protection, juvenile law and criminal practice in Stamford, acknowledges some of the issues described in the report. He said he believes the availability of special juvenile status encourages some migrants to enter the country, exposing them to potential safety risks on their journey to cross the border.

“You know, that's a double-edged sword,” Marantz said. “You feel for people, you want to help them, but it also sends out the word to encourage more of it.”

However, Marantz said most clients who seek his help with SIJS petitions have valid claims.

""They seem extremely legitimate,"" he said, ""and I don't think it's an abuse of the process that I've seen very often. And really, at this point, over the years, I've handled quite a few cases, and I really don't see that.""

What's next for SIJS?

A pending federal lawsuit challenges the Trump administration’s policy changes to SIJS.

Attorneys representing migrant children filed the suit in the Eastern District of New York, according to The Associated Press. The plaintiffs are asking a federal judge to restore these children’s deportation protections.

For now, Regina said she is holding out hope to one day receive her green card as she files for the special status. She hopes other migrant youth in Connecticut who have faced abuse and neglect will do the same.

“That's something that I want to pass on,” Regina said. “You can do things because you have gotten this far. You can do things even if you're doing them scared.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5559923/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7391x3880+0+523/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F85%2F6bd3617b47dda36455ce98277dc1%2F250725regina-mma2387.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:34.472662

The case was similar to one from April in which the Supreme Court allowed the administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, but the N.I.H.","In a fractured ruling, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled by a 5-to-4 vote that the Trump administration could for now cancel more than $780 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health that the government said had been intended to explore topics like diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, “gender ideology” and vaccine hesitancy.

But a different five-justice majority let stand for now a lower court’s ruling that the administration’s underlying policy directing the cuts was probably unlawful and should be put on hold.

Only Justice Amy Coney Barrett was in both majorities.

The court’s order is not the last word, and the case will proceed in lower courts. The upshot of the scrambled ruling, subject to ongoing litigation, appears to be that grants already canceled will not be immediately reinstated but that recipients may be able to sue in a specialized court. Further cancellations may be barred.

In a concurring opinion, Justice Barrett wrote that challenges to individual grant terminations had probably been filed in the wrong court. But she said the challenge to the policy guidance had been filed in the correct court.

Still, she added, “whether claims about the guidance in this case will succeed is another question” but the lower court judge’s ruling could remain in place for now.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — would have blocked the policy and also restored the funding. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh would have allowed the Trump policy and the cuts to be implemented.

The mixed result was a break from the administration’s recent winning streak at the Supreme Court.

After the N.I.H. sent out boilerplate notices terminating thousands of grants, research and advocacy groups, a union, individual researchers and 16 states sued, saying the moves were arbitrary and capricious.

The forbidden research topics, the challengers said, were ill-defined and the policy of canceling grants inconsistently applied. The practical impact, they added, was devastating.

“To take just one example,” lawyers for the states told the justices, “defendants’ terminations forced the University of Massachusetts’ medical school to lay off or furlough 209 employees and to cut the incoming fall 2025 graduate class by 86 percent, from 70 students to 10.”

Judge William G. Young of the Federal District Court of Massachusetts ruled for the challengers in July, saying that the administration had justified its actions with “sparse pseudo-reasoning and wholly unsupported statements.”

For example, Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said there was “not a shred of evidence” to support the administration’s position that D.E.I. studies are “often used in support of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics.”

A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, refused to pause Judge Young’s ruling while it considered the government’s appeal. Writing for the panel, Judge Julie Rikelman, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said it appeared that the terminations would set back lifesaving research by years, if not decades.

The case was similar to one from April in which the Supreme Court allowed the administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, but the N.I.H. case involves far more money. The April vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice Roberts dissenting along with the three-member liberal bloc.

Since then, the administration has prevailed in a large majority of its roughly 20 emergency applications arising from its blitz of executive orders, often with only liberal justices issuing public dissents.

In its emergency application in the N.I.H. case, the government said that the case was legally identical to the April case and that federal trial judges’ defiance of that ruling “has grown to epidemic proportions.”

The challengers said the two cases were different, partly because the earlier one concerned individual contracts rather than an overall policy. That was the issue that divided the justices.

In a page-long partial dissent, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the policy guidance and its consequences were legally inseparable and so the funding should be restored. Judge Young, the chief justice wrote, was not required to split the case into two parts.

The court’s three liberal members joined his opinion.

Justice Jackson added her own 16-page opinion writing only for herself. She drew on the comic strip “Calvin and Hobbes,” which features the game of Calvinball.

“This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Justice Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/00dc-scotus-NIH-wjtv/00dc-scotus-NIH-wjtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:49.924885

“It’s challenging if you have someone who is trying to block you from being able to get something done that I have legally every right to bring to the council,” Cervantes said.","About a month after a series of immigration sweeps took place in Los Angeles earlier this summer, a video posted to social media July 9 showed federal agents conducting an operation near a Home Depot between Madison Street and Indiana Avenue in Riverside.

In the video, masked U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations agents were seen detaining multiple individuals and placing them in the back of unmarked vehicles.

Riverside Councilmember Clarissa Cervantes, who is currently running for State Assembly, denounced the raid in a social media post later that day and announced plans to create a resolution requiring immigration agents to provide identification while conducting operations within the city.

“It really felt like that was a situation that was giving the kidnapping kind of essence,” Cervantes told The Riverside Record. “No one knew who these people were. They refused to say what agency they were with.”

Since then, Cervantes and her team have been working with local immigration rights groups to finalize the draft resolution, with plans to bring it to the city council early next month.

Natalia Saka, the Inland Empire’s regional policy advocate for the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), spoke in support of the proposed resolution at the August 5 meeting.

“By not placing this item on the agenda, the council misses a chance to strengthen public safety and trust,” Saka said. “When immigration agents don’t identify themselves, it undermines trust between residents and local police.”

In an email to The Record, CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas said that requiring clear identifications of agents “prevents vigilantes or those working outside the law from usurping the role of federal agents,” and would alleviate one of the community’s biggest concerns.

The current draft, Cervantes said, contains language reaffirming the city’s commitment to its immigrant community and provides statistics on the impacts of immigration enforcement operations on its residents before offering a variety of actions that the council could take, including condemning masked federal agents using with unmarked vehicles and requiring them to provide badge numbers and names.

Other city and state lawmakers across Southern California have taken a similar approach. State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez (D-Pasadena) announced in late June the “No Vigilantes Act,” a bill aimed at requiring agents to provide identification. Days after her announcement, the city of Huntington Park passed a similar resolution after local police arrested an individual impersonating a Border Patrol agent.

Cervantes said her resolution would also direct the city attorney’s office to document instances in which immigration agents might have violated a person’s civil rights while detaining them and asks the city council to consider creating a legal aid fund meant to support residents impacted by immigration operations.

Cervantes also said she planned to ask the city council, during closed session, to discuss joining other municipalities in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In July, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order as part of the suit that blocked immigration agents from conducting raids in several California counties, including Riverside, unless there was reasonable suspicion other than factors like ethnicity or presence in certain locations.

“Our hope is to really make it clear, again, where we are as a city and our values,” Cervantes said. “But also that, if people are concerned about who is showing up and arresting, that [the Riverside Police Department] will respond and they will do, to the best of their ability, to identify the agents.”

The department declined to comment on the potential resolution.

Cervantes said she previously attempted to get the draft resolution on a council agenda earlier this month, but received pushback from Councilmember Chuck Conder.

“It’s challenging if you have someone who is trying to block you from being able to get something done that I have legally every right to bring to the council,” Cervantes said.

Conder declined a request for comment.

Cervantes said she now plans to submit the final draft to Riverside’s Human Relations Commission by the end of the month with the hope that the commission will recommend it be placed on a city council agenda in September.",https://riversiderecord.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Photos-for-website-2-1-2.png,N,,2025-08-22 15:56:28.494697

Home Office to appeal against high court's Epping hotel ruling

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said.

Jarvis has said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex.

He told broadcasters:

This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government.

We’ve made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. And that’s why we’ll appeal this decision.

Here is a summary from today’s blog:

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said. Jarvis said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex.

On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas. Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”.

Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning, saying that the court ruling was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.

The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said. He accused the government of not “listening to the public or to the courts”.

Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”. Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City.

Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.

Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting tensions over the issue. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with more expected on Saturday.

Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds.

The Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats in two separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley Wood, Claygate, and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the Addlestone seat in yesterday’s byelections.

Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the party and will sit as an independent. In his resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish Conservatives had “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a “positive, proactive agenda for real change” had been rejected. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: “We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well.”

Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian. Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers.

GMB has urged the government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel after assuming control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told BBC Breakfast that recent developments show why public ownership or greater government control is needed. Separately, the mayor of South Yorkshire said the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a conclusion should not be rushed.

Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds, Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK politics”.

Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.

Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister.

Ministers have announced a clampdown on people who continue to claim child benefit payments even though they have moved abroad, in measures that could save the taxpayer £350m over five years. The government said 2,600 people who had left the UK but still claimed the benefit had already been removed from the welfare system.

Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair having worked closely together in the past.

A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration. Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained.

Civil servants in a government department are to strike in a dispute over office closures, recruitment and attendance policies. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike from 2 to 25 September.

Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels. Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year.

Closing asylum hotels must be 'orderly', says Cooper as government plans to appeal against Epping hotel court ruling

Closing asylum hotels must be “orderly” rather than through “piecemeal court decisions”, the home secretary has said as the government plans to appeal against a court ruling blocking the use of an Epping hotel.

The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to then further appeal against the temporary injunction.

On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas, reports the PA news agency.

Cooper said:

We agree with communities across the country that all asylum hotels need to close, including the Bell hotel, and we are working to do so as swiftly as possible as part of an orderly, planned and sustained programme that avoids simply creating problems for other areas or local councils as a result of piecemeal court decisions or a return to the kind of chaos which led to so many hotels being opened in the first place.

That is the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local councils.

Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”.

'Utterly horrifying': Lammy accuses Israeli government of causing 'man-made catastrophe' as famine declared in Gaza City

Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”, reports the PA news agency.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said on Friday that famine is occurring in Gaza City and could spread farther south. It comes after weeks of warnings by aid groups that restrictions on aid were leading to starvation among Palestinians.

In a statement on Friday afternoon, Lammy said:

The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable.

The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.

The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children.

The government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them.

It is the first time that the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East. The IPC report said that more than half a million people in Gaza face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes.

Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. He added:

The UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas.

We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans. This terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.

According to the PA news agency, Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, has hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning that asylum hotels must be closed “in a properly managed way”.

She said the row was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.

Whitbread warned that waiting until the end of parliament to close hotels was “too long”, adding:

Our community can’t afford to wait another four years.

She said the protests had already caused “a huge amount of disruption” and argued the hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was “untenable” and unsafe for both residents and the wider Epping community.

Anti-immigrant protesters face off with counter-demonstrators in Portsmouth

Dozens of immigration protesters have faced off with anti-racism demonstrators in Portsmouth.

According to the PA news agency Rita, a Portsmouth resident who joined the Stand Up to Racism counter-protest said:

I feel ashamed [at the protest] and I say this as a white British elderly lady who has been spat upon, verbally abused and had things thrown at me, just for being on this side of the road.

I am angry that my Christianity is being used as a weapon by the right and to be used in the name of fascism.

The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said.

According to the PA news agency, he said:

The Epping Bell hotel injunction has been a victory for local people, led by a Conservative council working hard for their community. This is the difference Conservatives in local government deliver.

In opposition, Labour worked hand-in-glove with activist lawyers to sabotage Conservative immigration plans. In government, nothing has changed.

It is completely wrong that the Labour government is taking legal action to keep open the Bell hotel. The Government isn’t listening to the public or to the courts.

Instead of trying to keep illegal immigrants in expensive hotels, the Conservatives would remove all illegal arrivals, put in place a real deterrent and ensure towns like Epping are never put in this position again.

A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration, reports the PA news agency.

Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained. She said:

I think we can be pretty confident that we will end up with a fragmented parliament where there is not a single party majority.

We will have a parliament of minorities – nothing new in that – but I think we will have a parliament of minorities that may find it more difficult to work across party lines. Partly because of the nature of relationships that have emerged over recent years, and we have seen an increasing polarisation among the parties.

Prof McEwen is a professor of public policy and governance at the University of Glasgow, director of the Centre for Public Policy, and senior fellow at the UK In A Changing Europe thinktank. She leads research on devolution and inter-institutional relations and provides advice to governments and public bodies.

According to the PA news agency, Prof McEwen advised that relationships across parties and between the UK and Scottish governments need to be prioritised in order for Holyrood to be able to successfully deliver on policies. She said:

Even if there was a majority government – there won’t be, but even if there was – the Scottish government cannot deliver things alone. It tends to set the framework and relies a lot on delivery partners, and a very big partner in that is local government.

There’s the relationship between the Scottish government and UK government. It’s an area I’ve done quite a lot of research on over the years, and the relationship particularly before the general election was dire.

That’s a problem, because it really matters … There are so many areas of policy that are still reserved, but they have an impact on the responsibilities of this parliament.

She added:

Managing that relationship has to be a priority for any administration in Scotland. That has been better since the last election since the change of government, but there are still challenges and still issues.

Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year.

The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister, with the increasing failure rate leading to education experts describing it as a “crisis” that was damaging students’ mental health and future prospects. The government is expected to revise the policy as part of its national curriculum review anticipated to be published later this year.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said:

It is important that if a young person leaves school not having achieved a grade 4 in English and maths, they continue to study it, so that they can achieve that qualification.

Having a GCSE in English and maths transforms life chances of young people, including their health and employment prospects … if you think about what’s happened since 2014 when that policy was introduced by the Conservatives, every year 30,000 more young people over the age of 16 are getting that qualification.

Gibb’s defence of the policy comes as the front pages of both the Times and Telegraph today drew attention to the likelihood of the policy being scrapped.

Catherine Sezen, director of education policy for the Association of Colleges, said:

We must also reflect on the experience of over 130,000 students who did not reach that [grade 4] benchmark. Across the country, educators are working hard to improve outcomes, yet many are left asking what more can be done.

After a decade of the condition of funding policy, it is time to rethink how we support young people to build essential English and maths skills.

Government gives baby food firms 18 months to improve quality of products in England

David Batty

Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor.

The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers.

It also requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims that make baby foods seem healthier than they are.

This will cover products with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk.

It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food that failed to meet the needs of infants.

A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, published in April, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.

The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said:

They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food.

The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often “bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”.

Prof Simon Kenny, NHS England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said:

These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life.

Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.”

Fears grow over impact of ONS data reliability on Rachel Reeves’s budget

Anna Isaac

Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian.

Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers.

Such is the concern that insiders at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believe it may have to again highlight “significant uncertainty” in its forecasts because of poor official data, as it did publicly in March. Economists have also warned that the problems risk the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”.

The OBR forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the headroom the chancellor has against her self-imposed fiscal rules, and form the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government needs to help fund public services.

The ONS, which produces figures on a range of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling with mounting problems as it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases.

Its labour force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns.

The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One said:

We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the jobs market.

They added that while other datasets might offer indications of the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role of the LFS.

Security minister vows Labour will meet manifesto commitment to 'end asylum hotels' but closures need to be done in 'managed way'

Dan Jarvis has vowed the Labour government will meet its 2024 manifesto commitment to “end asylum hotels”.

Asked whether he was “worried about any copycat protests” after the high court’s decision this week, the security minister told broadcasters:

We’ve made a very clear commitment that we’re going to close all of the asylum hotels. That was a manifesto commitment that we stood on and we will honour.

We’re clearing up the legacy that we inherited from the previous government but the closures of these hotels need to be done in an ordered and managed way.

David Lammy among 21 foreign ministers to condemn plan for illegal West Bank settlement

Kiran Stacey

David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure.

The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.

Officials then summoned Tzipi Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public rebuke for the Israeli ambassador. The actions marked a further intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and the West Bank.

The statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said:

The decision by the Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.

In a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a statement.

It did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for comment.

There has been some reaction to the news that MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see 9.13am BST). Balfour is the second MSP to leave the party in recent months, after Jamie Greene quit the Tories in April and joined the Liberal Democrats.

According to the PA news agency, Greene said of Balfour’s resignation:

I was clear back in April when I quit the Tories that it was a most unhappy of ships and others would follow my exit. Whilst Jeremy and I disagreed on specific issues over the years, I respect people who hold views which are clearly borne from life experiences and beliefs, as mine are.

One wonders how many more former colleagues will come to their senses and quit.

SNP MSP George Adam said:

The Scottish Conservatives under Russell Findlay’s disastrous leadership have completely fallen apart.

It is welcome to see Jeremy Balfour come to his senses on the reality of the Tories in Scotland, as they become increasingly extreme to pander to the politics of Nigel Farage.

With yet another MSP ditching the party, it’s clear the Tories are in freefall in Scotland as we approach the 2026 election. The only question remaining is who’ll be next to desert the sinking ship?

Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said:

When even a social conservative like Jeremy Balfour is saying you are too reactionary, it is time to reconsider your politics.

Government to cover pay and pensions at collapsed South Yorkshire steelworks

Jasper Jolly

Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company.

Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds.

The judge approved an application by the government’s official receiver, a representative tasked with winding up insolvent companies, to appoint special managers from the advisory company Teneo. A Teneo senior managing director was present in court on Thursday, and made contact with Liberty Steel executives immediately after the hearing.

Concerned union leaders representing SSUK’s 1,450 workers met the special managers last night, seeking assurances particularly on pay and pensions, as well as when operations could restart at sites including Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, after a year without work.

Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the biggest steelworking union, said that he had “received firm assurances” on pay and pensions.

The court heard on Thursday that SSUK had only £650,000 left in its bank account, with the August payroll of £3.6m due on Friday. Gupta’s counsel had argued that he was ready to cover the payments via another company, Liberty Capital UK, although the judge, Mr Justice Mellor, said Gupta’s assurances that he could pay “are at best questionable”.

The special managers have committed that workers will receive their August pay packets before the bank holiday weekend. They also said that they will fill in unpaid employer pension contributions for the past year. That will remove a major source of concern for workers, who had feared losing national insurance protections next month if the company were to close.

It remains unclear when the plants will restart production, although a person briefed on the talks said that the special managers had given positive signals that it could happen soon. Restarting production and trying to generate cash after four years in which it lost £340m will be crucial to limiting the costs of the administration, which will be borne temporarily by the government.

Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels, reports the PA news agency.

Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year.

The east of Scotland has experienced greater water scarcity than the rest of the country, with average reservoir levels down 1% to 57% this week – 24% below the average of 81% for this time of year.

Scottish Water said demand has increased by 100m litres per day.

The supplier has asked the public to take small precautions to save water when possible, such as using watering cans instead of garden hoses, taking shorter showers, and turning off the tap when brushing teeth. Washing machines and dishwashers should only be used when fully loaded, and buckets and sponges should be used to wash cars rather than a hose, it added.

Scots use an average of 178 litres of water per day, Scottish Water said, which is higher than in England and Wales where people use an average of 137 litres per person per day, reports the PA news agency.

John Griffen, Scottish Water’s water operations general manager, said:

We’re working hard to maintain normal supplies for all customers and would ask that they use water efficiently to protect this precious resource. We believe that a large part of the additional water use at the moment is in gardens so we would ask that customers are mindful of how much water they use there.

Any rainfall we have had in parts of the country recently has not been prolonged enough to help our resources recover from the long spells of dry weather we have had recently and earlier this year. With no significant rain forecast for the next week or more, it’s important that everyone helps.

Scottish Water is now considering the possibility of bringing in water from alternative sources at its Backwater and Loch of Lintrathen reservoirs, which serve the Dundee and Tayside areas.

In the West Linton area of the Scottish Borders, Baddinsgill and West Water reservoirs – which serve much of West Lothian – are at 50% and 40%, and Scottish Water is balancing the flows between both sources. The company is also using tankers to supplement normal water supplies in some parts of the country.

Commenting on the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks, the general secretary of Community union said the “government’s intervention must mark a turning point to deliver certainty” for the businesses.

Roy Rickhuss said in a statement that “jobs must be protected” and wages should be paid as well as outstanding pensions contributions being secured. He added:

We welcome the government’s intervention which is yet another demonstration of our Labour government’s commitment to delivering for steelworkers and our vital foundation industry.

However, in taking control of the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account.

(AP) — At an obstacle course in the humid Georgia heat, an instructor shows recruits how to pull a wounded partner out of danger. In a classroom with desks cluttered with thick legal books about immigration law, recruits learn about how the Fourth Amendment governs their work. And on a firing range littered with shell casings, new recruits for Immigration and Customs Enforcement practice shooting their handguns.

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump’s mass deportation goal. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They’re hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they’re hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour’s drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don’t know what might be coming at them.

“We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,” said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,” he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.”

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone’s house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can’t — and don’t — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2230972796-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 16:56:54.299130

The Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell T. Vought, has apportioned only $2.9 billion of $6 billion appropriated by Congress for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in the 2025 fiscal year spending bill, according to budget documents and members of the program’s staff.

PEPFAR, as the program is known, was created in 2003, during the George W. Bush administration, to provide funding for H.I.V. prevention and treatment to low-income countries. It has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support and is often cited as the most effective public health campaign ever, credited with saving an estimated 26 million lives.

In July, the Trump administration withdrew a proposed $400 million rescission from PEPFAR’s budget in the face of bipartisan Senate opposition. But that fight was a distraction, according to staff members who work on the program, because, they said, they have repeatedly been told by Mr. Vought’s budget office that the program would be receiving only about half of the $6 billion appropriated by Congress for the 2025 fiscal year, even with that $400 million restored.

That cut is visible in budget documents that appear on a federal website tracking the activity of the White House Office of Management and Budget. The Trump administration took that website offline in January, but it was restored late last week after a court order.

Whether the executive branch can withhold money appropriated by Congress has been a focus of a number of legal battles since the President Trump took office vowing to slash government spending and terminate many foreign aid programs.

The decision not to release the PEPFAR funds is in keeping with Mr. Vought’s stated belief that the executive branch can use the budget office forcibly to shrink the size of government. He has so far faced limited resistance from Congress although some members have accused him of impoundment.

The Impoundment Control Act restricts how a president can withhold funds appropriated by Congress. It was passed in 1974 to give Congress greater control over the budget in response to the impoundment practices of President Richard M. Nixon.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Vought’s office said that further financial allocations were awaiting a planning document and that those funds could be disbursed through 2029.

PEPFAR funds are normally appropriated by Congress in five-year cycles but allocated to the program each year. At this point in previous years, PEPFAR’s funding had been allocated in full, according to veteran staff members at the program, to allow for planning for disbursement of those resources.

The amount the O.M.B. has released for the 2025 fiscal year roughly aligns with the budget proposal the Trump administration sent to Congress in May for 2026 — $2.9 billion — offering a possible clue to Mr. Vought’s view on how much money the program should have.

William Hoagland, an expert on federal budgets with the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, said the failure to apportion the 2025 funds appeared to be a deliberate slow-walk. The effect was preventing PEPFAR from using the money and creating a justification for a much bigger rescission, said Mr. Hoagland, who was once a top aide to the former Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee.

A footnote on the O.M.B. document outlines a multistep process in which the PEPFAR leadership would need to submit a spending plan for this fiscal year (of which less than six weeks remain), the O.M.B. would revise that plan, and there would be further back-and-forth consultation. It requests that the submission include “a detailed description of how such spending plan aligns with Administration priorities.”

If Congress does not intervene, the funds will have been effectively cut, as the period for their use has passed, Mr. Hoagland said.

“Then Vought has achieved the goal that he wanted, which was to reduce funding for PEPFAR,” he said.

The withholding of PEPFAR funds is eroding H.I.V. programs that have relied on the program’s support to operate. While many have had to close completely since the Trump administration began to curtail foreign aid with an Inauguration Day executive order, others were continuing to operate on a reduced budget.

Lifesaving H.I.V. programs were covered by a waiver that allowed them to resume operations.

But now some are being told to pare back their budgets, on a scale that mirrors the amount of money being withheld.

Dr. Pasquine Ogunsanya, the director of a large H.I.V. program in Uganda, said that this month her organization had received money only for salaries and limited administrative costs, and that there was no budget for services such as delivering medications to bedridden patients or admitting critically ill individuals to the clinic.

She said she had been told this week that her program’s budget would shrink by a further 40 percent. “I’m just thinking how can we do that, I’m having sleepless nights,” she said. “How can we have five people providing lifesaving H.I.V. services to 10,000 clients?”

The administration has criticized global health programs as frequently bloated and wasteful, and argued that the countries that received the aid should do more to help their citizens. It has also urged other organizations and high-income countries to do more.

As part of the administration’s effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, it has terminated H.I.V. care for gay and transgender people. H.I.V. prevention programs for high-risk groups — such as sex workers and injecting drug users — have been cut and only pregnant and breastfeeding women can now receive U.S.-funded prevention drugs or condoms.

“O.M.B. is blocking funding for PEPFAR,” said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “Congress rejected O.M.B.’s proposed $400 million rescission in PEPFAR funding, yet none of these funds have been obligated to program. PEPFAR funds are simply not reaching those in need, as confirmed by those in the field.”

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, called the failure to appropriate the PEPFAR funds a de facto funding cut. “Even after promising Republican lawmakers that the program would be protected, Russ Vought has choked off a huge chunk of funding provided by Congress for PEPFAR,” she said. “And he’s managed to hide this cut from lawmakers and the public until now because he took down a key spending transparency website.”

Internal documents from the State Department show that the person approving these documents is Amarallyis Fox Kennedy, identified as the “Program Associate Director for Intelligence and International Affairs Programs.” Ms. Fox Kennedy is the daughter-in-law of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and was reported to have helped broker his endorsement of President Trump. She did not respond to requests for comment on her role in supervising the PEPFAR budget.

Staff members in the new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy at the State Department, which now oversees PEPFAR, described verbal directives from the O.M.B. in which they were told that the maximum amount that they would be given would be $2.9 billion, and that they should make plans with implementing partners accordingly. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

Another footnote on the O.M.B. document says that the funds apportioned are for PEPFAR but also “Global Health security, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Polio eradication and prevention.”

PEPFAR funding appropriated from Congress is earmarked strictly for H.I.V. programs; other global health activities have a separate funding stream.

The chokehold on funding comes at the same time that senior staff members are drafting a plan, at the direction of the State Department, to shut PEPFAR down, cutting some countries off in as little as two years and shuttering the whole program within eight.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/xx-pepfar-funding-01-flkw/xx-pepfar-funding-01-flkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 16:56:37.295240

For him and others from impoverished countries across Central Asia who seek better lives in Russia, such hostility is woven into everyday life. Sometimes it bursts into outright violence.

“Mostly you notice it when you go to the hospital, a clinic, a government office: You stand in line and everyone shoots you dirty looks,” said the man, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions.

Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, over 20% of Russian businesses said they were hindered by a lack of workers, according to the Central Bank.

But rather than welcoming laborers, Russian officials are fomenting anti-migrant sentiment and increasing restrictions on immigrants, which the government says number 6.1 million, but is probably higher. The government is tracking their movement, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children’s rights to education.

A massacre and a backlash

The continued crackdown comes as a trial began this month for four Tajik nationals who are accused of the shooting and arson attack at a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 149 people. The four were arrested within hours of the attack and appeared in court with signs of being severely beaten. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility but Russia sought to blame Ukraine for the bloodshed.

Anti-migrant rhetoric had been growing in Russia since the early 2020s. But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years. In the eight days after the killings, she received 700 reports of injuries to immigrants, including “faces smashed against the doors of police stations,” she said.

Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin captured the public mood after the massacre, saying “migration control is extremely important” to ensure foreign nationals carrying out “illegal activity” could be deported without a court order.

The violence drew concern from human rights groups.

“Central Asian migrants seeking work in Russia due to dire economic conditions in their countries of origin today face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and other harassment by police in Russia,” Human Rights Watch said in a report on the anniversary of the attack.

“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.

Raids, roundups and restrictions

While some violence has subsided, it hasn’t disappeared. In April, police raided a Kyrgyz-run bathhouse in Moscow with video showing masked men forcing half-naked bathers to crawl across the floor and deliberately stepping on them before covering the lens of a security camera.

Police also reportedly rounded up immigrants in raids on warehouses, construction sites and mosques, then coerced them into joining the military to fight in Ukraine. Some are threatened with having their residency documents withheld, while others are recently naturalized citizens who failed to register for military service. In such cases, serving in the military is presented as the only alternative to prison or deportation. For others, a fast track to Russian citizenship is offered as an incentive for enlisting.

Speaking in St. Petersburg in May, Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, said “20,000 ‘young’ citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan (and) Kyrgyzstan” were serving in Ukraine.

Those immigrants who have avoided violence still are subject to new anti-migrant laws. Much of this is targeted specifically toward workers from Central Asia.

In 2024, 13 Russian regions banned immigrants from certain jobs, including in hospitality, catering and finance, and even as taxi drivers. A pilot program starting in September in the Moscow region requires migrants who enter Russia without a visa to be tracked via an app. Those failing to comply are added to a police watchlist, impeding access to services like banking, and subjecting them to a possible cutoff of cellphone and internet connectivity.

A nationwide law banned children of immigrants from attending school unless they could prove they could speak Russian. Less than six weeks after the law came into force, officials told local media that only 19% of children who applied for the language test were able to take it, and the most common reason for rejection was incomplete or inaccurate documents.

Another man from Uzbekistan who has worked in Russia for almost two decades and lives in St. Petersburg said he’s had to wait in line for over seven hours to get needed residency documents. The man, who also spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, hopes to stay in Russia but says the climate has worsened.

“It’s hard to get paperwork,” he said. “There just isn’t the time.”

The oppressive laws sometimes force immigrants to resort to paying bribes. Chupik, the lawyer, believes that Russia’s system results in “violations that cannot be avoided.”

“This is exactly what this mass regulation is striving for: not for all migrants to be here legally, but for everyone to be illegal,” she said. “That way, they can extract bribes from anyone at any moment and deport anyone who resists.”

Encouraging anti-migrant sentiment

Anti-migrant sentiment is unlikely to diminish anytime soon, mostly because it’s encouraged by authorities like the Investigative Committee’s Bastrykin, who said immigrants “physically occupy our territory, not just with their ideology but with specific buildings” — referring to sites such as mosques.

Ultra-nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said foreign workers “behave aggressively, causing conflicts and potentially dangerous situations.”

Migrants are an easy scapegoat for many social ills, and not just in Russia, said Caress Schenk, an associate professor of political science at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan.

“Closing borders, conducting migrant raids and tightening policies are all tools that are easy go-tos for politicians the world over,” she said. “It goes in cycles that are sensitive to geopolitical pressures, as we’re seeing now, but also things like election campaigns and domestic political rivalries.”

A surge of “anti-migrant propaganda” has dwarfed previous rhetoric of recent years, according to the Moscow-based Uzbek immigrant who was ignored by the bank teller.

“If every person paying attention to the TV, the radio, the internet is only told that migrants are ‘bad, bad, bad,’ if they only show bad places and bad people, of course, that’s what people are going to think,” he said.

Such anti-migrant rhetoric has become part of the nationalist narrative from President Vladimir Putin and others used to justify the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — that Russia is under constant threat.

“Russia has started lumping together all of ‘the external enemies’ that it’s created over the years for itself: the migrants, the Ukrainians, the West,” said Tajik journalist Sher Khashimov, who focuses on migration, identity and social issues. “It all becomes this part of this single narrative of Russia being this castle under siege, and Putin being the only person who is on the lookout for ordinary Russians.”

Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the bond, which has resulted in a delay in Guevara’s release.

“We ask the court to reject this egregious suppression of protected press activity and order Mr. Guevara’s immediate release,” Kim added.","A Spanish-language reporter who was detained earlier this year has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging he’s being held in custody in violation of the Constitution.

Mario Guevara, 47, was arrested by police near Atlanta on June 14 while filming a “No Kings” protest — which sprung up in opposition to President Trump’s immigration agenda and summer military parade in Washington.

Guevara has a large following and frequently covers issues tied to immigration in the Peach State as the founder of MG News.

A judge in DeKalb County, Ga., dismissed his charges of unlawful assembly, obstruction of police and being a pedestrian on or along the roadway on June 25, but Guevara remains in federal custody.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Guevara is in the country illegally, while his lawyers say he is authorized to work and remain in the U.S. Over the past two months, he’s been shuffled through three detention centers despite attempts to pay a bond set by the immigration judge.

Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the bond, which has resulted in a delay in Guevara’s release.

Local, regional and national press organizations have objected to his prolonged stay in custody by sending a letter to DHS last week urging Secretary Kristi Noem to release him on bond without delay.

“Every day Mario Guevara remains in federal custody is another day the government sends a chilling message that our freedoms are no longer guaranteed but merely conditional in the United States,” said Nora Benavidez, Free Press’s senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights.

“His children now been without their father for two months; each of those days is time they cannot get back with him,” Benavidez continued. “If people like Mario Guevara are cast as dangerous, that says more about the kind of nation we are becoming than it does about who Mr. Guevara is.”

The ACLU of Georgia has also weighed in.

“His detention on this basis is unlawful and sends a chilling message to other journalists, particularly non-citizen journalists, that they will also face retaliation if they report on public officials,” said Scarlet Kim, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, in a statement.

“We ask the court to reject this egregious suppression of protected press activity and order Mr. Guevara’s immediate release,” Kim added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP25233508963064-e1755879754360.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-22 17:56:40.727831

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 269 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 15 through 21.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Hector Garcia and Victor Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, were arrested in Dilley on Aug. 16, when they were allegedly caught transporting five illegal aliens who were locked in metal compartments affixed to a pickup truck. A criminal complaint alleges that U.S. Border Patrol agents witnessed the pickup truck travel down roads and on routes utilized by human smugglers to avoid Border Patrol checkpoints. The truck driver’s driving behavior further raised the agents’ suspicion, and, as a result, agents conducted a traffic stop. The complaint alleges that Garcia was riding as a passenger in the vehicle and had an expired work visa. Rodriguez was allegedly the driver of the truck and told the agents that the keys to compartments affixed to the sides of the truck bed were at “the yard,” though, during a pat down search, agents found him to be in possession what appeared to be toolbox keys. Using those keys, the agents were able to unlock the compartments and allegedly discovered five individuals—all confirmed to be Mexican nationals illegally present in the U.S.—hidden inside. If convicted of alien smuggling as alleged in the complaint, Garcia faces up to 10 years in federal prison, while Rodriguez faces up to five.

Mexican national Santiago Esquivel Gonzalez was arrested and charged with one count of being an illegal alien in possession of firearm. A criminal complaint alleges he attempted to sell five firearms at a location in San Antonio on Aug. 19. Immigration records revealed Esquivel Gonzalez was in the U.S. illegally. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.

In El Paso, U.S. citizen Alberto Dovali-Gamboa was arrested after USBP agents allegedly observed multiple individuals breach the border fence and enter his vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that Dovali-Gamboa disregarded an attempted investigatory traffic stop and ultimately was stopped after Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers deployed a tire deflation device. When his vehicle finally stopped, Dovali-Gamboa was placed under arrest by USBP and eight passengers—all determined to be illegal aliens—were allegedly observed laying down in the rear of his vehicle.

Joshua Magdaleno, also a U.S. citizen, was arrested on Aug. 17 after he was allegedly identified as the driver of a vehicle transporting four illegal aliens from Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia. A DPS trooper had allegedly observed the four aliens breach the border fence and enter Magdaleno’s vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that Magdaleno failed to yield to emergency lights and sirens, and that DPS had to perform a pit maneuver to immobilize the vehicle. According to the complaint, Magdaleno stated he had been recruited to pick up illegal aliens on the border through a post on Instagram.

A Mexican national was arrested during a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspection on a Union Pacific train. Mexican railroad security officers allegedly notified CBP officers that they had seen a person on one of the rail cars. A criminal complaint alleges that during the inspection, the CBP officers removed Francisco Alfredo Palacios-Guerrero from a grain hopper. Further investigation revealed that Palacios-Guerrero was previously removed from the U.S. four times, and had been convicted three times for illegal re-entry, three times for possession of narcotics, twice for battery, twice for presenting false identification, and once for an escape from jail.

A Honduran national was arrested near Maverick on Tuesday and charged with illegal re-entry. Marlon Gerardo Zavala-Garcia had been previously removed from the U.S. twice, the most recent being in January. He was convicted in Hondo on Nov. 12, 2024, for smuggling of persons and sentenced to 130 days confinement.

In Austin, a Salvadoran national was taken into federal custody after he had been arrested and booked in the Williamson County Jail. Rene Adalberto Jacinto-Rodriguez was convicted in 2009 for assault causing bodily injury of a family member and in 2010 for the aggravated felony of indecency with a child by sexual contact.

Jose Marvin Lopez-Sanchez, a Honduran national, was also taken into federal custody and charged with illegal re-entry in Austin. Lopez-Sanchez was previously removed in May 2024 after being convicted of assault causing bodily injury and criminal trespass. He was also convicted in 2023 for assault causing bodily injury of a family member and interfering with emergency request for assistance.

Mexican national Vicente Rodriguez-Santos was transferred into federal custody from the Travis County Jail where he had been booked for his third DWI arrest. Rodriguez-Santos was previously removed from the U.S. in 2018. In addition to the prior DWI convictions, he was convicted in August 2016 for criminal trespass, in October 2016 for theft property, and in 2017 for possession of a controlled substance.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

The Scene recently obtained what appears to be one page taken from an internal Tennessee National Guard document that details the orders.
Kealy Moriarty would not specifically verify the authenticity of the document, but did not dispute its details.
“As ICE rapidly grows, we’re coordinating with DHS and our federal partners including DOD and the Tennessee National Guard to support transportation and logistics at our facilities across Tennessee,” an ICE spokesperson said.
“This mission is closely monitored by media and actors determined to cast our forces in a bad light,” the document reads.","Nashville is expected to see an uptick in ICE activity starting in September, with assistance from National Guard troops who will be deployed in administrative “support roles.”

The Tennessee Lookout first reported on the mobilization of the National Guard. The Scene recently obtained what appears to be one page taken from an internal Tennessee National Guard document that details the orders.

The document is dated July 30, 2025, and marked “CUI,” or “controlled unclassified information."" It states that the 1-181st Field Artillery Regiment (FAR), based out of Chattanooga, will deploy to Nashville's Department of Homeland Security facility on Brick Church Park Drive beginning in September. FAR is set to assist with “case management, logistical support, and clerical support of the in-processing and out-processing of illegal aliens in Nashville, TN to allow ICE to dedicate trained agents to core law enforcement activities, enhancing overall effectiveness.""

The “projected tour of duty” is Sept. 1 to Dec. 15, “with a possible extension"" through the end of the year. Soldiers will be activated under “Title 32 active duty status (Mobilization Authority TBD) and will NOT be in State Active Duty.”

Soldiers who live within 50 miles of the DHS facility will be prioritized for the mission, which according to the document will “perform strictly non-law enforcement duties within ICE facilities.” They will be “specifically prohibited from direct contact with individuals in ICE custody or involvement in any aspect of the custody chain.”

When contacted for comment by email, the Tennessee Military Department's joint public affairs director Capt. Kealy Moriarty would not specifically verify the authenticity of the document, but did not dispute its details. Moriarty noted that soldiers’ work in assisting ICE at “processing facilities within the state” will consist of “data entry, case management, and logistical support.”

“The Tennessee National Guard regularly works alongside local, state, and federal agencies in support roles throughout the year, and this assistance reflects our commitment to interagency partnerships,” Moriarty told the Scene on Aug 12.

Moriarty also declined to say how many troops will take part in the mission or if — regardless of their administrative duties — they will be armed. “Planning is currently underway, and we will continue to coordinate with our state and federal agencies to determine how best we can support this request,” she said.

At an Aug. 13 press conference, the Scene asked Gov. Bill Lee what Tennesseans should expect to see with immigration enforcement in the streets of Nashville and other cities. He provided little insight.

“Obviously, the operations of ICE are federal operations so we don't plan those, so I can't speak to what will happen over the next year as it relates to those operations from ICE, other than the fact that we will be a willing partner,” Lee said. “We want to work with them to make sure that we remove criminals from our streets.”

ICE declined to provide any details on what its operations in Nashville will look like throughout the remainder of 2025, including how many agents will take part in the operation.

“As ICE rapidly grows, we’re coordinating with DHS and our federal partners including DOD and the Tennessee National Guard to support transportation and logistics at our facilities across Tennessee,” an ICE spokesperson said. “This unified approach ensures we’re fully equipped to carry out our expanding mission.”

ICE is set to see unprecedented growth following the increase of its annual budget from $8.7 billion to $27.7 billion with the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

“What the people in Nashville will see is obviously more individuals and more agents, but they'll also see more training and equipment,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem during a July press conference in Nashville. “We'll see more investigative tools that will be able to be utilized. My hope is that we also get the chance to work with the Department of Justice to get more immigration judges.”

While specific enforcement details are unclear, the National Guard document highlights ongoing public outcry over immigration enforcement actions throughout the state.

“This mission is closely monitored by media and actors determined to cast our forces in a bad light,” the document reads. “We will ALWAYS maintain understanding of what optics our actions present and will always maintain military bearing.”

This mobilization comes as Lee is deploying more than 160 soldiers to Washington, D.C., a move made by several Republican governors in support of Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. and the city’s alleged “crime emergency.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nashvillescene.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/48/2480e438-d6bc-4162-bf62-63687e2ee011/684c9f5d6786c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-22 15:56:36.431087

Tom Morello, guitarist for Rage Against the Machine and a longtime activist, has released a striking 65-track playlist titled “F ICE,” aimed squarely at the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the enforcement actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The collection is a potent mix of protest, rock, and hip-hop tracks, chosen to highlight resistance, civil rights, and social justice through music.

The playlist spans decades and genres, featuring Rage Against the Machine classics alongside songs by Bruce Springsteen, Public Enemy, The White Stripes, Pearl Jam, and Rise Against. Among the standout tracks are Rage’s “Killing in the Name,” a furious call to challenge authority; Public Enemy’s politically charged anthem “Fight the Power”; Springsteen’s reflective protest ballad “The Ghost of Tom Joad”; and The White Stripes’ raw garage-rock track “Icky Thump,” which Morello has said resonates with defiance against oppressive systems. Morello also includes his own solo track, “Pretend You Remember Me,” reflecting personal engagement with political issues.

Morello, known as much for his activism as his guitar work, has a long history of blending music with political messaging. In June 2025, he joined thousands in downtown Los Angeles for the “Defend LA” protest, organized in response to recent ICE raids in the city. Images from the event capture him holding a “Defend LA” sign and wearing a t-shirt that reads “Destroy American Fascism.” The playlist continues this activism, providing a musical backdrop for resistance and urging listeners to confront political issues through song.

In discussing the playlist, Morello described it as “a rocking little soundtrack to enjoy while you drive those bastards out of your neighborhood.” He hopes the compilation will inspire fans not only to listen but to act, demonstrating that music can be a powerful tool for social change. While the songs cover a wide musical spectrum, they are united by a central theme: challenging injustice and advocating for human rights.

Beyond the playlist, Morello’s career has been defined by fusing music and activism. From the politically charged lyrics of Rage Against the Machine to his solo projects and collaborations with socially conscious artists, he has consistently used his platform to address inequality, systemic oppression, and authoritarianism. “F ICE” continues that trajectory, translating decades of political engagement into a curated musical statement against policies he views as harmful.

Listeners encountering the playlist will find it not only a celebration of protest music but also a historical lens, connecting contemporary activism with movements from the past. Tracks like Pearl Jam’s “Do the Evolution” and Rise Against’s “Prayer of the Refugee” reinforce themes of systemic injustice, while Springsteen and The White Stripes provide emotional and sonic contrast, showing how rock and folk traditions have long contributed to social discourse.

Ultimately, Morello’s “F ICE” playlist is more than just a collection of songs. It’s a call to awareness, a demonstration of the power of music to mobilize and educate, and a continuation of a career-long commitment to political engagement. For Morello, music is inseparable from activism, and this playlist exemplifies how a carefully curated set of songs can make both a cultural and political statement.

By drawing attention to both classic protest anthems and contemporary critiques, Morello underscores the enduring relevance of music in shaping public dialogue and inspiring collective action. “F ICE” serves as a reminder that art and activism can intersect powerfully, giving audiences the opportunity to reflect, resist, and rally.

In March, two months into Trump’s term, Panama’s immigration service registered a mere 194 arrivals from Colombia via the Darien Gap – compared with 36,841 arrivals in March of the previous year.
That said, the Darien Gap has also served as a venue for the display of incredible solidarity in the face of structural dehumanisation.
The Darien Gap, too, has functioned as a de facto warzone in its own right where punitive US policy plays out on vulnerable human bodies in the interests of maintaining systemic inequality.
In that sense, then, the Darien Gap is the world.","In January, just before Donald Trump resumed command of the United States on a bevy of sociopathic promises, incoming US border czar Tom Homan announced that the new administration would be “shutting down the Darien Gap” in the interests of “national security”.

The Darien Gap, of course, is the notorious 106km (66-mile) stretch of roadless territory and treacherous jungle that straddles Panama and Colombia at the crossroads of the Americas. For the past several years, it has served as one of the only available pathways to potential refuge for hundreds of thousands of global have-nots who are essentially criminalised by virtue of their poverty and denied the opportunity to engage in “legal” migration to the US.

In 2023 alone, about 520,000 people crossed the Darien Gap, which left them with thousands of kilometres still to go to the border of the US – the very country responsible for wreaking much of the international political and economic havoc that forces folks to flee their homes in the first place.

In a testament to the inherent deadliness of borders – not to mention of existence in general for the impoverished of the world – countless refuge seekers have ended up unburied corpses in the jungle, denied dignity in death as in life. Lethal obstacles abound, ranging from fierce river currents to steep ravines to attacks by armed assailants to the sheer physical exhaustion that attends days or weeks of trekking through hostile terrain without adequate food or water.

And while literally “shutting down” the Darien Gap is about as feasible as shutting down the Mediterranean Sea or the Sahara Desert, the jungle has become drastically less trafficked in the aftermath of the Trump administration’s machinations to shut down the US border itself, essentially scrapping the whole right to asylum in violation of both international and domestic law.

In March, two months into Trump’s term, Panama’s immigration service registered a mere 194 arrivals from Colombia via the Darien Gap – compared with 36,841 arrivals in March of the previous year. This is no doubt music to the xenophobic ears of the US establishment, whose members delight in eternally bleating about the “immigration crisis”.

However, it does not remotely constitute any sort of solution to the real crisis – which is that, thanks in large part to decades of pernicious US foreign policy, life is simply unliveable in a whole lot of places. And “shutting down” the Darien Gap won’t deter desperate people with nothing to lose from pursuing other perilous paths in the direction of perceived physical and economic safety.

Nor can the enduring psychological impact of the Darien trajectory on the survivors of its horrors be understated. While conducting research for my book The Darien Gap: A Reporter’s Journey through the Deadly Crossroads of the Americas, published this month by Rutgers University Press, I found it next to impossible to speak with anyone who had made the journey without receiving a rundown of all of the bodies they had encountered en route.

In Panama in February 2023, for example, I spoke with a young Venezuelan woman named Guailis, who had spent 10 days crossing the jungle in the rain with her husband and two-year-old son. Among the numerous corpses they stumbled upon was an elderly man curled up under a tree “like he was cold”. Guailis said she had also made the acquaintance of a bereaved Haitian woman whose six-month-old baby had just drowned right before her eyes.

Guailis’s husband, Jesus, meanwhile, had experienced a more intimate interaction with a lifeless body when, tumbling down a formidable hill, he had grabbed onto what he thought was a tree root but turned out to be a human hand protruding from the mud. Recounting the incident to me, Jesus reasoned: “That hand saved my life.”

I heard about bloated corpses floating in the river, about a dead woman sprawled in a tent with her two dead newborn twins and about another dead woman with two dead children and a man who had hanged himself nearby – presumably the children’s father.

A Venezuelan woman named Yurbis, part of an extended family of 10 that I spent a good deal of time with in Mexico in late 2023, offered the following calculation regarding the prevalence of bodies in the jungle: “I can say that we have all stepped on dead people.”

For pretty much every step of the way, then, refuge seekers transiting the Darien Gap were reminded of the disconcerting proximity of death – and the negligible value assigned to their own lives in a US-led world order.

Add to that the surge in rapes and other forms of sexual violence with The New York Times reporting in April 2024 that the “sexual assault of migrants” on the Panamanian side of the jungle had risen to a “level rarely seen outside war” – and it becomes painfully clear that the individual and collective trauma signified by the Darien Gap is not something that will be summarily resolved by its ostensible “shutting-down”.

That said, the Darien Gap has also served as a venue for the display of incredible solidarity in the face of structural dehumanisation. I met a young Colombian man who had personally saved an infant from being swept away in a river. I was also told of a Venezuelan man who had carried an ailing one-year-old Ecuadorean girl through the jungle when her mother, too weak to move at a rapid pace, feared she wouldn’t make it out in time to seek medical help.

When I myself staged an incursion into the Darien Gap in January 2024, two refuge seekers from Yemen complimented me on my Palestine football shirt and did their best to assuage my apparently visible terror at entering the jungle: “If you need anything, we are here.” This from folks who had for more than two decades been on the receiving end of quite literal terror, courtesy of my own country, as successive US administrations went about waging covert war on Yemen.

The Darien Gap, too, has functioned as a de facto warzone in its own right where punitive US policy plays out on vulnerable human bodies in the interests of maintaining systemic inequality. Widely referred to in Spanish as “el infierno verde”, or The Green Hell, the gap has certainly lived up to its nickname.

And while the heyday of the Darien Gap may be at least temporarily over, the territory remains an enduring symbol of one of the defining crises of the modern era in which the global poor must risk their lives to live and are criminalised for doing so. In that sense, then, the Darien Gap is the world.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP23131483025075-1726155360.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:27.785412

""Last month in July, a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini.
""The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""
These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.
South Sudan: war-torn and unsafe Conflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.","US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration is a cornerstone of his domestic policy, forming part of his controversial campaign pledge to carry out ""the largest deportation operation in American history.""

Deporting those migrants to African countries, however, was not part of the original plan he announced when he ran for the presidency last year.

But the US Department of Homeland Security said in June that third-country deportations — i.e. sending undocumented migrants from the US to countries other than their own — were necessary to expel people ""so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back.""

Uganda has now become the latest country in East Africa to accept a deal with Washington, pledging to take in a yet to-be-specified number of migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States.

Alex Vines, the head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, a renowned think-tank in London, highlights that this agreement builds on schemes between the US with other African nations adopted earlier in the year.

""Last month in July, a small number of individuals were sent to South Sudan and Eswatini. These were less then ten in total, but it shows the direction of travel"", Vines told DW. ""The Uganda deal is a lot more ambitious.""

""The Ugandans themselves have said they would not accept people with criminal records or minors and preferred Africans as the ones they would accept,"" Vines further pointed out, raising questions about the purpose of the scheme.

Uganda: a stretched-out refugee nation

Just days prior to the confirmation of the deal, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, Henry Oryem Okello, claimed the country did not have the capabilities to take in migrants.

But after initially denying the deal with the US government, Vincent Bagiire, the premanent secretary of Uganda's Foreign Affairs Ministry's, confirmed the deal while saying it was inly a ""temporary arrangement.""

Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, with roughly 1.7 million people housed in various camps across the country, according to the United Nations.

These are for the most part asylum-seekers and recognized refugees, who hail from other countries in the region such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.

For the most part, these immigrant communities live peacefully alongside the local population — but some think this might change:

""Uganda is a hospitable country, hosting many refugees. That is not a big thing to us. But already as a host country, we are choking,"" says Dorcus Kimono, a local living in the capital, Kampala.

""If these migrants are coming to our country, we would not mind sharing the little we have with them. But what is the American government doing for us?""

Alex Wandeba, another resident of Kampala, shares her views: ""Uganda is already overburdened; we have many refugees from the neighbouring countries. I feel, we have enough on the table.""

Kimono meanwhile wonders how Ugandans will ultimately benefit from the agreement with the United States:

""I would want to hear [that if] a deal is reached with our government that the US is constructing roads, or they are going to help us in the health and education sector. That would be a good deal.”

Eswatini: a kingdom with no rights

Though prior US administrations have also conducted third-country removals, the Trump's practice of sending immigrants to countries with considerable political and human rights crises have raised alarm among human rights' groups.

This was particularly notable last month, when the US flew five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to Eswatini — the last absolute monarchy in Africa, which is known for its troubling rights record.

Eswatini has been ruled by Mswati III since 1986, who leads a life of luxury while the population of 1,2 million of the landlocked nation remains poor.

The country has a deteriorating human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch and according to reports penned by the US State Department itself, as recently as 2023.

Political Activist Mphandlana Shongwe says there is widespread public anger in Eswatini about the king's decision to allow those immigrants into the country, which appears to fall on deaf ears: ""We condemn the bringing of hardcore convicts to our country to mix with our young convicts, who still have a chance to be rehabilitated,"" he told DW.

Government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli meanwhile assured the public that the five inmates ""pose no threat to the country or its citizens,"" as they were being kept in isolation, at least for now.

South Sudan: war-torn and unsafe

Conflict-torn South Sudan meanwhile has also agreed to accept immigrants sent by the Trump administration.

Edmund Yakani, President of East African Civil Society Organizations Forum, told DW that details of the deal were being kept hidden from the public.

Alex Vines meanwhile believes that it's all about geopolitics: ""It is about these countries looking at how to diversify their partnerships and engender improved relationships with the Trump administration that might carry money and other benefits longer term to them,"" he said.

""South Sudan is very much in the crosshairs of the current US administration visa strategy of restricting access to the US because of [a history of] overstay of South Sudanese"", Vines further explained, adding that there is also the issue of the US tariffs, which ""may be reduced, although that has not impacted these countries particularly.""

Rwanda: acting out of good will?

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolor confirmed that her country would also take up to 250 deportees from the US under the provision that the government maintains ""the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement"" under the agreement.

Elaborating on why Rwanda accepted the US deal, Makolo stated the agreement meant that the African country was doing its part to help with international migration issues because ""our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation.""

Other African nations that are known to have been approached by the US for deporatation deals include Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauretania and Guinea-Bissau.

Nigeria has explicitly rejected any proposal by the US, with its Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar saying the country already had ""enough of its own problems.""

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons vowed to ""flood"" Boston with agents after Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu doubled down on her pledge to uphold the city's sanctuary policies and resist the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Speaking on the local radio program ""The Howie Carr Show,"" Lyons responded to Wu by saying, ""Now you’re going to see more ICE agents come to Boston to make sure that we take these public safety threats out that she wants to let go back into the communities.""

He pointed to the Trump administration’s ""Operation Patriot,"" which sent federal agents into the Boston area in March and yielded over a thousand arrests.

""We are going to keep doing it in Boston,"" Lyons said. ""We’re going to continue to do our mission. We’re going to keep making Boston safe as she’s failing to do with these sanctuary city policies.""

LARGEST EVER ICE OPERATION RESULTS IN NEARLY 1,500 ILLEGALS ARRESTED IN BLUE STATE

Pressed on whether ICE will surge agents to the Boston area, similar to how agents are in Washington, D.C., Lyons responded, ""One hundred percent you will see a larger ICE presence.""

""We’re definitely going to, as you’ve heard the saying, flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,"" he added. ""And, obviously, Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuaries, and sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about in neighborhoods.""

Lyons pointed out that, during Operation Patriot, ICE pursued ""targeted enforcement operations"" of criminal aliens released by the City of Boston and Massachusetts.

Operation Patriot resulted in the arrest of nearly 1,500 illegal immigrants, including murderers, rapists, drug traffickers and child sex predators.

Sources at ICE told Fox News that 790 of those arrested had criminal convictions or charges, and 277 had final removal or deportation orders. The sources said that all the targeted criminals were roaming the streets of Massachusetts cities freely before being apprehended.

The operation ran throughout May and involved ICE teams from other states in the Northeast, as well as authorities from the FBI, DEA and ATF.

Speaking on Wednesday, Lyons said, ""There’s so many of these criminal aliens that keep getting released to go out and commit more crimes that local law enforcement have to deal with, and we can take that, you know, violent criminal illegal alien instantly out of the neighborhood.""

This follows U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi setting a deadline of Tuesday for sanctuary jurisdictions to drop their policies that block cooperation with federal authorities.

Speaking on Fox Business, Bondi said she sent letters to 32 mayors and seven governors ""telling them you better comply or you’re next.""

Bondi highlighted a letter she sent to California Gov. Gavin Newsom in which she warned that ""individuals operating under the color of law, using their official position to obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts and facilitating or inducing illegal immigration may be subject to criminal charges.""

SANCTUARY CITIES DEFY BONDI’S DEADLINE TO COOPERATE: ‘NO INTENTION OF CHANGING’

The letter, shared on social media, said cooperation between federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, including on immigration enforcement, ""is vital to enforce federal law and protect national security.""

Wu publicly rejected Bondi’s demands during a press conference, calling the ultimatum a political stunt.

""Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law,"" Wu said Tuesday. ""This is our city. This is our country, and I'm so proud and grateful to show the world who our community is here in Boston and what we're made of.""

In response to Lyons' comments, Wu's office shared a statement from the mayor who was answering another reporter's question.

Wu reiterated, ""In Boston, we comply and follow all of the laws, city, state and federal. And we will not back down from communities that have made us the safest major city in the country.

""This is a beautiful, diverse, incredible city, and I have said it now very directly this administration needs to stop attacking cities to hide their own failures.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/michelle-wu.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:57:24.070277

The Guardian has previously reported on how the Trump administration has deported Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee camp.
Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians.
Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture.
The Trump administration has also announced it will end TPS for Haitian immigrants living in the US legally under the scheme.","Many thousands of immigrants living in the US who came from certain countries regarded as risky or dangerous are at the mercy of US judges and the Trump administration’s agenda to slash their work authorization and protection from deportation.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has announced the termination of temporary protected status (TPS) for citizens of seven of the 15 countries previously designated for shelter under this legal umbrella – with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) controversially citing improved conditions in some of those places.

The seven countries are Afghanistan, Haiti, Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal and Cameroon, plunging many TPS holders in those US immigrant communities into confusion and fear and prompting groups of individuals and advocacy organizations to head for the courts to shield them, with varying degrees of success so far.

On Wednesday, a federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration and halted, for now, a lower court’s order that had kept in place temporary protections for 60,000 migrants from Central America and Nepal.

This means that the Republican administration can move toward removing an estimated 7,000 people from Nepal whose TPS designations expired on 5 August. The TPS designations and legal status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire on 8 September, at which point they will become eligible for removal from the US.

The National TPS Alliance group had sued, alleging that the administration’s plan was unlawful.

In the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, some of their nationals in the US have held TPS status for over 25 years, since Hurricane Mitch caused devastating damage to both countries in the late 90s.

In July, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said it was safe to return people to Nicaragua and Honduras.

However, the United Nations said in a report that the Nicaraguan regime of co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo “has deliberately transformed the country into an authoritarian state where opposition voices are silenced and the population faces persecution and economic retaliation”.

And in April the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said: “The Nicaraguan regime is an enemy of humanity.”

Meanwhile, Honduras has the highest rate of femicides in Latin America, according to Human Rights Watch, with approximately seven femicides per 100,000 women, and across the nation the UN says 1.6 million people live with urgent humanitarian needs out of a population of 7 million. More than 50,000 Hondurans in the US are TPS holders.

Nepal was initially designated for TPS in 2015 after an earthquake disrupted and displaced millions. Noem said that “there are notable improvements in environmental disaster preparedness and response capacity”. Earlier this year, amid economic and political instability in the country, Nepal was experiencing violent clashes between civilians and police.

The Guardian has previously reported on how the Trump administration has deported Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee camp.

Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians. In the case of the Afghan immigrant population in the US, many, including some who assisted US forces in Afghanistan before the botched withdrawal by the military in 2021, are already at risk of deportation.

Fereshta Abbasi, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture.

“For example, on the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, we were able to document cases that, especially former government employees, once they’re back in Afghanistan, they’re picked up by the authorities and they’re being arbitrarily detained and tortured; that’s a real risk for anyone who’s deported back to Afghanistan,” said Abbasi.

She added: “The Taliban have not only taken away the fundamental rights of women, they have taken women’s autonomy as well. I’ve spoken to women in Afghanistan who have told me that they feel they are living in a prison. The US knows that Afghanistan is not a safe country.”

The Department of Homeland Security has cited rising tourism as a factor in its assessment that Afghans can be deported back there, with the US Federal Register’s item about revoking TPS for Afghans saying: “Tourism to Afghanistan has increased, as the rates of kidnappings have reduced.”

However, the US has also issued a travel warning for Afghanistan, advising Americans not to visit the country due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism and risk of wrongful detention. The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for two Taliban leaders, accused of crimes against humanity for the persecution of women and girls.

An elderly British couple detained without charge after years of living in Afghanistan are in danger of dying in custody, relatives have warned. And Afghans living in or with the prospect of returning to Afghanistan who are known or even just suspected by the Taliban of having assisted US or British forces there could be in mortal danger.

The US Congress established TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, signed by the then president, George HW Bush.

The estimated 1 million TPS holders in the US overall have not only used the program’s benefits to support themselves in the US workplace, but also to contribute an estimated $21bn annually to the economy, while paying $5.2bn in taxes, according to the advocacy group Fwd.us.

The Trump administration has also announced it will end TPS for Haitian immigrants living in the US legally under the scheme. The US embassy in Haiti warns people not to travel to the Caribbean nation, citing kidnapping and civil unrest, as does the US state department website.

While Noem acknowledged that conditions in Haiti remained dire, she said it was not in the national interest of the US to continue the TPS program for Haitians.

The poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has been engulfed in political tumult since the assassination of the then president, Jovenel Moïse, in 2021. The descent for the already-unstable country into further crisis has displaced 1.3 million Haitians, according to the International Organization for Migration, and local authorities estimate that 5.7 million face food insecurity.

An estimated 340,000 Haitians in the US who are currently covered by TPS – a designation initially made in 2010 following the devastating earthquake that year – will no longer have this protection from deportation after 2 September.

Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigrant support group in the US, said some of the people already deported to Haiti “are just dropped off” and “their family relatives don’t know what happened to them”.

“The termination of TPS is a complete unwillingness to acknowledge the humanity of these immigrants, whom many of them have been in the country for over 15 years. Many of them have children who were born and raised here,” Jozef said.

“The entire Black immigrant community doesn’t fit the agenda, or are not deemed dignified enough, or not deemed worthy enough of the protection that those people need. We are at a point where they don’t care how long they have been here, that they have paid their taxes, that they have businesses.”

Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, remains largely under gang control and armed conflict has rendered the city inaccessible from both the north and south.

Violent groups dominate the city center and surrounding areas, with only two districts spared, where camps for internally displaced people have multiplied, sheltering tens of thousands who have fled violence.

In this parlous condition, the prospect of mass deportations from the US is alarming local organizations already struggling to cope.

“Where will families whose homes have been burned down go?” Katia Bonté, coordinator of the Support Group for Returnees and Refugees (GARR) in Haiti, asked.

Her organization already operates along the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, assisting people expelled daily back to Haiti under a crackdown by the Dominican government launched last October.

Bonté fears a similar wave from the US would overwhelm already fragile systems.

“Deported Haitians won’t be able to return to their families or communities. I visit the displacement camps. I see how people survive. It’s inhumane – the impact would be devastating,” she said, adding: “There’s not much hope left. It feels like we’re on our own, and no one is coming to help.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly eyeing Honduras and Nicaragua as places to send people who are from neither country originally but are being deported from the US, and has done a deal with Rwanda and, on Wednesday, with Uganda.

There was uproar from many directions when the US government deported, without due process, a group of people from a variety of countries to South Sudan and Eswatini this summer.

The money comes from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program, and voting officials say new requirements from the administration will make the money inaccessible for most of the country.

NPR is the first news outlet to report on the changes.

About $28 million — or 3% of the overall Homeland Security Grant Program — is devoted to election security and now at risk, though some officials and experts worry that the new requirements could also endanger hundreds of millions of dollars in other grants for law enforcement.

Voting officials say the amount of money at risk won't make or break the country's election security. But the potential withholding of funds over policy differences — combined with other recent election security cuts — has many wondering whether the Trump administration is prioritizing election security the way it claims it is.

""Despite the rhetoric, there's been [a] serious cutback to election security support that is being offered to the states,"" said Larry Norden, an elections expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is broadly critical of President Trump's policies. ""And this is going to be one more cut for a lot of states because most states are not going to allow the president to decide [how their elections work].""

The grant money in question is administered within DHS by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and is meant to help state and local governments prepare for and prevent terrorism and disasters. For some of the grants, DHS designates priority areas to further target what the money is spent on, and three years ago the agency began designating election security as one of those priorities.

This year, however, Trump directed DHS to adjust the election security portion of the grants as part of his March 25 executive order on voting (much of which has been paused by courts).

The new grant rules were released publicly in late July, and multiple election officials told NPR they saw them similar to that executive order: as a way for the administration to try to force their hands when it comes to policy.

""The Department of Homeland Security is trying to back-door changes to our election laws,"" said Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat. ""That is unacceptable.""

The grant applications closed earlier this month, and Maine is forgoing roughly $130,000 in election security grant money because the state does not plan to comply with the new requirements, Bellows said.

Another state election official, who spoke to NPR anonymously because they did not have permission to speak publicly, said their state was also forgoing the money. They estimated that only a handful of election offices were working with their state emergency management departments to craft the grant applications in line with the new election requirements and therefore would potentially access that money.

The new requirements

It's also unclear exactly how DHS will judge whether states meet the new demands.

One of the requirements, for instance, is that jurisdictions applying for money must ""prioritize compliance"" with federal guidelines for voting system certification that are so new they have not yet been incorporated anywhere in the country.

FEMA, which manages the grants, did not respond to NPR's questions about the new grant rules, including about how such a provision would be adjudicated considering that no state is currently using election equipment certified to the new standards. DHS also did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Another new requirement is that jurisdictions applying for election security money must use a new DHS citizenship verification tool for all people working at a polling place in ""any capacity.""

That tool, known as the SAVE system, was expanded rapidly by DHS this year, and the agency has not disclosed anything publicly about the accuracy or reliability of the information provided by the system, or about how personal data run through the system will be secured.

It's unclear whether the system has ever been used to verify election workers, considering the functionality that allows the system to search for U.S.-born citizens was only added in the past few months.

""DHS can't require us to use that system,"" said Bellows.

Concerns about other law enforcement grants

NPR has previously reported that in previous years some of the grant program's money designated for election security has not actually gone to reinforcing state voting infrastructure.

That election security portion of the grants represents a small percentage of the overall billion-dollar DHS grant program, but Norden of the Brennan Center is concerned the rest of the grant money could also be withheld if states don't comply with the elections rules.

In the section of the new election requirements, there is a line that says an applying jurisdiction must ""demonstrate proof of compliance before accessing the full"" award. Norden called the line unclear and alarming.

""You are talking about a billion dollars for state and local law enforcement to protect Americans from terrorism,"" Norden said. ""The idea that that money ... could be in any way held up is alarming for anybody who cares about the safety and security of citizens.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4032x2268+0+209/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2Fb8%2Ffdcfbb8742b4999a50d1bb38eda5%2Fap24309673948410.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 11:57:39.013228

Hours after protesters gathered at City Hall on Thursday to demand answers about the decision, Mayor Mark Dion said during a news conference that the council decided to go ahead with the agreement because the city’s lawyers believe Portland will not be required to work with the immigration agency.

During the news conference, Dion said the grant agreement would be publicly available Friday — two days after the council called an emergency workshop to discuss new terms that tied the airport funding to cooperation with immigration authorities. But the city released a digital version of the grant agreement Thursday night that was signed by city attorney Michael Goldman. City Councilor Wes Pelletier also posted the document online Thursday night.

At the meeting Wednesday night — which was held almost entirely out of public view — Dion said the council “reached a consensus” to move forward with accepting the grant for upgrades at the jetport.

“We did not consent, capitulate or embrace any condition for this money that would allow ICE to be entangled with city affairs. Period,” Dion said to a crowd of media gathered inside council chambers. “Somewhere along the line, this has become an ICE contract — it’s not. This is a grant award for infrastructure improvements at the airport.”

Dion said an item in the agreement stipulates that Maine and other states that have sued the Department of Transportation over its efforts to tie grant funding to immigration enforcement do not have to abide by the directive, so long as a judge’s injunction issued in June holds.

That temporary injunction barred the federal government from making ICE compliance a condition for DOT funding after Secretary Sean Duffy wrote a letter to grant recipients nationwide saying that cooperation was required. The conditions are outlined in Section 40 on Page 15 of the agreement.

When asked what action the city would take if a higher court reverses the injunction, Dion replied: “I can’t answer that with any certainty. Who could?”

The mayor said Thursday that some of the grant money had already been spent on airport improvements prior to the city signing the agreement.

Dion said he was not aware changes had been made to the grant’s conditions until a few days ago and that the council had not met earlier because the city only recently received the contract.

PROTESTERS DEMAND ANSWERS

The emergency meeting Wednesday raised concerns that the council was circumventing the public process. Some residents quickly organized a protest outside City Hall Thursday morning to decry the decision and ask questions.

Councilor Kate Sykes stood in the middle of the crowd of about 50 protesters and scrambled to answer questions.

“What about the citizens of Portland?” Lee Nicoloff, 72, called out. “I didn’t hear anything about this. I didn’t have a chance to share my two cents about this in a council meeting. … I was blown away when I got the message this morning.”

“Is there anything we can do?” Alexandra Magnaud, 34, asked from the crowd.

“It’s a done deal,” Sykes replied. The crowd booed.

Some held signs reading “Immigrants are not criminals, ICE is” and “No ICE in Portland,” and lobbed questions at Sykes for roughly 20 minutes.

Sykes, who was the only council member there, said she did not support the decision and noted multiple times that it was not unanimous.

“So can you tell us how everyone voted?” someone in the crowd shouted.

“I can’t,” Sykes replied. “The content of that meeting is protected.”

Prior to Wednesday’s meeting, Dion expressed frustration that the topic of the workshop had been publicly revealed beforehand: “I’m disappointed that someone who has been briefed on the nature of the executive session from our attorneys has decided to provide information to the public at this juncture,” he said.

Wednesday night’s agenda cited 1 M.R.S.§ 405(6)(E), a section of Maine law that allows government bodies to enter executive session to discuss “legal rights and duties,” litigation, settlement offers and other legal issues with an attorney but without the public present.

The council is not allowed to take votes in executive session, however.

Sykes said no formal vote had taken place and told protesters that she plans to put forth a transparency ordinance to change the protocol surrounding private meetings.

“We can never do this again,” she told the crowd. “We have to be transparent in all of the deals we have with the federal government right now.”

Some protesters voiced skepticism that the council had abided by the law.

“It sounds like they took a straw poll in executive session, which is just a vote by another name,” said Joey Brunelle, who helped organize the demonstration.

Rep. Grayson Lookner, a Democrat who represents parts of Portland in the State House, said the lack of transparency from the council was “unconscionable.”

FRUSTRATION WITH ICE

The council initially accepted the $21 million grant in January, though Dion said Thursday that the actual amount hinging on ICE cooperation was closer to $18 million. The money was set aside for gate improvement projects, new passenger boarding bridges and terminal improvements.

Sykes urged the protesters Thursday to attend future council meetings and speak during public comment. The council’s next meeting is scheduled for Monday evening.

About a dozen people broke off from the group and marched into the mayor’s office to submit written public comment. The protesters remained peaceful inside City Hall and followed protocol for submitting written public comment.

“We cannot be making secret agreements to cooperate with ICE,” Brunelle said.

Portland residents have previously expressed concerns about local cooperation with the agency. In June, more than 100 people packed a meeting of the Cumberland County commissioners to demand that the county jail stop holding ICE detainees.

“I find what’s going on with ICE to be an absolutely disgrace to our country,” Molly Gibbs, 36, said as she wrote a comment for the mayor. “It’s inhumane and un-American. The council meeting behind closed doors is very shady.”

“These small compromises are how we’ve gotten here,” added Alexandra Magnaud, 34. “I get that we have to play the game, but we’re no longer playing in a legal system that is functioning. We need to stand firm and be very clear that we do not accept this.”

Editor’s note: This story was updated on Aug. 21 to show that the city has signed the agreement and publicly released it.

City councilors agreed to accept the $18 million grant, which was previously reported to be $21 million, and reject wording in the agreement that would mandate the city to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

The grant agreement was signed late Thursday. Portland communications director Jess Grondin shared more details about the agreement through email.

""Note that the new language was added by USDOT, not ICE. The immigration enforcement provision that is the subject of the litigation is in section 31 on page 12. After the court issued the preliminary injunction, DOT added section 40, which indicates that DOT cannot enforce the provision in section 31 while the injunction is in place. Section 40 also states that by signing the agreement, we are not required to certify compliance with the immigration enforcement provision, and that DOT cannot construe our acceptance of the funds as certification of our compliance with the provision,"" Grondin wrote.

Dion said he believes it is unconstitutional for the federal government to add new terms that impose on local and state government operations, adding that the City of Portland would not agree to terms that make its immigrant population unsafe.

""We did not agree to any conditions involving ICE,"" Portland Mayor Mark Dion said during the press conference Thursday. ""We did not consent, capitulate, or embrace any condition for this money that would allow ICE to be tangled in city affairs. Period.""

The grant is for infrastructural improvements for things including the replacement of aging boarding bridges, new snow removal equipment, updated bathrooms, and more, Dion said.

The grant application was approved in January, Dion explained. Between then and the receipt of the awards, the U.S. Department of Transportation added language requiring recipients cooperate and not impede ICE and federal officers and components of the Department of Homeland Security in the enforcement of federal immigration law, according to Dion.

After the new wording was added, Maine and 19 other states went to federal court seeking to block the language involving ICE cooperation, Dion said. The federal judge issued an emergency preliminary injunction blocking ICE from the enforcement or application of those provisions to any grant recipient.

The ICE component did raise conversations and concerns among city councilors, Dion said. The councilors agreed the best way to deal with the situation was to accept the federal money and preserve standing to wage legal contest with the federal government down the road, if necessary.

The city also spoke with the Office of Attorney General. Dion said the office agreed that accepting the money does not make the city subordinate to ICE.

""This is not an issue of immigration, and ICE has no business, to our mind, to interfere in those responsibilities that we're trying to carry out as it applies to our jetport,"" Dion said.

Despite the city being completely against the newly added conditions, Dion said they cannot guarantee that the lawsuit will turn out in their favor.

Portland city council member Kate Sykes said that in agreeing to move forward and receive the grant funding and knowing the possible implications, she believes the city council backdoored its own people, making this deal through closed executive session.

""I think that when we compromise our values to quote on quote stay in a legal battle, we've already lost the fight,"" Sykes said. ""Immigrants need to be able to trust that when they call 9-1-1 and call police to their door that they will not be abducted and sent to a prison somewhere outside of our country.""

She said Portland's immigrant community is now at risk because of the council's actions, adding that she fears that these actions increase the likelihood of federal overreach in local government.

""It is a decision that directly impacts some of the deepest values that Portlanders have around what our city is, whether or not we are free to make our own decisions, whether or not we're going to make life more difficult for the immigrants that are living in our city, and I think it's a real problem that we didn't have a public process around this,"" Sykes told NEWS CENTER Maine outside city hall.

Just last month, there was pushback against the Jetport offering incentives to a small airline, Avelo, that has also entered into agreements with the Department of Homeland Security.

Earlier this year, news reports indicated that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) had shared the personal data of people who received Medicaid-covered services with DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in order to aid immigration enforcement. The two agencies eventually entered into a formal data-sharing arrangement. While undocumented individuals are not eligible for Medicaid, states receive federal Medicaid funding for emergency services regardless of immigration status, giving states and CMS important information about patients who are noncitizens. Following the data disclosure, nearly two dozen states sued HHS and DHS in federal court, arguing the agencies violated federal privacy laws, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The court's preliminary injunction prohibits DHS from using the Medicaid data it obtained from the plaintiff states and HHS from sharing new data with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes. Calling the Administration's data sharing policy a ""bolt-from-the-blue reversal,"" the court agreed that the government had failed to undertake a reasoned decision-making process and likely acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA. As the court noted, CMS' disclosure broke from decades of federal precedent, with HHS and DHS publicly indicating for years (and continuing to indicate) that Medicaid data will only be used for health coverage purposes. The order remains in place until 14 days after DHS and HHS have completed a ""reasoned decisionmaking process"" regarding the data sharing policy or until the litigation ends (whichever comes sooner).

The court left open the question of whether the Medicaid data disclosure violated federal privacy laws, though it suggested DHS may be able to obtain data from HHS subject to certain limitations. While the preliminary injunction is a key victory for states seeking to protect Medicaid enrollees' data, it is possible DHS and CMS may be able to establish a data-sharing policy in the future, depending on how the litigation unfolds.

The incident, which was recorded and shared on social media, has garnered thousands of views.

The footage shows Jade Michalski being carried into a Ringgold Police cruiser. A Facebook live captured her confrontation with officers. Watch below:

Minutes earlier, Michalski walked between police and the police car holding the suspect, Obrey Jiminez, claiming officers refused to provide him with medical treatment.

The incident began when a Georgia State Patrol trooper pulled over Jiminez in this white van.

According to a Ringgold police report, the trooper was engaged in a struggle with Jiminez just before Michalski began recording the encounter. Officers had determined that Jimenez was operating a vehicle without a valid license.

The Georgia State Patrol later provided these details of the arrest in their report:

Jimenez was instructed multiple times to exit the vehicle but refused to comply. While being given verbal commands, he reached between the driver and passenger seats, prompting the Trooper to remove him from the vehicle. During the arrest, Jimenez resisted and attempted to flee; however, the Trooper regained control and placed him in custody.

As officers waited for a tow truck to arrive to pick up the van, police say Michalski asked them if an ambulance was on the way for Jiminez, who was arrested for driving without a license and obstruction.

Elizabeth Haley, a friend of Michalski, said,

Jade saw a brown man being arrested and harassed asking for medical care,' said Elizabeth Haley, a friend of Michalski. 'And as any decent human would, [they] stepped in to say, hey, can we make sure he gets that medical care?

Dispatchers on Broadcastify attempt to call for an ambulance, but were advised that none were available.

The police report says Michalski stepped in front of the patrol vehicle when officers informed them they were taking Jiminez to jail for medical treatment instead.

We asked attorney McCracken Poston, who knows Michalski's family, when trying to help crosses the line into breaking the law.

I know that videoing these encounters is not intrusive. You know, other things may be or may be considered that, or they may be considered justified. It's just hard to tell at this juncture,"" he said.

Despite the outcome, Haley believes Michalski's actions were justified.

Jade would say that it was worth it, because they we've had attention drawn to this issue,"" she said.

The Catoosa County Sheriff tells us Jiminez has now been turned over to federal officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We've requested the Georgia State Patrol report that details why Jiminez was pulled over and what started the altercation with Troopers.

Catholic churches that serve Spanish-speaking communities in the Archdiocese of Washington have reported anxiety as encounters with immigration enforcement continue to function as a major aspect of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital.

Sacred Heart Shrine in Columbia Heights reported that six of its parishioners were detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in recent weeks, including an usher who was on his way to evening Mass. Other parishes in the archdiocese have also expressed concern amid the current situation in the District.

This comes after the Trump administration announced Aug. 11 the deployment of federal agents and the National Guard in order to crack down on widespread crime in D.C.

Following an executive order from Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith, D.C. police officers have been permitted to notify ICE agents of encounters with undocumented migrants, resulting in tight collaboration between the two law enforcement agencies in the city.

Sacred Heart Shrine’s pastor, Father Emilio Biosca Agüero, OFM Cap, told Religion News Service that one of the parishioners detained by ICE was a man in marriage preparation, while another was in a confirmation class.

Some of the detainees, the pastor noted, were stopped by immigration officials while on their way to the shrine for catechetical classes over the past several weeks. Bisoco estimated in the report that Mass attendance at his parish has dropped about 20% from 2,500 to less than 2,000 people.

The priest also said the parish WhatsApp chats “have been filled with immigration agent sightings and warnings to parish members.”

Biosca Agüero declined to comment to CNA on the story.

Last month, an ICE spokesperson told CNA: “While ICE is not subject to previous restrictions on immigration operations at sensitive locations, to include schools, churches, and courthouses, ICE does not indiscriminately take enforcement actions at these locations.”

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” the spokesperson noted, adding: “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removed from the United States.”

According to the RNS report, attendance at St. Gabriel Catholic Church in the Petworth neighborhood of D.C. has also gone down.

The communications director at Our Lady Queen of the Americas parish, Kevin Arevalo, told CNA that “the parishioners that we have had coming to Sunday Mass have expressed concerns and fears over the situation here in D.C.”

Arevalo said there have not been any detentions on church grounds and that he is not aware of any parishioners being detained on their way to attend Mass at the parish or nearby.

However, he noted several detentions he has heard of have taken place in neighborhoods like Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant, and many parishioners of Our Lady Queen of the Americas “have to go through those areas to get to our parish.”

As such, Arevalo and the parish’s administrator, Father James Morrison, are currently preparing alternative ways to reach the community amid rising fears regarding immigration enforcement.

“I know that most of them live pretty far and go out of their way to come here for our Masses and activities,” he said, “so we’re looking at using digital media and our channels, our online channels, to reach out to them and serve them in whatever best way possible we can.”

(Story continues below)

He concluded: “We definitely won’t stay quiet about this because our parish, the majority, is Hispanic-Latino community. So you want to make sure that we’re listening to them and we’re attentive to what they’re going through.”

Undocumented immigrants have long been ineligible for programs like Medicaid, Medicare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
“This will just further entrench those people as an underclass of people who are afraid to come out, afraid to get needed nutritional assistance, send their children to school and receive health care services,” Popat said.
“These guys have sought to completely confuse people on who is an illegal alien,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law policy at George Washington University.
That portion rose to about four in 10 among undocumented immigrants and immigrants with limited English.","The Trump administration is attempting to reverse decades-old policy to exclude a broad group of immigrants from accessing social services and health benefits, a move that is causing widespread fear among immigrant advocates even as it has yet to take effect.

Immigration groups and health experts say it could harm millions by cutting off access to basic health services, including for people who are U.S. citizens and immigrants who have legal permission to be in the country. They have been pressing the administration for more information, but say there have been few details forthcoming.

“That’s the other thing about these notices, they leave so many questions unanswered,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel on health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center.

“They don’t tell people how immigration status will be verified, whose immigration status is relevant,” she added. “They say more guidance is forthcoming, but they don’t name the services that are exempt from restrictions, and they leave people confused on what they should do.”

The administration in July announced it was reinterpreting a 1996 federal law that has allowed immigrants access to certain public benefits, part of an effort to further crack down on what the White House says is the abuse of taxpayer services by undocumented immigrants.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it was expanding the definition of “federal public benefit” to include a host of new services that would be off-limits to undocumented immigrants – including Head Start, Title X family planning services, and the community health center program.

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr said in a statement announcing the new policy.

The move “restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people,” Kennedy said.

The policy was supposed to take effect immediately without any public input.

But after being sued by 20 blue states and the District of Columbia, HHS agreed to pause enforcement nationwide until Sept. 10 while considering public comments, which were due Aug. 13.

The agency said it would determine whether to provide any additional information. Plaintiffs in the case are expecting a judge to issue an order on the lawsuit by September 10th, according to Broder.

Advocates said the administration’s shift fits a pattern.

Undocumented immigrants have long been ineligible for programs like Medicaid, Medicare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). But the administration and Republicans in Congress are going further.

“These changes, just like many of the attacks that the administration has perpetuated against immigrants and the immigrant community, are really not actually about undocumented immigrants,” said Esther Reyes, a campaign strategist for the Protecting Immigrant Families coalition.

“In reality, they don’t have eligibility for these programs to begin with. So what [the administration is] actually doing is limiting access and restricting eligibility for people who are actually here with authorization and with a lawful status,” Reyes said.

For instance, Reyes said many U.S. citizen children have parents who are undocumented or have other types of immigration status. So even if those children are eligible and entitled to use a program, they may get shut out due to confusion and misunderstanding about the restrictions.

The sweeping change was announced just weeks after the “big beautiful” tax and spending law imposed new restrictions on food aid and health programs for immigrants. Combined with the new restrictions, experts and advocates said the changes will likely have chilling effects on immigrant families, making them reluctant to seek out the care and services they need.

“People are going to … retreat further into the shadows of our society,” said Mitesh Popat, CEO of the Venice Family Clinic, a community health center serving more than 45,000 people in the Los Angeles area.

“This will just further entrench those people as an underclass of people who are afraid to come out, afraid to get needed nutritional assistance, send their children to school and receive health care services,” Popat said.

The Clinton administration’s 1996 welfare reform restricted services like Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and more to a category of “qualified immigrants.”

Now, the Trump administration wants to add 13 more programs to the list.

A qualified immigrant is not necessarily undocumented. The category includes people in the country with a nonimmigrant visa, people who have applied for asylum, people with Temporary Protected Status, those who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others, according to health research nonprofit KFF.

“These guys have sought to completely confuse people on who is an illegal alien,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law policy at George Washington University.

The change most concerning for advocates involves federal funding for community health centers, a program that funds more than 15,000 clinics.

Community health centers are often the providers of last resort. A 2023 KFF survey found three out of 10 immigrant adults said a CHC is their usual source of care. That portion rose to about four in 10 among undocumented immigrants and immigrants with limited English.

Health centers can’t turn anyone away, but if they are restricted from serving undocumented patients, they may not be reimbursed for care.

Under the 1996 law, nonprofits are not required to report on immigration status of the patients they serve. The new policy seemingly keeps that exemption, but HHS wasn’t clear.

Advocacy groups fear the administration is attempting to turn health centers and other places where people receive services into immigration checkpoints.

“Our purpose for existing, we’re not supposed to be arbiters in the middle of deciding who can get care, who can’t get care,” said Popat.

It’s also unclear how the administration will enforce the new policy.

“We are service providers … we aren’t law enforcement. We aren’t here to adjudicate whether someone’s ID looks legitimate or not, or someone’s papers look legitimate or not,” Popat said.

This conflict between the federal government’s policy change and the statutory requirement for CHCs will likely cause confusion among providers and immigrant patients alike.

“There’s this very complicated patchwork of different regulations right now on the federal, state and local level, in terms of who is or isn’t required to check immigration status. And that’s just going to put a huge burden on these community health centers,” said Sweta Haldar a senior policy analyst at the Democratic-aligned Families USA.

Cutting off access to affordable community health center care will likely send people to emergency departments, a costly visit for patients that could also exacerbate overcrowding and long wait times/

“Immigrants and citizens work together in families and communities, and that excluding anybody from health care, compromises the health and well-being of all of us,” Broder said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Immigration_082225_AP_Jessie-Wardarski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-22 10:56:24.456004

“We can do both.” Throughout their letter, the bishops encouraged Kansans to see immigrants as humans rather than criminals.","TOPEKA — An open letter from Kansas Catholic bishops urges people to approach immigration with compassion, and condemns portrayals of all immigrants as criminals — rhetoric President Donald Trump frequently uses.

“Treating all migrants and refugees as if they were violent criminals is simply unjust. They are human beings made in God’s image,” wrote Archbishop Shawn McKnight, Bishop Carl Kemme, and Bishop Gerald Vincke in the letter.

Both Pope Francis, who died in April, and Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, have been critical of Trump’s mass deportations and descriptions of immigrants as criminals.

The Kansas Legislature passed a resolution in April to encourage Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — who has condemned Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, like his deployment of the National Guard on U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles — to “fully cooperate with the policies of the Trump administration in enforcing federal immigration laws.”

The resolution encourages compassion for immigrants — who are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born Americans — but includes a paragraph that asserts “illegal immigration leads to severe repercussions for our entire state, including threats to public safety and public health via human trafficking, the deadly fentanyl crisis and strains on public resources.”

Some of the legislators who voted yes on the resolution are Catholic, including Republican Rep. David Buehler from Lansing.

Buehler said he found the bishops’ letter, which acknowledges criminals are taking advantage of the country’s broken immigration system, to be incomplete.

“We don’t have anything in the way of policy in the state of Kansas that I think is not kind. I think we all stand for law and order and humane treatment of all people,” Buehler said. “But I think we have to consider all aspects of this issue, and we can’t turn a blind eye to the impact on our schools, to the impact on our health care. There are so many pieces and parts.”

Buehler said he is worried about what he sees as the unintended consequences of immigration, which he believes were exacerbated when President Joe Biden was in office.

“We should have humane treatment for immigration and those who may be here illegally, but we also at the same time should enforce the laws of this country,” Buehler said. “We can do both.”

Throughout their letter, the bishops encouraged Kansans to see immigrants as humans rather than criminals.

“Amid political division and fear, we remind our communities that at the center of every immigration debate are real people: families in our pews, children in our schools, workers in our neighborhoods, and volunteers in our parishes,” the bishops wrote.

Shabina Kavimandan immigrated to Kansas from India in 1998. She said she started volunteering with Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher’s campaign for governor in part because of Holscher’s kindness toward immigrants.

“There are certain members of a party that always say they align with so many religious views, especially when it comes to ‘pro-life’ issues,” Kavimandan said. “I see that they believe in life, and the value of life. And then on the other hand there is such a dismissal of the reasons why people choose to come to this country.”

Kavimandan said she stayed in the United States in part because of her determination and also because of Kansans’ interest in knowing and helping her as a person.

“There were people who sat across from me and asked about Shabina the individual. I see that missing now,” Kavimandan said. “That’s another piece that lawmakers tend to overlook sometimes. Behind all the policies there really are just people and their stories. There’s a Shabina who came to this land with $200 in her pocket, but then there were people who were like ‘We have to make sure that she becomes something in this country.’ ”

According to Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora, ICE agents arrived around 7 a.m. in unmarked vehicles with blacked-out windows. They attempted to detain a man but failed to produce a judicial warrant. When the man fled into his home, the standoff began.

""Trenton Police are here just strictly to keep the peace in the neighborhood,"" Gusciora told CBS News Philadelphia. ""We're not here to assist ICE. Shame on ICE for not having the warrant to begin with.""

Outside the home, dozens of neighbors, including members of a local ""rapid response team,"" gathered behind police tape, demanding transparency and accountability.

Ana Puello, a resident of Chambersburg for more than a decade, said the neighborhood is home to families from Guatemala, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and beyond.

""They don't have the paperwork,"" Puello said of ICE.

""This is a sanctuary community,"" she said about the neighborhood.

Pastor Erich Kussman, of St. Bartholomew Lutheran Church, said he knows the family well. The man ICE was seeking is a day laborer. His wife works at a cleaning company. They have five children, ranging in age from 1 to 10.

""There's a whole family inside,"" Kussman said. He added, ""We welcome Jesus when we welcome the people that are immigrants in our neighborhood.""

The agents wearing vests marked ""POLICE U.S. BORDER PATROL"" and ""POLICE HSI"" (Homeland Security Investigations) remained outside the home until about 11:45 a.m., eventually leaving without making an arrest.

""ICE should be acting responsible. They should have a warrant, they should tell us when they're here, and they should tell us the reasons why they're picking up the person. Again, if it's a gang member or somebody who's in a drug cartel, we'll support that,"" Gusciora said.

One protester was briefly arrested for crossing police tape but was later released.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Democrat from New Jersey, condemned the operation.

""To come and to be masked, to not identify yourself, to not show your badge, that's something that you see in other countries. You don't see that in the United States of America. It's very un-American,"" Coleman said.

In a statement, Trenton Police emphasized their limited role in the situation: ""We are not involved in the ICE action nor are we assisting them. We are only there to maintain safety and respond if necessary.""

The community, though relieved the standoff ended without violence, remains shaken.

In a written answer to a question posed by The Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document.

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department's new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews.

But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9941acf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2Fb5%2F916bbc8c4f6d83e07f68fb6ba37c%2Fap25226635647511.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 10:56:28.900752

(AP) — At an obstacle course in the humid Georgia heat, an instructor shows recruits how to pull a wounded partner out of danger. In a classroom with desks cluttered with thick legal books about immigration law, recruits learn about how the Fourth Amendment governs their work. And on a firing range littered with shell casings, new recruits for Immigration and Customs Enforcement practice shooting their handguns.

“Instructors, give me a thumbs up when students are ready to go,” a voice over the loudspeaker said before a group of about 20 ICE recruits practiced drawing and firing their weapons.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, is the epicenter of training for almost all federal law enforcement officers, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are at the center of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

Now, with lots of money approved by Congress this summer starting to flow into ICE, the agency is in midst of a huge hiring effort as it aims to get thousands of new deportation officers into the field in the coming months.

On Thursday, The Associated Press and other news organizations got a rare look at the Basic Immigration Law Enforcement Training Program that new ICE recruits — specifically those in the Enforcement and Removal Operations unit responsible for finding, arresting and removing people from the country — go through and what they learn.

Ramping up hiring, training

ICE is getting $76.5 billion in new money from Congress to help it meet Trump’s mass deportation goal. That’s nearly 10 times the agency’s current annual budget. Nearly $30 billion of that money is for new staff.

They’re hiring across the agency, including investigators and lawyers, but the numbers they’re hiring in those areas pale in comparison to how many deportation officers are coming on board. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, was at the training demonstration Thursday. He said the agency currently has about 6,500 deportation officers and is aiming to hire 10,000 more by the end of the year.

With that hiring surge has come concerns that vetting or training of new recruits will be shortchanged. The Border Patrol went through a similar hiring surge in the early 2000s when hiring and training standards were changed; arrests for employee misconduct rose.

Lyons pushed back on concerns that ICE might cut corners when it comes to training. although he said they have made changes designed to streamline the process.

“I wasn’t going to water down training,” said Lyons.

Caleb Vitello, the assistant director of ICE in charge of training, says new recruits will go through about eight weeks of training at the Georgia facility. But they also have training before and after they come here.

One key change, Vitello noted: ICE cut out five weeks of Spanish-language training because he said recruits were only getting to the point of being “moderately” competent in Spanish. He said language translation technology can help fill that void in the field.

What does the training look like?

During the six-days-a-week training, new recruits live on the grounds of the sprawling facility, which is covered with pine forests and sits near the Atlantic Ocean a little less than an hour’s drive north of the Florida state line. Hundreds have gone through the training here in recent months.

During the course, new recruits train on firearms in a large indoor shooting range that looks as big as a football field. On Thursday, the floor was littered with spent shell casings as roughly 20 new recruits wearing blue shirts and blue pants practiced shooting from a bent-elbow position and transitional shooting — involving transferring their guns from one hand to another. Instructors in red shirts walked behind them, occasionally giving them instruction. Everyone wore eye protection and red, noise-reducing earmuffs with earplugs underneath.

Dean Wilson, who oversees the firearms training, compared some of the operations that ICE agents face to a haunted house where they don’t know what might be coming at them.

“We do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision,” said Wilson. “Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot, and nobody wants to be the one that doesn’t make it home.”

In a big field with various driving tracks and courses, they also train on driving techniques — how to recover from a skid on wet pavement or how to navigate a winding course similar to an urban environment where they have to come to a full stop or navigate blind corners.

The curriculum also includes de-escalation techniques designed to prevent the use of force in the first place, Lyons said.

“In any type of law enforcement situation,” he said, “you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.”

Learning the law and the Fourth Amendment

Not all of the training is in the field.

ICE agents like to point out that when it comes to complexity, immigration law is second only to the tax code.

At the training academy, they get about 12 hours of classroom instruction on things like the Fourth Amendment — the part of the Constitution that protects against unreasonable searches and seizures — and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which has evolved over the decades and governs all facets of immigration. Those legal lessons are also interspersed throughout the rest of the training.

On the desks in one classroom are training manuals and immigration law handbooks roughly two to three inches thick. Recruits learn about how to determine if someone is removable from the country, under what circumstances they can go into someone’s house to search and when they have to leave.

ICE staff pushed back on accusations that they are indiscriminately pulling people over or setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere as part of immigration enforcement.

They said they have to have probable cause to go after someone, and they do targeted operations. They said they can’t — and don’t — do traffic stops but can work with local authorities who are.

“Once local law enforcement makes a stop, and then they contact ICE saying we have somebody that we possibly think might be an alien,“ said Greg Hornsby, an associate legal adviser at ICE. ”And that’s where we step in.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3c327be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+257/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fe6%2Fd1%2Fba04724362881e0498045e2f499c%2F6e72832c6d7c429c99f722986c015e55,N,,2025-08-22 11:58:10.563783

The ruling could have broader implications for the approximately 29,000 others from countries covered by the travel ban who won the diversity visa lottery in 2024, according to State Department data.
She concluded that she was unable to direct the State Department to reverse those decisions.
In an accompanying order, Judge Sooknanan directed the State Department to “expeditiously process” and approve the remaining 82 applications.
“Defendants miss the gravity of what the plaintiffs stand to lose,” Judge Sooknanan wrote.","A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Trump administration had unlawfully withheld visas from a number of people because of a travel ban President Trump instituted in June, which barred visa access for individuals from 19 countries.

The decision from Judge Sparkle Sooknanan in Federal District Court in Washington applied narrowly to seven dozen people who had been selected for entry to the United States on “diversity visas.” Such visas offer a pathway to permanent residency, and 55,000 of them are granted every fiscal year to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States.

She found that those individuals were then unlawfully refused the visa because of the travel ban Mr. Trump had instituted more than a year after they had won the lottery in May 2024. The ruling could have broader implications for the approximately 29,000 others from countries covered by the travel ban who won the diversity visa lottery in 2024, according to State Department data.

The individuals involved in the lawsuit hailed from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Togo, Somalia and Iran, and their visas were either denied outright or remained in processing. The lawsuit argued that the Trump administration had stalled, refusing to process visa requests before Sept. 30, when their eligibility to receive a visa through the program is set to expire.

Judge Sooknanan, who was appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., rejected the government’s argument that the State Department should be allowed to act on Mr. Trump’s order and ignore pending applications from countries that had been included on the list, given that existing laws allow people to get visas through the lottery program.

In her opinion, Judge Sooknanan cited a precedent set by the Supreme Court last year that prohibits federal agencies from relying on their own interpretations of the law to make policy, adding that the State Department had done so in this case.

She wrote that the administration had cited “longstanding practice” in seeking to deny visas to people barred by presidential action, but that doing so represented “turning away from the text of any statute.”

Judge Sooknanan noted severe limitations on the court’s authority that she said could result in the individuals ultimately being turned away from the country despite her order.

Out of the 84 individuals involved, she wrote that two had already seen their visas formally denied. She concluded that she was unable to direct the State Department to reverse those decisions.

Furthermore, she noted that even though she could require the Trump administration to process the visa applications before Sept. 30, the individuals affected by the president’s order could still be denied admission to the country at a port of entry for any number of other reasons, with little recourse.

In an accompanying order, Judge Sooknanan directed the State Department to “expeditiously process” and approve the remaining 82 applications. But she stressed in her opinion that the ban had upended the lives of those in what she described as the inauspicious position of winning the lottery amid Mr. Trump’s presidency — an opportunity that many people never have despite applying every year for decades.

“Defendants miss the gravity of what the plaintiffs stand to lose,” Judge Sooknanan wrote. “The plaintiffs literally won the lottery; they were randomly selected from millions of people around the world hoping for one of a handful of visas that could give them a chance to immigrate to the United States.”

“It may well be that, because of circumstances outside of their control, they will ultimately be unable to enter the United States even if they get a visa,” she added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/21/multimedia/21dc-visas-pkvt/21dc-visas-pkvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:23.655840

“I don’t think that we have done everything in our ability to keep communities safe,” said state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma. “Certainly, I don’t think we’ve done enough with Department of Corrections information sharing.”

The state agency can ask for and collect information about inmates’ immigration status and country of origin to share with embassies, spokesperson Christopher Wright said. Prison staff don’t confirm this information. And incarcerated Washingtonians aren’t required to provide it.

The Department of Corrections sends a weekly report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement listing the names of everyone newly admitted to the state’s prisons, regardless of immigration status. ICE compares those names to its list of people who they believe should be deported.

Agents can then share detainer requests with the Department of Corrections, allowing the prison system to let immigration authorities know when people will be released and coordinate transferring custody to ICE.

Corrections doesn’t hold people beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up, Wright noted. And the agency doesn’t allow agents to interview incarcerated people on their immigration status while in prison, unless the person consents.

Despite the information sharing between the department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the number of people federal immigration authorities detain after their release from Washington prisons has been dropping for years, state data shows.

Of the 61 prisoners wanted by immigration authorities who have been released this year, ICE has picked up 51 of them, the highest rate in the past decade. In 2024, immigration agents detained 101 of 128 of those leaving prison.

The number of prisoners exiting with ICE detainers has dropped over the past decade from more than 300 in 2015. This mirrors a declining prison population in general, Wright said.

The more than 500 prisoners still in custody with ICE detainers have mostly been convicted of violent offenses. More than one-third are serving time for murder convictions, and more than one-quarter are in prison on rape charges, according to state data.

ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t provide comment.

‘Why do we do this?’

In a letter to Ferguson in June, around four dozen state lawmakers, as well as city and county council members from western Washington, called for a second look at the Department of Corrections’ role under the law.

Mena, who spearheaded the letter, met with top aides from Ferguson’s office about the concerns. She said they were receptive to changing prison policy. She’s now figuring out ways the Department of Corrections is sharing information that isn’t required by federal law that Ferguson could address through executive action, instead of through new legislation.

For example, she says prison staff don’t need to ask prisoners about citizenship status. She also wants Corrections to stop volunteering the lists of people newly admitted into prison.

“I want to have a deeper conversation about, why do we voluntarily share that list, as opposed to letting the Department of Homeland Security specifically request information about certain folks?” Mena said. “That is truly not required. That’s my biggest question mark is, why do we do this?”

Some worry changing the law could make it vulnerable to legal challenges.

In a February press conference, Ferguson noted advocates’ concerns about the state prisons’ continued cooperation with immigration authorities, but said he wouldn’t make changes.

Ferguson’s position hasn’t changed.

“We’re always happy to have a conversation about anything that the state’s doing,” he said in an interview Thursday. “But I think the Legislature in 2019, when they passed the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act, struck a good balance. They carved out an exception for the Department of Corrections in a thoughtful way and the Department of Corrections is acting in a way that’s totally consistent with the Keep Washington Working Act.”

Similar to Ferguson, state Attorney General Nick Brown said he doesn’t “see any reason right now to change the law” on Corrections’ information sharing with ICE.

“We want to make sure that we’re continuing to protect people in Washington from people who have committed crimes or have a risk of danger moving forward,” he said in an interview this week.

Wright, from the Department of Corrections, also said the agency has “no intention” of changing its policy.

Meanwhile, Mena said President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has created more urgency around the issue.

She has been leading the charge on this in part because of one of her constituents, Ngoc Phan, whose husband had finished a 25-year sentence for murder and assault when ICE detained him.

Tuan Thanh Phan was a lawful permanent resident from Vietnam before his conviction. He was in limbo for weeks in the African country of Djibouti as advocates fought in court the Trump administration’s move to deport immigrants to so-called third countries. These are places where the deportee has no ties.

Ferguson denied a pardon request for Phan, to the disappointment of Mena, other lawmakers and advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court in early July cleared the way for the final deportation of Phan and seven others to South Sudan in the headline-grabbing case.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-ICE-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:57:46.709081

As of June, the number living in the U.S. had dropped to 51.9 million.
Roughly 19% of workers were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier, according to Pew.
Higbie predicts the decline in immigration won’t last long, particularly if prices on goods rise amid labor shortages.","For the first time in more than half a century, immigrants leaving the U.S. outnumber those arriving, a phenomenon that may signal President Trump’s historic mass deportation efforts are having the intended effect.

An analysis of census data released by Pew Research Center on Thursday noted that between January and June, the United States’ foreign-born population had declined by more than a million people.

Millions of people arrived at the border between 2021 and 2023 seeking refuge in America after the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, which ravaged many of their home countries. In 2023, California was home to 11.3 million immigrants, roughly 28.4% of the national total, according to Pew.

In January, 53.3 million immigrants lived in the U.S., the highest number recorded, but in the months that followed, those who left or were deported surpassed those arriving — the first drop since the 1960s. As of June, the number living in the U.S. had dropped to 51.9 million. Pew did not calculate how many immigrants are undocumented.

Trump and his supporters have applauded the exodus, with the president declaring “Promises Made. Promises Kept,” in a social media post this month.

“Seven months into his second term, it’s clear that the president has done what he said he’d do by reestablishing law and order at our southern border and by removing violent illegal immigrants from our nation,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a USA Today column on Thursday. “Both actions were necessary for Americans’ peace and prosperity.”

But some experts caution that such declines will have negative economic effects on the United States if they continue, resulting in labor shortages as America’s birth rate continues to drop.

“Looking ahead in the future, we’re going to have to rely on immigrant workers to fulfill a lot of the jobs in this country,” said Victor Narro, project director at UCLA Labor Center. “Like it or not, the demographics are going to be changing in this country. It’s already changing, but it’s going to be more pronounced in the future, especially with the decline in native-born workers.”

The Pew analysis highlights several policy changes that have affected the number of immigrants in the country, beginning during then-President Biden’s term.

In June 2024, Biden signed a proclamation that bars migrants from seeking asylum along the U.S. border with Mexico at times when crossings are high, a change that was designed to make it harder for those who enter the country without prior authorization.

Trump, who campaigned on hard-line immigration policies, signed an executive order on the first day of his second term, declaring an “invasion” at the southern border. The move severely restricted entry into the country by barring people who arrive between ports of entry from seeking asylum or invoking other protections that would allow them to temporarily remain in the U.S.

Widespread immigration enforcement operations across Southern California began in June, prompting pushback from advocates and local leaders. The federal government responded by deploying thousands of Marines and National Guard troops to L.A. after the raids sparked scattered protests.

Homeland Security agents have arrested 4,481 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6, the agency said this month.

Narro said the decrease in immigrants outlined in the study may not be as severe as the numbers suggest because of a reduction in response rates amid heightened enforcement.

“When you have the climate that you have today with fear of deportation, being arrested or detained by ICE — all the stuff that’s coming out of the Trump administration — people are going to be less willing to participate in the survey and documentation that goes into these reports,” Narro said.

Michael Capuano, research director at Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit that advocates for a reduction in immigration, said the numbers are trending in the right direction.

“We see it as a positive start,” Capuano said. “Obviously enforcement at the border is now working. The population is beginning to decrease. We’d like to see that trend continue because, ultimately, we think the policy of the last four years has been proven to be unsustainable.”

Capuano disagrees that the decrease in immigrants will cause problems for the country’s workforce.

“We don’t believe that ultimately there’s going to be this huge disruption,” he said. “There is no field that Americans won’t work in. Pew notes in its own study that American-born workers are the majority in every job field.”

In 2023, the last year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were part of the country’s workforce, including about 10 million undocumented individuals. Roughly 19% of workers were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier, according to Pew.

“Immigrants are a huge part of American society,” said Toby Higbie, a professor of history and labor studies at UCLA. “Those who are running the federal government right now imagine that they can remove all immigrants from this society, but it’s just not going to happen. It’s not going to happen because the children of immigrants will fight against it and because our country needs immigrant workers to make the economy work.”

The United States experienced a negative net immigration in the 1930s during the Great Depression when at least 400,000 Mexicans and Mexican Americans left the country, often as a result of government pressure and repatriation programs. Not long after, the U.S. implemented the bracero program in 1942 in which the U.S. allowed millions of Mexican citizens to work in the country to address labor shortages during World War II.

Higbie predicts the decline in immigration won’t last long, particularly if prices on goods rise amid labor shortages.

“You could say that there’s a cycle here where we invite immigrants to work in our economy, and then there’s a political reaction by some in our country, and they kick them out, and then we invite them back,” he said. “I suspect that the Trump administration, after going through this process of brutally deporting people, will turn around and propose a guest worker program in order to maintain a docile immigrant workforce.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c352238/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2Fbf%2F5e670a1b4c0084b7e33b81707df5%2F1517913-me-groups-protest-immigration-raids-03-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 07:56:30.015582

The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind.","LOS ANGELES — Aurora was working as a nurse at a hospital in her home country of Honduras when she decided to leave for good. A mother of two, she yearned for a better future for herself and her young daughters. So in 1990, she went in search of that, making the journey through Mexico into the United States.

She eventually found work in Los Angeles, taking care of older adults in their homes. She bathes, feeds and changes them and sometimes takes them places, like the beauty salon. She often stays with the same clients for years, through good health and bad and, in some cases, until death.

For a while, she did this work without legal status. But then, in late 1998, Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. granted temporary protected status (TPS) to Hondurans, citing the environmental disaster the hurricane had wrought.

For the first time, Aurora had government permission to live and work in the United States.

""I felt protected,"" she says in Spanish. NPR agreed not to use Aurora's last name because she now fears being targeted by immigration authorities.

TPS for Hondurans was renewed multiple times over the years. But this year, the Trump administration decided to terminate it, effective Sept. 8.

""Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement in July. ""It is clear that the Government of Honduras has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch, almost 27 years ago. Honduran citizens can safely return home.""

The decision is being challenged in court. But on Wednesday, a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling, paving the way for the Trump administration to terminate TPS for Hondurans while litigation continues.

With Sept. 8 quickly approaching, Aurora faces a future of uncertainty.

""We don't know what will happen,"" she says. ""We don't know anything.""

An end to immigration programs designed to provide temporary refuge

Since returning to office, President Trump has ended a number of programs granting immigrants refuge from unsafe conditions back home, citing national security concerns.

""For decades, TPS has been abused as a de facto amnesty program to allow unvetted aliens to remain in the U.S. indefinitely,"" Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement to NPR. ""Too often, these programs have been exploited to allow criminal aliens to come to our country and terrorize American citizens.""

McLaughlin's statement included photos of Hondurans with TPS who've been convicted of crimes in the U.S., including aggravated assault and a sex offense against a child.

Aurora, who has spent most of her adult life in Los Angeles, wants to convey a different message about the roughly 72,000 Hondurans granted TPS over the years, as well as those from other countries.

""Not all immigrants are criminals,"" she says. ""We are hardworking people earning an honest living.""

Few opportunities to gain permanent status

Like so many other noncitizens in the U.S., Aurora wishes she could become a permanent resident or even a citizen. Her union, Service Employees International Union Local 2015, representing roughly half a million long-term care workers in California, has been pushing lawmakers to create a path to citizenship for people like her.

""They give so much. I think they're deserving of us being able to find a system that works for them,"" says SEIU Local 2015 President Arnulfo De La Cruz.

De La Cruz notes that caregivers represented by the union serve California's lowest-income older adults and people with disabilities — those who qualify for government-funded care.

The union does not track the immigration status of its members, but the long-term care sector relies heavily on immigrants. In a 2023 report, the California Health Care Foundation estimated that close to half of California's direct care workforce — those caring for older adults or disabled people in their homes or in facilities — are immigrants. With a rapidly aging population, California could face a shortage of between 600,000 and 3.2 million care workers by 2030, the report says.

Before the termination of TPS for many immigrants, ""we were already in a huge care shortage,"" says De La Cruz. ""There's not enough caregivers to be matched with people who need care.""

De La Cruz has heard the argument that immigrants should get in line and wait their turn. He says that it's not that simple.

""It's not an application that you fill out and you get processed,"" he says, adding that the few pathways that do exist, including through marriage to a U.S. citizen or political asylum, are difficult given the requirements.

De La Cruz is struck recalling that just a few years ago, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, care workers were recognized as essential, even heralded as heroes. The country could not do without them. And now, for at least some of them, the message is: Go home. ""To go from that to this … I think, is creating an enormous amount of stress,"" he says.

Elevated anxiety for the care workforce

Roberto Oronia is feeling that stress, even though he is a U.S. citizen, born in Los Angeles.

""This has infected everybody,"" he says. ""I say infected. It's not affected. It has infected the psyche.""

Oronia works as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home in the San Fernando Valley, alongside a lot of immigrants who, like him, have family members, friends and co-workers who fear getting caught up in Trump's immigration enforcement.

The sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer remain fresh on everyone's mind. Reports that officers have been detaining people based on their appearance and that legal U.S. residents have been among those arrested have stoked fear that no person of color is safe, Oronia says.

""What's it matter whether I'm born here?"" he says. ""It's just a matter of your skin color and your last name.""

Oronia worries that the anxiety he and other care workers are experiencing could have consequences for the people under their watch.

""When anxiety's elevated, people are nervous, people are stressed, their minds are on other things,"" he says. ""Accidents happen.""

Aurora does not want to return to Honduras. Although nearly three decades have passed since Hurricane Mitch, she says her home country is still dangerous, wracked by tremendous poverty, gangs and corruption.

But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years.
“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.

For him and others from impoverished countries across Central Asia who seek better lives in Russia, such hostility is woven into everyday life. Sometimes it bursts into outright violence.

“Mostly you notice it when you go to the hospital, a clinic, a government office: You stand in line and everyone shoots you dirty looks,” said the man, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions.

Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, over 20% of Russian businesses said they were hindered by a lack of workers, according to the Central Bank.

But rather than welcoming laborers, Russian officials are fomenting anti-migrant sentiment and increasing restrictions on immigrants, which the government says number 6.1 million, but is probably higher. The government is tracking their movement, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children’s rights to education.

The continued crackdown comes as a trial began this month for four Tajik nationals who are accused of the shooting and arson attack at a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 149 people. The four were arrested within hours of the attack and appeared in court with signs of being severely beaten. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility but Russia sought to blame Ukraine for the bloodshed.

Anti-migrant rhetoric had been growing in Russia since the early 2020s. But the massacre in particular launched a wave of “terrible violence” against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years. In the eight days after the killings, she received 700 reports of injuries to immigrants, including “faces smashed against the doors of police stations,” she said.

Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin captured the public mood after the massacre, saying ""migration control is extremely important” to ensure foreign nationals carrying out “illegal activity” could be deported without a court order.

The violence drew concern from human rights groups.

“Central Asian migrants seeking work in Russia due to dire economic conditions in their countries of origin today face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and other harassment by police in Russia,” Human Rights Watch said in a report on the anniversary of the attack.

“The heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,” said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.

While some violence has subsided, it hasn't disappeared. In April, police raided a Kyrgyz-run bathhouse in Moscow with video showing masked men forcing half-naked bathers to crawl across the floor and deliberately stepping on them before covering the lens of a security camera.

Police also reportedly rounded up immigrants in raids on warehouses, construction sites and mosques, then coerced them into joining the military to fight in Ukraine. Some are threatened with having their residency documents withheld, while others are recently naturalized citizens who failed to register for military service. In such cases, serving in the military is presented as the only alternative to prison or deportation. For others, a fast track to Russian citizenship is offered as an incentive for enlisting.

Speaking in St. Petersburg in May, Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, said “20,000 ‘young’ citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan (and) Kyrgyzstan” were serving in Ukraine.

Those immigrants who have avoided violence still are subject to new anti-migrant laws. Much of this is targeted specifically toward immigrants from Central Asia.

In 2024, 13 Russian regions banned immigrants from certain jobs, including in hospitality, catering and finance, and even as taxi drivers. A pilot program starting in September in the Moscow region requires migrants who enter Russia without a visa to be tracked via an app. Those failing to comply are added to a police watchlist, impeding access to services like banking, and subjecting them to a possible cutoff of cellphone and internet connectivity.

A nationwide law banned children of immigrants from attending school unless they could prove they could speak Russian. Less than six weeks after the law came into force, officials told local media that only 19% of children who applied for the language test were able to take it, and the most common reason for rejection was incomplete or inaccurate documents.

Another man from Uzbekistan who has worked in Russia for almost two decades and lives in St. Petersburg said he's had to wait in line for over seven hours to get needed residency documents. The man, who also spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, hopes to stay in Russia but says the climate for immigrants has worsened.

“It’s hard to get paperwork,” he said. “There just isn’t the time.”

The oppressive laws sometimes force immigrants to resort to paying bribes. Chupik, the lawyer, believes that Russia’s system results in “violations that cannot be avoided.”

“This is exactly what this mass regulation is striving for: not for all migrants to be here legally, but for everyone to be illegal,” she said. “That way, they can extract bribes from anyone at any moment and deport anyone who resists.”

Anti-migrant sentiment is unlikely to diminish anytime soon, mostly because it's encouraged by authorities like the Investigative Committee's Bastrykin, who said immigrants “physically occupy our territory, not just with their ideology but with specific buildings” — referring to sites such as mosques.

Ultra-nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky said immigrant workers “behave aggressively, causing conflicts and potentially dangerous situations.”

Migrants are an easy scapegoat for many social ills, and not just in Russia, said Caress Schenk, an associate professor of political science at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan.

“Closing borders, conducting migrant raids and tightening policies are all tools that are easy go-tos for politicians the world over,” she said. “It goes in cycles that are sensitive to geopolitical pressures, as we’re seeing now, but also things like election campaigns and domestic political rivalries.”

A surge of “anti-migrant propaganda” has dwarfed previous rhetoric of recent years, according to the Moscow-based Uzbek immigrant who was ignored by the bank teller.

“If every person paying attention to the TV, the radio, the internet is only told that migrants are ‘bad, bad, bad,’ if they only show bad places and bad people, of course, that’s what people are going to think,” he said.

Such anti-migrant rhetoric has become part of the nationalist narrative from President Vladimir Putin and others used to justify the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — that Russia is under constant threat.

“Russia has started lumping together all of ‘the external enemies’ that it’s created over the years for itself: the migrants, the Ukrainians, the West,” said Tajik journalist Sher Khashimov, who focuses on migration, identity and social issues. “It all becomes this part of this single narrative of Russia being this castle under siege, and Putin being the only person who is on the lookout for ordinary Russians.”

The Uzbek immigrant in Moscow said Russia has created conditions “supposedly to help people, to help migrants.”

“But the rules do not work,' he added. ”Special barriers are created that migrants cannot pass through on their own.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/24903b25-f6c8-457c-96cb-88b60452e2b1/wirestory_3fb300676f1855bc13e20bd7780534ea_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-22 07:56:34.123852

FFLA rules prohibit grant recipients from suing the state, potentially jeopardizing AIJ's funding.

Gov. Ron DeSantis' former top lawyer is raising questions about an immigrants' advocacy group that's suing the state over its immigration enforcement law.

And one end result could be that the group loses a pot of money it gets to serve low-income clients.

Joe Jacquot, who was DeSantis' first general counsel in 2019–20, is a board member of Funding Florida Legal Aid (FFLA), the group that administers grants to legal aid organizations. He's now a shareholder in the Gunster law firm.

In May he sent an email to FFLA executive director Donny MacKenzie, highlighting groups that received funding from FFLA and that were involved in the lawsuit against the state.

FFLA’s rules prohibit groups receiving grants from suing the state.

Jacquot raised concerns about a host ""of pure policy/political organizations suing the State of Florida"" that receive legal aid money, ""which raises a concern on our objective standards,"" he wrote.

The USA TODAY NETWORK–Florida Capital Bureau obtained the emails between Jacquot and MacKenzie, as well as MacKenzie's letters to legal aid groups, through a public records request.

State bar foundations or other entities collect interest from lawyers' pooled trust accounts and use it to fund legal aid services and access-to-justice initiatives for low-income individuals. Clients can include hurricane victims, children in foster care, as well as veterans, the elderly and disabled folks seeking to obtain benefits.

In Florida, it's called the Interest on Trust Accounts (IOTA) program, referring to the bank accounts used to hold client funds separately from a lawyer’s own money.

MacKenzie emailed Jacquot back to say he’d look into the situation, and eventually focused on Americans for Immigrant Justice (AIJ), one of the groups suing over a law (SB 4C) passed by the Legislature in February and signed by the governor.

Florida responds to Trump on need to boost immigration enforcement

The law was the result of a push by DeSantis to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s surge of immigration enforcement measures upon taking office Jan. 20. Legislative leaders initially rebuffed him and passed their own bill, which he vetoed as too weak.

The sides eventually reached a compromise; the new law made entering the state as an illegal immigrant a state felony, and empowered state and local law enforcement to detain suspected illegal immigrants.

A federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the law in April, saying it likely violated the U.S. Constitution by assuming powers related to immigration that only fall within the federal government’s authority. The state is appealing the ruling.

In a letter to AIJ executive director Sui Chung on June 4, MacKenzie warned the group could be in violation of FFLA’s rules and asked for an independent audit to be completed to show whether any IOTA funds were used on the lawsuit.

“The auditor’s report should clearly state what source(s) of funding were used in connection with the (lawsuit) or any similar litigation or activity that may be prohibited under FFLA’s funding requirements,” MacKenzie wrote.

If IOTA funds were used on the lawsuit, AIJ could lose funding. If not, they would still be eligible for FFLA grants.

Lawyer trust fund interest money scrutinized by lawmakers

But it’s unclear whether the audit, due by Aug. 4, was completed or what consequences resulted. MacKenzie didn’t respond to calls or emails for comment. Nor did Chung or anyone at AIJ. And Jacquot did not respond to emailed questions.

IOTA funds have been scrutinized by lawmakers in recent years after the Florida Supreme Court issued a change in the rule governing them that required banks to charge a higher rate. The rule was passed in 2023, at the same time the Federal Reserve was raising the benchmark interest rate to slow skyrocketing inflation.

That produced a large spike in IOTA funds and therefore the money given to legal aid groups. In the 2021–22 fiscal year FFLA collected $9.4 million. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, FFLA collected $260.4 million.

The grants AIJ received reflect that trend. The group received $36,470 in IOTA funds from FFLA in 2022, and $4.7 million in 2024.

Bills to lower the interest rate paid on IOTA accounts have advanced in the Senate in the last two years but have failed to gain traction in the House.","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/28/PTAL/77998181007-gi-zda-oswea-awz-qx.jpg?crop=1079,607,x0,y236&width=1079&height=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-22 06:56:17.406769

August 21, 2025

WASHINGTON — An appeals court late Wednesday said it will allow the Trump administration, for now, to move forward with ending temporary protections for 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.

It means that Nepali immigrants with Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, will lose their legal status – including work permits and deportation protections – immediately. Honduran and Nicaraguan holders will lose their status by Sept. 8.

The judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — Michael Daly Hawkins, Consuelo M. Callahan and Eric D. Miller — did not give a reason for their decision. Former President Bill Clinton nominated Hawkins, former President George W. Bush nominated Callahan and President Donald Trump nominated Miller in his first term.

Wednesday’s decision pauses a late July ruling from California District Judge Trina Thompson that found Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to end deportation protections for those nationals to be rooted in racism.

Instead, Thompson extended TPS for nationals from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua until Nov. 18 while the case proceeded through the courts.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek,” Thompson wrote in her 37-page ruling. “Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.”

As the Trump administration aims to carry out its plans of mass deportation of immigrants in the country without legal authorization, DHS has also moved to end the temporary legal status many immigrants have held.

Noem has acted to halt TPS for nationals from Haiti and Venezuela and end humanitarian protections for those from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Supreme Court has allowed, for now, many of those moves by the Trump administration.

DHS praises decision

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement called the decision from the appeals court a victory for the Trump administration.

“TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades while allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country without proper vetting,” McLaughlin said. “This unanimous decision will help restore integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe.”

Certain nationals are granted TPS because their home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to war, disaster or other unstable conditions.

Immigrants who are granted TPS go through vetting by DHS, including a background check, and have to re-apply roughly every 18 months to keep work permits and have deportation protections. A misdemeanor could result in the loss of TPS status for an immigrant.

‘Fear and uncertainty’

“I am heartbroken by the court’s decision,” Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal who is a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement.

“I’ve lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty,” Lama continued.

Many immigrants are on TPS for lengthy periods due to their home country’s condition. Those from Nepal had TPS for more than 10 years and those nationals from Honduras and Nicaragua were on TPS for more than 26 years, attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union, which is one of the groups that filed the suit, said.

“This administration’s attack on TPS is part of a concerted campaign to deprive noncitizens of any legal status,” Emi MacLean, an attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California said in a statement. “(Wednesday’s) ruling is a devastating setback, but it is not the end of this fight. Humanitarian protection–TPS–means something and cannot be decimated so easily.”

Organizations that filed the suit include the ACLU Foundations of Northern California and Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law and the Haitian Bridge Alliance.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ice-immigration-border-adobestock_1234297462_editorial_use_only-by-photogranary.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 06:56:21.616127

Williams landed a legal blow to the Trump administration Thursday night in a ruling on Alligator Alcatraz, banning site expansion and new detainees at the immigration detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.

The judge is giving the administration 60 days, ""once the population attrition allows for implementation of this order,"" to remove the fencing, gas, sewage, lighting, generators and ""waste receptacles that were installed to support this project.""

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) via email for additional comment Thursday night.

Why It Matters

The detention center is a focal point of President Donald Trump's second-term immigration platform. Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials have touted the facility—built by repurposing the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida—as representing the White House's hard-line stance on immigration enforcement and border security.

Critics—who include Democrats, civil rights groups and environmentalists—have said detainees at the facility are forced to endure unsafe, unsanitary and inhumane living conditions and that Alligator Alcatraz runs afoul of environmental laws.

The center was quickly created and holds an estimated 1,000 beds. The bunk beds are stacked together in wire-fenced cages. Alligator Alcatraz is expected to cost Florida about $450 million annually to operate.

What To Know

The judge's order comes on the heels of lawsuits challenging the facility's potential damage to the environment on the protected Florida Everglades.

The Miccosukee Tribe of Native Americans brought a lawsuit, with environmental groups, based on their ties to the land and potential disruptions to water and food supply, according to the court ruling reviewed by Newsweek.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dismissed worries about the environmental effects of the facility.

The judge, in her ruling, prohibited ""bringing any additional persons onto the … site who were not already being detained.""

The ruling also prohibits the installation of ""industrial-style"" lighting, paving, filling, excavating, fencing or any other site expansion, including new building tents or dormitories. The order does not prohibit modifications or repairs to existing facilities for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental and other risks.

The state of Florida, which is partnering with the federal government to build the facility, filed a notice of appeal on Thursday night, shortly after the ruling was issued.

The facility has faced other legal challenges.

This week, a federal judge in Miami has dismissed part of a lawsuit brought by immigrant advocates challenging detainees' access to legal processes, handing state and federal officials a partial win.

Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.

What People Are Saying

Judge Kathleen M. Williams, referring to more than 75 years of efforts to preserve the Everglades, wrote in her ruling: ""Every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades. This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements designed to fulfil those promises.""

Eve Samples, the executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said of the ruling: ""It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government—and there are consequences for ignoring them.""

What Happens Next

The judge said she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed.

In a written answer to a question posed by the Associated Press, the department said that all U.S. visa holders are subject to “continuous vetting” with an eye toward any indication that they could be ineligible for the document.

Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked and, if the visa holder is in the United States, he or she would be subject to deportation.

The department said it was looking for indicators of ineligibility, including visa overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization.

“We review all available information as part of our vetting, including law enforcement or immigration records or any other information that comes to light after visa issuance indicating a potential ineligibility,” the department said.

Since President Trump took office in January, his administration has thus far focused on deporting migrants illegally in the United States as well as holders of student and visitor exchange visas. The State Department’s new language suggests that the re-vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread.

The administration has steadily imposed more and more restrictions and requirements on visa applicants, including requiring all visa seekers to submit to in-person interviews.

But the review of all visa holders appears to be a significant expansion of what had initially been a re-vetting process focused mainly on students who have been involved in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activity.

Officials say the reviews will include all the visa holders’ social media accounts, law enforcement and immigration records in their home countries, along with any actionable violations of U.S. law committed while they were in the United States.

“As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to protect U.S. national security and public safety, since Inauguration Day the State Department has revoked more than twice as many visas, including nearly four times as many student visas, as during the same time period last year,” the department said.

Earlier this week, the department said that since Trump returned to the White House, it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and violations of local, state and federal law, the vast majority of which were assault, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and support for terrorism.

It said that about 4,000 of those 6,000 were due to actual infractions of laws and that approximately 200–300 visas were revoked for terrorism-related issues, including providing support for designated terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c9e6f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1994x1047+0+143/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F72%2Fbdc2b905435aae0c51ddca20affd%2Fe5a088dc6b8a4fc5b32aca63259ab9b2.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 06:56:14.483211

Federal agents and protestors pushed toward the members of Congress, “destabilizing the group,” McIver’s filings say.
McIver’s filings say an agent “forcefully shoved her backwards” as she returned inside the secured area following Baraka’s arrest.","New court filings from U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, who wants a judge to dismiss a federal indictment against her, allege the charging document excludes key details of what happened at a Newark migrant jail on the day prosecutors claim McIver attacked federal officers.

The indictment, which hit McIver (D-10) with three charges of assaulting or impeding federal agents trying to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on May 9, leaves out that Baraka had left the facility when ordered, overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and obscures that McIver’s actions were part of her federally authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman, the filings say.

Moreover, McIver’s legal team says, footage from federal officers’ body-worn cameras confirms her version of events. McIver has cited the video footage in court filings, but it has yet to be made public.

“The indictment is skeletal, exaggerated, omits context, and the video evidence squarely contradicts much of it,” one of them says.

McIver was at the migrant jail, called Delaney Hall, along with two Democratic colleagues, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman. Baraka, a Democrat who at the time was running for governor, had already visited the jail that week to claim that the building’s owner began housing immigrants there before city inspectors had deemed it safe to open.

The indictment alleges that when a security gate separating the Delaney Hall property from the driveway leading to it opened to let a vehicle through, the three representatives “moved quickly inside to the secured area before the gate closed” and then proceeded to an interior reception area.

McIver’s filings say the three identified themselves as members of Congress, explained they were there to “conduct congressionally authorized oversight,” and were told to remain in a secured area for about an hour. During this time, she alleges, ICE was “mobilizing its forces,” with high-level federal officials reporting to the facility, munitions-filled vehicles taking formation in the parking lot, and about 15 armed agents assembling inside the gates.

The indictment alleges this is when Baraka arrived with his security detail, told the guard at the gate that he was part of the congressional entourage, was denied entry at first, and then was “allowed to enter” the property. The guard was concerned about Baraka’s safety “amidst the crowd of protestors” outside the gate, the indictment says.

McIver’s filings say after Baraka arrived, the mayor spoke to the gate guard, who after 10 minutes then spoke to someone on his radio. After that, the guard “invited the mayor and his security detail” onto the property, her filings say.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent approached Baraka, according to the indictment, and ordered him to leave, spending about five minutes issuing “multiple warnings” that he would be arrested if he did not depart.

McIver’s filings cite video footage to say Baraka had been “standing peacefully and quietly” inside the gate for about 40 minutes when a team of agents approached him and told him to leave. Baraka said he had been invited in, was waiting for the Congress members to exit, but was “fine” to leave. He turned to walk out, and McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman then “approached the circle of agents” who were confronting Baraka.

The indictment alleges that the homeland security agent said he was going to arrest Baraka, to which McIver said, “Hell, no! Hell, no!” As the agent ordered Baraka to place his hands behind his back to be handcuffed, the indictment says, McIver and the other Congress members “surrounded” Baraka and prevented agents from handcuffing and arresting him as the mayor’s security detail escorted him off the property.

McIver’s filings say the agent’s call to arrest Baraka came after the mayor had turned to exit the jail’s property. It cites video footage that claims to show an unidentified man — “not Congresswoman McIver” — moving between the agent and Baraka. Then, McIver’s filings say, the agent allowed Baraka to leave the property.

“Alright . . . walk out,” they claim the agent said to the mayor.

McIver’s filings say federal agents then led the members of Congress toward Delaney Hall “as if they were finally going to permit the Members’ inspection.” Instead, the agent who had moments earlier said he was going to arrest Baraka took a phone call, then again said he would arrest the mayor.

“Even though he stepped out, I am going to put him in cuffs . . . per the deputy attorney general of the United States,” the agent said, according to McIver’s filings.

This is the first allegation that the order to arrest Baraka came from high-level officials with the Trump administration, and not from agents at Delaney Hall.

It’s at this moment, both sides agree, that chaos erupted.

Now outside the gate, federal agents again attempted to handcuff Baraka, according to the indictment, which says McIver “hurried” toward the agents as others yelled to “circle the mayor.” Once she was near Baraka, the indictment claims, she “slammed her forearm into the body of” one of the agents, reached out, and “tried to restrain” him by “forcibly grabbing him.”

According to McIver, when she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman saw Baraka getting arrested, they moved to the public side of the gate along with a phalanx of heavily armed and masked federal agents. She claims an unidentified man yelled out for others to “circle the mayor,” and the members of Congress and others did just that. Federal agents and protestors pushed toward the members of Congress, “destabilizing the group,” McIver’s filings say.

“The members repeatedly asserted their federal status and instructed the agents not to touch them,” one says. “Agents nevertheless pressed in on the members as the crowd formed more tightly around them.”

The indictment claims that after Baraka was arrested, McIver used “each of her forearms to forcibly strike” an agent.

McIver’s filings say video shows any contact between McIver and agents happened after an ICE agent shoved a man from behind, forcing him into the members of Congress and “sending a torrent of jostling through the crowd.” McIver’s actions were a defensive reaction to that force, her lawyers say.

McIver’s filings say an agent “forcefully shoved her backwards” as she returned inside the secured area following Baraka’s arrest. She said that force was “so egregious” she immediately said she wanted to file a complaint.

After the mayor was taken into custody, the scene calmed down, and the three House members were finally given their tour of Delaney Hall, McIver’s filing states.

The Department of Homeland Security soon after this episode posted some video footage of the scuffle on social media, slowed down to highlight McIver’s actions. McIver in her new filings says these social media posts harm her ability to have a fair trial.

“Congresswoman McIver’s contact with agents was a reactive, proportional response to what the government has apparently conceded to be a baseless, pretextual and clearly unlawful arrest in chaotic circumstances that federal agents themselves instigated,” her attorneys wrote.

Federal prosecutors dropped the trespassing charge against Baraka just days after his arrest, leading to a rebuke from the judge overseeing the case. Baraka is suing the federal government for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' injunction formalized a temporary halt she had ordered two weeks ago as witnesses continued to testify in a multiday hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case.

The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal Thursday night, shortly after the ruling was issued.

""The deportations will continue until morale improves,"" DeSantis spokesman Alex Lanfranconi said in response to the judge's ruling.

The judge said she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property. The order does not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities, ""which are solely for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site.,""

The preliminary injunction includes ""those who are in active concert or participation with"" the state of Florida or federal defendants or their officers, agents, employees,"" the judge wrote in an 82-page order.

The judge said state officials never sufficiently explained why the facility needed to be in the middle of the Florida Everglades. ""What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention camp, the State did not consider alternative locations,"" Williams said.

Judge cites decades-long efforts to preserve Everglades

Williams said her order gave the state and federal defendants time to wind down the facility so that it can undergo the required environmental assessments. She noted the three-quarters century of efforts to preserve the Everglades.

""Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,"" she wrote. ""This order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.""

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars' worth of environmental restoration.

Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, called the ruling a landmark victory for the Everglades and Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected.

""It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them,"" Samples said in a statement.

Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said this isn't the first time the tribe has has to fight for its land and rights.

""We will always stand up for our culture, our sovereignty, and for the Everglades,"" Cypress said in a statement.

Attorneys for the state and federal defendants didn't immediately respond to emailed inquiries late Thursday. But they have previously argued that, although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility was entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the federal environmental law didn't apply.

The judge has said the detention facility was, at a minimum, a joint partnership between the state and federal government.

Hasty construction of detention center

The detention center was quickly built almost two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport in the middle of the Everglades. It currently holds several hundred detainees but was designed to eventually hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures.

Inside the compound's large white tents, rows of bunkbeds are surrounded by chain-link cages. People held there say worms turn up in the food, toilets don't flush and flood floors with fecal waste, while mosquitoes and other insects are everywhere. At times the air conditioners abruptly shut off in the sweltering heat. Detainees are said to go days without showering or getting prescription medicine, and can only speak to lawyers and loved ones by phone.

Witnesses for the environmental groups testified during the hearing that at least 20 acres (8 hectares) of asphalt had been added to the site since the Florida Division of Emergency Management began construction. They said additional paving could lead to an increase in water runoff to the adjacent wetlands, spread harmful chemicals into the Everglades and reduce the habitat for endangered Florida panthers.

Attorneys for federal and state agencies have asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Williams ruled Thursday that her court was the proper venue.

Another federal judge in Miami dismissed part of a lawsuit earlier this week that claimed detainees were denied access to the legal system at the immigration detention center and then moved the remaining counts of the case to another court.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5730x3223+0+298/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Ff5%2Faa33f9e64e5db6bf922eb6108bf7%2Fap25234061775212.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 01:56:33.178438

It’s a so-called soft, and to date, generally a bloodless war — only about 150 years since the truly bloody first American Civil War of 1861-1865 ended.

To win his second term, Donald Trump promised to end of the Ukraine War on Day One, to lower grocery and gas prices right away, to stop inflation and to carry out retribution. Now, the picture is more clear, more cruel, more likely than not that we are racing towards a complete destruction of the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution.

Opposition political parties, the free press and vocal community leaders have not been rounded up under mass arrest — yet. It may be around the corner. I’m hoping not. But already, highly qualified and capable women and minority top military leaders were the first to go. The retribution will keep ratcheting up.

Today I don’t want to expound on predictions about the downward spiral and probable end of the Great American experiment in democracy, one that has lasted almost 250 years as the global standard. I see that we have almost completely lost the checks and balances of our form of government. It is barely limping toward its semi- quincentennial birthday unless that trajectory is stopped and reversed by a people power –People United Revolt (again, hopefully peaceful and bloodless) to restore an open and fair democracy once again by all, of all and for all.

Today I prefer to focus on the little guys like me and on my reaction to a news article I read recently. It was about ICE offering new recruits –projected to be about 80,000 strong — a $50,000 signing bonus and possible six-figure salary plus a college loan forgiveness package. These are things not offered to other Americans who do the most important work in our society for our collective safety and prosperity like first responders, nurses, teachers, caretakers of our sick and elderly, and many others. These professions can expect salary cuts, layoffs and zero federal support as they toil daily for the common weal of our nation.

In 1989 I was a 33-year-old mid-grade U.S. Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer serving my obligatory “weekend warrior” two-weeks of active duty annual tour in Argentina’s major naval base in Puerto Belgrano. One morning, as I rushed out of the officer’s club front door where I was billeted, I almost brushed elbows with an Argentine naval officer who the U.S. Embassy driver waiting for me outside identified as the “Blond Angel of Death.”

Who?

Alfredo Astiz is not a household name in the United States, but in Argentina he is the famed, handsome, blond Navy Special Forces officer who led heroically and gloriously the capture of the South Georgia Island from the British setting the stage for the Falklands/Malvinas War of 1982.

Today his story is on the internet. Astiz, now 74, has been languishing in jail for extra-judicial crimes he and his comrades-in-arms committed in their blind fervor to “save Argentina,” then under military rule. It would take almost 35 years of Argentine national anguish and debate — and international judicial wrangling –to finally bring Astiz and his cohorts to justice for their illegal and criminal acts committed under the guise of “saving our country.”

The parallels today could not be clearer from across the United States of America. There are daily reports on audio and video recordings and victims’/witnesses’ statements about the extra-judicial abuses by unidentified, combat-ready armed, masked personnel who claim to have some vague legal authority from even more questionable government or para-governmental agencies. It will happen one day — maybe not next year, not in five, 10, 20 or 30 years — but it will happen that these horrific stories of human rights abuses and deliberate violations of current laws will be pieced together. They will unmask who the perpetrators are and what they did, what laws they violated in their blind belief in leaders who will not be there to support them for their careless, illegal and inhumane actions during this current, amorphous mission to “keep America safe.”

Like Alfredo Astiz, they will be left to fend for themselves. Like Argentina then, the United States now is struggling with itself. Like Argentina in 1976, we may even lose our democracy, but it will be back — like Argentina did, fighting valiantly, for 35 years under great pain, to restore its democracy.

If they are 22, 32 or 42 now, the potential new ICE recruits will be only 57, 67 or 77 in 2060. Want an unprecedented, irresistible $50,000 signing bonus, potential six-figure salary, loan forgiveness plan just to fight America’s very open, clumsy, notorious, not-so-secret Dirty War?

I would resist. And just say no.
