We, the Leadership Team of the Congregation of the Sisters of St Joseph of Peace, reaffirm our 2016 Congregation Statement, 'Welcome Immigrants and Refugees'.

Our Congregation, ""had its origin in the founder's response to the social concerns and needs of the time."" (Constitution 4) At our founding, we were a congregation of immigrants, serving immigrants, knowing their pain and suffering. Throughout our history, we have stood in solidarity with recent arrivals to our countries, helping them find safe and stable housing, providing job and skills training, and offering pastoral care in the face of undignified treatment.

With the changes of government that have taken place in both the US and the UK, we have witnessed not only increasingly alarming rhetoric against asylum seekers, immigrants, and refugees, but also the disturbing violent action that is playing out in the streets and in public policy. We continue to urge our governments to follow international law and protocols guaranteeing the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

We join Pope Leo XIV and our brother Bishops in denouncing the inhumane and unjust treatment of our immigrant brothers and sisters. We call for an end to harmful rhetoric meant to instill fear and create division. In an era where we see mass deportation and the erosion of due process, we recall the words of Pope John Paul II who named arbitrary imprisonment and deportation as intrinsically evil acts ""offensive to human dignity."" (Veritatis Splendor, 80).

On November 12, 2025, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops released a special pastoral message regarding immigration. We share the concerns expressed by the bishops regarding the climate of fear and anxiety created by harsh immigration enforcement, increased profiling, inhumane conditions in detention centres, arbitrary revocation of immigration status, and indiscriminate mass deportation.

We also welcome the message that Bishop Paul McAleenan, Lead Bishop for Migrants and Refugees of the Catholic Church, England and Wales, offered for the annual World Day of Migrants and Refugees. ""Hostility and prejudice towards migrants and refugees, whatever its source - whether it is spoken or indicated in another way - must not make us lose hope or harden our hearts. It is our obligation to try and understand why migrants appear among us; our duty is to care for those who seek refuge in our country.""

We are troubled by the UK government's proposal to reverse many of the protections guaranteed to people who seek asylum. In a country whose residents are raising alarm because of increasing inequity, immigrants and asylum seekers should not be made the scapegoats and receive unjust treatment as a result.

We urge the bishops, as models and teachers of the Catholic faith, to use their authority, standing, and connections to act on behalf of migrants. The teaching of Jesus Christ demands that we act on behalf of our suffering neighbour. We encourage the bishops to join religious congregations, Catholic welcome centres, legal clinics and individuals in the advocating for human rights and concrete actions on behalf of migrants that bring the light of Catholic Social Teaching to this moral moment.

""The Church,"" writes Pope Leo in 'Dilexi Te', ""like a mother, accompanies those who are walking. Where the world sees threats, she sees children; where walls are built, she builds bridges. She knows that her proclamation of the Gospel is credible only when it is translated into gestures of closeness and welcome. And she knows that in every rejected migrant, it is Christ himself who knocks at the door of the community (73).""

Asylum numbers have dropped across Europe, making it hard to say exactly how much of it owes to Danish policy.","Britain’s government is joining the rest of Europe in taking a stricter stance on asylum, turning to the nation that has become something of a migration role model: Denmark.

Right-wing parties across Europe have sought for years to limit migration, often arguing that too many migrants could overwhelm public services and fracture social cohesion. Denmark stands out, though, because here it was a center-left government that doubled down on strict rules. Asylum flows have steadily fallen, and the Danish Social Democrats have retained national power.

But as Keir Starmer’s Labour government in London takes notes, unveiling a plan last week that openly borrows elements of Denmark’s policy, the way the Danish approach has worked on the ground offers reasons to proceed carefully. The political gains that the approach seemed to offer now show some signs of cracking, and policies meant to limit the entry of asylum seekers may come at a social cost.

Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the moderate politician who was prime minister when Denmark adopted many of its strictest policies, said immigration policy was about both limiting big flows of potential refugees and welcoming needed foreigners.

“They should just recall that we need this balanced approach,” said Mr. Rasmussen, who is now the Danish foreign minister. “It’s not black and white. It’s a colorful world, and it comes with a lot of nuances.”

‘Unwelcoming Country’

Over the years, but especially since the Syrian refugee crisis of 2015 sent a flood of newcomers into Europe, the Danish government has enacted policies to make life challenging for asylum seekers, trying to discourage them from coming.

Danish officials say the nation wants to slow the flow of new asylum seekers so it can adjudicate their cases carefully, and thoroughly integrate the people whom it does accept, even as it still takes a large number of documented migrants. The point, they say, is to avoid pressures that rapid migration has put on other societies, including homelessness, while maintaining public support in a society with high taxes and generous welfare policies.

Copenhagen pioneered a number of policies that Britain hopes to emulate. Some were largely symbolic, like threatening to confiscate the jewelry and valuables of would-be refugees to pay for their expenses. It also has made the process to gain permanent residence longer and subject to review. And it houses would-be refugees in conditions that it hopes discourages them from remaining.

That’s the case at Avnstrup return center, a former sanitarium filled with sparse, dormitory-like rooms in the countryside about an hour outside of Copenhagen. The Danish government sends some asylum seekers there, including people who are waiting on decisions and others who have been rejected but who cannot be returned to their home countries.

Ayfer Tepe, 52 and from Turkey, has lived in limbo at the Avnstrup center since 2019, when Denmark first rejected her asylum application. She has no money and no permission to work, and must check in twice a day. She compares it to life in an open-air jail.

Still, she has no intention of leaving. She said she fears the police in Turkey, where her ex-husband, a left-wing political activist, ran into trouble with the law and where the authorities repeatedly visited her house. And her 15-year-old son has largely grown up in Denmark, so she worries he would no longer fit in back in her home country.

“Where would I go?” she said from a worn couch in the center’s cafe, where residents and volunteers had gathered for coffee and cake on a clammy November afternoon.

Some human rights experts argue that even as governments make asylum processes more difficult, people in danger will still seek refuge, but they will be caught in worse conditions.

It is a “race to the bottom,” said Michala Clante Bendixen, who runs the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, which creates a “constant atmosphere of stress and insecurity.”

And migration researchers say the policies could have a long-run social cost, making even legal migrants and their descendants feel unwanted in Danish society.

“We’ve really branded ourselves as a more unwelcoming country,” said Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, a professor of migration law at the University of Copenhagen.

‘Open and Closed at the Same Time’

Denmark is not alone in restricting asylum. The Biden administration progressively tightened American rules over its time in office and in some cases went further, turning away potential asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. And countries across Europe are becoming steadily stricter about who enters and stays.

But Denmark’s tough stance on asylum came early. Its policies began to tighten notably after 2015 and continued after 2019, when Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, came into office. At the time, the policies made her Social Democrats an outlier on the left.

Mr. Rasmussen, the prime minister who oversaw the early shift toward a stricter approach, pointed out that Denmark still welcomes many legal migrants. But, he added, with its high taxes and generous welfare state, it also needed to limit asylum flows.

“If we can’t solve that dilemma, being open and closed at the same time, then we will lose our people’s support,” he said.

The Danish approach seemed to work. Denmark has not experienced some of the acute migration-related strains of nearby nations like Germany, Sweden and Belgium. In 2015, about 21,000 people sought asylum in Denmark, with the largest numbers coming from Syria and Eritrea. That figure fell to just over 2,000 last year, based on Eurostat data.

Asylum numbers have dropped across Europe, making it hard to say exactly how much of it owes to Danish policy. Still, today Denmark ranks toward the bottom of the pack in applications among the European Union’s 27 nations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/24/multimedia/24denmark-migration-01-cjtv/24denmark-migration-01-cjtv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 15:57:56.224345

In a hard-hitting statement released this week, the State Department said that countries in the West were enduring terror attacks and sexual assault as a result of mass migration – and listed the rape of thousands of girls by “grooming gangs of migrant men” as an example of concern.

“Mass migration is a human rights concern. Western nations have endured crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assaults, and the displacement of communities,” the statement said.

And the State Department said it would be working to encourage governments to “defend citizens” against the threats it perceived are being posed by mass migration.

“U.S. officials will urge governments to take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration,” the State Department announced.

It said that State Department officials “will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by people of a migration background.”

It said that “these issues have plagued citizens of Western nations for years” before listing examples including a high-profile Swedish sentencing – the rape of girls in the UK by gangs of men mostly of Pakistani heritage.

“In the United Kingdom, thousands of girls have been victimized in Rotherham, Oxford, and Newcastle by grooming gangs involving migrant men,” the State Department said. “Many girls were left to suffer unspeakable abuse for years before authorities stepped in.”

“In Sweden, an Eritrean migrant convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl was allowed to remain in the country after a judge ruled that the incident was not an “exceptionally serious crime” and did not warrant deportation,” the statement continued.

“In Germany, nine men – several of whom were migrants – were convicted for the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl. A German woman who insulted one of the rapists online was given a harsher sentence than the perpetrators themselves.”

The Department said that U.S. officials “will now scrutinize policies in Western nations that give leniency to migrant crime and human rights abuses or that create two-tiered systems that prioritize migrants at the expense of their own citizens”.

“The United States supports the sovereignty of our allies and calls on governments to constructively engage with the growing numbers of citizens concerned about mass migration.”

“The United States stands ready to assist our allies in solving the global crisis of mass migration,” the statement concluded.

Last month, Minister for Justice, Jim O’Callaghan, said that there is no link between asylum centres and crime levels in communities in Ireland. His predecessor, Helen McEntee, said last year that there is a false perception in Irish society that crime is on the rise because of increased levels of migration in this country.

Earlier this year, in a landmark speech at the Munich Security conference attended by leading politicians and policymakers, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has lashed out at suppression of free speech and freedom of association in Europe – pointing towards censorship of political parties, of Christians, and of peaceful pro-life prayer activists.

Vance raised, as examples of threats to free speech coming from within, the annulment of a recent election in Romania, the conviction of a Christian activist in Sweden, and the prosecution of a man for praying for his aborted son at an abortion clinic in Britain.

“The threat that I worry the most about vis à vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,” he said in a blistering speech.",https://gript.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/asylum-shutterstock_2438065389.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 14:57:01.051701

The Government is due to consider proposals from Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan that will reform Ireland's migration policy.

The Government is going to progress changes to the asylum system here this week.

Attending the G20 summit in South Africa, the Taoiseach indicated that those seeking citizenship could be prevented from doing do if they received certain welfare payments over a specific period.

The changes going to Cabinet will also tighten the rules around family reunification applications - plus there will be a focus on any debt owing to the State.

While those granted refugee status may have to wait five rather than the current three years before applying for full citizenship.

Sinn Féin and Aontú both expressed concern that the Government's plans are not adequately responding to the impending changes to the British asylum system.

Britain is set to overhaul its approach to human rights' laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive illegally, in a major shake-up of asylum policy.

The full extent of the changes to the migration laws will be outlined in legislation due to be published before the end of the year but Mr O'Callaghan is set to give an update on the measures after the Cabinet meeting concludes on Wednesday.

""I think this is a modest enough overhaul, but an important one,"" Mr Martin said.

""We've always taken a humanitarian approach, but I think there is necessary tightening up that is required in terms of both the asylum process and in terms of the citizenship process in Ireland.

""That's in essence, what is envisaged by these reforms,"" he said.

Mr Martin said the reforms had come before the party leaders and also before the Cabinet sub-committee.

The Taoiseach was asked about reports that refugees will not be allowed to become Irish citizens if they have received welfare payments within a certain period of time.

He was specifically asked if that would mean a female refugee should avoid getting pregnant if she wants to obtain Irish citizenship.

""So we've discussed these in relative detail and I think we will work through these as the legislation comes in, but that wouldn't be on the agenda,"" he said.

""I think we're looking at particular types of payment and so on like that,"" Mr Martin said.

The Taoiseach was also asked what he hoped the new reforms would achieve.

""I think a sense that Ireland is not an outlier in terms of benefits,"" he said.

""We see what's happening in the United Kingdom, even though we were looking at these reforms before the UK's latest reforms, there are knock-on effects, consequences from what others do. That's the reality.

""We have to be realistic about it, and we have to be firm about it, and also we have to accelerate because it's taken too long historically for people to have their asylum applications processed and concluded,"" Mr Martin said.

""We've now made a lot of progress on the first phase of that, the appeal stage is being staffed up, and Minister [Jim] O'Callaghan has particular plans to enhance the resources there so that we get a faster timeline in terms of appeals as well, so that people aren't waiting for prolonged periods of time,"" he added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/002385a0-1600.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:32.410461

That ended last week when eight senators — seven Democrats and one independent — voted with 52 Republicans to restart federal operations.

What some on the left have condemned as a capitulation was instead an acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by the shutdown. It ends the uncertainty for millions of Americans who struggled to make ends meet as Congress dithered.

The defectors' gambit may not be successful — chances are high that it will fail — but the shutdown illuminated the targeted cruelty of the Trump administration. The two parties' starkly different views of governance couldn't be clearer.

In mid-September, the Republican-led U.S. House passed what House Speaker Mike Johnson imprecisely termed a ""clean"" continuing resolution and promptly adjourned the chamber, forcing the Senate to accept or reject federal funding on their terms.

The Senate rejected that bill and a competing bill from House Democrats, with neither measure reaching the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. The inability to reach agreement — and a refusal by Republicans to negotiate a bill that could earn Democratic votes — set the stage for the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

Though Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, they framed Democrats as responsible for the impasse, falsely claiming that the minority party shut down the government to provide health care benefits to illegal immigrants. The Trump administration went so far as to (illegally) put that partisan lie atop the websites of all executive agencies.

Democrats argued that the expiration of tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act necessitated a legislative fight. The expansion of those benefits during the pandemic provided essential coverage for millions; its elimination would leave that population without affordable access to care.

That was a minor but important point in the larger opposition to Trump administration actions and the disastrous effects of the Republican spending bill passed during the summer.

The so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" Act will drive up health care prices and slash funding for social safety nets such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and food assistance which help vulnerable, elderly and needy families — all to extend lucrative tax benefits that accrue to the richest Americans.

Democrats were right to be wary of negotiating with President Donald Trump's White House. The administration faces numerous lawsuits for firing federal workers, withholding federal funds appropriated by Congress and generally acting as if the executive branch, rather than the legislative, is empowered by the U.S. Constitution to make spending decisions.

The longer the shutdown dragged on, the more Trump and his administration squeezed. They accelerated federal layoffs, which have been challenged in the courts. They (again, illegally) used private funds and money from other sources to meet the military payroll. And they appealed to the Supreme Court in a bid to ensure that hungry Americans were denied their monthly SNAP benefits.

Ultimately, Democrats buckled. While that ensures funding flows again to federal workers, service members and needy families, the shutdown made clear what each party values and the lengths each is willing to go in service to those ends.

Americans, even those who backed the Democrats' approach, should be relieved that Washington is open again. And they should remember how this played out — especially when they flock to the polls next year.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/11/25/103858998_AP25317127455615_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:24.020510

The NZ picture: steady support despite noise overseas In New Zealand, DEI remains firmly on the HR agenda.
Public-sector agencies continue to publish DEI strategies, and obligations under the Human Rights Act and Employment Relations Act hold steady.","A major change in how the United States defines human-rights breaches is drawing international attention and could prompt organisations in New Zealand to think carefully about how they position their diversity and inclusion work.

The US State Department has instructed its diplomats to treat certain DEI policies, affirmative-action measures, state-funded abortion services and even some forms of migration and online safety laws as potential human-rights violations. Officials say the new approach tackles “new destructive ideologies”, although critics argue it’s an attempt to recast long-agreed human-rights principles to suit domestic US politics.

A senior official described the new rules as “a tool to change the behaviour of governments,” while deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott warned that the administration would not allow what it sees as violations “to go unchecked”, adding, “Enough is enough.”

What this means for NZ workplaces

For HR leaders in Aotearoa, the US shift does not alter New Zealand’s own employment law or DEI expectations. But it does highlight how sharply different countries are now approaching inclusion—something global employers will need to navigate with care.

New Zealand’s direction is unmistakably different from Washington’s. The Public Service Commission’s 2024–25 DEI plan centres on building a workforce that reflects and serves the country’s diverse communities. NZTA’s 2025–28 roadmap ties inclusive leadership directly to organisational performance. And tools like the Aotearoa Inclusivity Matrix, widely used by HRNZ and Diversity Works NZ, provide a local framework for what good DEI practice looks like.

Because many New Zealand organisations operate internationally, these contrasting signals matter. The concern is not about legal exposure, but about how DEI work is understood and communicated across different markets, particularly if US stakeholders are involved.

The NZ picture: steady support despite noise overseas

In New Zealand, DEI remains firmly on the HR agenda. The 2024 New Zealand Workplace Diversity Survey shows strong focus on ethnic representation, gender equality and rainbow inclusion, alongside ongoing work to address pay gaps. Public-sector agencies continue to publish DEI strategies, and obligations under the Human Rights Act and Employment Relations Act hold steady.

What HR teams should focus on now

Be clear about the “why”

In a more contested global landscape, it’s important to explain the purpose of DEI—improving performance, culture and fairness—rather than relying solely on acronyms or assumptions.

Stay aware of global shifts

If your organisation has US investors, clients or operations, consider whether your DEI messaging is framed in a way that travels well.

Anchor everything locally

New Zealand has its own cultural foundations, legal requirements and expectations—especially relating to Te Tiriti o Waitangi—that should guide DEI efforts.

A moment for clarity, not retreat

While the US is taking a far more combative stance, New Zealand organisations still operate in a context where inclusion is tied to performance, culture and fairness—not ideology. For HR leaders, the task now is to keep DEI grounded in local values, communicate it clearly and ensure it reflects the people and communities of New Zealand.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0311_638995122457260197.png,N,,2025-11-23 11:57:51.175667

But for many of us it was a welcome reminder that the old Christianity has not yet been stamped out entirely.","Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an AI video of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.

He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the current estimate of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a study predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the active collaboration of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”

As disorienting as it is to watch the president try to upend the old idea of democracy and replace it with its polar opposite, there is one large group of Americans who should not find it completely novel. That is those of us – in older age cohorts a near majority – who were raised as mainline Protestant Christians.

We have watched over the years as rightwing evangelical churches turned the Jesus we grew up with into exactly the opposite of who we understood him to be. At its most basic, they turned a figure of love into a figure of hate who blesses precisely the cruelties that he condemned in the Gospel; we went from “the meek shall inherit the Earth” to “the meek shall die of cholera.” This has happened more slowly, over decades instead of months, but it is nonetheless unsettling in the same ways, a disorienting gut punch for many of us.

What particularly hurts is the fact that at no point did we manage to fight back, not effectively anyway. Without intending to, we surrendered control of the idea of Jesus. It is a story that may provide some insights into how to fight the attack on democracy.

Many readers, younger ones especially, will require some backstory. In 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower laid the cornerstone for the building that would house the National Council of Churches on the Upper West Side of Manhattan – on that day, according to a history of Protestantism by Mark Silk, a cool 52% of Americans were part of the so-called mainline denominations: Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Episcopalians and the like. That meant most of the nation subscribed at least nominally to a religious life marked by a kind of polite civic normality and a somewhat progressive reading of the Bible – every one of these denominations eventually backed the civil rights movement, and Dr Martin Luther King’s March on Washington was literally planned from the Methodist national headquarters, the closest private building to the Capitol. (Catholicism accounted for another third of Americans, an important piece of the story I will get to eventually.)

In the 60 years since, all that has changed; the mainline denominations are now barely a sixth of population, our churches largely aged and declining. Now the most public and powerful forms of Christianity, the vast and often denominationally independent megachurches and TV ministries, are as wildly different from that version of Protestantism as Donald Trump is from Eisenhower.

Paula White-Cain, for instance, who leads the newly created “White House Faith Office”, held a livestreamed prayer service the day after the 2020 election to call on “angelic reinforcement” from Africa and South America to swing the election away from Joe Biden. Doug Wilson, the self-taught pastor who co-founded Pete Hegseth’s denomination has insisted that it was a mistake to let women vote. (He also teaches that sex “cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party”, because “a man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants. A woman receives, surrenders, accepts.”)

Christianity, it must be said, has always trafficked in angels and had some serious trouble with the role of women. The actually distinctive things about this newly ascendant version of Christianity is that it meshes easily with the savage cruelty of the new political order, one whose tenets and tempers are directly contradictory to that older version I grew up in. They share the same forms, in that all pay homage to Jesus and quote from the Bible, just as the president still inhabits the same White House (or what is left of it). But the Jesus of this imagination – muscular, aggressive and American – is a different man than the one I grew up worshipping. The idea that he can be invoked to justify cutting off aid to foreign countries and bundling immigrants into the back of unmarked vans is repulsive to me, but also mystifying – as if gravity suddenly pulled objects upward.

A toxic Christianity takes hold

So let me first describe the Jesus that I grew up with, because theoretically Jesus is the center of any Christian faith, and because the fastest-growing cadre of Americans might have little sense of him since they are atheists or agnostics or nones. I have no problem with any of these traditions, nor with any other faith (of my three particular political heroes, only one – Dr King – is a Christian. Gandhi was Hindu, and his colleague, the too-little-known Abdul Ghaffar Khan – was a Muslim). But I do think that there are pearls of great price in the Christian story (though it should be said that I am no theologian, only a layperson and occasional Sunday school teacher).

It is emphatically not the story of a mighty king arising; instead, a baby is born to homeless parents in a garage, who must quickly flee to a different country to evade secret police. The baby grows up in humble circumstances, a working carpenter; his message is about love for others, especially for the poor – and not a sentimental love, but a concrete one, expressed by feeding and sheltering. Christ’s response to violence is to turn the other cheek – not as an act of passive acceptance, but as a way to educate the attacker; his crime policy is that if someone steals your coat you should give him your sweater too. This person’s message is sufficiently subversive that he is eventually put to death by the reigning imperial power, but that execution is powerless to quell his spirit or his message, which then spreads across a growing community of followers who try to behave as he had.

It is entirely fine to reject the supernatural elements of that story, or to bemoan the fact that it has been repeatedly captured, twisted and exploited by the powerful – but the story itself is one of the unlikely, distinctive and remarkable expressions of human civilization; it has been pressed into service behind any number of bad and violent plans from the Crusades on down, but it has also inspired an unfathomable number of artists, educators, physicians and helpers across the centuries.

In no small measure, it made me who I am. I grew up in the suburbs in the 1960s and 70s when mainline Protestantism retained its strength. I was baptized as a Presbyterian in California; the pastor who previously led my church, Eugene Carson Blake, headed the National Council of Churches, marched with King, and was on the cover of Time in the days when that was ultimate imprimatur. I was confirmed in a Congregational church in Lexington, Massachusetts – the direct descendant of the church where the original Minutemen had worshipped 200 years before. In college, at Harvard, my preacher was a man named Peter Gomes who exemplified the cross-cultural power of that tradition: a Black American with an anglophile’s appreciation for high church solemnity and a Republican by temperament who prayed at Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural, he was nonetheless a profound believer in the liberal tradition in which he came up. And when I left college I ended up for a few years in William Sloane Coffin’s Riverside church in New York, built by John D Rockefeller as more or less the St Peters of American Protestantism where Harry Emerson Fosdick had once preached – a name few recognize today but all would have known at a certain point in our history, for he was the foremost preacher of the first half of the 20th century. Riverside was right next to that building that Eisenhower had dedicated in 1958, the National Council of Churches headquarters sometimes known as “the God Box” – though that institution was already turning into a shell of its former itself, its corridors emptying as the mainline denominations downsized and then downsized again. Sunday morning church was no longer a civic obligation for Americans the way it had been in my youth, and for those who still wanted a Christian life, the evangelicalism we now see in full flower was beginning its rise.

I am less concerned with the shrinkage of the mainline church than with the replacement of its Jesus with this very different one. In some ways the Jesus of my early years was a good fit with the New Deal and then postwar politics – at once concerned with others, and also a figure of peace in a tense bipolar world. Not a pacifist, but an apt figure for an age reacting to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and Montgomery. The new Jesus is none of that. Indeed, according to his acolytes, he rejects all of it, and utterly.

Consider, for instance, one heir to Charlie Kirk’s place at the top of Maga Christianity. Allie Beth Stuckey, grew up in a megachurch; her father, a Texas state legislator, is senior adviser to the Heritage Foundation, the cradle of Project 2025. She is a distillation of the currently dominant American Christianity, and above all, her Jesus rejects empathy. This year, she published a bestselling book describing the concept as toxic and unbiblical; she is enthusiastic in her support for the president, including his immigration policies, which she describes as scriptural. As she told a reporter recently: “We can only look to scripture to see the principles of nations, of governance, of laws, of borders, of security, of God’s provision through walls, the Book of Nehemiah, and say: ‘OK. Can we apply those principles to America today? Do they still have wisdom? Does it make sense why God wanted secure walls for Jerusalem? Does that still apply to America?’”

Basing your support for ICE raids on terrified immigrants on a relatively obscure passage in a relatively obscure Old Testament story is a good example of what is known as prooftexting – the citing of some verse somewhere to support your predetermined beliefs. In this case, a story about Nehemiah rebuilding walls in parts of Jerusalem becomes a reason to ignore the utterly clear and oft-repeated instruction of Jesus to welcome the stranger. Indeed, Jesus tells the parable of the good Samaritan, which quite clearly extends this welcome beyond our nationalities. “Philoxenia” is the Greek term used in the New Testament for this love of strangers – it is the opposite of xenophobia, which is what JD Vance and Trump were practising when they started lying about immigrants dining on cats and dogs. To continue with the gastronomic theme, as a theologian the cherrypicking Stuckey, in her citation of Nehemiah and his walls, is like a restaurant critic who has visited a steakhouse, noted that it has creamed spinach on the menu, and declared confidently that it is a vegetarian eatery. (And as long as we are on the subject, Nehemiah, once done with his wall project, spent a fair amount of time chasing entrepreneurs out of the Temple because they had been using it for their own commercial purposes; tickets for Stuckey’s recent Share the Arrows conference, according to the Wall Street Journal, cost between $99 and $5,000, which bought VIP seating and a private lunch and dinner with Stuckey. Attenders strolled hallways lined with vendors selling everything from Christian-themed clothing and children’s books to Patriot cell service: “America’s Only Christian Conservative Wireless Provider – Defending God-Given Rights & Freedoms”.)

But the Bible at least talks about walls. It has almost nothing to say about the rest of their favorite culture war hobby horses – you can find five scattered references to what might be homosexuality in the Bible, though recent scholarship makes clear they were actually attacks on prostitution and abuse. Jesus himself had exactly nothing to say on the topic – not a sermon, not a parable, not even an offhand nasty joke. He also did not talk about transgender people, even though they have been a feature of every culture any anthropologist has ever studied. In her concession speech after her loss in the Republican Virginia governor’s race, Winsome Earle-Sears declared that she was “a Christian first and a Republican second”. But 57% of the Republican party’s advertising spending in her race had reportedly gone to attacking transgender people, a topic – again – that Jesus ignored. None of that spending went to attacking Elon Musk (a recently self-proclaimed “cultural Christian”), who had managed to kill 600,000 poor people by “feeding USAID into a woodchipper” in the first weekend of his Doge campaign. Musk’s new pay raise means that he could have, if he had pleased, made each of those 600,000 people a millionaire instead, but he did not, which may explain why Jesus thought that it was easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle than a rich man to heaven. If you think I am being hyperbolic here, a “rich young ruler” actually presented himself to Jesus and asked what he should do, and Jesus said he should sell his stuff and give it to the poor. This is what Jesus was about.

The obvious and straightforward fact that the Jesus of the gospels calls for a kind of radical love centered on the poor is what has always made Christianity something of a scandalous religion: appealing to the masses, but because of its inherent radicalness needing to be contained. In the 1950s it was contained by dilution – Protestantism was so dominant that it basically baptized the status quo. The 1960s broke that – the leadership of these churches, who were among the most committed followers of Jesus, found that they had little choice but to march in Selma, literally or figuratively. But many of their followers did not want to; they had been on board because Protestantism was part of the fabric of American life, not a challenge to it. Membership in mainline churches began dropping off. And for many of those who still felt a cultural or personal need for Christianity, evangelicalism was on the rise: it meshed wonderfully with the emerging Reagan-era emphasis on individualism and spoke directly to Americans who rejected the movements of the civil rights era.

The idea that personal salvation – as opposed to concern for others – was at the heart of Christianity always bordered on the heretical, but over the decades it has morphed into the absurd farce we see now, where Jesus is held to bless every show of dominance and aggression we can imagine. There is, by now, a well-established genre of Republican officials posing for Christmas cards with submachine guns; Nashville Republican congressman Andy Ogles passed them out to his entire family for a picture. He was one of the congresspeople who led the charge not only to freeze USAID funding for the poorest people in the world, but to use that money instead for increased deportations from this country. It is as if he had decided to see exactly how un-Christlike it was possible for one human being to be – indeed, he demanded that the local private Christian college Belmont University lose federal funding because it had a hope, unity and belonging department that he thought was too much like “DEI”.

Evangelicals are not unanimous in their support for Trump. For years I have written a column for the progressive evangelical magazine Sojourners, for example, but even its publishers would confess that they are very much a minority. Realistically, white evangelicalism is the base of Trump’s support, and this flock has not broken with him the way many of his other followers have in the past nine months.

For most readers, rightly, none of this inside baseball will matter much. For me, personally, it certainly does: it is as weird to me as a Christian as it to me as an American to see King Trump fantasizing about offloading his bowel movements from a plane on our heads. But the reason I bother to write about it is not personal but strategic. That is because mainline Protestantism made a serious mistake: surrendering its vision of Jesus without much of a fight. It is not entirely gone – there remain thousands of wonderful and vibrant congregations, and leaders like the Rev William Barber who occasionally manage to break through in public. Episcopal bishop Mariann Edgar Budde raised a ruckus this winter when, with Trump in attendance, she prayed for him to show compassion to immigrants; there have been more than a scattering of pastors in the protests outside immigration offices, just as there are in almost every social movement in this country. But these exceptions prove, I fear, the rule of general passivity: in general, the old mainline Christianity never was able to offer a very potent defense against the aggressive and toxic new forms of Christianity.

There were structural reasons for that passivity – five or six declining and theologically similar denominations never really considered uniting into one more powerful one, and there were conservative movements within Methodism or Presbyterianism or most of the others that sapped their strength. And there were intellectual reasons – this older tradition wrongly believed, right back to the days of Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority, that the new emerging take on Jesus was so transparently bogus that eventually people would snap out of it and return to their former orthodoxy. They were wrong, and that is not an error I would like to see repeated in the struggle for democracy; having lost for now the cross, I am not eager to surrender the flag as well.

A struggle for the best of us

So I have been heartened to see the steadfast resistance to Trump arise in this past year. It has been great solace to help build the movement that has taken to the streets in rally after rally, and seems to have inspired voters to turn out in numbers in the off-year elections earlier this month. (As the founder of Third Act, which organizes progressives over 60, I am especially gratified by the number of older Americans in the streets, many of them the children of the Eisenhower era, and appalled as I am at the foulness of the president). We will need to continue it, and in the same spirit, with American flags at every demonstration and appeals to the best parts of American history.

And indeed, there are signs of this starting to happen. In Texas, a young Democrat named James Talarico has surged into contention in the state’s Senate race largely on the strength of his forthright declaration of the kind of retro Christianity I have been describing. A part-time seminary student (Presbyterian, one of those mainline denominations that used to dominate America’s spiritual landscape), he said in a sermon two years ago: “Jesus came to transform the world. Christian nationalism is here to maintain the status quo. They have coopted the Son of God. They have turned this humble rabbi into a gun-toting, gay-bashing, science-denying, money-loving, fear mongering fascist. And, it is incumbent upon all Christians to confront it, and denounce it.” (Talarico is doing well enough that he recently came under attack for the sin of following several OnlyFans models on Instagram; his campaign has said that he “follows back and engages with supporters who have large followings and does not investigate their backgrounds”. Given that the president’s record with, say, Stormy Daniels, it is one more example of evangelical absurdity).

Talarico is still an outsider. But Pope Leo is not, and in his first months he has begun at least to suggest that the Roman Catholic church may not watch from the sidelines as this era plays out. Catholicism has been a largely conservative force in American politics in recent years, institutionally obsessed with the abortion debate above all things. Globally, however, things are a little different. If you had suggested a generation ago that the Roman church might become one of the planet’s more progressive large institutions, I would have giggled. But Pope Francis made clear that abortion was not the only issue that counted, insisting that the church focus on the poor. His remarkable encyclical, Laudato Si’, usually described as “about global warming”, was actually much broader, a scathing critique of modernity and the politics of division and exploitation. He followed up, in the last year of his life, by firmly correcting new convert JD Vance, who argued that Augustine preferred that people centered their compassion on family and neighbors. Francis schooled him on the saint, explaining that “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups” and urging him to meditate on the parable of the good Samaritan.

I was in Rome earlier this autumn for a session to mark the 10th anniversary of that encyclical, and so got to watch Leo close up for a little while. I was glad to hear him say that he will continue the church’s environmental activism unabated – indeed the Vatican will soon be the world’s first fully solar-powered nation. But I was equally as interested to simply take his measure. He is very much recognizable as a midwest American – if he showed up at your Thanksgiving table as a bachelor uncle in a White Sox cap, you would not find him out of place at all. But his 20 years in Peru and elsewhere around the poor world accomplished two things. One, clearly, was to make him as sensitive as Francis to the plight of the impoverished and vulnerable.

Just as important, Leo – Robert Prevost – was more away than not from America all those decades. So in some ways you see preserved in a kind of amber the attitudes of a man who took his first vows in the 70s, when the kind of ugly Christianity that marks the Trumpers was almost unimaginable. Many American bishops moved hard to the right in the decades that followed, identifying themselves with the Republican party, but Leo seems not to have followed. This month, he explicitly called out American immigration authorities for their brutal treatment of arrested immigrants, particularly the fact that they were being denied communion. “Many people who’ve lived for years and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now,” he said. But he went further, saying that when God judged humans: “We’re going to be asked, you know, how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”

In the eyes of the new Republican Christianity, that reflection would involve the sin of empathy. Better to build some walls. (This week the president’s staunchest defender, Laura Loomer, accused the Catholic church of “work[ing] so hard to try and destroy our country” by “condemning deportations”.) But for many of us it was a welcome reminder that the old Christianity has not yet been stamped out entirely.

I got to give the talk on Lexington Green at the last No Kings day, and it was a chance to quote from the American Gospel according to old Sam Adams:

The liberties of our country, the freedoms of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards; it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors. They purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood. It will bring a mark of everlasting infamy on the present generation – enlightened as it is – if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men.

America is best defended, in other words, by reference to the best about American history, just as Christianity is best defended by reference to what makes it distinctive and beautiful, which is the example of Jesus. In neither case does it mean pretending the worst of both America and Christianity did not happen; it means both humility and belief, a combination that serious American Christians should be comfortable with.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de25cfa1856ab299c8cb4c79142d40f30ddb4ffb/0_381_2400_1920/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=676bb50c2ca220953521ef406d5fc218",N,,2025-11-23 10:58:27.012230

Some of the claims about “Operation Charlotte’s Web” were misleading.

Other WRAL Top Stories

The Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 15 launched the operation in Charlotte and then expanded its efforts to Raleigh days later. The cities were the latest targets of the federal government’s stepped-up immigration enforcement, a campaign promise and top priority of President Donald Trump.

The operation’s stated goal: to capture immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and have been previously arrested for criminal offenses. By Friday, Border Patrol reported that it had arrested about 370 people.

The operation is ongoing despite objections from local and state officials in Raleigh and Charlotte who worry about teams of agents disrupting their cities, which they claim are already safe. Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, criticized the operation as targeting everyday people for their skin color — a claim DHS has disputed.

""I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,"" Stein said Tuesday.

Here is a roundup of claims we found to be inaccurate or disputed.

Are North Carolina jails refusing to turn over arrestees to law enforcement ‘right now’?

That’s what Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview with Fox News. However, there’s no evidence it’s true.

“There’s about 1,400 criminal illegal aliens that, right now, are in North Carolina and Charlotte’s jails that they refuse to turn over to ICE law enforcement,” McLaughlin said in a video clip the department posted on X on Nov. 17.

It’s possible she misspoke. The department’s Nov. 15 press release about the operation says North Carolina officials ignored nearly 1,400 of the department’s requests — known as “detainers” — to hold immigrants in local jails so that federal immigration officials could pick them up. It’s unclear when those requests were made or if each one refers to a separate inmate. We asked the department about its numbers and McLaughlin’s claim. A department spokesperson said “CBP has no further information to provide.”

North Carolina sheriffs are legally required to notify ICE when they take someone into custody who they suspect is in the country illegally. They must also comply if ICE demands that the inmate be kept in custody for federal agents to pick up. North Carolina Republican lawmakers passed this law last year over the veto of then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, who said it was unconstitutional and also infringed on the rights of sheriffs to run their jails how they see fit.

Do North Carolina cities have sanctuary policies?

The department’s Nov. 15 release said “sanctuary policies” prevented local officials from honoring immigration detainers. That needs clarification.

A decade ago, some North Carolina cities banned their law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration officials. Then in 2015, former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, signed a law banning those types of policies. However, North Carolina sheriffs maintained the legal flexibility to ignore the detainers if they wanted.

Although most of North Carolina’s 100 sheriffs complied with detainer requests, some did not. Sheriffs in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, for instance, said honoring detainers would strain their relationships with people in their communities and potentially create legal issues. Some courts have said ICE detainers, which aren't approved by any judge, violate the Constitution.

The GOP-controlled North Carolina General Assembly last year enacted the law requiring sheriffs to honor the detainers. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Sheriffs Association, which represents the state’s sheriffs and advocates on their behalf, said he believes all sheriffs are currently complying with the law.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office is not blocking immigration officials from any of the 85 people in its jail who are suspected of being in the country illegally, office spokesperson Sarah Mastouri said. The Wake County Sheriff’s Office is also complying with detainer requests, office spokesperson Rosalia Fedora said. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, federal immigration officials took into custody 28 people who were in the Wake County jail, she said.

Does the uptick in ICE raids harm broader public safety?

Democratic state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls believes so. In a lengthy statement criticizing the raids, she wrote that the large national immigration crackdown “is making the public less safe, in part because it has resulted in abandoning the effort to stop serious crimes. These agents are being pulled off cases investigating sex trafficking, child abuse and terrorism.”

Earls is correct that ICE has taken thousands of federal agents off their work on other cases to help round people up in the raids in cities across the country. But does that make the country less safe? Not everyone agrees.

Trump personally ordered thousands of federal agents reassigned to ICE on his first day in office this year, writing in an executive order that he was doing so because “many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans.”

According to data analysis by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, roughly one-fifth of all FBI agents, as well as half of all DEA agents, have been reassigned to working on immigration raids like the ones in North Carolina due to Trump’s executive order.

Ninety percent of the Department of Homeland Security Investigations staff has been reassigned to ICE, according to Cato. HSI is a unit of ICE but traditionally handles international criminal activity, rather than immigration enforcement. Those 6,198 HSI agents had previously been tasked with handling human trafficking, child exploitation, cybercrime, weapons export controls, intellectual property theft, drugs, and terrorism cases — the same issues Earls raised concerns over.

Trump wrote in his executive order that as long as he’s president, “the primary mission of [HSI] is the enforcement of … federal laws related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States.”

Did Charlotte traffic plummet after Border Patrol started its operation?

Some X posts claimed that traffic cleared around Charlotte after Border Patrol launched its operation. The Department of Homeland Security shared a post showing a map of Charlotte with clear roads, adding the caption: “You’re welcome.” And state data shows traffic dipped in some areas.

The state Department of Transportation monitors traffic on the major thoroughfares around Charlotte, such as Interstate 77, Interstate 85, Interstate 485, and U.S. 21. We wanted to compare traffic on Nov. 17 with traffic on Nov. 10 — the Monday after Board Patrol arrived vs. the Monday before agents arrived. The number of vehicles dipped between 1% and 7.9% depending on the road, a DOT spokesperson told us.

In the Raleigh area, Border Patrol agents ramped up their operation Tuesday and Wednesday. Traffic volumes were down 0.5% to 4.8% on Wake County thoroughfares on those days compared to the previous week, DOT said.

Are nearly 15% of Mecklenburg County’s public school students here illegally?

Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s deputy White House chief of staff, shared a news report on X that nearly 21,000 of the county’s students missed school on Nov. 17, adding: “So a conservative estimate is that one-seventh of a major southern public school district is here illegally.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System’s average daily membership is about 140,000 students, according to 2023-24 data collected by the state Department of Public Instruction. The number of students who missed class that day — about 21,000 — does come out to about one-seventh of the district’s student population, or 15%. But that doesn’t mean that the students who were no-shows are in the U.S. illegally.

The DPI data from 2023-24 shows that nearly 8% of Charlotte-Mecklenburg students missed class on any given day.

Students often miss school because they are sick, have an appointment, or are on vacation. It’s also possible some students skipped school because they were afraid immigration agents would target them whether or not they are citizens. It’s difficult to know how many of the district’s students entered the U.S. illegally because the state doesn’t track its students’ citizenship statuses.

Did immigration agents shoot someone in Charlotte?

That’s what a video on social media claimed, showing a man being wheeled away in a stretcher as masked, armed federal agents kept watch on the crowd gathered nearby and filming.

McLaughlin said the social media post was false. The man in the stretcher was being taken into ICE custody, she said, but hadn’t been shot. She said he “had a panic attack and was taken to the hospital, where he attempted to escape by climbing into the ceiling tiles from the hospital bathroom. He was unsuccessful and was apprehended inside the ceiling by law enforcement.”

Is Border Patrol done with North Carolina?

Democratic leaders in Charlotte on Nov. 20 celebrated what they said was the end of the operation. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles wrote on social media: “It appears that U.S. Border Patrol has ceased its operations in Charlotte. I’m relieved for our community and the residents, businesses, and all those who were targeted and impacted by this intrusion.”

But, later that same day, federal officials said those announcements were far too premature. McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said “the operation is not over and is not ending anytime soon.”",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/state/2025/11/17/22250746/media_0243bd8be21c43cab2afcc1d43d253b8-DMID1-692n84wga-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 10:58:30.611381

The Department of Homeland Security is conducting Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham, who tragically lost her life to a drunk-driving criminal illegal alien in the sanctuary state of Illinois.

Of those arrested across Chicago on Nov. 19 alone, violent criminal illegal aliens include:

Angel Gonzalez Di Luca, a 27-year-old criminal illegal alien from Venezuela who’s been convicted of domestic violence with strangulation. He attempted to flee on foot, but ICE officials caught up and arrested him. He illegally entered the country at an unknown date and location, and he was released under the Biden administration’s catch and release polices and never reported to ICE.

Juan Toledo Vasquez, a 54-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico who’s been arrested for aggravated criminal sexual abuse against a child and possession of a fraudulent ID card. He’s been removed from the U.S. twice — once in 2000 and once in 2007.

Jose Juarez Soto, a 31-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico convicted of domestic battery and criminal recklessness with a deadly weapon. He illegally entered the U.S. on an unknown date at an unknown location, and U.S. Border Patrol gave him a voluntary return to Mexico on March 4, 2010. He illegally reentered the country sometime after that date.

Hector Teja Solis, a 34-year-old criminal alien from Mexico convicted of armed robbery causing bodily injury. He illegally entered the U.S. on an unknown date at an unknown location.

Miguel Angel Portillo Pacheco, a 29-year-old criminal illegal alien from El Salvador who’s been convicted of domestic battery, assault, violating a protective order, armed robbery without a firearm and resisting a peace officer. He claims to have entered the U.S. illegally in 2009, and ICE encountered him in Illinois’ McHenry County Jail after his conviction; he served his sentence before his Nov. 19 ICE arrest.

Domingo Sanchez Hernandez, a 47-year-old criminal illegal alien from Mexico with a final order of removal who’s been convicted of DUI and arrested multiple times for domestic battery. An immigration judge ordered him removed from the U.S. on Aug. 12, 2024.

“These arrests are a drop in the bucket,” said ERO Chicago Field Office Director Sam Olson. “ICE Chicago is out doing targeted enforcement every day to protect people where their local leaders have failed, and we’ve arrested thousands of dangerous criminal aliens. Make no mistake: These are criminals, and if local officials had called ICE before releasing them, they’d be in their home countries rather than victimizing innocent people here in the United States.”

Each of these criminal illegal aliens will remain in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings or removal.

Federal immigration arrests in Colorado surged this summer under the Trump administration’s plans to mass-deport immigrants lacking permanent legal status.","Joanne Belknap bears witness.

She bears witness to the young families arriving at Denver immigration court in their Sunday best — baby girls in headbands, men in collared shirts. She notices the trembling hands accepting informational pamphlets she distributes outside the Byron Rogers Federal Building downtown. Among packed, wooden courthouse benches, Belknap absorbs the testimonies of immigrants seeking asylum in the United States who describe fleeing violence and terror in their home countries by foot, sometimes on their own and sometimes with children in tow, in pursuit of safety.

Although she spends hours at the federal courthouse each week, the 67-year-old retired professor is not a lawyer. She is a volunteer court watcher — a group of regular people who sign up for shifts observing the proceedings at Denver’s immigration court and pass out resources to the immigrants.

Volunteers walk the courthouse perimeter, eyes peeled for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles or ICE agents. If spotted, they can warn immigrants in the vicinity and alert local immigration advocacy groups to be prepared to respond. They document which federal or state agencies are parked nearby, sharing the information they gather in encrypted text messages. They hand out fliers in English and Spanish with information about how to prepare for immigration proceedings, free legal resources and what to do if detained by ICE.

The Byron Rogers Federal Building’s six immigration courtrooms and those who enter and exit their chambers have imprinted on Belknap’s conscious. Sometimes in heartening moments like flexing her Duolingo-acquired Spanish skills entertaining a small child sitting in the courthouse waiting room for hours. Other times, like the day she witnessed a man “violently” arrested by ICE in front of his young son and partner, it is emotionally taxing.

Still, the longtime activist said it is the most impactful work she has ever done — using the privilege of being a white woman to look out for the vulnerable in her community, she said.

“It’s the best I’ve felt about being white in my entire life,” Belknap said. “I don’t think I’m a wonderful person or such a badass for doing this. It is just a really good outlet to feel like I’m doing something. How do we show up for our neighbors?”

‘It’s very grassroots’

The court watch group was born out of concerns from members of the Colorado Rapid Response Network which responds to and documents ICE activity in the state. In late May, members of the network heard rumors that ICE might show up outside federal immigration court to detain people, so they pulled together volunteers from various immigration, activist and faith-based groups to go to the courthouse and observe.

“It’s very grassroots,” said Kellyn Croy, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom in Thornton who heard about the group in June from a Reddit post.

Croy was “totally new to activism,” she said. After reading news reports about immigrant families being separated or detained in Colorado, she felt compelled to get involved in the cause.

Federal immigration arrests in Colorado surged this summer under the Trump administration’s plans to mass-deport immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

The agencies detaining immigrants in Colorado have increasingly arrested those without any prior criminal convictions or charges, according to internal data.

“I’m white and a suburban mom, so there is a certain amount of power in that — privilege,” Croy said. “Seeing all of this tears my heart up. If I can use my whiteness to do something, then please sign me up for it. That was my thought process.”

In the beginning, the court watchers would just show up and figure out how to divide themselves to best serve the people there that day. Now that they’ve been going for several months, there’s an official shift sign-up process where people schedule themselves in two-hour blocks. Those interested in signing up can learn more at colocw.org/cwint.

There’s a vetting process and a training they’ve created to show people the ropes and teach new volunteers the rules.

For example, they can’t hand people literature inside the courthouse, so they pass out their informational pamphlets outside.

“We’re on public property,” Croy said. “We’re not violent. We’re not screaming. We’re peaceful. We’re just there for members of our community.”

The newly minted activist said the work is simple but meaningful. She has made new friends among her peers and met immigrants whose lives have moved her. She doesn’t speak Spanish, but her volunteerism is still welcomed.

“These are good people who are trying to do the right thing,” Croy said. “They’re trying to go about the immigration process the right way, showing up to court and going to their appointments and they have to worry about being detained while doing so.”

Showing up for people

On an early Monday morning in November, a mother pushing a stroller flanked by two older children hustled into the courthouse. Belknap handed the family a list of immigration advocacy group resources on their way inside, and the family’s worried expressions momentarily lifted, shifting into smiles.

“I feel guilty sometimes how grateful people are just that we are there to give them their rights and try to keep them as safe as we know how to do,” Belknap said. “It’s very, very humbling.”

The pamphlet states that June 17 was the last time someone was taken from the courthouse by ICE — both a reassurance that it’s been a few months and a notice to be vigilant, Belknap said.

Belknap was on court watch when the incident happened.

Volunteers told The Denver Post when it happened that a man, his partner and young son left the courtroom after an immigration hearing when ICE agents in plain clothes and masks grabbed the man and pushed him into the women’s restroom. The man was “violently” detained in front of his young child who was crying, volunteers said. Agents took the man down the courthouse hallway and “disappeared him,” volunteers said.

A volunteer was in the bathroom during the incident telling the agents to stop and telling the couple not to give the agents any information. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, that volunteer was then detained, arrested, handcuffed and cited.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Denver office said in a social media post that an agent was “assaulted” that day while performing their duties. The agency did not provide additional details about the situation.

Belknap — whose university research has largely taken place in prisons and domestic violence shelters — described the event as among the most horrifying scenes she’s witnessed.

Court watchers called immigration rapid response networks, who quickly showed up. They documented the incident, alerted the media and helped spread the word about what happened to someone in their community.

Margaret Bobb, a retired Denver teacher, joined the court watch group this summer after involving herself in immigrant advocacy work the past year.

One of her children is nonbinary, she said, which compels the 62-year-old to fight hard for the rights of the vulnerable.

Bobb finds the volunteer work calming — a tangible action she can do to quell a feeling of hopelessness.

She feels fortified at the thought that “a bunch of white U.S. citizens with cameras ready to film and report on what’s going on” could prevent injustices.

While she knows it’s a drop in the bucket, she hopes that some information on the fliers they hand out might prove helpful — even life-saving, she said.

“You meet cool people and you meet nice immigrants,” Bobb said. “I drive away going,’I did something.’ It’s empowering.”

As a kid, Belknap remembers learning about Hitler and the Nazis.

“I used to always think that I hope I would have been one of the good people who tried to stand up for these horrible things going on — kidnapping and detaining people and killing them,” Belknap said. “This is it for me. I feel I am obliged to show up for people.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-L-Belknap111825-cha-048.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-23 12:57:41.769478

Grissom,,,,,https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article313026606.html,"At the heart of the entire lawsuit collection is the real question: CoreCivic, why not just get the permit?
While CoreCivic’s multimillion-dollar contract to house ICE detainees in Leavenworth is on hold because of the litigation, CoreCivic apparently has a larger mission: Avoid even the small, intolerable amount of oversight of a permit.
Ultimately, the entire saga could end if CoreCivic were simply to apply for a permit.
But this has clearly become about more than just Leavenworth to CoreCivic, which has clearly had enough of pesky voices concerned with human rights and local governance, in Leavenworth and beyond.
The scale and implications here for federal intrusion on local government cannot be overstated, for Leavenworth and cities across the nation.","By now, you may have heard 2025 has been quite a legal saga between private prison giant CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth, in four separate lawsuits over the requirement of a permit to operate a currently inactive facility as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center. At the heart of the entire lawsuit collection is the real question: CoreCivic, why not just get the permit?

While CoreCivic’s multimillion-dollar contract to house ICE detainees in Leavenworth is on hold because of the litigation, CoreCivic apparently has a larger mission: Avoid even the small, intolerable amount of oversight of a permit. No amount of flip-flopping or expensive judicial gymnastics is too much for CoreCivic’s hope of a United States where it can disregard local government’s concerns anywhere it seeks to do business.

Once upon a time, CoreCivic insisted it would be a good partner to Leavenworth, touting tax benefits and investments — but now the multibillion-dollar company has dragged both parties through multiple cycles of costly, adversarial litigation. Similarly, CoreCivic once trumpeted flexibility and work-life balance to job applicants in Leavenworth, but within a few months, new staff members found themselves in quite the bait and switch of extra shifts and long stretches without a day off as the facility grew increasingly dangerous.

CoreCivic’s “Better the Public Good” slogan and its entire website are “1984”-level corporate doublespeak, gaslighting anyone who has read or lived through its record of human rights abuses under its current name or previous identity, Corrections Corporation of America. The Leavenworth prison itself has an indelible local reputation as a violent hellhole, and CoreCivic’s brand is consistent in recent reports of horrific conditions at its facilities across the country, from Tennessee to California.

This year, the dystopian corporate mind games continue. CoreCivic applied for a permit in February, then withdrew it. In March, when Leavenworth sued CoreCivic in federal court for attempting to open in violation of local law, the company claimed this was a zoning question suited more to state court, and the litigation moved accordingly. But when CoreCivic filed its own lawsuit in August, it suddenly insisted this was very much a federal question — now that it could call in the cavalry, the U.S. Department of Justice, to weaponize the supremacy clause and national immigration politics against Leavenworth.

Ultimately, the entire saga could end if CoreCivic were simply to apply for a permit. It could end the three active lawsuits, open its Leavenworth detention center and begin fulfilling its profitable contract. But this has clearly become about more than just Leavenworth to CoreCivic, which has clearly had enough of pesky voices concerned with human rights and local governance, in Leavenworth and beyond. Thus, CoreCivic reached for the wieldy, federal hammer of allies at the DOJ in its new mission: Weaponize the courts and be able to operate completely unregulated.

The scale and implications here for federal intrusion on local government cannot be overstated, for Leavenworth and cities across the nation. Were this a developer looking to install a nuclear waste dump by a residential neighborhood, in the reality that CoreCivic and the DOJ hope to create, all it would take is a friendly political connection to Washington, D.C., to shut up a local government and override any attempts to protect residents’ health.

Every city and county in the U.S. should be alarmed by CoreCivic’s arrogance and bullying of our local government. We should not allow corporate executives to reduce all of us — staff, immigrant detainees and entire surrounding communities — to the mere collateral materials for their profiteering.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/i7jnpr/picture313028578/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Leavenworth%20ICE%20detention%20online.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 10:58:55.988389

Both political parties.
The only ones who can mess that up are the political parties and the people of Congress, as they add their special preferences to the bill.
But our system is broken, and it is because we put political parties before the dignity of the human being.","At a Stations of the Cross prayer gathering in Aurora, Archbishop Aquila condemns political gamesmanship and calls Catholics to defend the God-given dignity of migrants.

Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila, together with Auxiliary Bishop Jorge Rodríguez, led a Stations of the Cross prayer service around the ICE Detention Facility in Aurora. Several hundred attended the peaceful procession and joined in saintly solidarity with the innumerable immigrants affected by the current immigration crisis.

In his remarks following the Stations of the Cross, printed below in full, Archbishop Aquila lambasted both U.S. political parties for failing immigrants and using them for selfish political gain. He called on those gathered, and indeed, all Catholics, Christians and people of good will to pray and act to defend the dignity of every human person — especially migrants.

“I want to thank all of you for coming today, as we have prayed and walked the Stations of the Cross. They are reminders to us of God's love for all people and for the immigrant, for the stranger, for those who are sick and suffering, and for all those who are in need of our prayer. We must remember the dignity of every human being. That dignity is not bestowed by any government. That dignity comes from God and God alone.

Both political parties have failed horribly when it comes to immigration. They have treated immigrants as pawns for their own elections, for their own desires, and they have failed every immigrant. Both political parties. Not just one, but both. And they have not served people well. Their only interest is themselves and that alone. And getting to the next election. It is important for us as Catholics and as Christians and as people of goodwill to give witness to the dignity of the human person, that every human being, whether they believe it or not, whether they be atheist, agnostic, whether they be Hindu or Muslim, whether they be Jewish or Christian, every human being is created in the image and likeness of God. It is important to always understand that.

God never, ever stops loving a human being. No matter who that human being is, no matter who that president may be, no matter who that person in Congress may be, no matter who that world leader may be. God is love, and it is impossible for God to not love. It is human beings who stop loving. It is human beings whose hearts are so hardened that they are rocks. And as God knocks on that door, they still refuse to believe. They still refuse to trust in him.

As we have walked this Way of the Cross and seeing how much God loves us, that he has died for you and your sins. Whether you believe it or not, he has. Whether you receive it or not, he offers it still to you.

What we see in the brokenness of our immigration system is horrendous, especially when it comes to human trafficking, when it comes to sex trafficking, the trafficking of children and the trafficking of drugs. That all undermines the dignity of the human person.

I just learned a couple days ago that there is finally a bill in Congress that is supported bipartisan, and it is called the Dignity Act. It is to take care of immigrants who have come to this country. They may not have come with documents, but they have been living here peacefully for 10, 20, 30 years. Many of us know them, and they need a path to citizenship.

The only ones who can mess that up are the political parties and the people of Congress, as they add their special preferences to the bill. If they just did not touch the bill the way it is today, it would be fine. But our system is broken, and it is because we put political parties before the dignity of the human being.

And so I encourage you, my sisters and brothers, and I thank you for being here today to give witness to the dignity of the human person and to the goodness of every human being from the moment of their conception through natural death. Let us continue to work for the immigrant and to proclaim Jesus Christ, no matter what the cost. May the Lord bless all of you and thank you for your witness.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1c90d9_0474c8cb8fd04a15b33d694f1db4123c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/1c90d9_0474c8cb8fd04a15b33d694f1db4123c~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-23 14:57:20.716436

A lot of immigrants who are in the country illegally — and their employers — remember when the siege began. Federal immigration agents equipped with tactical gear and rifles descended on downtown Los Angeles in armored trucks on June 6, arresting dozens of workers at an apparel factory. Within hours, another group of agents raided a Home Depot a few miles away, arresting day laborers who were looking for work.

Those operations quickly became a flashpoint, sparking spontaneous large-scale street protests. But President Donald Trump’s administration doubled down, and more high-profile raids followed as the White House sought to make good on the president’s promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in the nation’s history.

Immigration agents have since conducted sweeps at construction sites, restaurants, factories, car washes and farms, upending life for undocumented workers nationwide. California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.

As militarized crackdowns have become more common in many parts of the country, employers and unions alike have taken new steps to protect their workers. In industries ranging from farmwork to garment production to food service, they have begun organizing defenses to make it harder for ICE to identify, detain and deport unauthorized immigrant employees who help keep their workplaces in business.

While the strategies vary, they share common goals: to find ways to inform immigrant workers about threats and, when possible, to shield them from detainment and deportation.

Adopt a corner

On Aug. 6, day laborers gathered in front of the same Home Depot in Los Angeles that had been raided two months earlier. Tensions were still high in the city with ongoing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol actions, but the workers needed some income.

Suddenly, the back door of a Penske rental truck slid open from the inside to reveal nearly a dozen CBP agents in body armor lying in wait. They surged toward unsuspecting laborers, many of whom scattered in fear.

The raid, dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” by the Department of Homeland Security and captured on camera by a Fox News reporter embedded with the agents inside the truck, resulted in the arrests of more than a dozen immigrants.

Similar raids earlier in the year inspired the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a labor group that advocates for improved working conditions, to create the “Adopt a Corner” campaign.

Jose Madera, the director of the NDLON-affiliated Pasadena Community Job Center, said that the campaign encourages volunteers to go to places where immigrants regularly gather in search of work, to teach people about their rights. So far, volunteers have visited more than 100 locations across the country, Madera said.

The group’s volunteers hand out “Know Your Rights” materials like red cards, which are pocket-sized cutouts that explain what anyone — regardless of immigration status — can do when confronted by an immigration officer. But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.

The Pasadena Community Job Center also tells people in the community to record actions by authorities on cellphones so that when there is a raid, “there can be someone documenting the abuse, the violence, people’s constitutional rights being violated,” Madera said.

Organizers hope that documentation can serve both as evidence in lawsuits or in immigration courts, and as proof to show the public how the Trump administration is conducting immigration enforcement operations.

“Many Americans do not want to see this type of violence — masked men in unmarked cars, armed to the teeth, going into communities and causing this terror,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.

In the fields

Federal agents staged massive immigration raids on a pair of California cannabis farms in the cities of Carpinteria and Camarillo on July 10, blocking roads with armored vehicles, launching tear gas and firing crowd control munitions at protesters.

Amid the chaos, Jaime Alanis Garcia — who had worked at Glass House Farms for a decade — was fleeing from immigration officers when he fell 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse, fracturing his neck and skull, according to NBC. Two days later, he died.

At those raids, federal agents arrested 361 people, including American citizen and U.S. Army veteran George Retes.

More than a quarter of the state’s large agricultural workforce is undocumented — and nearly two-thirds are immigrants, more generally — leaving hundreds of thousands of laborers vulnerable to immigration crackdowns at work.

Since even before the Glass House Farms raids, the United Farm Workers union has been reaching out to employers to suggest ways to protect their employees.

Elizabeth Strater, vice president of UFW, told Capital & Main that one of the simplest things farmers can do is put up gates and fences to keep intruders out. For large fields that are too difficult or costly to encircle, Strater recommends a more impromptu tactic that, ironically, is sometimes used by law enforcement.

“If you’re out in flat, open fields where you can’t put a gate, what you can do is have the foreman, or whoever, park their vehicle so that it prevents access (by) someone who may not have your workers’ best interest at heart,” Strater said.

Such physical barriers are critical, Strater said, because while workers who are in the U.S. illegally are protected by constitutional and statutory rights, federal agents have repeatedly been recorded ignoring basic protections.

Undocumented workers “have a right not to answer questions, but what happens when they assert that right is these absolutely unhinged, untrained, uncontrolled agents smash their windows and drag them out of their cars,” Strater said. “The utter lawlessness on behalf of these agencies is just extreme.”

Beyond providing employers with resources, UFW has taken legal action against the DHS, which Strater said has helped reduce the number of indiscriminate raids on farmworkers in certain areas of California.

Still, federal agencies can obtain criminal warrants to go after workers at specific sites, according to Strater.

Not all farm owners are taking action in response to workplace raids, but Strater said that most, including nonunionized operations, have been receptive to UFW’s recommendations. Some have even hosted community meetings to develop plans that could lessen the impact of immigration enforcement on workers and, by extension, the businesses that employ them, some of which have been hit by labor shortages triggered by the raids.

The factory floor

Many clothing manufacturing businesses in Los Angeles have also been open to outreach aimed at protecting employees, according to Daisy Gonzalez, campaign director at the Garment Worker Center.

“It’s a new sort of reaction to us. … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said. “But I think information about what to do in this moment, employers understand it’s a resource for both their workers and themselves.”

Since the high-profile raids in June, many of the Garment Worker Center’s members have been worried about being detained on the job. Some have opted to stay home from work — for months.

In response, Gonzalez said, the Garment Worker Center has significantly ramped up its mutual aid programs, providing financial assistance to affected employees and even delivering resources to home-bound workers.

One middle-aged undocumented worker in Los Angeles, who spoke to Capital & Main on the condition of anonymity for fear that immigration officials would detain him, said the garment factory where he was working closed permanently after immigration raids began. If it were not for the Garment Worker Center’s financial support, he added, he would not have been able to pay for food or rent.

“The raids have deeply affected me, both psychologically and economically,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “There’s panic in the streets. I try to leave the house as infrequently as I can. I speak for myself, but there are thousands of people just like me, many in worse situations. … This is a national emergency.”

Undocumented migrants aren’t the only ones potentially impacted by raids.

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that DHS officers could detain people based on their race, their use of Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence at locations such as car washes, agricultural or day labor sites.

The result is that many immigrants with residency, U.S. citizens and their American-born children can get caught up in aggressive raids. To Gonzalez, “Anyone who has a darker skin tone, or speaks a different language, or works in an industry that might be where certain people expect undocumented immigrants to work, are all targets.”

Serve and protect

On a busy street in L.A.’s Los Feliz neighborhood, customers line up to order tacos and burritos outside a small hut. Yuca’s is a modest operation with no inside seating, but it has been in business for nearly half a century, becoming a staple of the city’s Mexican-food scene and even winning a prestigious James Beard Foundation Award.

Dora Herrera, the restaurant’s co-owner, delights in being able to serve her local community, but since the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration raids began, she has worried intensely about Yuca’s customers, vendors and workers, whom she considers “family.”

Herrera sought advice from organizations like the Latino Restaurant Association about how to protect her staff, regardless of their immigration status, as she has seen reports of federal agents arresting U.S. citizens, green-card holders and immigrants with work permits.

She has provided her employees with Know Your Rights materials like red cards and, for the first time since the restaurant opened in 1976, installed signs on the outside of the building declaring it private property. The law requires officers to produce a warrant to gain access to private property.

“We haven’t been around for 50 years for nothing. You learn something, you adapt, and you keep adapting to make it work,” Herrera said.

Such measures are far from foolproof but, according to Herrera, it is incumbent on people like her to do what they can to keep vulnerable workers as safe as possible.

“We want to make sure everybody’s taken care of, protected, educated,” Herrera said. “As an employer, I believe you have to do everything, absolutely everything you can, to protect your people, even the smallest thing.”

TRUMP'S SHIFTING UKRAINE POLICY The Trump administration paused processing applications and renewals of the Ukrainian humanitarian program in January, citing security reasons.

Ukrainian immigrants in the United States find themselves in a precarious situation. With their legal residency in limbo, they are at risk of being deported, while many grapple with job losses and a lack of medical care.

Kateryna Golizdra has survived six months in legal limbo - so far. She thinks she can hold out another six months, waiting for Donald Trump's administration to decide the fate of a humanitarian program that allowed some 260,000 people who fled the war in Ukraine to live and work in the United States.

When her legal status lapsed in May, Golizdra, 35, automatically became vulnerable to deportation. She lost her work permit and was forced to leave a job earning over $50,000 a year as a manager at the Ritz-Carlton in Fort Lauderdale. Golizdra also lost the health insurance that she used to cover check-ups for a liver condition. And she can no longer send money to her mother, who was also displaced and lives in Germany, she said.

The Trump administration's processing delays on the humanitarian program for Ukrainians launched by former Democratic President Joe Biden left nearly 200,000 people at risk of losing their legal status as of March 31, according to internal U.S. government data reviewed by Reuters. The number of Ukrainians affected by the delays has not been previously reported.

The humanitarian program, introduced in April 2022, allowed nearly 260,000 Ukrainians into the U.S. for an initial two-year period. That's a small share of the 5.9 million Ukrainian refugees worldwide, 5.3 million of whom are in Europe, according to United Nations refugee figures.

Golizdra said she has no idea when - or if - her permission to stay in the United States might be renewed, threatening her short-lived sense of security in America.

Live Events

While she waits for an update on her application, she could potentially be arrested by federal immigration authorities, three former immigration officials said.

'CONSTANT STRESS'

The last six months have felt like she is on a ""hamster wheel,"" Golizdra said.

""It's a constant stress, anxiety,"" she said. ""If I will need to leave the States, then I will have to build something again.""

Reuters spoke with two dozen Ukrainians who lost their work permits - and their jobs - due to delays in processing renewals, including tech workers, a preschool teacher, a financial planner, an interior designer and a college student. They described digging into their savings, seeking out community support and taking on debt to support themselves while they wait for a decision on their status.

Some of the people interviewed by Reuters said they were worried they could be arrested by U.S. immigration authorities. Others said they were staying indoors, or had left the U.S. for Canada, Europe and South America.

Returning to Ukraine is not an option. Golizdra's home in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, was set ablaze in March 2022 when Russian troops stormed the city. After Ukrainian forces retook the town, they found hundreds of bodies, including of civilians who were victims of extrajudicial killings.

TRUMP'S SHIFTING UKRAINE POLICY

The Trump administration paused processing applications and renewals of the Ukrainian humanitarian program in January, citing security reasons.

After a contentious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump said in March that he was weighing whether to revoke the Ukrainians' legal status entirely - a plan first reported by Reuters.

Trump ultimately did not end the program and in May, a federal judge ordered officials to resume processing renewals.

But U.S. immigration officials have processed only 1,900 renewal applications for Ukrainians and other nationalities since then, a fraction of those with expiring status, according to U.S. government data released last week as part of a lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a spending package Trump signed into law in July added a $1,000 fee to such humanitarian applications - on top of a fee of $1,325 per individual.

The White House referred questions about the Ukrainian humanitarian program to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat in the Chicago area, said his office has received requests for assistance from more than 200 Ukrainians in limbo.

""There's a fear that if they haven't completed their application, if they haven't gone through the whole process, they're vulnerable for deportation,"" Quigley said.

Anne Smith, the executive director and regulatory counsel of the Ukraine Immigration Task Force, a legal coalition formed to aid those who fled the war to the U.S., said her attorney network was receiving multiple calls per week from Ukrainians saying they have family members detained by immigration authorities. She said Ukrainians have been arrested at construction sites, while doing food delivery or working as Uber or truck drivers, as well as in broader sweeps in Chicago and greater Cleveland.

Brian Snyder, a product marketing manager in Raleigh, North Carolina , who has sponsored three Ukrainian families , said people who followed the rules are being treated unfairly.

One Ukrainian woman recently asked if he would serve as her emergency contact if she was picked up by immigration officers, he said. He knew of another family where a teenage son's parole was renewed while the parents and two younger children were left waiting, he said.

""All of this dysfunction and uncertainty is just introducing a tremendous amount of stress in these families' lives,"" he said.

SOME UKRAINIANS 'SELF DEPORT'

Six of 24 Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters have left the U.S. rather than risk ending up in immigration jail or being sent to Latin America or Africa, as the Trump administration has done with other hard-to-deport immigrants.

Yevhenii Padafa, a 31-year-old software engineer who moved to Brooklyn in September 2023, applied to renew his status in March. His application sat pending until it expired in September.

Worried that he could be barred from the U.S. in the future if he remained without legal status, he tried to ""self deport"" using a government app known as CBP One.

The Trump administration in May promised a free outbound plane ticket and $1,000 ""exit bonus"" for those using the app.

Padafa decided to go to Argentina, which has a lower cost of living than other countries and offers a humanitarian program for Ukrainians. But the app would not book him a ticket there. A U.S. border official told him the flight would need to be booked to Ukraine, he said.

He was counting on the free flight and $1,000 bonus. Arriving in Buenos Aires in mid-November with little money, he planned to sell a laptop to cover initial rent for an apartment.

""If I return to Ukraine, I'll just go to the frontline,"" he said. ""I'd rather be homeless somewhere than go to Ukraine.""

The Trump administration has until mid-January to revoke the legal protection for Somalis nationally.
But that move would affect only a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of Somalis living in Minnesota.
“The truth is that the Somali community is beloved and long-woven into the fabric of many neighborhoods and communities in Minnesota,” said Altman.
The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.","President Donald Trump’s pledge to terminate temporary legal protections for Somalis living in Minnesota is triggering fear in the state’s deeply-rooted immigrant community, along with doubts about whether the White House has the legal authority to enact the directive as described.

In a Truth Social post late Friday, Trump said he would “immediately” strip Somali residents in Minnesota of Temporary Protected Status, a legal safeguard against deportation for immigrants from certain countries.

The announcement drew immediate pushback from some state leaders and immigration experts, who characterized Trump’s declaration as a legally dubious effort to sow fear and suspicion toward Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the nation.

“There’s no legal mechanism that allows the president to terminate protected status for a particular community or state that he has beef with,” said Heidi Altman, policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center.

“This is Trump doing what he always does: demagoguing immigrants without justification or evidence and using that demagoguery in an attempt to take away important life-saving protections,” she added.

The Trump administration has until mid-January to revoke the legal protection for Somalis nationally. But that move would affect only a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of Somalis living in Minnesota. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by TPS at just 705 nationwide.

“I am a citizen and so are (the) majority of Somalis in America,” Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Somali, said in a social media post Friday. “Good luck celebrating a policy change that really doesn’t have much impact on the Somalis you love to hate.”

Still, advocates warned the move could inflame hate against a community at a time of rising Islamophobia.

“This is not just a bureaucratic change,” said Jaylani Hussein, president of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “It is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

In his social media post, Trump claimed, without offering evidence, that Somali gangs had targeted Minnesota residents and referred to the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

Federal prosecutors have in recent weeks brought charges against dozens of people in a social-services fraud scheme. Some of the defendants hail from Somalia. “Accountability is coming,” Minnesota Republican Rep. Tom Emmer wrote in response to that story.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has noted that Minnesota consistently ranks among the safest states in the country.

“It’s not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community,” Walz said Friday. “This is what he does to change the subject.”

In response to Trump’s announcement, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison his office was “exploring all of our options,” adding that Trump “cannot terminate TPS for just one state or on a bigoted whim.”

“Somali folks came to Minnesota fleeing conflict, instability and famine, and they have become an integral part of our state, our culture and our community,” he added.

The protection has been extended 27 times for Somalians since 1991, with U.S. authorities determining that it was unsafe for people already in the United States to return there.

Somalia for decades has been regarded as one of the world’s most dangerous countries. People have been fleeing ever since leader Siad Barre was removed in 1991 by clan-based militias and civil war erupted. The chaos later led to the rise of the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group, which still holds parts of the country and carries out deadly attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere against the fragile federal government.

Community advocates note that the Somali diaspora in Minnesota has helped to revitalize downtown corridors in Minneapolis and plays a prominent role in the state’s politics.

“The truth is that the Somali community is beloved and long-woven into the fabric of many neighborhoods and communities in Minnesota,” said Altman. “Destabilizing families and communities makes all of us less safe and not more.”

As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.

Sylvester has been an active community member for many years in Rogers Park, which she refers to as “The People’s Republic of Rogers Park.” But she said it’s time for others to take the lead.","Following President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Evelyn Rodriguez, a social worker at a K-8 school on Chicago’s North Side, received a letter from one of her students. That student no longer attends school. No one in the community has seen or heard from this student or their family since.

The letter read: “Estoy triste porque las noticias están diciendo que me van a reportar y deportar a Ecuador.” The student was saddened by news reports about Trump’s deportation threats, and thought they would soon be deported from their Rogers Park neighborhood to Ecuador.

In September, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began Operation Midway Blitz, in which they detained children and adults presumed to be undocumented immigrants, often with force.

The ongoing detentions prompted local activists to organize to protect their neighbors. Protect Rogers Park, a community group formed in 2017, has led ICE watch training and connects impacted families with aid services.

“This is probably the first time we’ve really had to activate in such an intense way,” said Torrence Gardner, a founding member of Protect Rogers Park.

Gardner said the group has witnessed at least 10 immigrant detentions in the neighborhood since federal agents arrived in the city. Group members call them “abductions.”

Rodriguez, who has attended Protect Rogers Park events, said her school has also seen a decrease in enrollment by over 100 students. Others who remain enrolled are completing work at home on school-provided Chromebooks because they said in-person attendance no longer feels safe for them.

Rodriguez said several parents are also missing necessary meetings with school staff because they are worried about their safety while transporting themselves to the school. She says the school’s Halloween Trunk or Treat event was cancelled because federal agents were present in the school’s parking lot.

“They’re missing out on socialization. They’re missing out on peer relationships, emotional regulation. They are missing out on so much that they need in the early stages of development,” Rodriguez said. “I am upset because all I can say is ‘I am sorry.’”

These are just a few ways that families’ lives have changed because of Operation Midway Blitz.

Gardner says ICE has used a tactic known as “staging,” — prohibited by Mayor Johnson’s “ICE Free Zone” executive order — when city parking lots, vacant lots and garages are used for mobilizing or deploying immigration personnel.

Protect Rogers Park has never seen anything like it before.

“We adjusted pretty quickly, and this is the biggest turnout we’ve ever had, with thousands of volunteers,” Gardner said.

In response, Protect Rogers Park volunteers have organized school patrols to help parents and students get home safely, and they have distributed whistles to blow when agents are spotted. They also organize events, such as training sessions, educational webinars and “B*tch and Wine,” an event where community members are invited to rant about anything going on in their lives over a glass of wine.

After Operation Midway Blitz began, neighbors immediately gathered for a rally, and traffic on the group’s social media posts surged.

“We haven’t seen that level of intensity ever,” Gardner said.

Joey Sylvester, another early member of Protect Rogers Park, sees herself as a community facilitator within the group. She can often be spotted at Protect Rogers Park events, handing out the now-recognizable orange whistles, gathering contact information and answering questions about provided services and volunteer opportunities.

Sylvester, who is 79, has spent most of her adult life in volunteer work and activism. In the late 1960s, she protested the Vietnam War. She has worked to help formerly homeless women and mothers whose children have been murdered. Sylvester credits her work to how she was raised and also to her sons.

“I have two sons who are Black, and so to me, on a selfish level, part of my organizing since they’ve been with us, is also related to that struggle,” Sylvester said.

In 1982, Sylvester was part of Wellington United Church of Christ, which was one of the first public sanctuaries beyond the Mexico border to welcome migrants from Guatemala and El Salvador without documents.

When Trump was elected to his first term in office, Sylvester received a mass call to action from Protect Rogers Park co-founders Gabe González and Marissa Graciosa. She responded immediately, walking down to Living Water Church into a room of more than 300 people.

“We really got organized. We canvassed neighbors about Know Your Rights. We started to form different teams to work on different aspects of the resistance,” she said. “We had community events. We did training back then in self-defense and ICE Watch.”

There was not much ICE activity or work for the group until last December, after Trump’s reelection, when Sylvester sat with the other group founders and volunteers. They asked themselves, “What are we going to do now? Do we still have the capacity to do this work?”

The answer was yes — but at that point, they had no idea what the neighborhood would be facing.

“This context is very different because of the risks and the brutality we’re seeing now,” Sylvester said.

The group’s safety efforts meet community needs in a few ways, members say. Volunteer escorts usually don’t prevent detainment, but Gardner said they can act as a deterrent.

Volunteers film interactions between ICE and community members so Protect Rogers Park can follow up to see what can be done for detainees. They also try to notify family members and warn other neighbors and neighborhoods. Gardner and others say the school patrols provide a feeling of safety for children and families.

But feelings of safety can’t guarantee it.

On Nov. 5, ICE went into a day care in the North Center neighborhood and detained a teacher in front of children, sparking conversation between Protect Rogers Park organizers about ways to help families find safe childcare and other services.

“We need more people to keep stepping up because people are getting tired — more and more hands and eyes and ears, because this is far from over,” Gardner said.

Gardner is no stranger to activism. The grandson of a civil rights activist and Chicago Lesbian Hall of Fame inductee, Gardner’s own work began when he was 23, fresh out of college and living in St. Louis.

“I got involved in the Black Lives Matter stuff, but it wasn’t Black Lives Matter yet,” Gardner said. “It was … a kid who was killed by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri.”

Riots in Ferguson over the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown marked the start of the Black Lives Matter movement.

“And I was there,” Gardner said.

Sylvester has been an active community member for many years in Rogers Park, which she refers to as “The People’s Republic of Rogers Park.” But she said it’s time for others to take the lead.

“I’m honored I’m still able to do it … at my age,” she said. “I’m able to still physically and mentally hang together with the younger people who are part of the future. It’s up to them to carry it forward.”

But just as Rodriguez worries for her sons and her neighbors, she continues to worry about her students.

“This is what social work has come to now because our systems are broken,” she said. “Our systems are not working.”

Despite the unprecedented challenges her students are facing, she is “so proud of the families that are continuing to show up to school, that are continuing to pursue their education.”

Through it all, members of the Protect Rogers Park community have also shown up for students and their promise to continue their efforts until all can feel safe at school and in their homes is clear.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in the east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting temporary protective status (TPS) in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the homeland security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” The chapter’s executive director, Jaylani Hussein, said in a statement late Friday: “This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

The department reiterated that ICE does not target schools or children, and any enforcement action at schools would require secondary supervisor approval and would be extremely rare.

“The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement. These smears are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing 1,000% increase in assaults against them,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

The Appellate Division, Third Department’s decision in Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC, 2025 NY Slip Op 06370 (Nov. 20, 2025), addresses two recurrent and practically important issues in New York workers’ compensation and third-party practice:

When is a workers’ compensation carrier’s consent required for a settlement of a related third-party action under Workers’ Compensation Law (§) 29(5)?

Which forum has authority to equitably apportion litigation expenses (counsel fees and costs) between the claimant and carrier under § 29(1), the Workers’ Compensation Board or the court in which the third-party action was brought?

The case arises out of a fatal work-related motor vehicle accident. The decedent’s spouse, claimant Sally Rorapaugh, pursued two parallel avenues:

a New York workers’ compensation death benefits claim, and

a federal third-party wrongful death action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.

After a substantial $9 million third-party settlement (with a net recovery of approximately $5.9 million to the claimant), the employer and its workers’ compensation carrier challenged both:

the validity of the settlement for lack of carrier consent, and

the Workers’ Compensation Board’s authority to calculate the carrier’s equitable share of litigation expenses and award “fresh money” to the claimant.

The Third Department:

affirmed the Board’s conclusion that the carrier’s consent to the settlement was not required, because the settlement far exceeded the total statutory workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable; but

reversed the Board’s determination that it could equitably apportion litigation costs and award the claimant $113,631.55 in “fresh money,” holding that only the court in which the third-party action was instituted has jurisdiction under § 29(1) to make that equitable apportionment.

This commentary examines the opinion’s reasoning, its grounding in prior precedents such as McComber, Kelly, Burns, and Stenson, and its likely impact on New York workers’ compensation and third-party practice. In particular, the decision crystallizes two important principles:

Consent Threshold Rule: Where a claimant’s third-party settlement substantially exceeds the full statutory value of potential workers’ compensation benefits, carrier consent under § 29(5) is not required.

Exclusive Judicial Apportionment Rule: Absent agreement, the equitable apportionment of litigation expenses under § 29(1) must be obtained by motion to the court in which the third-party action was instituted; the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to make that apportionment and award “fresh money.”

II. Factual and Procedural Background

A. The Fatal Accident and Workers’ Compensation Claim

In July 2019, claimant’s spouse (the “decedent”) was killed in a motor vehicle accident while acting in the course of his employment. The claimant (his widow) filed a claim for workers’ compensation death benefits in August 2019.

B. The Third-Party Wrongful Death Action

In July 2020, claimant also commenced a third-party wrongful death action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, naming the driver and owner of the other involved vehicle as defendants. This action was brought pursuant to Workers’ Compensation Law § 29, which preserves an injured worker’s or dependent’s right to sue a negligent third party while receiving workers’ compensation benefits.

C. Settlement, Stipulation of Dismissal, and Jurisdictional Complications

The third-party action was settled for $9 million. As the Workers’ Compensation Board later noted (fn. 2), the claimant’s net recovery after fees and costs was approximately $5.9 million.

In February 2021, the parties to the third-party action filed a stipulation of dismissal in the District Court, which the court granted. Crucially, the stipulation did not inform the court that the action had been settled.

After dismissal, claimant attempted on August 27, 2021 to obtain a compromise order from the District Court under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5), apparently in an effort to substitute judicial approval for the carrier’s consent. As the Appellate Division recounts in footnote 1:

Although claimant had attempted to get a compromise order from District Court in lieu of the carrier's consent on August 27, 2021 (see Workers' Compensation Law § 29 [5]), the court rejected the request based upon the fact that, in their stipulation seeking dismissal of the third-party action, the parties failed to inform the court that the action had been settled and, in light of the court's subsequent dismissal of the action, it no longer had jurisdiction to make a compromise order.

This sequence created a significant procedural trap: the third-party court had already dismissed the case without being made aware of the settlement, and later refused to issue a compromise order for lack of jurisdiction.

D. The Carrier’s Post-Settlement Objections

In August 2021, after learning that the third-party action had in fact been settled, the employer and its workers’ compensation carrier (collectively, the “carrier”) argued:

They had not consented to the settlement as required under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5).

Their payments on the workers’ compensation claim should therefore be discontinued.

Further benefits to claimant were barred by § 29.

E. Proceedings Before the WCLJ and the Workers' Compensation Board

Following hearings, the Workers’ Compensation Law Judge (WCLJ) determined, among other things, that:

The carrier’s consent was not necessary because the amount claimant received in the settlement exceeded the total workers’ compensation benefits to which she was entitled.

The WCLJ set payments at a temporary total disability rate, subject to the carrier’s lien and any lien reduction.

On administrative appeal, the Workers’ Compensation Board modified the WCLJ’s decision:

It affirmed that the carrier’s consent was not necessary.

It rejected the carrier’s assertion that the Board lacked jurisdiction to calculate the lien reduction.

It calculated:

the carrier’s lien on claimant’s benefits as $109,402.81, and

the carrier’s apportioned share of claimant’s third-party litigation expenses as $223,934.36.

Because the carrier’s equitable share of litigation costs exceeded its lien, the Board concluded that the carrier owed claimant an additional $113,631.55 in “fresh money.”

The Board rescinded the WCLJ’s temporary total disability classification but otherwise allowed weekly benefits to continue, subject to the carrier’s credit.

F. Appeal to the Appellate Division, Third Department

The carrier appealed to the Appellate Division, challenging:

The Board’s conclusion that the carrier’s consent under § 29(5) was not required for the third-party settlement.

The Board’s jurisdiction and method of calculating the lien reduction and the $113,631.55 “fresh money” award.

III. Summary of the Court’s Opinion

Justice Aarons, writing for a unanimous panel (Clark, J.P., Pritzker, Reynolds Fitzgerald and McShan, JJ., concurring), issued a decision that:

A. On Consent to Settlement (§ 29(5))

Reaffirmed that under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5), carrier consent to a third-party settlement is required “only if the settlement is for less than the statutory amount of compensation benefits.” (quoting McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402, 403 [1st Dept 2006]).

Accepted the Board’s finding that the full value of claimant’s potential death benefits over her remaining life expectancy was approximately $1.2 million.

Held that the net settlement of approximately $5.9 million so vastly exceeded this figure that, even if claimant outlived her life expectancy, consent was not required.

B. On Lien Reduction and Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses (§ 29(1))

Restated that a compensation carrier has:

a lien on the third-party recovery to the extent of past benefits paid, and

a right to offset future workers’ compensation benefits by the amount of the claimant’s net recovery.

Reaffirmed that the carrier must pay its equitable share of the claimant’s litigation expenses, which is assessed based on the total benefit the carrier derives (both lien and future credit) from the claimant’s recovery (per Kelly, Brisson, and Burns).

But emphasized that under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1), where the parties do not agree, the equitable apportionment of legal expenses must be made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted, not by the Workers’ Compensation Board.

Held that, in light of the statute and claimant’s failure to obtain carrier consent, her “only recourse” for equitable apportionment was to move in the federal District Court for such an order.

Concluded that, under these circumstances, the Board lacked jurisdiction to determine the equitable apportionment of costs and to award the claimant $113,631.55 in fresh money.

C. Disposition

The Court ordered:

ORDERED that the decision is modified, without costs, by reversing so much thereof as held that claimant was entitled to $113,631.55; matter remitted to the Workers' Compensation Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's decision; and, as so modified, affirmed.

Thus:

The no-consent-required ruling stands.

The Board’s apportionment and fresh money award is reversed.

The matter returns to the Board to administer benefits and lien/credit issues consistent with the Appellate Division’s jurisdictional holding.

IV. Legal Framework: Workers’ Compensation Law § 29

A. Dual-Track Recovery: Workers’ Compensation and Third-Party Actions

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29 allows an injured worker or, in death cases, the decedent’s dependents to:

receive workers’ compensation benefits from the employer/carrier (a no-fault, statutory remedy), while

also suing a negligent third party for full tort damages (e.g., pain and suffering, wrongful death damages).

B. The Carrier’s Two Key Benefits Under § 29

Under New York law (as synthesized in Kelly, Brisson, Burns, and Stenson), the carrier receives two distinct statutory benefits from a claimant’s third-party recovery:

Past Benefits Lien (§ 29(1))

The carrier has a lien on the third-party recovery to the extent of compensation and medical benefits already paid. The claimant must satisfy this lien out of the gross recovery.

Future Benefits Offset (§ 29(4))

The carrier may offset (suspend or reduce) future compensation payments until the claimant’s net recovery is exhausted. In substance, the third-party tortfeasor (rather than the carrier) funds the claimant’s future stream of benefits, to the extent of the net recovery.

C. Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses (§ 29(1))

Because the carrier’s lien and future offset are both benefits directly flowing from the claimant’s (and her counsel’s) efforts in the third-party litigation, the Court of Appeals in Matter of Kelly v State Ins. Fund, 60 NY2d 131 (1983), held that equity requires the carrier to bear an appropriate share of the litigation expenses proportionate to the benefit it receives.

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1) contains the statutory mechanism:

Should the [claimant] secure a recovery from [a third party], whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, such [claimant] may apply on notice to such lienor to the court in which the third-party action was instituted ... for an order apportioning the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including [counsel] fees, incurred in effecting such recovery. Such expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the court between the [claimant] and the lienor.

Thus, when the parties do not agree on how to divide litigation costs between the claimant and the carrier, the statute directs that the court where the third-party action was brought resolve the issue.

D. Consent to Settlement (§ 29(5))

Separate from cost apportionment, § 29(5) governs when a third-party settlement requires carrier consent (or a court “compromise order”) to preserve the claimant’s entitlement to ongoing workers’ compensation benefits. Courts have construed § 29(5) to require consent:

only when the settlement is for less than the total “statutory amount of compensation benefits” potentially payable under the Workers’ Compensation Law; and

no consent is required when the settlement is for more than that statutory amount.

The leading statement of this rule is McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402 (1st Dept 2006), which is central to the Rorapaugh court’s analysis.

V. Precedents Cited and Their Influence

A. McComber v Lehrer McGovern Bovis, Inc., 28 AD3d 402 (1st Dept 2006)

In McComber, the First Department held that carrier consent under § 29(5) is required “only if the settlement is for less than the statutory amount of compensation benefits.” The rationale is that if a claimant’s settlement is greater than the total workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable, the carrier suffers no prejudice from the settlement – the recovery fully covers both past and prospective compensation exposure.

In Rorapaugh, the Third Department directly quotes and applies this rule. The Board had calculated the full value of claimant’s future death benefits based on her age and life expectancy (~$1.2 million). Because the net settlement was about $5.9 million, the court saw no realistic scenario in which the carrier would be disadvantaged:

Even if, as the carrier argues, claimant lives beyond her estimated life expectancy, given the significant disparity between what she would collect in benefits in her lifetime and the $5.9 million she received in the settlement, the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement was not necessary (see Workers' Compensation Law § 29 [5]; McComber, 28 AD3d at 403).

Thus McComber provides the doctrinal backbone for the consent holding in Rorapaugh.

B. Matter of Kelly v State Ins. Fund, 60 NY2d 131 (1983)

Kelly is the foundational case on how to apportion litigation expenses between claimants and carriers. It established that:

the carrier’s lien for past benefits paid entitles it to reimbursement from the recovery; but

the carrier must pay its equitable share of litigation expenses on both:

the reimbursement (lien), and

the benefit of not having to pay future compensation (future offset).

The Court of Appeals recognized that absent such sharing, the carrier would receive a “free ride” on the claimant’s litigation efforts. Therefore, litigation costs must be apportioned based on the carrier’s total benefit from the recovery.

In Rorapaugh, Kelly is cited for two key points:

As authority that the carrier’s equitable share of expenses is proportionate to the total benefit it derives from the claimant’s recovery (60 NY2d at 135–36).

As authority that the court (not the Board) is the ultimate decision-maker on equitable apportionment under § 29(1) (60 NY2d at 138).

Thus, Kelly underpins both:

the substance of the apportionment rules, and

the jurisdictional allocation of the apportionment decision to the third-party court.

C. Matter of Brisson v County of Onondaga, 6 NY3d 273 (2006)

Brisson reiterated that the carrier’s benefit includes both:

its lien for past payments, and

its right to offset future benefits.

The decision clarified aspects of the formula for calculating the carrier’s share and reinforced that the apportionment must consider the entire economic benefit the carrier receives from the third-party recovery.

In Rorapaugh, Brisson is cited in the string of authorities supporting the standard understanding of lien and future offset under § 29, and the need to apportion litigation expenses accordingly.

D. Burns v Varriale, 9 NY3d 207 (2007)

Burns refined Kelly by addressing cases where future benefits are speculative or not fixed, such as non-schedule permanent partial disability claims. The Court of Appeals held:

The carrier’s share of litigation costs attributable to uncertain future benefits may need to be reassessed over time, rather than set once and for all at the time of settlement.

The essential principle remains: the carrier must share, proportionately, in the costs of achieving the recovery from which it benefits.

In Rorapaugh, Burns is cited:

to reaffirm that the carrier’s offset of future benefits must be taken into account in apportioning litigation expenses (9 NY3d at 215), and

as part of the authority supporting the view that equitable apportionment is a judicial, not administrative, function (9 NY3d at 214).

E. Matter of Stenson v New York State Dept. of Transp., 84 AD3d 22 (3d Dept 2011)

Stenson is a Third Department decision that elaborated on:

the dual benefits to carriers under § 29 (lien and future offset), and

the need to consider the future offset when apportioning litigation expenses.

Notably, Stenson acknowledged that § 29(1) assigns equitable apportionment of expenses to the court, but in practice the Workers’ Compensation Board has often been involved in related calculations, especially concerning:

determining the amount of the carrier’s future credit, and

implementing or adjusting the credit as benefits resume or are modified.

In Rorapaugh, Stenson is cited for:

describing the carrier’s dual benefits and the need to take the future offset into account in apportioning costs (84 AD3d at 24–25); and

the principle that “the ultimate determination of the equitable apportionment of legal expenses resides in the courts vested with the powers of fact finding and the exercise of a sound discretion” (84 AD3d at 26).

The Court adds “compare Stenson” when declaring that the Board has no jurisdiction to apportion expenses in the circumstances of Rorapaugh, signaling that Stenson should not be read as granting the Board general jurisdiction to perform Kelly/Burns apportionments absent judicial involvement.

F. Becker v Huss Co., 43 NY2d 527 (1978)

Becker is an earlier Court of Appeals decision dealing with § 29 liens and third-party recoveries. It is cited in Rorapaugh (along with Kelly and Burns) as part of the authority that apportionment of expenses is to be made by the court where the third-party action was instituted.

G. Minkowitz Practice Commentaries

The opinion references Martin Minkowitz’s Practice Commentaries to Workers’ Compensation Law § 29 for the proposition that:

An application to the court on notice to the lienor may be made to apportion such expenses if an agreement on such amount cannot be reached.

This reinforces the understanding that § 29(1) provides a judicial remedy—by motion in the third-party court—when the parties cannot agree on the carrier’s share of litigation expenses.

VI. Legal Reasoning of the Court

A. Consent to Settlement: Applying § 29(5) and McComber

1. The “Statutory Amount of Compensation Benefits”

Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5) is intended to protect carriers from prejudice where a claimant’s settlement with a third-party tortfeasor could be inadequate to fully fund both:

the carrier’s lien for past benefits, and

the carrier’s exposure for future benefits.

Under the now-settled interpretation from McComber, carrier consent is required only when the settlement is for less than the full statutory amount of workers’ compensation benefits that might be payable over the life of the claim.

In a death case such as Rorapaugh, this involves projecting:

the weekly death benefits payable (typically two-thirds of wages, subject to statutory caps), and

the claimant’s life expectancy (or other statutory duration),

to arrive at the total expected present value of the workers’ compensation obligation.

2. Applying the Consent Threshold in Rorapaugh

The Board determined, based on “credible evidence of claimant's age and life expectancy,” that the full value of her lifetime death benefits was about $1.2 million. The Appellate Division accepted this factual finding.

The Board further found that claimant’s net third-party recovery (after fees and costs) was about $5.9 million—almost five times the projected value of her compensation benefits.

The carrier argued that claimant might live beyond her statistical life expectancy, and thus the actual benefits payable could exceed the projected $1.2 million. The Court rejected this argument as insufficient to trigger the consent requirement:

Even if, as the carrier argues, claimant lives beyond her estimated life expectancy, given the significant disparity between what she would collect in benefits in her lifetime and the $5.9 million she received in the settlement, the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement was not necessary.

The Court thus signaled that:

Speculative possibilities that the claimant might outlive life expectancy do not defeat the conclusion that a settlement many times greater than the projected benefit adequately protects the carrier’s interest.

The standard is a practical, comparative one: when the settlement far exceeds the (reasonably estimated) statutory benefit exposure, consent is not required.

B. Jurisdiction to Apportion Litigation Expenses: § 29(1) and the Board’s Role

1. The Statutory Text and Judicial Role

The Court focuses closely on the text of Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(1), which:

gives the carrier a lien on the third-party recovery for past benefits paid;

authorizes the claimant to apply “to the court in which the third-party action was instituted” for equitable apportionment of litigation expenses; and

mandates that “[s]uch expenditures shall be equitably apportioned by the court between the [claimant] and the lienor.”

The Court emphasizes earlier holdings that:

Under the statute, then, the ultimate determination of the equitable apportionment of legal expenses resides in the courts vested with the powers of fact finding and the exercise of a sound discretion.

(citing Stenson and Kelly).

2. The Board’s Lack of Jurisdiction in Rorapaugh

The Workers’ Compensation Board had taken the position that it could calculate the carrier’s equitable share of litigation expenses (and therefore determine that the carrier’s share exceeded its lien, requiring a fresh money payment of $113,631.55).

The Appellate Division disagreed, focusing on two elements:

The explicit statutory directive that apportionment be made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted (here, the District Court for the Northern District of New York); and

The claimant’s failure to obtain the carrier’s consent to the settlement agreement.

The Court concluded:

In light of the statutory language of Workers' Compensation Law § 29 (1) and the failure of claimant to obtain the carrier's consent to the settlement agreement, we conclude that her only recourse in obtaining the equitable apportionment of her legal expenses in the third-party action is to move for such an order in District Court (see Burns, 9 NY3d at 214; Kelly, 60 NY2d at 138; Becker, 43 NY2d 527, 544 [1978]); compare Stenson, 84 AD3d at 26).

From this, the Court draws the controlling jurisdictional conclusion:

Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the equitable apportionment of claimant's costs and expenses, and its finding that claimant be awarded $113,631.55 in fresh money must be reversed.

Thus, the Court holds that the Board cannot stand in for the third-party court in performing a Kelly/Burns apportionment when:

no carrier consent was obtained, and

no judicial apportionment order has been made by the court in which the third-party action was instituted.

3. The Role of the Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court (Footnote 3)

The record showed that claimant had also petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of York County, Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Division for approval of the $9 million wrongful death settlement and allocation among:

claimant,

decedent’s heirs, and

claimant’s attorneys.

The Orphans’ Court granted that petition. However, the Appellate Division notes in footnote 3:

Insofar, however, as the court was not the one in which the third-party action was instituted, it does not satisfy the requirements of Workers' Compensation Law § 29 (1).

This underscores that for purposes of New York’s workers’ compensation lien and cost apportionment:

Approval by another court (even one overseeing wrongful death settlement and distribution in another state) is not a substitute for the specific § 29(1) apportionment by the court where the New York third-party action was actually brought.

4. The Jurisdictional Trap: Dismissal Before § 29(1) Motion

The procedural history reveals a practical problem:

The District Court had already dismissed the third-party action, without being told that a settlement was reached.

It later refused to issue a compromise order under § 29(5) for lack of jurisdiction (fn. 1).

Yet the Appellate Division now says claimant’s only recourse for equitable apportionment of litigation expenses is to “move for such an order in District Court.”

The opinion does not address directly how the District Court might reacquire jurisdiction over the dismissed action (e.g., via a motion to reopen, modification of the dismissal order, or reliance on ancillary jurisdiction). Nonetheless, for New York law purposes, only that court can issue the § 29(1) apportionment order; the Workers’ Compensation Board may not.

This creates a strong cautionary lesson for practitioners: do not stipulate to dismissal of the third-party action before obtaining the necessary § 29(1) and § 29(5) orders, or at least ensuring the court retains jurisdiction to enter them.

VII. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. What is a “Lien” in this Context?

When a workers’ compensation carrier pays benefits, and the claimant later recovers money from a negligent third party, the carrier has a lien on the recovery. This means:

The claimant must use part of the third-party recovery to reimburse the carrier for the benefits already paid.

The lien amount is simply: all compensation and medical payments made up to the time of the recovery.

B. What is the “Future Benefits Offset”?

After a third-party recovery, the claimant typically ends up with a “net” recovery (after fees, costs, and lien reimbursement). Under § 29(4):

The carrier can stop or reduce paying future workers’ compensation benefits until the claimant’s net recovery is used up (in theory).

During this period, the third-party settlement, not the carrier, is effectively paying the claimant’s loss of earnings and other compensable losses.

This future credit is a substantial benefit to the carrier; it is part of what must be considered in apportioning litigation costs.

C. What is “Equitable Apportionment of Litigation Expenses”?

Litigation expenses include:

attorney’s fees (often one-third or 40% contingency),

court costs, and

other necessary expenses (experts, discovery, etc.).

The principle from Kelly and § 29(1) is that when a claimant’s lawsuit benefits the carrier (through lien reimbursement and future offset), the carrier should pay a proportionate share of those expenses. This prevents the carrier from receiving a “free ride.”

“Equitable apportionment” is thus:

a fair division of litigation expenses between claimant and carrier,

based on the relative economic benefit each receives from the third-party recovery.

D. What is “Fresh Money”?

“Fresh money” is shorthand used in workers’ compensation practice for a situation where:

The carrier’s fair share of litigation expenses (based on its total benefit) is greater than its lien for past payments.

In that case, after applying the carrier’s share of expenses against the lien, there is a remainder that the carrier must pay the claimant—money the claimant would not otherwise receive from the recovery itself.

In Rorapaugh, the Board concluded that:

lien = $109,402.81; and

carrier’s share of litigation expenses = $223,934.36.

Because the latter exceeded the former by $113,631.55, the Board ordered the carrier to pay that difference as “fresh money.” The Appellate Division reversed this, not because “fresh money” is conceptually improper, but because the Board lacked jurisdiction to decide the apportionment at all.

E. What is a “Compromise Order” Under § 29(5)?

If a settlement is for less than the total statutory amount of compensation benefits, § 29(5) requires either:

the carrier’s written consent to the settlement, or

in lieu of consent, a court order approving (“compromising”) the settlement.

This order is often referred to as a “compromise order.” It is typically obtained from the court overseeing the third-party action. In Rorapaugh, the District Court refused to issue such an order because the case had already been dismissed and it deemed itself without jurisdiction (fn. 1).

VIII. Impact and Practical Implications

A. Clarifying When Carrier Consent is Unnecessary

Rorapaugh reinforces and slightly refines the consent rule under § 29(5):

Consent is not required when the third-party settlement substantially exceeds the full projected statutory benefits.

Courts are willing to rely on reasonable life expectancy projections and will not be swayed by highly speculative arguments that the claimant might dramatically outlive those projections—especially when the settlement is multiple times larger than the projected benefits.

For practitioners:

In high-value settlements (like the $9 million gross / $5.9 million net recovery here), carrier consent may not be a legal prerequisite to preserving continuing compensation rights.

However, counsel should still carefully document the calculation of the statutory benefit value and consider proactively addressing this with the carrier to avoid later disputes.

B. A Firm Line on Jurisdiction: Only the Third-Party Court Can Apportion Litigation Expenses

The decision has significant implications for the division of authority between:

the Workers’ Compensation Board, and

the courts where third-party suits are filed.

Key takeaways:

Equitable apportionment of litigation expenses under § 29(1) is a judicial function. The statute explicitly assigns it to “the court in which the third-party action was instituted.”

The Workers’ Compensation Board cannot unilaterally fill this role, at least where there is no carrier consent and no prior judicial apportionment order.

Without a court order apportioning litigation expenses, the Board must treat the lien and credit calculations accordingly—likely giving the carrier the benefit of a full lien and credit until a judicial apportionment order is entered.

Practically, this means:

When settling a third-party action, claimant’s counsel must address apportionment with the court before dismissal, either by:

obtaining a specific § 29(1) Kelly/Burns order apportioning costs, or

embedding an apportionment determination in the settlement approval order.

Relying on the Workers’ Compensation Board to later adjust for the carrier’s share of costs risks leaving the claimant without a remedy, especially if the third-party action has already been dismissed.

C. Implications for Federal Courts and Multi-Jurisdictional Settlements

The third-party action here was in federal court (NDNY), and additional approval was obtained from a Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court. The Appellate Division’s treatment has several implications:

Federal courts hearing New York-based third-party actions must be prepared to entertain § 29(1) motions for apportionment of litigation expenses.

Parties should ensure that any stipulation of dismissal expressly:

acknowledges the existence of a settlement, and

either (a) attaches the § 29(1) order, or (b) retains the court’s jurisdiction to enter such an order.

Approval orders from other courts—such as a Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court order approving a wrongful death settlement and distribution—do not satisfy § 29(1). The apportionment must come from the court “in which the third-party action was instituted.”

D. Tension With Prior Administrative Practice and Stenson

Historically, the Workers’ Compensation Board has sometimes engaged in practical, formula-based implementation of Kelly/Burns apportionments in the absence of court orders, especially where the parties acquiesced or did not raise jurisdictional objections.

Rorapaugh marks a firm doctrinal clarification:

Even if the Board can administer the consequences of a Kelly/Burns apportionment (e.g., by calculating future credits once a judicial apportionment is in place),

it cannot itself decide the equitable apportionment of litigation expenses when the parties disagree and no court order exists.

By citing Stenson and then saying “compare,” the Third Department indicates that:

Stenson should be read consistently with § 29(1)’s text and with Kelly/Burns,

rather than as granting the Board general authority to perform Kelly/Burns apportionments in disputed cases.

E. Procedural Best Practices Going Forward

For claimant’s counsel and carriers alike, Rorapaugh highlights several best practices:

Quantify the Statutory Benefit Exposure

Before settlement, calculate the projected total statutory workers’ compensation benefit exposure (using wage rate, statutory caps, and life expectancy). This is critical to:

determining whether carrier consent is legally required under § 29(5), and

negotiating with the carrier on consent issues if the settlement is near or below that threshold.

Secure § 29(1) and § 29(5) Orders Before Dismissal

Do not stipulate to dismissal of the third-party action before:

obtaining any necessary compromise order under § 29(5), and

obtaining a § 29(1) order apportioning litigation expenses (Kelly/Burns order), or ensuring the court retains jurisdiction to enter one.

Do Not Rely on the Board to Fix Apportionment Later

Given Rorapaugh, the Board cannot unilaterally determine equitable apportionment in contested cases. If no judicial apportionment order is obtained, the claimant may be left with:

a full lien,

a full future credit, and

no mechanism before the Board to compel the carrier to share litigation expenses.

Coordinate in Multi-State Situations

When wrongful death settlements require approval in another state’s court (e.g., an Orphans’ Court), ensure that this is in addition to, not in place of, a § 29(1) motion in the New York (or federal) court where the third-party action is pending.

IX. Broader Doctrinal Significance

Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC does not radically change New York law, but it significantly clarifies and sharpens existing doctrines in two ways:

Consent Threshold in High-Value Settlements

The case reinforces that § 29(5) consent is a protective device for carriers in cases of inadequate settlements, not a veto power they can exercise over generous settlements that substantially exceed their statutory exposure. It underscores a pragmatic, comparative approach based on the magnitude of the settlement vs. projected benefits.

Exclusive Judicial Role in Kelly/Burns Apportionment

By holding that the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to equitably apportion litigation expenses and award fresh money, the court:

reaffirms the centrality of § 29(1)’s directive that apportionment be performed by the court where the third-party action was instituted; and

places responsibility squarely on litigants and the third-party court to address and resolve apportionment issues at the time of settlement or shortly thereafter.

The decision thus streamlines the division of labor:

Courts (state or federal, depending on where the third-party action was filed) decide:

whether to approve compromise settlements when required, and

how to equitably apportion litigation expenses between claimant and carrier.

The Workers’ Compensation Board applies and administers:

the carrier’s lien and credit consistent with § 29 and any court orders, and

continuing benefit entitlements, classifications, and rates, subject to the carrier’s lien and offset rights.

X. Conclusion

Matter of Rorapaugh v New Penn Motor Express LLC is a significant Third Department decision that:

reaffirms that carrier consent under Workers’ Compensation Law § 29(5) is required only when a third-party settlement is less than the total statutory workers’ compensation benefits potentially payable, and

holds that the Workers’ Compensation Board lacks jurisdiction to equitably apportion litigation expenses and award fresh money under § 29(1); such apportionment must be sought by motion in the court where the third-party action was instituted.

For practitioners, the decision offers both comfort and caution:

Comfort in knowing that high-value settlements that substantially exceed projected benefit exposures will not be undone for lack of carrier consent.

Caution that failure to secure a § 29(1) apportionment order before the third-party action is dismissed may leave the claimant without any administrative forum to enforce the carrier’s obligation to share litigation costs.

In the broader legal context, Rorapaugh consolidates the Court of Appeals’ Kelly/Brisson/Burns line and aligns Third Department practice with the statutory text of § 29. It underscores that equitable sharing of litigation costs is a judicial responsibility, while the Board’s role is to administer the resulting liens, credits, and benefits within the workers’ compensation system.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 11:58:30.645911

A 2-1 panel of the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit declined to put on hold the central part of a ruling by a lower-court judge who had found that the administration’s policies violated the due process rights of immigrants who could be apprehended anywhere in the US.

The US district judge Jia Cobb in an 29 August ruling sided with an immigrant rights group and blocked the US Department of Homeland Security from enforcing policies that exposed immigrants to the risk of rapid expulsion if the administration believed they had been in the country for less than two years.

The administration asked the DC circuit to stay that ruling while it appealed.

But the US circuit judges Patricia Millett and J Michelle Childs said the administration was unlikely to succeed in showing that its systems and procedures adequately protected immigrants’ due process rights under the US constitution’s fifth amendment.

The judges, both appointees of Democratic presidents, cited “serious risks of erroneous summary removal” posed by the administration’s effort to expand the fast-track deportation process away from the borders to cover the entire US.

While the court largely left Cobb’s order in place, it stayed part of it to the extent it required changes to how immigration authorities determine whether someone has a credible fear of being sent back to their country of origin.

US circuit judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, dissented and called Cobb’s ruling “impermissible judicial interference”.

The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The administration’s appeal on the merits is scheduled to be heard on 9 December.

When comments close December 19, immigration lawyers, health providers, state officials, and advocates are expected to flood DHS with objections.","WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, federal regulators published a bureaucratic notice that could reshape life for millions of immigrants in America—and the fine print reveals a boldface acknowledgment of the potential human cost.

The Department of Homeland Security’s proposed rule on “public charge,” buried in the Federal Register, would rescind the 2022 Biden-era protections and replace them with something far more dangerous: a blank check for immigration officers to deny green cards based on virtually any government benefit use, without clear standards to guide them.​​

DHS openly acknowledged in its own analysis that “over 400,000 eligible individuals could forgo or disenroll[sic]” from these vital health programs out of fear—and the administration is counting on exactly that.​​

The mechanism is discretion without guardrails. Instead of spelling out new rules like the first Trump administration did in 2019, this proposal does something potentially worse: it eliminates the definition of “public charge” altogether and tells officers to rely on future “interpretive guidance” that won’t require public comment. That means immigration officers could consider “any means-tested public benefit” of “any duration” when deciding whether to approve or deny someone’s path to permanent residence.​​

The consequences are deliberately vague. An officer could weigh against an applicant their use of Medicaid, CHIP, food stamps, housing assistance, or even services related to communicable disease testing. DHS signals the agency may even consider family members’ use of benefits—a direct reversal of longstanding practice—and new guidance from the State Department has already expanded scrutiny to include obesity and chronic illnesses as potential factors in public charge determinations.​​

“This is designed to create confusion and uncertainty,” immigrant rights advocates warn, and they’re right. Without clear standards, immigration decisions become arbitrary and politically malleable. Two people in identical circumstances could face opposite outcomes depending on the officer reviewing their file.​

The comment period closes December 19 … just weeks away. DHS said a final rule could materialize as soon as 30 days after, meaning early 2026 could see this take effect.​

Congressional and Political Context

The proposed rule emerges during a period of unprecedented, federalized xenophobia under the second Trump administration. Immigration lawyers note that DHS used the same approach during the 2019 public charge rule—then got blocked by federal courts three times before the Supreme Court intervened. The precedent is grim.​

Yet this proposal goes even further. Where the 2019 rule at least spelled out which benefits counted and which didn’t, this one deliberately leaves that to officer discretion. This will doubtless cause a chilling effect among many who would otherwise legally receive these benefits, including U.S. citizen children in mixed-status households.

One legal analysis found that between 2.0 and 4.7 million people left Medicaid and CHIP after the Trump administration’s previous public charge rule. Research from KFF shows that immigrant families are already frightened. Between 2023 and 2025, the share of immigrant adults skipping or postponing health care jumped from 22% to 29%, with 19% citing immigration-related concerns. This proposed rule would likely turbocharge that trend.​

Public health experts paint a bleak picture. DHS’s own regulatory analysis acknowledges the rule could lead to worse health outcomes, increased emergency room use, higher prevalence of communicable diseases, increased uncompensated care, and rising poverty and housing instability. The Centers for Disease Control has flagged the danger: chilling effects on benefit use during health emergencies could spark outbreaks of preventable disease.​

On Capitol Hill, the reception has been predictably partisan. Democratic senators like Alex Padilla, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have made clear their opposition to benefit restrictions targeting immigrants. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has signaled opposition to expanded immigration enforcement that creates bureaucratic barriers. But with Republicans controlling Congress, legislative salvation for the current rule appears unlikely.​

The Interpretive Guidance Gambit

What makes this proposal particularly troubling is its use of “interpretive guidance” rather than formal rule-making. Once DHS rescinds the 2022 rule, it plans to issue new instructions to immigration officers through subregulatory guidance, thereby sidestepping the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirement for notice and mandatory comment period on major policy changes.​

This is deliberate. Under formal rule-making, the public gets to comment, courts can review the reasoning, and legal challenges must grapple with an agency’s statutory interpretation. Guidance can be issued quietly, with minimal process, making it harder to challenge in court.

Advocates worry that officers will eventually tell applicants that obesity, diabetes, or family members’ SNAP use counts against them—and when lawsuits follow, DHS will claim these are mere guidelines, not binding rules, and therefore not subject to the same level of judicial scrutiny.

What’s at Stake

For the migrant community and beyond, the stakes could hardly be higher. The 2022 rule—which limited public charge to consideration of cash assistance and long-term institutional care—provided clarity and protected millions. Rescinding it without a replacement creates a legal and moral vacuum.

The proposed rule signals that this administration intends to use public charge not as a narrow tool to identify truly dependent individuals, but as a broad discretionary weapon to discourage benefit use across immigrant populations. The $9 billion in projected savings tells the real story: this is about cutting government spending on vulnerable people, not about fiscal responsibility or immigration law.

When comments close December 19, immigration lawyers, health providers, state officials, and advocates are expected to flood DHS with objections. But if the Trump administration follows its first-term playbook, court fights will dominate 2026.

For now, the fear is already spreading through immigrant communities … which, sadly, is the point.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!edaI!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1725578-2537-40b0-acf0-766de5de0602_768x431.jpeg",N,,2025-11-22 20:56:41.865183

DHS says Tall fled from agents for several blocks before tripping, falling and continuing to resist arrest before ultimately being apprehended. The department claims the NYPD failed to turn Tall over to ICE last month when he was arrested for felony trademark counterfeiting.

""This entire incident could have been prevented had the NYPD simply honor our ICE detainer after they arrested Tall on Oct. 7 for felony trademark counterfeiting.

This time he was released by NYPD before ICE could even lodge a detainer,"" the DHS statement continued.

NY1 has reached out to the NYPD for a response.

Earlier Saturday, the NYPD had said officers were on the scene conducting routine vendor enforcement near Canal Street and Broadway when ICE agents arrived around noon.

""Federal agents appeared at the location unrelated to any NYPD activity. NYPD personnel immediately left the area and did not interact with federal agents in any manner,"" the NYPD said prior to DHS's statement.

She is also pregnant and relies on her car to get to and from prenatal doctor’s appointments.","Satima Flaherty was working from her West Oakland home on Wednesday when she heard tires screeching and a loud smash outside her door.

She rushed to her front window, assuming there had been a car crash — and hoped it didn’t involve hers.

“I go outside, I look, it’s my car,” she recalled. “I was almost in tears.”

Flaherty said she saw an older man, who appeared to be limping, get out of the grey Dodge Charger that rammed into the front of her black Honda and take off down the street.

At first, she thought it had been a typical hit-and-run until neighbors informed her that the officers on scene were federal immigration officials who had been following the man.

The collision occurred after 9 a.m. Wednesday morning, shortly before reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had been spotted conducting a targeted enforcement operation nearby Hoover Elementary School.

The commotion led to secure lockout procedures at Hoover and Harriet Tubman Child Development Center and standard protocol for ICE activity at other nearby Oakland Unified School District sites.

According to Councilmember Carroll Fife, the targeted man had been dropping a child off at school that morning when he was “chased by masked men,” believed to be ICE officers.

The crash came just months after Oakland loosened its vehicle chase policies for local law enforcement, reversing restrictions from 2022 intended to protect bystanders during high-speed pursuits. Oakland’s rules don’t apply to state and federal agencies, including ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. The speed at which the agents and the pursued vehicle were traveling is unknown.

Flaherty said that when she went outside to check on her car, she approached the agents, who were searching through the Dodge. They told her that Oakland Police would follow up on the incident and drove away, she said, guessing they were still in pursuit of the man they had aimed to detain.

“It left me with a huge amount of damage and no accountability,” she said.

The front bumper of Flaherty’s car was completely totaled and undrivable, she said.

She filed a police report with OPD later that day, but said she hasn’t been contacted. In a statement on Wednesday, OPD said it was investigating the collision.

“It’s kind of like I’m just left dangling here,” Flaherty told KQED. “It’s going to be a setback, especially during the holidays.”

The 38-year-old Oakland native, who lives with her nine-year-old daughter and mother, said she doesn’t have a reliable way to take her child to school or visit the clients she serves as a social worker. She is also pregnant and relies on her car to get to and from prenatal doctor’s appointments.

Her mother has a car, but it isn’t in reliable condition, she said.

Flaherty said Fife offered to help her get reimbursed for a rental car, but she doesn’t have one yet. Instead, she’s used Uber to travel to and from her daughter’s school at pick-up and drop-off and took Thursday off from work.

She has insurance and said she’s begun the claim process, but isn’t expecting to get enough compensation to replace the car. She started a fundraiser on GoFundMe asking neighbors to help her raise money to purchase a new vehicle in the meantime.

She said she wanted to be able to be independent again, but didn’t want to see the driver get in trouble.

“It caused a huge setback for me, but for me, it’s material stuff and for him, it’s his life. When he was running, he was running for his life,” she said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/HooverElementaryGetty.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 18:57:41.255271

Ayala-Uribe’s relatives and members of Congress have alleged that he was denied proper medical care after being taken into ICE custody in August.
Adelanto detention staff members were aware of his medical crisis, according to internal emails obtained by The Times.","Southern California lawmakers are demanding answers from U.S. Homeland Security officials following the deaths of two Orange County residents and nearly two dozen others while in federal immigration custody.

In a letter Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Reps. Dave Min (D-Irvine) and Judy Chu (D-Pasadena) pointed to the deaths of 25 people so far this year while being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The number of in-custody deaths has reached an annual record since the agency began keeping track in 2018.

Two Mexican immigrants — who had long made their homes in Orange County and were sent to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center north of Hesperia — were among the deaths.

“These are not just numbers on a website, but real people — with families, jobs, and hopes and dreams — each of whom died in ICE custody,” the lawmakers wrote. “The following cases illustrate systemic patterns of delayed treatment, neglect, and failure to properly notify families.”

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, died Sept. 22 about a month after being apprehended while working at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for 15 years, according to a GoFundMe post by his family.

He had lived in Westminster since he was 4 years old, and had previously been protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The Times previously reported that his application for continued protection was not renewed in 2016.

Ayala-Uribe’s relatives and members of Congress have alleged that he was denied proper medical care after being taken into ICE custody in August. Adelanto detention staff members were aware of his medical crisis, according to internal emails obtained by The Times. But Ayala-Uribe initially was taken back to his Adelanto dorm room, where he waited for another three days before being moved to Victor Valley Global Medical Center in Victorville.

ICE officials acknowledged that Ayala-Uribe died at the Victorville hospital while waiting for surgery for an abscess on his buttock. The suspected cause of the sore was not disclosed.

Ayala-Uribe’s cause of death is under investigation, ICE has previously said.

A second man — Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, 56, who lived near Costa Mesa — died Oct. 23, about a week after being detained.

ICE said Garcia-Aviles was arrested Oct. 14 in Santa Ana by the U.S. Border Patrol for an outstanding warrant, and eventually sent to the Adelanto center. ICE said in a previous statement that he was only at the Adelanto facility for a few hours before he was taken to the Victorville hospital for “suspected alcohol withdrawal symptoms.”

His condition rapidly worsened.

The deaths have focused attention on the treatment of detained immigrants as well as long-standing concerns about medical care inside Adelanto, one of the largest federal immigration detention centers in California. The situation raises broader concerns about whether immigration detention centers throughout the country are equipped to care for the deluge of people rounded up since President Trump prioritized mass deportations as part of his second-term agenda.

“These deaths raise serious questions about ICE’s ability to comply with basic detention standards, medical care protocols, and notification requirements, and underscore a pattern of gross negligence that demands immediate accountability,” Min and Chu wrote in the letter to Noem and Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE.

The letter was signed by 43 other lawmakers, including Reps. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), J. Luis Correa (D-Santa Ana), John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) and Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).

An ICE representative did not immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment.

The lawmakers stressed the need to treat the immigrants with humanity.

The lawmakers said Garcia-Aviles had lived in the U.S. for three decades. His family did not learn of his dire medical condition until “he was on his deathbed.” Family members drove to the hospital to find him “unconscious, intubated, and . . . [with] dried blood on his forehead” as well as “a cut on his tongue ... broken teeth and bruising on his body.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/140a9fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F61%2Ffa79dd494d88b87d72c8fccc9807%2F1510618-me-adelanto-ice-detention-center-06-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 18:57:14.880483

On Tuesday, White House border czar Tom Homan announced the plans for operations during an interview with Fox News. Homan said he previously had an agreement with Mayor Eric Adams to use Rikers Island as part of the operations, but that those plans were halted by the city council.

“So, we’re going to be coming to New York City,” he said. “We’re already there now. I mean, teams are there now.”

Homan added that New York City is a self-described “sanctuary city” and that it has had an “issue there with public safety threats in the streets every day.”

One area of the city that is expected to see a surge in federal agents is Canal Street, which has previously been the site of immigration operations. The street has been linked to vendors selling knockoff handbags, designer clothing or bags that folks like to pick up on the cheap. In October, ICE announced it had made nine arrests during a Canal Street operation, and a majority of those individuals were from West Africa.

Meanwhile, the New York Immigration Coalition released footage this week of an ICE raid on a home in Queens that happened on November 13. The organization claims the agents did not identify themselves or provide a warrant, and then pointed guns at a mom and her four children. The coalition also notes that ICE was looking for a person who did not live at that address. DHS denies that it did anything wrong. 911 calls were made because neighbors thought this was a home invasion, which led to confusion, where two NYPD officers suffered minor injuries in that scuffle.

On Friday, President Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met for what they later called a “productive” meeting at the White House. Following the meeting, Trump and Mamdani told reporters that they both wish to address crime.

In the past, the president has threatened to withhold funding from the city if Mamdani were elected. Meanwhile, Mamdani has been a vocal critic of ICE’s expanded raids in the city, as well as the Trump administration’s surge in deportations.

“The concerns that many New Yorkers have are around the enforcement of immigration laws on New Yorkers across the five boroughs, and most recently, we’re talking about a mother and her two children, how this has very little to do with what that is,” Mamdani said.

Trump followed this comment with a statement of his own.

Why did Marjorie Taylor Greene resign?","Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said Nov. 21 she will resign from her post in January, an announcement that is shocking supporters in her district.

Her decision comes after she publicly opposed policies of President Donald Trump, whom she has often supported, and Trump withdrew his endorsement of her.

""My self-worth is not defined by a man but instead by God, who created everything in existence,"" Greene said.

Here are a few things to know about Greene.

Who is Marjorie Taylor Greene?

Greene, 51, grew up outside of Atlanta. She attended the University of Georgia and went on to be part-owner in her father's construction company and then co-owner of a CrossFit gym. She has three grown children.

Loyalists who know her describe her as kind, intelligent, and maternal. Her constituents say she fights for them. But she also earned a firebrand reputation for heckling President Joe Biden and otherwise sparring with her liberal colleagues.

What state is Marjorie Taylor Greene from?

Greene is from Georgia. She represents the 14th Congressional District, which is in the northwest area of the state and mostly includes rural areas. It is a heavily Republican district whose elections are usually decided in the primary.

What are Marjorie Taylor Greene's politics?

Greene is considered far-right. She subscribes to a mantle called America First that supports isolationist foreign policy and promotes a focus on domestic issues. The philosophy goes hand in hand with Make America Great Again, or MAGA.

Greene has voted against funding foreign wars in Ukraine and Gaza. She opposes transgender women playing in girls' sports, supports hardline immigration policies and supports policies that help working-class Americans.

What happened with Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump?

Greene spent more than a month doing television interviews in which she publicly disagreed with the president, despite her longtime support of him. She also vocally and forcefully advocated for a bill Trump opposed to force the release of law enforcement files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

On Nov. 14, Trump withdrew his endorsement of her and encouraged people in her district to challenge her in the 2026 Republican primary. Greene said this lead to threats against her, and that she feared for her safety. She also responded to the nickname ""traitor"" by saying a traitor is someone who prioritizes foreign countries.

Why did Marjorie Taylor Greene resign?

In a social media video, Greene described how frustrated she was with trying to get things done in Washington for ordinary people. She said she did not want to put her constituents through a bruising primary battle against a Trump-supported candidate. But she also said she was leaving to spend time with her family.

“I missed precious time with my family that I can never get back,” Greene said. She said she had to leave her mother's side while her father was having brain surgery to remove a cancer in order to go to Congress and vote against Trump's impeachment.

What did Donald Trump say about Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation?

Trump told ABC News that Americans should be happy Greene is resigning. ""I think it's great news for the country,"" he said ""It's great.""

While two have had a close relationship in the past, including phone conversations, Trump told ABC News that Greene did not tell him before making her announcement.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he was immediately terminating temporary deportation protections for Somalis living in Minnesota, accelerating the end of a program that began in 1991 under another Republican president.

""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing,"" Trump said in a late-night post on Truth Social, without providing any further explanation or evidence.

""I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota,"" he said.

Trump clashes with Governor Tim Walz

Trump called Minnesota a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" under Democratic Governor Tim Walz, an apparent response to unverified media reports, shared by several Republican lawmakers, that the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia had benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota.

Walz responded on X, saying, ""It’s not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.""

The TPS program for Somalis was launched by then-President George H.W. Bush in September 1991. It grants government protection to eligible foreign-born individuals who cannot return home safely due to civil war or natural disasters.

Seventeen countries are eligible, but the Trump administration has announced it is terminating TPS designations for several, including Venezuela and Nicaragua.

The administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, extended the eligibility for Somalis through March 17, 2026. Most of the Somalis in Minnesota are US citizens, and there are only 705 Somali-born individuals nationwide who have TPS status, according to a report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service.

By comparison, over 330,000 Haitians have TPS status, along with over 170,000 people from El Salvador.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, said Trump's decision was disappointing given that the Somalis in question were legal migrants, adding that Trump's move could tear families apart.

""These are legal immigrants, and they should not suffer as a consequence of a political football that's being played against the Muslim community. These individuals have been following the law,"" he said.

Abshir Omar, a political strategist who endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential election, said he expected the decision to be challenged in court. He said it could harm the long-term economic and strategic relationship with Somalia, which in March offered the US exclusive control of air bases and ports, and has expressed interest in partnerships with US firms to explore its large oil reserves.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/jerusalem_post_articles_818/16e25a38d057edc64786b205e3a11eac,N,,2025-11-23 02:57:42.209233

In October, they heard a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional voting map.","The Supreme Court on Friday evening temporarily allowed Texas to use its newly redrawn, Republican-friendly congressional voting map for the 2026 midterm elections.

The decision blocked, for now, a lower-court ruling that had said Texas could not use the map. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who is assigned to handle emergency applications from that region of the country, issued the administrative stay, a temporary ruling meant to give the full court time to consider the issue.

The Texas attorney general earlier in the evening had filed an emergency application with the justices, asking them to allow the state to use the new map.

Justice Alito requested that the civil rights groups that had challenged the map respond to the attorney general’s request by Monday at 5 p.m., signaling the court would likely consider the issue speedily.

Texas sought the justices’ intervention after a panel of federal judges in El Paso on Tuesday blocked the map from going into effect in time for the elections, a setback for an aggressive push by Texas Republicans and President Trump to flip Democratic seats in the state.

By a vote of 2 to 1, the divided panel had sided with the civil rights organizations, arguing it was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. In the court’s ruling, Judge Jeffrey V. Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, a Trump appointee, wrote that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

In the 160-page ruling, the judges blocked the use of the new map while litigation continues over its legality. In the meantime, they ordered the state to use a map enacted by the Texas Legislature in 2021 for the November 2026 elections.

Texas’ Republican-controlled State Legislature redrew its map this summer, creating five new Republican-favored seats as part of a strategy by Mr. Trump to block Democrats from taking control of the House of Representatives.

After the court ruling, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced that the state would appeal to the Supreme Court. In a statement, Mr. Paxton said he fully expected “the court to uphold Texas’ sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”

The Texas legal loss was the latest challenge for the president’s effort to redraw state congressional maps to favor Republicans in the lead-up to the midterms. Last week, Indiana Republicans rejected the president’s request that they redraw congressional districts.

The fight over the Texas map is also the latest in a string of voting and elections-related challenges facing the justices. In October, they heard a challenge to Louisiana’s congressional voting map. In that case, a group of white voters argued that the state’s new map, redrawn after the latest census to include a second majority-Black district, was an illegal racial gerrymander that violated the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.

A decision in the case is expected by the end of June or early July, and it could shape how the court views the Texas challenge. In Texas, challengers have argued that even as lawmakers sought to create new districts to achieve a partisan advantage, they in fact gerrymandered based on race.

The nationwide push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms is highly unusual, breaking from decades of settled norms around the process for carving up legislative districts. The drive by the president has set off a race in states throughout the country. This month, California voters approved an aggressive plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts, potentially flipping five Republican seats, a major victory for Democrats. That map has also been challenged in court.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/19/multimedia/00dc-scotus-texasvote-bctf/00dc-scotus-texasvote-bctf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 16:57:15.812978

A Superior Court judge intervened, preventing the wrongful detention by asserting the agents had misidentified his intern.

The incident has prompted Rhode Island officials to condemn ICE's tactics and renew calls for virtual court hearings.

Lawmakers and Rhode Island state officials are continuing to speak out against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics that saw a 16-year-old Superior Court intern wrongfully detained last week and released only after a judge's intervention.

The judiciary announced that ICE agents outside the courthouse detained a high school student on Nov. 20 who is interning for Superior Court Judge Joseph J. McBurney.

“If not for the intervention of a Superior Court judge, who insisted that ICE had wrongfully identified his intern as their target, this young person would have been taken into ICE custody,” the judiciary said.

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, Gov. Dan McKee, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the Rhode Island Bar Association and more have spoken out against the tactics ICE used when detaining the student, and some have said that the incident shows the need for virtual court hearings.

Here's what we know about the incident:

ICE agents were seen inside the courthouse and approached by court security

The Rhode Island Judiciary confirmed that ICE agents were seen inside the courthouse taking pictures of the 16-year-old intern. They were approached by court security and were directed to follow the court rules.

Agents threatened to break judge's car windows to apprehend teen

Judge McBurney took the intern into his car while asserting to ICE that they had the wrong person, a Judiciary spokesperson confirmed. They then surrounded McBurney's car with the teenager inside and threatened to break the windows.

At McBurney's insistence that they were making a mistake, ICE agents checked their information. The intern was released after officers confirmed they had misidentified the teen, according to the account.

A spokesman for ICE did not respond to a Journal inquiry.

ICE has frequently been seen outside RI courthouses

Deportation Defense Network of Rhode Island’s College Hill group has been patrolling outside courthouses for the presence of ICE and warning court users accordingly.

The Deportation Defense Network estimates that more than 20 people have been taken into custody by ICE outside state courthouses in Providence, Newport and at the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston since July – and ICE has been recently spotted outside the Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street.

The Providence City Council and advocacy groups have also urged the judiciary to provide virtual court hearings in the city due to the increased presence of immigration officers around courthouses.

McBurney was praised for his actions

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos offered praise for McBurney's actions in a statement:

""This high school student was spared being wrongfully taken into custody only because of the intervention of Superior Court Judge Joseph McBurney. To Judge McBurney, I offer sincere thanks on my own behalf and on behalf of our immigrant communities for using your position of power to prevent this,"" she said.

RI Supreme Court justice speaks out

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell said in a statement. “Given this climate, the Judiciary understands the call to implement remote hearings in Providence County, and beyond. The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system.”

“What occurred today, however, reinforces the Judiciary’s need to focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings,” Suttell continued. “The courts are here to serve the people and the Judiciary remains steadfast in preserving and augmenting access to justice for all persons.”

Other RI officials condemn ICE tactics

Gov. Dan McKee's office on Thursday also issued a statement condemning the intern's detention:

“Today, ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life. Rhode Islanders should not have to fear federal agents operating with such reckless disregard for the law and human dignity. This was not a harmless mistake. It was the direct result of callous and chaotic policies by the Trump Administration. Moreover, ICE’s failure to exercise even a shred of due diligence is shameful and underscores just how broken and dangerous these federal policies are.

“I fully support the Judiciary’s commitment to enhance access to virtual hearings and promote safe access to the courts.”

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos also responded.

""Yesterday's attempted abduction of a Rhode Island Superior Court intern by ICE drives home the danger of flooding our streets with masked thugs who can't tell the difference between a hardened criminal and a high school student. We must cease these rogue operations and allow law enforcement to be led by the local officers who actually know their community,"" Matos said in a statement.

And U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner, ranking member of the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee on the House Homeland Security Committee, called the incident ""yet another example of the disregard for civil liberties by immigration enforcement under the Trump Administration,"" and said he would ""continue to call out the Administration’s reckless actions, in Rhode Island and across the county.”

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed also issued a statement:

“The Trump administration refuses to accept we’re a nation of laws with a constitution that provide all of us with rights. Trump and his team’s tactics are jeopardizing public trust and public safety. Innocent people are being wrongfully targeted,"" Reed's office said in an emailed statement. ""We should not accept a bunch of masked armed individuals running rampant, ignoring the rules, and threatening innocent students and judges as routine law enforcement. Every day law enforcement across our state don their uniforms and display their badges proudly. The leadership of ICE and any unprofessional field agents must be held accountable for this type of outrageous incident. The pattern of too many ICE agents committing civil rights abuses and disregarding the law is very disturbing. We have to protect everyone’s rights and legal obligations. Failing to speak out against escalating authoritarian immigration enforcement tactics only invites the further use of these tactics against more Americans and the erosion of due process.”

And the Rhode Island Bar Association weighed in:

""Courthouses must remain spaces where the rule of law is respected, and where judges, court personnel, interns, lawyers, and members of the public can carry out their duties without fear of improper detention or intimidation,"" RIBA President Patrick A. Guida said in a statement. ""We commend Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell and the Rhode Island Judiciary for their measured response to this incident, including their ongoing efforts to maintain safe access to court proceedings and their careful expansion of virtual hearing options where appropriate.""

“If you are a legal professional, the Trump Administration is calling on YOU to join @TheJusticeDept as a Deportation Judge to restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system,” said Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, on Thursday in a post on X.

The Department of Justice (DoJ), which oversees the nation’s immigration court system, also posted a recruitment ad, where prospective applicants can “become a deportation judge” and “define America for generations”.

While these advertisements use the phrase “deportation judge”, the government application portal still lists the official job title as “immigration judge”.

The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Immigrants and asylum seekers appear before an immigration judge for several reasons, including to make their case for protection, attain lawful permanent residence or halt their proceedings while they pursue other immigration relief. But generally, people are before a judge because they are fighting their removal to their home country.

This year, the Trump administration has been purging immigration judges whose judicial philosophies do not align with the administration’s priorities. Some have also chosen to leave since Trump took office. Because of this, and an already backlogged court system, the government started recruiting hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges.

The recruitment of military lawyers came after the DoJ’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR) relaxed rules in August so that any lawyer could serve as a temporary immigration judge.

Two judges in New York, for example, were laid off after one of them had the highest rate in the city for granting asylum, and the other had been an outspoken critic of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). More terminations took place in San Francisco, Chicago and Boston, suggesting the Trump administration is targeting sanctuary cities.

The latest recruitment effort this week tells applicants that, if hired, they will have the power to “determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay” and to “ensure that only aliens with legally meritorious claims are allowed to remain”.

The pay range is $159,951 to $207,500, Noem said on Thursday. A cash incentive is also provided for those in cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco, according to the ad.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2014448158e21512132e60abe9501adcdbfbdf1e/292_0_2917_2334/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f2e5c30ae4c9dae99c10bb5339c3771",N,,2025-11-22 17:57:19.506396

In addition to challenging the state’s in-state tuition policy, the lawsuit argues that California unlawfully extends eligibility for scholarships and subsidized loans to undocumented students.
Among the defendants are the state, top California officials, and the state’s two public university systems: the University of California and California State University.
“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state US citizens,” reads the complaint.
The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students.","The justice department sued California on Thursday for allowing undocumented college students to pay in-state tuition for public universities, alleging the policy harms US citizens.

The lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the eastern district of California, marks the third time this week that the Trump administration has sued California. In addition to challenging the state’s in-state tuition policy, the lawsuit argues that California unlawfully extends eligibility for scholarships and subsidized loans to undocumented students.

Among the defendants are the state, top California officials, and the state’s two public university systems: the University of California and California State University.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state US citizens,” reads the complaint. “There are no exceptions.”

California law does allow some students to qualify for in-state tuition rates, which are lower than out-of-state tuition, even if they technically qualify as non-residents. This includes students who have had “three full-time years or the equivalent at any combination” of California high school, California adult high school, or California community college.

The California Dream Act, two bills passed in 2011, permits undocumented students to apply for, and obtain, state-based financial assistance, according to San Francisco State University. Undocumented students cannot receive federal financial aid for college.

The justice department’s civil complaint alleges that California policy on undocumented student tuition is “unconstitutional” and wants a judge to “declare it illegal and permanently enjoin its enforcement”.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” said Pamela Bondi, the US attorney general. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week – we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The Trump administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California’s.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren’t in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don’t violate federal law if they provide the same rates to US citizens in the same circumstances – meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the US by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as US citizens.

The complaint cites an executive order signed in February that directs federal departments and agencies to block undocumented people from receiving public benefits. Another executive order signed in April directs officials to stop enforcing laws and practices that favor undocumented people over US citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president’s orders enforce federal immigration laws.

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” it said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the California supreme xourt let stand a lower-court ruling that the University of California’s policy barring students without legal status in the US from campus jobs is discriminatory and must be reconsidered.

University system officials had warned that the decision would put them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

The UC is dealing with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1bn fine over allegations, including antisemitism and the illegal consideration of race in admitting students to its Los Angeles campus.

The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students. More than a quarter of undergraduates are first-generation college students, according to the university system.

The University of California serves about 300,000 students.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5d6638950468ed3692a9a8c7a21a9a6ea7ee5f8/827_0_5417_4335/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b3740b4291fc14d3f91ab2a2b0384ca",N,,2025-11-22 15:57:28.036389

Garcia, a 31-year-old father of four, was in ICE custody after being arrested for a DWI in Tarrant County.

The shooting has raised questions about controversial 287(g) agreements that allow local police to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal agents.

DALLAS ― Stephany Gauffeny hovered over her comatose husband as he lay in bed at Parkland Medical Center, pleading with him to wake up but facing a yawning dread that he may never do so.

Staples closed a scar across his head, tubes snaked down his throat and his face was swollen nearly beyond recognition. Each arm was attached to the bed railing with soft restraints and his ankles were shackled together. Nearby, a life support machine whooshed and beeped steadily.

Just a few weeks earlier, Miguel Angel Garcia Medina, 31, had been cavorting with his four children at their Arlington, Texas, home, meeting his 8-year-old daughter for lunch at school and giddily planning the arrival of their fifth child.

Now, on Sept. 24, he was in a hospital bed in a coma, his body ripped apart by rounds from a bolt-action rifle.

In a corner of the room, two agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement observed Gauffeny’s every move – a pair of constant reminders of how Garcia, who had crossed into the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor two decades earlier and had grown into a house painter, husband and father, had ended up near death in a hospital.

Under the close watch of the agents, she sat and talked to him and urged him to wake up.

“I would tell him, ‘Take your time. I’m going to wait for you as long as it takes,’” Gauffeny, 32, told USA TODAY. “’I’m going to be here every day taking care of you.’”

Garcia was one of several detainees ICE picked up for deportation under agreements with local police and held inside transport vans parked outside a Dallas ICE facility on the morning of Sept. 24 when a gunman opened fire, unleashing rounds from an 8mm bolt-action rifle. Authorities said the shooter, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, was targeting ICE agents. He was found dead at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Norland Guzman Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador, was killed in the attack and Venezuelan detainee Jose Andres Bordones-Molina was also injured in the shooting, treated for his injuries and later transferred to a detention center. No federal agents were hurt in the attack.

In a series of press conferences following the shooting, federal officials detailed how Jahn allegedly had left a series of handwritten notes denouncing ICE. They also heralded agents from ICE and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who reportedly tried to save the detainees during the barrage of gunfire.

But family members of the detainees and immigrant advocates bristled at how little detail was released about the shooting itself or the injured detainees and the circumstances that put them inside the transport van and in the crosshairs of a determined gunman.

In response to USA TODAY's request for comment, DHS sent an email that said: “Like other law enforcement agencies, it is standard procedure for detainees in ICE custody to have guards at the hospital.”

The agency did not respond to questions about the ongoing investigation.

The shooting also raised questions over controversial pacts between local law enforcement agencies and ICE – known as 287(g) agreements – where undocumented immigrants are handed over to federal agents, even if charged with non-violent offenses or whether or not they’ve applied for legal status. The detainees involved in the attack had been transferred from Tarrant County Jail to ICE custody just prior to the shooting.

Devan Allen, a former Tarrant County commissioner who opposed 287(g) agreements, said she was told the agreement was only supposed to target violent crime offenders. Suspects like Garcia should not have been ensnared in the program, she said.

“That breaks my heart,” Allen said. “That does not feel like justice for anybody.”

Immigrant advocates and families of the detainees said not enough has been said about those injured or killed in the attack.

“We do feel bad for [ICE agents]” who are targeted, said Rocio Martinez, a Fort Worth immigration attorney who represented Gauffeny and Garcia. “But they weren’t the people who were shot. The people who were shot deserve to be remembered for who they were and not just for the fact that they were here unlawfully or in ICE custody. They’re more than that.”

‘Just the best dad’

Garcia arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2007 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor, entering without a visa. He had fled violence in his hometown of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and went to live with his mother, Maria Garcia, who had migrated to Arlington a few years earlier.

He met Gauffeny while the two attended Sam Houston High School, reconnected after high school and got married on his birthday: January 5, 2016.

Gauffeny had two daughters, Barbie and Kendra, from a previous relationship, and Garcia coddled and raised them as if they were his own, she said. They also had two kids of their own: Makayla and Miguel Angel, Jr., whom he nicknamed “Cricket,” after the mischievous character from the animated series, Big City Greens.

Last year, Gauffeny found out she was pregnant with a fifth child: Another boy, whom they planned to name Miles. In May, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home in Arlington to accommodate their growing family.

“It wasn't the biggest house, but we were really happy for that accomplishment,” Gauffeny said. “We worked hard for it.”

Garcia, who worked as a house painter, would get home exhausted and paint-splattered but always made time to tuck the little ones in, Gauffeny said. In the morning, he was the one driving everyone to school. Anytime the paletero would push his cart filled with popsicles past the home, she said, Garcia would get all the kids treats.

Makayla, 8, was the first one squealing, “Papi!” when Garcia walked through the door and solicited a few extra hugs from her father.

“He was always hugging, very affectionate,” Gauffeny said. “Just the best dad.”

But Garcia’s undocumented status hung over them like a cloud. Gauffeny, who is a U.S. citizen, applied for an I-130 visa a few years ago, the first step in getting Garcia legal residency. It was preliminarily approved, but Garcia still needed permission to leave the country and finalize the visa at the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.

He planned to travel there later this year.

Then, on Aug. 8, Garcia was FaceTiming with his mom, brother and stepfather who had been swept up on ICE raids a few weeks earlier and deported to Mexico. He grew sullen, Gauffeny said, playing bachata music and telling his mom he missed her. He drank a beer. Then another one.

Gauffeny fell asleep and awoke at 2 a.m. to a phone call from another one of Garcia’s brothers who lived 10 minutes away. He told her Arlington Police pulled Garcia over as he drove to the brother’s home and arrested him for driving while intoxicated and evading arrest. He hadn’t crashed into anything and no one was hurt, his brother told Gauffeny. Garcia was later transferred to Tarrant County Jail.

“His whole family – his mom, his stepdad, his brother – getting deported really affected him,” she said. “He was depressed. I just didn’t know how to help him.”

Gauffeny said she realized Garcia was in trouble and at risk of being deported, even though it was his first DWI offense. She had heard of other migrants arrested in Tarrant County who were handed over to ICE and deported. Under President Donald Trump, that cooperation – known as a 287(g) agreement – had flourished.

Controversial pacts spread across USA

Named for Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the statute empowers local law enforcement agencies to perform certain federal immigration functions, including holding individuals in local jails until ICE takes custody.

In December 2024, there were 135 such agreements in 16 states across the USA. By mid-November, that number had soared to 1,154 agreements across 40 states, even with college police on campuses like Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University, as the Trump administration used it as a tool to crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Though designed to target immigrants who had committed violent crimes or pose a national security threat, today the agreements are used to sweep up anyone not in the country legally, said Lena Graber, managing attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.

“It's part of the mass detention and mass deportation machine,” she said. “And [DHS] conscripts more agencies to do that for them.”

Sheriffs and police chiefs across the country herald the agreements as ways to clear their streets of dangerous migrants who shouldn’t be in the U.S. in the first place.

But enlisting local law enforcement agents to identify undocumented immigrants has, in the past, led to racial profiling and the removal of suspects who were charged with – but not convicted of – crimes, Graber said.

“There are a lot of people who are charged with crimes and might be worth a chance at redemption,” she said, “and instead they are hurled out of the country and their family is left to fend for itself.”

When Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn introduced a 287(g) agreement to his county in 2017, it uncorked a wave of controversy, with residents split on how they felt about the agreements.

Measure to hand over immigrants roil Tarrant County

In June 2020, the four county commissioners met to decide whether to allow the agreement to continue without an annual review, essentially making it permanent. Dozens of residents – many opposing the measure – packed the small Tarrant County chambers in Fort Worth. Extra security lined inside and outside the chambers. Demonstrators rallied outside. Inside, several people opposing it were forcibly removed when they got too rowdy.

Waybourn didn’t answer several requests for comment. Current county judge Tim O’Hare declined interview requests.

“The tension was palpable,” Allen, the county commissioner, said of the June 2020 meeting. “My concern was racial profiling. My concern was about its efficacy. My concern was about its implementation. My concern was about the lack of accountability by the sheriff's department.”

Commissioners deadlocked on the issue, 2-2. The deciding vote came down to then-County Judge Glen Whitley, who said he supported getting criminal migrants off Tarrant County streets but also felt lawful migrants should have a clearer path to citizenship.

Assured the agreements would go after the “worst of the worst,” he supported the measure and 287(g) agreements became entrenched in the county by a final vote of 3-2.

Whitley said he has since grown disillusioned with how the agreements are being used, particularly during Trump’s second term, when federal enforcement agents use every tool to detain and remove as many undocumented immigrants as possible.

“President Trump indicated that he was only going to take the worst of the worst,” Whitley told USA TODAY. “But in an effort to get to his numbers, he's taking anybody he can find, and I think, in many instances, picking up people who have tried to be good community representatives, who tried to work hard to take care of their family.”

He added: “To that end, I'm very disappointed.”

‘We had a plan’

Gauffeny was keenly aware that Tarrant County Jail officials would hand over her husband to ICE agents as soon as he stepped out of jail. Together with attorney Raul Natera, they decided not to bond him out until all of his local charges had been resolved, giving an immigration judge less reason to deport him.

Garcia had two other items on his record – he had been cited in 2011 and again in 2017 for “failure to identify/giving false/fictitious information,” both misdemeanors – but this was his first DWI, a Class B misdemeanor. The evading arrest charge was dismissed.

Garcia would stay at the Tarrant County Jail until the DWI was taken care of for time served, then they’d try to release him from ICE detention by showing he had diligently applied for an I-130 visa. If that failed, they’d request a “cancellation of removal,” showing he was married to a U.S. citizen, had been in the country for more than 10 years and was the main provider to his four – almost five – children.

Even if he was deported, he could make his way to Ciudad Juarez and apply for the I-130 visa from there, Gauffeny said.

“We had a plan,” she said. “Eventually, either way, he would be able to be here legally.”

Garcia spent day after day in Tarrant County Jail. He would call Gauffeny several times a day, every day. At night, he’d talk to his kids, telling the younger ones he was away on work.

Garcia told Gauffeny he was sorry for driving that night, that he knew he had jeopardized everything they’d worked for, and reminded her to lock all the doors at night. Gauffeny assured him he’d be home soon.

‘He was just so happy’

His court date arrived on Sept. 23, 46 days after his initial arrest. Gauffeny sat in the visitor’s gallery and watched how defendant after defendant, accused of crimes she considered worse than her husband’s – burglary, assault, drug possession – were allowed to walk free.

A judge told Garcia that the evading arrest charge had been dismissed and he had served enough time to satisfy the DWI charge, but that he was being kept in custody to hand him over to ICE. Garcia said he understood.

After the hearing, Gauffeny was allowed a few minutes to briefly chat with her husband. Garcia smiled and teased her about her growing belly, the pregnancy now in its final month. Gauffeny told him he looked skinnier. Overall, they were glad he was leaving county jail.

“He was just so happy,” Gauffeny said. “He was ready to get out of there.”

Later that night, Garcia called again, at around 9 p.m. He told Gauffeny it was nice seeing her that day and that he would call her the next morning. If she hadn’t heard from him by 11 a.m., he said, it meant he’d been transferred to ICE detention and he’d try to call her when he could.

Before he hung up, 3-year-old Miguel Angel, Jr., jumped on the line.

“Hi Papi! What are you doing?”

Garcia said he was at work but he missed him and would see him soon.

‘Yelling, screaming for help’

The next morning, as she readied to shuttle kids to school, Gauffeny noticed alarming alerts pop up on her Facebook feed: A gunman had shot up the ICE processing facility in Dallas earlier that morning and three detainees had been injured, including one who had died.

Authorities allege that Jahn, of Fairview, Texas, climbed onto the roof of a nearby office building and, at around 6:30 a.m., opened fire on the federal facility, spraying the building and hitting several transport vans filled with detainees parked outside.

An 18-year-old detainee who sat next to Garcia on the bus later told Gauffeny that her husband had been talking about her and the children that morning as they waited in the van.

Then, shots.

Guzman, sitting nearby, was shot and killed instantly, he told Gauffeny. Garcia, riddled with bullets, draped over the detainee to prevent him from getting shot, he said. As they huddled down, shots still pinging the bus, a number of other detainees tried to escape out the van’s back door but it was locked, he told Gauffeny. Others yelled at the driver to drive away, but the bus remained stationary as rounds rained down on them.

“They were yelling, screaming for help,” Gauffeny recalled the detainee telling her. “They were just panicking in there and yelling the whole time they were being shot at.”

Some did escape the bus. In a surveillance video of the facility released to local media, detainees could be seen shackled and scampering into a building. A uniformed man who appears to be an employee points them to safety.

Federal officials have said ICE agents rushed in to help the shooting victims, but the detainee who spoke with Guzman said they were left alone during the fusillade. Gauffeny and her attorney, Martinez, would not identify the detainee or his family for fear they’d be targeted and deported.

ICE officials did not respond to a list of detailed questions attempting to verify the detainee’s account.

Gauffeny followed news of the shooting on the TV news but federal officials weren’t releasing names of the detainees.

At 11 a.m., as her phone remained silent, Gauffeny’s concern began to fester.

Two and a half hours later, just past 1:30 p.m., an ICE official called: Garcia had been injured in the shooting and was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Gauffeny, her mom and sister rushed to the hospital.

The official told Gauffeny that Garcia had to be revived with CPR and needed emergency surgery. But nothing prepared her for what she saw in the room on the hospital’s 15th floor: Her husband was scarred, stapled and intubated. His face was so swollen she could barely make out his features. Dried blood splattered his neck. And his arms and legs were restrained. She broke into sobs.

“It was just awful to see him like that,” she said. “It was traumatic.”

‘Eyes on you at all times’

Doctors initially told Gauffeny they were hopeful. When they gave him a pharyngeal reflex, where doctors stimulate the back of his throat, Garcia gagged, a positive sign. At times his shoulders would twitch and the swelling in his brain, caused by the wound to his neck, seemed to be lessening, they told her, according to Gauffeny.

Gauffeny was there every day, whispering to her husband about the media coverage he had drawn and the outpouring of support from family and strangers.

“Everyone's rooting for you,” she told him. “There's so many people that don't even know us that are praying for you.”

There was something else Gauffeny needed to contend with: ICE. Technically, Garcia was still in ICE custody. Each day, two ICE agents sat in his hospital room, observing them, she said.

Only Gauffeny, her mother and her sister were allowed inside the room and visiting hours were limited to three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, even though the hospital allowed for longer visits, Gauffeny said.

Two new agents arrived each day.

“It felt weird because there are just eyes on you at all times,” Gauffeny recalled. “We didn’t have a lot of privacy.”

An ICE spokesperson said it is ""standard procedure for detainees in ICE custody to have guards at the hospital.”

By the third day, Garcia’s condition spiraled. The swelling in his brain had resumed and his blood pressure plummeted. On the night of Sept. 27, he had to be revived after his heart nearly stopped. Doctors told Gauffeny that Garcia’s heart could give out at any moment. He wasn’t going to make it. They should make plans to say final goodbyes.

Garcia’s mom and brother got special permission to return to the U.S. to see her dying son. Gauffeny also needed ICE approval to bring everyone into the room. After a few phone calls, the agency approved.

Just past 10 p.m. on Sept. 29, Garcia’s wife, two stepdaughters, mom, mother-in-law and brother crowded into the room to say their final goodbyes. As the life support machine beeped steadily, his mother, Maria Garcia, prayed over her son and told him she loved him.

“Go in peace,” she told him. “If you have to go, go in peace.”

His two stepdaughters, Barbie and Kendra, thanked him for taking care of them all these years and promised to take care of Makayla and Miguel Angel, Jr.

“We’re going to look after them for you,” they told him. “Don’t worry about them.”

After a while, a nurse came into the room and disconnected Garcia from the life support machine. Gauffeny held her husband’s hand as he breathed on his own for a few more minutes, then stopped.

He was pronounced dead at 10:48 p.m.

Having a baby while planning a funeral

Three days later, on Oct. 2, Gauffeny was at Arlington Memorial Hospital giving birth to Miles. As she cradled her newborn in her arm, she took calls from the funeral home, picking out casket colors and flower arrangements for her husband’s funeral.

Again, she had to call ICE to confirm she could retrieve her husband’s body. An ICE official explained that she was now in full custody of her husband – a stark reversal from the layers of bureaucracy and rules they faced when he was alive.

“That made me upset,” she said. “I don't get him until he passes away, then they’re like, ‘Here you go, here’s his body.’”

Garcia was buried on Oct. 9, in Arlington. The ceremony was well attended by family members and friends who knew him from Arlington.

Gauffeny struggled with how to relay the news to Miguel Angel, Jr.

“You know how Jesus is in the sky?” she asked him one day shortly after Garcia’s death. “Well, Papi’s in the sky, too.”

“No!” he answered. “I don’t want Papi to be in the sky!”

Makayla also struggled with the news. She would clamp up and squeeze her eyes against tears that nonetheless streamed down her face, Gauffeny said.

Gauffeny wrestled with her own gnawing questions: Should she have bailed him out of Tarrant County Jail sooner, saving him from being in the transport van that morning? If she had stayed awake the night of his arrest, could she have kept him from leaving the house?

She also had questions about the shooting: How many total shots were fired? What were Garcia’s final words? How long was he injured on the bus before help arrived? ICE officials had been frustratingly quiet on details of the incident, she said.

“I wonder if he was aware of what was happening,” Gauffeny said. “I wonder if he had any last words. I wonder if he was in pain and I wonder what his last moments were like.”

Gauffeny said she now worries how to support five children with the family’s main breadwinner gone. A GoFundMe page started by her sister has helped offset some of the hospital bills and funeral costs. But mortgage and other bills loom and she suspects they'll need to see a therapist soon.

More painful are the constant reminders scattered throughout the home: Garcia’s tools in the garage, his clothes hanging in the closet, his toothbrush still in a cup by the bathroom sink.

“My brain knows he's gone,” Gauffeny said. “But I sometimes feel like he's just in the other room or laying down or somewhere at work and he'll be back later.”

A Dia de los Muertos offering

On Nov. 2, Gauffeny decided to take her children to Garcia’s grave for Dia de los Muertos, a holiday observed in Mexico and some parts of Latin America. The day is dedicated to paying respects to loved ones who have died. The family hadn’t ever celebrated but Gauffeny thought it might help bring closure.

They brought fresh flowers, brushed off weeds and debris from his site and laid down a framed picture of a smiling Garcia. Miguel Angel, Jr., saw it and asked his mom, “Is Papi dead?” He asked matter-of-factly; Gauffeny, caught off guard, changed the subject.

They prayed, lit a few candles and gathered to leave.

As they were walking away, Makayla jogged back to her father’s grave and placed a single Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, still in its wrapper from her Halloween collection, next to Garcia’s framed photo.

“Bye, Papi,” she said. “I love you.”

She ran to catch up to her family.

The TOI correspondent from from Washington:

The United States on Friday extended its campaign against mass migration to cover its European allies, warning that such inflow poses an “existential threat to Western civilization” and undermines its stability. In a series of posts, the State Department sought to expand the Trump administration’s anti-migration outlook beyond US borders, instructing American embassies in western nations to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration. “Western nations have endured crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assaults, and the displacement of communities. US officials will urge governments to take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration,” the State Department said characterising mass migration as “a human rights concern” affecting the population of its allies, rather than a concern relating to the migrants themselves as has been viewed traditionally. Asserting that issues stemming from mass migration have plagued citizens of Western nations for years, it said US officials will urge governments to “take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration.” Officials will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by people of a migration background, it added. The State Department cited examples of grooming gangs of migrant men victimising girls in the U.K – a decades old problem involving British-Pakistani criminals – and more recent stray incidents in Sweden and Germany to make the case against mass migration. It said US officials will now scrutinize policies in Western nations that give leniency to migrant crime and human rights abuses or that create two-tiered systems that prioritize migrants at the expense of their own citizens, citing the example of a German woman who it claimed was given a harsher sentence than rape perpetrators for insulting one of them online. Effectively, the State Department warning suggests the Trump administration not only wants to end migration into the US but also to stir up opposition in its western allies some of whom have been flooded with refugees and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia. Some analysts are concerned that the campaign against mass migration is a cover to end all immigration, including legal immigration, as demanded by MAGA nativists and isolationists. A few US allies, notably Canada and Australia, actively solicit qualified immigrants to replenish their vast land mass, stagnant or depleting population, and their coffers, without the wealthy and healthy conditionalities that Washington now insists on. While MAGA sentiment is firmly against all immigration, including legal immigration and even temporary foreign skilled workers, Canada aims to attract 500,000 immigrants annually and Germany's Skilled Immigration Act eases entry for non-EU workers. Even China, with 1.4 billion people, is opening its doors to foreign workers that the MAGA is happy to reject or dispense with. The new US anti-migration policy rolled out by Washington came on the heels of a series of posts by senior Trump officials blaming unchecked immigration for the economic decline of allies and celebrating US success in staunching migration. Responding to a chart shared by an economist that showed Canada's GDP per capita growth lagging behind other G7 nations since around 2015, US vice President J.D Vance suggested that immigration, not US policies, was the problem. ""While I'm sure the causes are complicated, no nation has leaned more into 'diversity is our strength, we don't need a melting pot we have a salad bowl' immigration insanity than Canada. It has the highest foreign-born share of the population in the entire G7 and its living standards have stagnated,” he gibed. US officials also shared and celebrated a report in MAGA outlet Breitbart News about the US Foreign-Born Population declining by 2.3 Million under Trump, heralding what it called the “Golden Age” of America. “We are seeing a massive decrease in net migration in our country. What we're doing is working!” Vance exulted, while immigration advocates mused about the long-term effect of negative migration on the US economy. The official White House handle itself celebrated a report showing more than 2.5 million native-born Americans gaining employment, while 670,000 foreign-born workers lost jobs under President Trump.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, saying that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, ”This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

This July, a man in Utah set his home on fire, killing himself, his 33-year-old partner, Jaimar Bravo Gil, and their children, police say. The family had moved to the U.S. from Venezuela, and Bravo Gil’s relatives said her partner had a history of violence but she had kept silent about most of the abuse for fear of being deported. She was not alone. At least two other women killed by their intimate partners this summer reportedly did not seek police help because they also feared deportation.

A growing chorus of attorneys, advocates and members of law enforcement are warning that the terror that has taken hold in immigrant communities is causing some people to remain in abusive relationships rather than risk deportation and separation from their families. While undocumented victims have always faced barriers in escaping abuse, experts say Trump administration policies have left them much more vulnerable.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Here are six changes impacting immigrant victims of domestic violence:

In January, DHS rolled back protections that kept immigration agents from entering “sensitive locations,” including domestic violence shelters and hospitals. DHS also began allowing enforcement at courthouses.

These changes have caused some domestic violence victims to think twice before seeking medical help, moving into a shelter, or seeking an order of protection, experts say.

There have been reports from across the country of immigration officers arresting people at courthouses, sometimes violently. A recent survey of more than 170 attorneys and advocates for immigrant survivors of domestic and sexual violence found that 70% said their clients had concerns about going to court for a matter related to their abuser.

Some jurisdictions are pushing back. In October, the top judge in Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, issued a local order barring civil ICE arrests in and around courthouses. Weeks later, Illinois lawmakers passed legislation barring civil ICE arrests in all state courthouses.

ICE raids have also had an impact on domestic violence shelters in Los Angeles and elsewhere. One advocate shared a story of a client who waited two days after an assault to go to the hospital. She only went after her attorney told her it was safe, and was found to have a broken nose and eye socket, according to a press release from the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors.

The Laken Riley Act requires detaining undocumented immigrants accused of certain crimes, even petty ones. Advocates say this will wrongfully ensnare domestic violence victims.

It is common for the victim to be arrested along with the abuser, or for abusers to call the police on undocumented victims as a form of control, experts say. And sometimes, victims commit crimes to survive, like shoplifting diapers or food for their children.

Under prior laws, an immigrant could discuss their abuse with a criminal court judge and argue for bond while the case is pending. Under the Laken Riley Act, passed by Congress in January, survivors have to make their case from inside the immigration detention system, and could be kept in custody throughout their case, even if the criminal allegations against them are later dropped.

Local police are often cooperating with ICE, and new funding incentivizes such partnerships.

Under the Trump administration, DHS has been aggressively pushing local police to make immigration arrests and share information on possible targets through a program known as 287(g). The federal government is now offering to reimburse the pay of local officers. The federal government lists over 1,000 agreements with law enforcement across 40 states.

“For survivors, this raises a critical question,” said Cecelia Levin, advocacy coordinator for the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors. “If an officer arrives at the door, what are they there to do? Are [officers] there to offer protection and help, or are they there to conduct an enforcement action?”

In Houston, the police department’s calls to ICE have increased more than 1,000% this year, the Houston Chronicle recently reported. Most referrals were related to traffic stops. This June, a Houston officer warned a woman reporting her abuser that the police contacted ICE and advised her not to file a report in person or risk being deported, she told the newspaper.

Domestic violence organizations, including shelters and legal aid, are facing financial turbulence as conditions for federal grants change repeatedly.

The Trump administration has issued a dizzying array of new policies that specifically impact immigrant victims of domestic violence. The federal Office on Violence Against Women set new conditions for its funding, requiring applicants to certify that they are not promoting gender ideology, DEI, or prioritizing “illegal aliens” over citizens. A group of state-level coalitions for survivors sued, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the new funding restrictions.

The administration also tried to use Victims of Crime Act grants — which fund compensation and assistance programs — to compel states to comply with federal immigration demands. The administration later backed off of this threat.

Then, in August, the administration said it would bar states from providing services to crime victims who “cannot immediately prove their immigration status” — a move being challenged in federal court by more than 20 state attorneys general.

While the lawsuits against these policies have had some wins, cuts are already happening. In Tennessee, for example, the state’s office that decides how to spend federal crime victim dollars ended immigrant legal aid grants this past June.

Safety nets for immigrants have been cut, making people more vulnerable.

This summer, the Trump administration announced that unauthorized immigrants would be barred from receiving certain social services, including Head Start, which has long supported families with education and health care for children. In September a federal judge blocked the policy change.

Cuts to assistance were also part of the Big Beautiful Bill, which made certain lawful immigrants, including survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, ineligible for SNAP food aid, Medicaid, and health care tax subsidies. As a result, an estimated 90,000 people will lose SNAP benefits in a typical month, according to the Congressional Budget Office. These benefits have never been available to people who are undocumented.

Nearly 80% of advocates polled in a 2017 survey by the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence reported that “most domestic violence victims rely on SNAP to help address their basic needs and to establish safety and stability.”

Losing food benefits, together with potential cuts to other support services, creates a heightened level of vulnerability for immigrants, making them more susceptible to ongoing abuse, experts say.

Some worry that the administration’s next target is protective visas.

Abusers can exploit people’s immigration fears, and the vulnerability of undocumented women is part of why Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. The law allows survivors to apply for permanent residence without the abuser’s involvement. The visas, U visas for victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes, and T visas for victims of human trafficking, require that they cooperate in the arrest and prosecutions of those who harmed them.

Police often embraced the tool, said Zain Lakhani, migrant rights and justice director at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “It enables law enforcement to be able to conduct investigations. It keeps the witnesses around, and it makes it safe for people to report crime.”

The special visa process has, for years, been plagued by lengthy wait times, which have grown to over a decade, according to The 19th. Applicants are supposed to receive protection from deportation while their application is awaiting a final decision, yet over the past year, women have been forced out of the country while waiting on pending T or U visas. A lawsuit seeking to halt those deportations is pending, and legislation to do the same has been introduced in Congress.

Project 2025 called for the total elimination of both visas, concluding that “victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit.” The 19th reported that access to these visas is already being restricted. About 3 in 5 applicants for these visas are immigrant women.

So what safe avenues still exist for immigrants who need to escape from abuse?

Advocates for survivors told The Marshall Project there is still help available. Local and national domestic violence hotlines are confidential, and they can help people understand what their options are and how to make a safety plan. Shelters take the privacy and safety of people in their care seriously and immigration agents would need a warrant signed by a judge to enter without permission and cannot rely on abuser-provided information to find people. The rules surrounding certain protections, like special visas, are still the law. Legal aid for immigrants is still available in many places, and attorney client privilege is legally protected regardless of immigration status.

And in many jurisdictions, advocates and attorneys are providing their services virtually, and using remote court options, said Casey Swegman, director of public policy at the Tahirih Justice Center, which serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence.

“We are ready to serve folks, and no survivor should feel like there isn’t help out there,” Swegman said.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/IWWnx9bmeKQJOewBLNmSU-4FNS5buHDF-MshFaX1LHE/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC8wM3F4eWh5Z25k/Znd1YWw4dTdzbWpw/aDU4N3RvLzI1MTEy/MV9HZXR0eV9DQUVT/U0FZMTEyMl9zb2Np/YWwuanBn,N,,2025-11-22 12:57:17.269730

“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said.
In a phone conversation with an ABC News reporter, Trump was quoted as saying Greene’s resignation was “great news”.
He added that Greene hadn’t given him notice but “it doesn’t matter, you know but I think it’s great.
Greene did not give House Speaker Mike Johnson advance notice of her resignation, according to NBC News.","Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday evening she will be resigning from office effective 5 January 2026, in the wake of souring relations with President Donald Trump, mostly recently over a vote to force the release of files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein.

In a four-page statement, the Georgia congresswoman said the legislative branch had been “sidelined” and accused Republican leaders of refusing to advance conservative priorities such as border security or “America First” policies.

Until recently, Greene had been one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, crediting him with inspiring her to run for Congress in 2020. But in recent months, the congresswoman had become a surprising critic of the Trump administration – taking on the president not just over the release of the Epstein files, but also his administration’s support for Israel, and extending expiring Obamacare subsidies. She began questioning whether Trump was truly an “America first” president.

“No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,” Greene said.

“When the common American people finally realize and understand that the political industrial complex of both parties is ripping this country apart, that not one elected leader like me is able to stop Washington’s machine from gradually destroying our country, and instead the reality is that they, common Americans, the people, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.

“Until then I’m going back to the people I love, to live life to the fullest as I always have, and look forward to a new path ahead,” Greene added.

In a phone conversation with an ABC News reporter, Trump was quoted as saying Greene’s resignation was “great news”. He added that Greene hadn’t given him notice but “it doesn’t matter, you know but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.”

Previously, Trump has called Greene a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he would endorse a challenger against her when she ran for re-election next year. In a social media post last week, Trump speculated that Greene had turned against him because he advised her not to run for Senate and claimed she was “upset that I don’t return her phone calls”. In response, Greene accused Trump of lying and said she believed it was her persistent calls for his administration to release the Epstein files that “sent him over the edge”.

Greene did not give House Speaker Mike Johnson advance notice of her resignation, according to NBC News. Her departure in January will narrow Johnson’s already razor-thin majority, leaving him less room to maneuver.

Greene explained her decision in a 10-minute social media video posted on X on Friday night.

In her resignation statement, she said: “I have fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans to power … Through it all I have never changed or went back on my campaign promises … America First should mean America First and only Americans First, with no other foreign country ever being attached to America First in our halls of government.”

Last week, Greene said she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” after Trump announced he was withdrawing his support for and endorsement of her.

In a post on X, Greene said that “a hotbed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”.

Greene reiterated these threats in her statement, saying that she has faced “never ending personal attacks, death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me, that most people could never withstand even for a day”.

Her resignation comes after months of opinions that go against those of the White House and some of her Republican colleagues. Earlier this month, Trump pushed back against criticism from Greene, saying she had “lost her way” after she accused him of paying too much attention to foreign affairs and not enough to the rising cost of living in the US – points she also addressed in her Friday statement.

Greene said she had broken with the US president over several issues, including the issuing of H-1B visas to skilled foreign workers, a ban on AI regulation, “50-year mortgage scams”, involvement in foreign wars, and the release of files related to the crimes of Epstein, the late pedophile Trump socialized with for more than 15 years.

“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.

Greene has been an outspoken opponent of Israel’s war on Gaza, with US support, calling it “a genocide”.

“If I am cast aside by Maga Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well,” Greene said.

Her resignation comes halfway through her third term in the US House of Representatives. In her resignation speech, she did not say what she would do next but hinted at a future in politics, saying: “When the common American people finally realize and understand that the Political Industrial Complex of both parties is ripping this country apart … [and] that they, common Americans, The People, possess the real power over Washington, then I’ll be here by their side to rebuild it.”

Political strategist Shermichael Singleton said Greene might be “looking at future plan”.

“If I were advising her, hey, you might be able to get through this brief moment in time,” Singleton told CNN. “But perhaps she thought otherwise. Maybe she’s looking at future plans. But this is a big shocker.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f77e660498bd99368208387da77d4cfeede17fd5/522_0_3184_2547/master/3184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=911e6e1369270e80ade731f6be50205c",N,,2025-11-22 11:57:52.239898

Thomas McCarthy said his wife Jessica's interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was almost over when ICE agents entered the room and detained her for overstaying her visa.

""We heard a knock on the door. She stepped out, and then they came in and said, 'Yeah, two ICE agents want to ask us questions,'"" McCarthy said.

The couple has been together for two years and married for a year and a half. They celebrated their marriage in the Catholic Church about a month ago.

""I'm just kind of in disbelief about it because we were doing the right thing,"" McCarthy said.

Jessica is one of several people detained over the last week at USCIS offices for visa overstays. Immigration attorneys say they have never seen anything like this before.

""It's just like a punch in the face, like my world's been turned upside down,"" McCarthy said.

McCarthy said his wife was worried this could happen after seeing previous ABC 10News coverage about the USCIS detentions, but he reassured her everything would be fine.

""I think she saw your article specifically in San Diego of that happening recently,"" McCarthy said.

Immigration attorney Jacob Sapochnick, who McCarthy has hired, said he received a frantic call about the detention. Sapochnick is one of several attorneys who told ABC 10News that people are now being detained at their green card interviews.

Sapochnick said the law allows people to adjust their status from a visa overstay to a green card and argues this new tactic is a waste of resources.

""The thing is we will be able to release them. It's just, it's a waste of resources for them. It's anxiety for the spouses, it's trauma that's gonna last for a long time,"" Sapochnick said.

ICE referred ABC 10News to a statement sent earlier in the week about the USCIS detentions, saying they are committed to enforcing federal immigration laws and that people unlawfully present in the U.S., including at places like USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal.

""She didn't do anything wrong. We went in there with good faith, you know, doing everything the legal way, paid our dues,"" McCarthy said.

A protest has been held outside an Oxfordshire immigration removal centre that is set to reopen under government plans.

Campsfield House Immigration Removal Centre is due to reopen later this year, after closing in 2018 following riots, escapes and complaints about conditions.

Along with protesters, the plans have been opposed by MPs, residents and charities, as well as Oxford City Council.

A Home Office spokesperson said the centre, near Oxford Airport, will boost ""our immigration detention capacity to support a higher pace of removals"".

Emma Jones, speaking on behalf of the protest group Coalition to Keep Campsfield Closed, said the centre was an ""appalling"" place, and that the plans were ""devastating to so many people in Oxfordshire"".

""We are here in solidarity with people who are detained simply because of their immigration status, not because of any crime they've committed,"" she said.

The plans to reopen Campsfield, she said, are ""a huge worry"" to people who care about human rights.

Ms Jones said: ""The people of Oxfordshire have made their voices clear, and will continue to do so, that refugees are welcome here. This is meant to be a city of sanctuary. Campsfield is the opposite of sanctuary.""

The government has said the centre will initially provide 160 beds and then up to 400 following a £70m expansion, and will be used to accommodate ""a mixture of time-served foreign national offenders and immigration offenders while we prepare to remove them from the UK"".

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Opening Campsfield Immigration Removal Centre will boost our immigration detention capacity to support a higher pace of removals.

(KOIN) — A McMinnville High School student was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers while on his lunch break off campus, the school district confirmed to KOIN 6 News.

The 17-year-old senior is a U.S. citizen, according to the Yamhill County News-Register. The district did not confirm those specific details to KOIN 6, saying they couldn’t share the student’s name or other personal information due to privacy laws.

“This afternoon, we became aware of an incident off school grounds in which a high school student was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during today’s lunch period.

“School leaders will continue to increase visibility during arrival and dismissal today, and district-level administrators will be assigned across campuses to support students and staff,” Ferrua said.

The district further reiterated its commitment to state and federal laws, including not releasing personally identifying information about students unless there’s a judicial order reviewed by district leaders. The district also said they will continue to follow Oregon Sanctuary Promise laws, prohibiting district staff from sharing information for immigrant enforcement purposes, unless there’s a court order.

Law enforcement officers said that the aide had actually paid a body artist $500 to give her scars on her arms, chest, neck and face, for which the officers obtained a receipt and a consent form with a copy of her driver’s license.

The woman, Natalie Greene, 26, of Ocean City, N.J., told law enforcement officers that she had been bound at gunpoint at a nature reserve on the night of July 23 by three men, who had written the words “TRUMP WHORE” onto her stomach with a black marker during the slashing, the authorities said.

She also claimed that her attackers had also scrawled the name of her boss in marker on her back with the word “RACIST,” according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.

The complaint did not name the congressman, but a legislative database indicated that Ms. Greene had been working at the time as a constituent advocate director for Representative Jeff Van Drew, who represents South Jersey.

Ms. Greene was arrested on Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to convey false information and hoaxes, and making false statements, court records showed.

The charges against Ms. Greene carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. She was released on $200,000 bond.

Louis M. Barbone, a lawyer for Ms. Greene, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday but told The Associated Press that his client was presumed innocent under the law.

“At the age of 26, my client served her community working full time to serve the constituents of the congressman with loyalty and fidelity,” he said in statement. “She did that while being a full-time student.”

A spokeswoman for Mr. Van Drew did not immediately answer questions on Friday about Ms. Greene’s arrest.

In a statement, the congressman’s office said that those in the office were “deeply saddened” by the episode.

“While Natalie is no longer associated with the congressman’s government office, our thoughts and prayers are with her and hope she’s getting the care she needs,” the statement read.

On the night of July 23, the authorities received a 911 from a person who claimed that she and Ms. Greene had been attacked by three unknown men at Egg Harbor Township Nature Reserve, the criminal complaint said.

The caller, whom investigators did not name but said was a co-conspirator, told the operator that Ms. Greene had been targeted because of her job.

“They were talking about politics,” the complaint quoted the co-conspirator as saying in the 911 call about the supposed attackers. “They were like calling her like racist, calling her a whore.”

When the police arrived at the nature reserve, officers found Ms. Greene on the ground, with her feet and hands bound with black zip ties, the authorities said.

Investigators said that Ms. Greene’s co-conspirator had become agitated when they asked for the keys to Ms. Greene’s Maserati but that she had ultimately consented.

Inside the vehicle, officers discovered the same type of zip ties and a roll of duct tape, according to the complaint.

While combing through the co-conspirator’s phone browsing history, officers learned that the co-conspirator had searched where to buy zip ties, the authorities said.

It was not immediately clear whether the co-conspirator faced any charges.

Two days after Ms. Greene claimed she had been attacked, she told an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the office where she worked had frequently received threatening mail, the complaint said.

“There’s so many,” the complaint quoted Ms. Greene as telling the agent. “Windmills belong on your grave. We keep all of our hate mail. We recently got like, a letter with like powder in it and stuff.”

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, ”This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people.

Salvador spent much of his first two weeks at the ICE detention center in El Paso, Texas, worrying that he’d be sent back to Mexico, a country he hadn’t lived in for decades. The rest of the time, the expired food, overcrowded quarters, unsanitary conditions, and separation from his family, particularly his toddler, left him hopeless and depressed. When his wife sent a photo of the boy, guards wouldn’t allow him to see it.

In his decades living undocumented in the U.S., Salvador has never been charged with a crime beyond a traffic infraction. He had steady work in construction and paid his income taxes. But masked, unidentified Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detained him the morning of Aug. 18 outside his house in Rohnert Park.

Now he was stuck in Texas, while his wife and six children anxiously waited for him back home in California.

On Sept. 3, a judge at the El Paso detention center granted him the $8,000 bond that, if paid, would allow Salvador to return home. The judge said he had considered the importance of Salvador’s relationship with his 2-year-old son, who has Down syndrome.

Salvador felt a deep sense of relief — but it wouldn’t last.

Two days later, the judge rescinded his own order, denying the bond. The Board of Immigration Appeals, a body at the Department of Justice empowered to set precedent for immigration courts across the country, had just decided that immigration judges could no longer grant bonds. It was a policy shift that went against decades of precedent. Salvador, along with thousands of other people in ICE facilities across the U.S., was stuck in detention with no clear way out.

The BIA’s decision, a controversial and underreported ruling by an obscure appellate body that accepts no public input, is a dramatic change from how the immigration system has worked for decades. Legal experts say it is the latest instance of the Trump administration flouting the law in order to speed up immigration enforcement by any means, and doing so in little known corners of government, away from public scrutiny.

Salvador’s case is one of tens of thousands, as immigrants find themselves stranded in detention for lengthy periods — to the point that some choose to be deported over remaining locked up. The ruling leaves immigrants with fewer options to find freedom.

“The immigration court system, as most anyone who’s been through it knows, is extremely imperfect,” said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. “ICE [is] taking this wrong approach to what the law says, and then the Board of Immigration Appeals [is] rubber-stamping it.”

Salvador immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in 1997, moving close to relatives in Sonoma County. While working at a Wendy’s in Petaluma, he started dating a coworker, Alondra, another recent Mexican arrival. They married and had five kids. Along with Alondra’s son from a previous relationship, the family settled in Rohnert Park. (Given their tenuous immigration status, they declined to share their last names.)

“Everyone here knows my family,” Alondra said in Spanish. “We’re part of the community. This place makes me feel peaceful.”

In 2024, Salvador and Alondra’s oldest child turned 21 and, as a U.S. citizen, had the right to petition for his parents to gain residency. Undergoing this process would be risky. Salvador and Alondra had crossed the border decades before without being detained by Customs and Border Patrol and had lived ever since without much interaction with the federal government. Applying for residency would put them on the feds’ radar. It was a calculated risk ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

“We thought that if [Donald Trump] wins, applying for residency might be a bigger risk, but we had to take that risk,” Salvador said. “Unfortunately, he won.”

When ICE began large raids in Los Angeles in June, Alondra was afraid to leave the house. She stopped shopping at the local Walmart. But Salvador was less worried.

“They said ICE was at the CVS, at the Mexican restaurant,” he said. “I didn’t believe it. Until they showed up at my home.”

On the morning of Aug. 18, moments after Salvador had driven away from his house en route to his construction job, an unmarked car with a flashing red light pulled him over. Masked, uniformed men emerged, instructed Salvador to exit his vehicle, and handcuffed him. He had no idea who they were. A couple of hours later, Salvador sat in ICE’s holding facility in San Francisco.

“I asked them to let me call my boss so that I could tell him I would be missing work that day,” Salvador said. “I thought I’d be back on the job the next day.”

Instead, he was held in San Francisco for four days, in a facility not built for overnight stays. He slept under a thin foil blanket, his work boots serving as a pillow.

Nicole Gorney, a lawyer with Vital Immigrant Defense Advocacy and Services, the legal aid group working on Salvador’s residency application, went to see him three days after he was detained. But when she arrived at ICE headquarters in San Francisco, a receptionist said Salvador was no longer there.

“She said he’d been transferred,” Gorney said, “and couldn’t tell me where.”

From Salvador’s charging documents, Gorney learned that he’d been taken to El Paso Service Processing Center, an ICE detention facility that is often a final stop before deportation.

As soon as she learned where he was, Gorney filed a request for a bond hearing. Since Salvador had no criminal record and several young children, she figured she had a good chance of getting him out.

On Sept. 3, two weeks into Salvador’s detention in El Paso, Gorney, Alondra and their teenage son appeared by videoconference at the bond hearing. The judge at the detention center listened to Gorney plead on behalf of her client and reviewed letters of support from his longtime employer and other community members. At the end of the hearing, the judge decided Salvador wasn’t a danger or flight risk and granted him bond.

On Sept. 4, the Department of Homeland Security’s lawyer appealed. Gorney said the lawyer explained that the DHS instructed him to appeal every successful bond request now.

The following day, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued the Matter of Yajure Hurtado. The ruling over one Venezuelan man’s ability to seek asylum resulted in stripping any immigration judge of the ability to grant bond. Salvador’s bond was rescinded.

“I was sure they were going to deport me,” Salvador said. “I was going to be away from my family, everything I own, and be in Mexico. What was I going to do there all by myself?”

It was unclear when Salvador would see his family again, and if the next time he would see them would be in the United States.

At the heart of the BIA’s decision in the Matter of Yajure Hurtado is a reinterpretation of what it means to be “seeking admission” to the U.S. While Salvador wanted to return to the life he’d spent decades building in Sonoma County, the DHS contended that, legally speaking, he’d never entered the United States at all.

Historically, the government has treated immigrants at the border who are trying to come into the U.S. and those already inside the country differently. Newcomers are legally much easier to expel. The law looks more compassionately on undocumented people who have strong community ties or people in the U.S. who depend on them — especially young children, as in Salvador’s case.

But the Hurtado decision contends that undocumented people, even after decades of living, working, and paying taxes in the U.S., are still “seeking admission” to the country. By classifying immigrants as newcomers, the Trump administration moved them into a legal category in which a separate set of laws apply. The newcomer rules do not offer immigration judges the right to grant bond.

“What ICE is attempting to do here is to say every immigrant in the United States, unless they came with a visa, is essentially still asking for that first permission to enter the United States,” Altman said. “Even if they’ve been living in their community and working and supporting U.S.-citizen children for 15 years, they are the legal equivalent of knocking at the door asking for admission.” As unwanted guests, they can’t be eligible for bonds to return to their U.S. homes — because the government essentially says they never had a home in the U.S.

When immigrants have appealed these rulings, moving their cases from immigration to federal courts which operate with greater judicial independence, more than 100 (opens in new tab) federal judges have rebuked the Hurtado interpretation, finding that longtime undocumented residents should not be classified as newcomers. But the DHS has continued to argue on behalf of the new interpretation, compelling immigration judges to deny bond.

“ You see how baffling and clearly contrary to the law it is in the ways in which the government just keeps losing and losing and losing when they try to defend it in court,” Altman said. “ We see it across the board when it comes to immigration law and policy, and civil rights generally: a willingness to sort of brazenly adopt an unreasonable and illegal interpretation of federal law in order to impose cruelty and terror on immigrant communities.”

With Salvador’s bond swiftly revoked, Gorney waited for the habeas corpus petition she filed on his behalf to work its way through the federal court system, which in recent months has tended to judge more liberally in favor of immigrants. Increasingly, the only way to leave ICE detention is with a federal habeas corpus ruling, a centuries-old protection against unlawful incarceration.

Week after week, Salvador waited.

At the ICE facility, he met detainees from all walks of life. “There were Chinese, Mexicans, Russians, 70-year-olds, even 80-year-olds,” Salvador said. Some had been detained by ICE for years.

The whole time he was in El Paso, he saw one detainee released back into the U.S. He saw several others deported to their homelands. So in mid-October, when guards told him he’d won his case, he knew how lucky he was.

Salvador bought soda and chips from the commissary for his friends in detention. “They all hugged me,” he said.

Salvador’s situation was more rare than they knew. The share of ICE detainees who were released on bond or under parole or supervision following the Hurtado decision in September 2025 was 3%, versus 26% in October 2024, before the ruling, according to a recent study by the Migration Policy Institute.

Salvador was unusually fortunate in that he had a lawyer who filed his habeas petition in a federal court that is known to be sympathetic to detained migrants. The vast majority of ICE detainees do not have lawyers to file a petition on their behalf.

“So for most people, you have to kind of figure out on your own, in a language that is probably not your first language, how to access the federal court system, how to file this petition, what it looks like,” Altman said. “And for most people, that is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to do.”

Salvador was released from ICE detention Oct. 15, nearly two months after ICE detained him. He boarded a bus in El Paso and 16 hours later was greeted by Alondra and his children in Bakersfield, where they’d driven down to meet him. It was a bittersweet reunion. “The baby forgot who I was,” Salvador said.

While he’s happy to be home, he’s out of work after his employer of 16 years refused to give him back his job.

“We’re running out of money, paying rent and bills,” Alondra said. She’s taken an extra job to keep the family afloat. “At the same time, we’re not getting down. We have to believe things are going to turn out OK.”

Salvador’s petition for residency has been moved from USCIS to immigration court, where he’s scheduled to see a judge in 2027. Alondra has a December appointment at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in San Francisco to determine whether she can become a permanent resident.

“I know that sometimes they detain people at those appointments,” she said. “So I’m a little afraid.”

But she will have something with her that most immigrants don’t have, something that can make all the difference: Gorney, her lawyer.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_4arssfa8ah28b3e1kabdim2s27/-FWEBP,N,,2025-11-22 13:57:03.255026

As an undocumented immigrant, she pays in-state tuition rates at East Los Angeles College — $619 per semester, a fraction of the $5,286 charged to out-of-state students.

Because of her immigration status, Sara is not eligible for Pell Grants and other federal student aid. Under a 2001 state law and the California Dream Act — Sara pays lower in-state tuition and receives state financial aid for college — she has been able to afford her education. When she receives her associate’s degree, she intends to transfer to a Cal State or UC campus and major in business administration.

But Friday her dreams felt more out of reach, after the Trump administration sued California, alleging the state’s laws granting in-state tuition rates and financial aid to undocumented students are illegal. The suit threatens the higher education goals of about 80,000 undocumented college students, many who arrived in the state as children.

“After I get my degree, I want to use it to work in California and contribute to my community,” said Sara, who requested to withhold her last name because she is fearful of federal immigration enforcement action. “How does that hurt anyone?”

Trump seeks to overturn California law

The Department of Justice on Thursday sued California and its three public higher education systems, seeking to overturn a decades-old state law that provides lower in-state tuition to undocumented students who have attended the state’s high schools. The Trump administration also sued to put an end to the California Dream Act, which it alleges gives illegal preference for financial aid to people who are not citizens.

The moves are the latest in a series of similar legal actions the federal government has taken this year against states including Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma and Minnesota.

U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said the government took the action because California has a “flagrant disregard for federal law.”

State leaders disagreed, saying they will defend the laws.

“The DOJ has now filed three meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California in a single week. Good luck, Trump. We’ll see you in court,” said Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom. The other suits are against the Proposition 50 redistricting effort and a state law banning federal immigration agents from hiding their identities with masks.

Though other states have faced similar suits, California — with the largest number of undocumented students in the nation — stands as the biggest such test case of Trump’s second term. California has prided itself on its expansive public higher education system and its pioneering support of immigrant communities.

“It’s another attack on immigrants. So not a surprise at all,” said Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who said he would “review the case and identify any appropriate responses to it.” Bonta noted that with tuition and aid policies, California is “making its own decision. We have 10th Amendment state sovereignty.” He said the state is “using our own funds and following all the laws, and that Trump “really wants to micromanage the policy of cities and of states.”

In 2001, lawmakers passed AB 540, which gives in-state tuition rates to all students who graduated from California high schools after attending for at least three years. The California Dream Act passed a decade later and opened up state aid, including Cal Grants, to undocumented students. It was later expanded to include students who were citizens but had an undocumented parent.

The Trump administration’s challenge to California’s tuition and aid statutes focuses on a 1996 federal law that says people in the U.S. without legal permission should “not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state ... for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit ... without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.”

Legal scholars have debated whether the federal law affects California tuition and aid laws because the price tags apply to citizens and non-citizens alike.

Critics of Trump’s actions also say the law does not speak specifically to tuition rates. Some courts have interpreted the word “benefit” to include cheaper tuition.

Higher education institutions maintain that their tuition practices abide by the law.

“California Community Colleges are open-access institutions dedicated to serving all students. The California Community Colleges will follow all legal obligations and fully participate in the judicial process alongside our state partners,” said Chancellor Sonya Christian.

Community colleges enroll the vast majority of undocumented immigrant students in the state. Between 12,000 and 14,000 of such students attend CSUs and UCs.

“Although we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, our commitment remains unchanged: We will continue to ensure that all students who qualify under state law have access to an affordable, high-quality education,” Christian said. “We will also continue to comply fully with all current federal and state requirements.”

How students are responding

For students like Sara, the lawsuit stirs more uncertainty in a year she said has “shaken” immigrant communities, including her relatives who are citizens and permanent legal residents.

“We have ICE raids, we have people picked up off the street and in their homes. Now they don’t even want us to educate ourselves?” she said. “This is my home, not a place I can’t remember where I was born.”

Juan, an undocumented student at Cal State Northridge, shared similar sentiments. He also traveled as a toddler with his parents from Mexico to the U.S. and pays in-state education fees.

“Even with that, it is expensive — you pay for gas, books, computers,” said Juan, who requested that his last name not be used.

Juan has an older sibling who was approved for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which provides work authorization to people who moved to the U.S. as children and lack legal status. The program has largely been closed to new applications for years, so his options to earn money are limited.

“I help my parents, siblings and friends with odd jobs — running social media accounts, housework, pet-sitting,” he said. “That money can help pay for the lower tuition rates. It cannot cover out-of-state rates.”

At CSU Northridge, the in-state rate per semester is $3,925, compared with $10,585 for non-California residents.

Ju Hong, who attended UC Berkeley as an undocumented student and directs the UCLA Dream Resource Center, said he was “devastated” by the suit.

“I think we are going backwards,” said Hong, who was born in South Korea. “Immigrant youth and students and organizers won major victories with AB 540 though ground-up organizing for decades. This is not just about a legal action. It’s an attack on immigrant students and youth who have grown up, have studied here and contributed to California.”

Jack Feng, a graduate student at UCLA and immigrant rights advocate, said the moment calls for broader support for undocumented students across UC.

He said UC “should join the state of California in aggressively litigating against this attack.”

“UC should expand immigration legal services, mental health resources, and emergency financial aid for undocumented students,” said Feng, who is the external vice president of the UCLA Graduate Students Assn.

Legal questions loom

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA Law School, said California’s tuition law does not appear to violate the federal law the Trump administration is using in its challenge.

“Federal law prohibits certain benefits to undocumented students based on residency in the state. But AB 540 does not make people eligible based on residency,” he said. “Instead it ties eligibility to whether students have graduated high school and attended three years of high school in the state.”

He said the difference between residency and high school graduation is a key legal point.

Arulanantham explained that in-state tuition is open to all students, regardless of legal status. But all students must meet the California high school attendance and graduation criteria — even if they now live in another state.

“There are lots of citizens who would not qualify for in-state tuition under a residence-based rule — but who do qualify based on the graduation criteria,” he said.

Arulanantham said California’s tuition law has at times helped more students who have legal documentation than those who do not.

A 2012 report from the University of California that tallied AB 540 recipients from 2002 to 2011 showed that, in those years, U.S. citizens and people with legal authorization were frequently more likely to make use of the law than undocumented immigrants.

In the 2010-2011 academic year, the report said, 1,260 documented UC students received California resident tuition rates compared with 620 “potentially undocumented” people.

UC said it has not compiled a public report of more recent data.

The California law has withstood earlier challenges. The state Supreme Court upheld it in 2010 after out-of-state students sued. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the case.

In those cases, judges said undocumented immigrants were not receiving preferential treatment because of their immigration status but because they attended and graduated from California schools. They said U.S. citizens who graduated from the state’s schools had the same opportunity.

Thursday’s complaint was filed in the Eastern District of California. In June, after the Trump administration sued over the law in Texas, the state agreed to stop giving in-state tuition to undocumented immigrant students. Kentucky and Oklahoma also said they would not defend their tuition laws.

Undocumented students have joined the Kentucky case to fight to keep the law there in place and are attempting to do the same in Oklahoma. Illinois and Minnesota said they would challenge the Trump lawsuits against their states. None of the cases have reached a conclusion.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ddec614/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1e%2F33%2Fc029069d45318e9cb54d1bee01a5%2F1297686-me-uc-board-of-regents-daca-students-jlc-0517-10843.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 10:59:52.282685

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” said Suttell.","Aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents drew the ire of Rhode Island’s governor and state Supreme Court chief justice this week when a high school intern was detained and questioned before being released.

The incident, captured on video, showed ICE agents detaining the teen, who is taking part in an internship experience at Rhode Island Superior Court, as he was being driven to school by a judge.

“ICE agents wrongfully detained a high school intern outside the Superior Court – an outrageous and indefensible act that could have completely upended a young person’s life,” Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Thursday.

The Department of Homeland Security has faced criticism for pursuing targets in or near courthouses, after rescinding guidance limiting activity in such locations.

Here’s how the latest incident unfolded.

ICE agent took photos in courtroom, stopped judge’s car

It began in a courtroom, where the teen noticed someone taking photos of him, a member of the court staff familiar with the situation told CNN.

When security asked the person to stop taking photos to abide by courthouse rules, he identified himself as an ICE agent, the court staff member said.

CNN has asked DHS why agents were taking photos of the intern.

Upon learning an ICE agent was taking photos of him, the intern appeared shaken by the experience, and Superior Court Associate Justice Joseph McBurney offered to drive him to his high school, the staffer said.

ICE agents later surrounded the judge’s car as he intended to drive the intern to school, according to the court staffer and a video of the incident.

In a video from the Deportation Defense Network of Rhode Island, at least six federal agents are seen near McBurney’s car, asking him and the teen to exit it.

“Are you a judge here?” one of the ICE agents appears to ask McBurney after he opens his car door.

About 30 seconds later, a federal agent is seen restraining the intern’s hands behind his back and escorting him away from the vehicle as nearby protesters shout at the agents.

McBurney continues talking to federal agents, explaining the teen is an intern, and they were making a mistake, a member of the court staff familiar with the situation told CNN.

The intern, who was not named by the court or ICE, was taken across a busy street in front of the Providence courthouse. He was released after his identity was verified by the federal agents, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Judiciary said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told CNN the agents had been searching for a “child predator” and “briefly questioned someone who resembled the target” but the person “was never arrested or taken into custody.”

CNN has reached out to the DHS and Judge McBurney for more information.

ICE tactics under scrutiny

The incident comes as ICE has continued to make arrests at courthouses across the country.

In fact, demonstrators were already holding an anti-ICE rally outside the courthouse to protest ICE activity at courthouses and in support of virtual court hearings, for which immigrants would not need to be physically present, reducing their exposure to ICE activity.

Video of the protesters shows demonstrators shouting “Let him go!” as the teen was released. “He’s a f**king kid,” one protester is heard shouting, with another one adding, “That’s a 16-year-old!”

Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul A. Suttell said the incident reinforces the judiciary’s need to focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings.

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the Judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” said Suttell.

According to ICE’s website, ICE does not detain unaccompanied children except in rare instances, though CNN has previously reported on similar instances.

“This was not a harmless mistake. It was the direct result of callous and chaotic policies by the Trump Administration,” McKee said. “Moreover, ICE’s failure to exercise even a shred of due diligence is shameful and underscores just how broken and dangerous these federal policies are.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/screenshot-2025-11-22-at-11-43-49-am.png?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-22 07:56:46.239622

The Congolese family was detained on November 12th at the Champlain Port of Entry, after the Canada Border Services Agency denied their asylum claim, according to a statement from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.

The family had first entered the U.S. without authorization in 2022, according to the spokesperson. An immigration judge issued a deportation order for the family in February of this year, and their appeal was dismissed in October.

""To date, no member of the family unit has valid current or pending status changes with USCIS,"" the spokesperson said, referring to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

One of the children, sixteen year old Joel Andre, is a student at Deering High School, and a fixture of Portland's Kennedy Park neighborhood pickup soccer community.

""It really sent shockwaves through the KP community,"" said organizer Anthony Fiori.

Fiori said Joel first arrived on the soccer scene in 2024, and immediately made a strong impression.

""I was like, 'Whoa, this kid's skills are crazy,'"" Fiori said.

Beyond his talent on the field, fellow organizer Matheus Santana said Joel's character has made him one the most well-liked and respected players in the community.

""Every single person that encounters him loves him, wants to be on his team,"" Santana said. ""Not just because he's a good player, but because he's a fantastic teammate.""

Fiori said he found out the family was in custody after seeing a GoFundMe page this week raising money for their legal fees. But he said Joel's friends had noticed him missing from school for about a week.

""So they were looking for him for like a whole week, very confused,"" he said. ""Why is he not in school? Like, what's going on here? He's not one to, you know, skip school like that.""

On Friday, a spokesperson for Portland Public Schools said the whole district was devastated by Joel's detention, and that of his sister, Casco Bay High School student Estafania Andre, adding that administrators and mental health professionals have been supporting students and staff.

""To have students in class one week and then suddenly gone the next is traumatic,"" the district said in a written statement. ""We will continue to do all we can to support this family and others affected by immigration enforcement actions.""

Joel and Estafania's older sister, Olivia Andre, is also in ICE custody.

But a spokesperson for Congresswoman Chellie Pingree's office said ICE confirmed that it was not involved in the initial arrest of the family, and that it was Customs and Border Protection that ""took custody of the family and transferred them directly to Texas.""

ICE's online detainee tracker shows the mother, Carine Balenda Mbizi, is currently being held in a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas. Pingree's spokesperson said her office has not been able to confirm whether the family is being detained together.

Online immigration court records indicate Mbizi was issued a deportation order in February, and that her appeal of that case was denied last month.

Meanwhile, the family's sudden absence is also being felt at their Jehovah's Witnesses congregation.

""Learning that they were detained was a surprise for me,"" said Douglas Mpay, an ordained minister, who said he helped support the family when they first arrived at the church. He said they've been valued members of the congregation.

""They are good people. They have a good influence, good friends in the community,"" he said. ""Really, really nice people.""

Mpay started a GoFundMe that has since raised over $27,000 to cover the family's legal fees.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c5a739/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F1c%2Ffec71c2848489f39480404a3b72e%2Fjoelandre1-courtesy.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 10:59:37.051964

President Donald Trump's administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California's.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren't in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don’t violate federal law if they provide the same rates to U.S. citizens in the same circumstances — meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as U.S. citizens.

It is the latest action by Trump's administration since he issued executive orders in February directing federal agencies to stop public benefits from going to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and to challenge state and local policies seen as favoring those immigrants over some citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president’s orders enforce federal immigration laws.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The Justice Department also recently sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters, and over California’s new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said in a statement: “The DOJ has now filed three meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California in a single week. Good luck, Trump. We’ll see you in court.”

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” it said in a statement.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump’s announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump’s decision “will tear families apart.” Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, ”This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.”

Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.

In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that people in the country illegally could face “significant financial penalty” if they chose to stay.
Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now,” McLaughlin said in February.","A team of lawyers filed suit Thursday against federal authorities on behalf of immigrants facing what they called “ruinous civil fines” that reach up to $1.8 million.

Daily fines of $998, designed to encourage immigrants in the US illegally to leave the country, have been imposed on more than 21,500 people who the lawyers said were trying to comply with immigration laws.

The fines are “grossly disproportionate to the gravity” of any immigration violations, said the suit, calling them unconstitutional.

The lawsuit was filed in a Massachusetts court on behalf of two immigrant women.

It seeks class-action status to represent people facing fines that lawyers say have totalled more than $6 billion since President Donald Trump returned to office early this year and launched an immigration crackdown.

“The people we serve are doing exactly what the law requires — pursuing legal relief through immigration courts and immigration agencies,” Hasan Shafiqullah, a supervising attorney with The Legal Aid Society, one of the groups handling the suit, said in a news release. “In return, the government is threatening to seize their wages, cars, even their homes.”

The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the suit as “just another attempt to nullify federal immigration law through activist litigation.”

“The plaintiffs in this case are here illegally and are suing so they can remain in the country illegally without any consequence or penalty – contrary to decades-old federal law,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

One of the two plaintiffs, a Florida woman identified in the complaint only as Nancy M. to shield her from retribution, had been ordered to leave the US, but also had what’s known as an “order of supervision” and was meeting annually with immigration authorities as she tried to become a legal permanent resident.

Instead, earlier this year she received a bill for roughly $1.8 million, a number apparently reached by totalling daily $998 fines for the past five years.

The order comes in a case, brought by a taxpayer advocacy group, that challenged an I.R.S. decision to provide migrants’ addresses, as included on their tax returns, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal law tightly controls the use of taxpayer information, and several top I.R.S. officials quit this spring over concerns that giving tax records to ICE on a large scale could be illegal.

Still, officials from the two agencies worked for months to create a process for ICE officials to access addresses on record with the I.R.S. In June, ICE asked the I.R.S. for information on roughly 1.3 million people, and in August, the I.R.S. turned over the last known addresses of roughly 47,000 people, according to court documents.

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said on Friday that the I.R.S. plan to share information with ICE was too broad. She said that federal law only allows for the I.R.S. to share tax information with other government officials who are directly involved in an ongoing investigation. The I.R.S. sent the thousands of addresses to a single ICE official, who Judge Kollar-Kotelly said could not have been personally conducting so many investigations.

“Plaintiffs have shown that the I.R.S.’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

The judge paused the existing data-sharing agreement between I.R.S. and ICE and said she would need to review any other attempts to share taxpayer information. Previously, she had ordered the I.R.S. to disclose any other ICE requests for tax records.

The I.R.S. has long encouraged undocumented migrants to file a tax return, and many tax lawyers and immigration activists had trusted the agency would not use tax information to deport people.

DHS Used Customs Investigations Authority to Demand Social Media Account Information Totally Unrelated to Enforcing Trade Laws

Text of the Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to stop using a trade enforcement law to demand social media account information in investigations totally unrelated to trade.

DHS demanded Meta reveal the owner of an Instagram account that criticized Trump administration immigration policies, citing federal customs summons authority. The order is being challenged by the account owner, represented by the ACLU.

“DHS apparently is trying to expose an individual’s identity in order to chill criticism of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies. That is a profound misuse of the limited customs authority granted” under the law, Wyden wrote.

In 2017, the first Trump administration attempted to use customs summons authority to unmask the owner of a Twitter account that was critical of federal immigration policy. DHS later rescinded its request amid widespread criticism. The DHS Office of Inspector General ultimately determined the request likely exceeded the agency’s legal authority.

Half of the protesters stayed on the corner of Evans Road and Centrewest Court holding banners, signs and noisemakers. They manned a folding table with coffee and refreshments while playing Latin music.

The other half stood in front of the building and shouted chants like “Pigs, go home!” A marked Cary Police Department vehicle circled the building a few times.

At least one SUV pulled into the facility, which has two security gates on both sides blocking a parking lot and signs reading “No Photography. No Video Recording” on the gates. Near the building were two portable, solar-powered surveillance cameras.

No violence or property damage was reported. Protesters dispersed when someone who identified themself as associated with the property manager of nearby businesses asked them to move their cars from the parking lot.

One protester, a woman from Holly Springs, said she’s an immigrant from Poland who was born there in the 1970s, during the communist regime. The woman said the Border Patrol actions reminded her of what life was like in her childhood.

Immigrant rights group Siembra NC said in a Friday news release that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had departed North Carolina, with a 47-vehicle convoy leaving Thursday morning.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Thursday statement that “’Operation Charlotte’s Web’ is not over and it is not ending anytime soon.” The Wake County Sheriff’s Office told The News & Observer it has not received any information from Border Patrol about the status of the operation.

Federal agents have made at least a dozen arrests in the Triangle since arriving Tuesday, Siembra NC said.

The N&O previously reported on agents seizing a 23-year-old Wendell woman in Cary — who a family member, said sought asylum in the U.S. after her father was killed by a gang in Honduras — and agents detaining a Latino man outside of a Home Depot on Walnut Street.

Prison teachers and medical staff are being forced to step in as corrections officers on a regular basis.
“I have never seen it like this in all my 25 years,” an officer in Texas told ProPublica.
“This is, from what I can remember, the biggest exodus of younger staff, staff who are not retirement-eligible,” she said.
While ICE agents and corrections officers continued bringing home paychecks, thousands of prison teachers, plumbers and nurses did not.","After years of struggling to find enough workers for some of the nation’s toughest lockups, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is facing a new challenge: Corrections officers are jumping ship for more lucrative jobs at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This is one of the unintended consequences of the Trump administration’s focus on mass deportations. For months, ICE has been on a recruiting blitz, offering $50,000 starting bonuses and tuition reimbursement at an agency that has long offered better pay than the federal prison system. For many corrections officers, it’s been an easy sell.

Workers at detention centers and maximum-security prisons from Florida to Minnesota to California counted off the number of co-workers who’d left for ICE or were in the process of doing so. Six at one lockup in Texas, eight at another. More than a dozen at one California facility, and over four dozen at a larger one. After retirements and other attrition, by the start of November the agency had lost at least 1,400 more staff this year than it had hired, according to internal prison data shared with ProPublica.

“We’re broken and we’re being poached by ICE,” one official with the prison workers union told ProPublica. “It’s unbelievable. People are leaving in droves.”

The exodus comes amid shortages of critical supplies, from food to personal hygiene items, and threatens to make the already grim conditions in federal prisons even worse. Fewer corrections officers means more lockdowns, less programming and fewer health care services for inmates, along with more risks to staff and more grueling hours of mandatory overtime. Prison teachers and medical staff are being forced to step in as corrections officers on a regular basis.

And at some facilities, staff said the agency had even stopped providing basic hygiene items for officers, such as paper towels, soap and toilet paper.

“I have never seen it like this in all my 25 years,” an officer in Texas told ProPublica. “You have to literally go around carrying your own roll of toilet paper. No paper towels, you have to bring your own stuff. No soap. I even ordered little sheets that you put in an envelope and it turns to soap because there wasn’t any soap.”

The prisons bureau did not answer a series of emailed questions. In a video posted Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Director Josh Smith said that the agency was “left in shambles by the previous administration” and would take years to repair. Staffing levels, he said, were “catastrophic,” which, along with crumbling infrastructure and corruption, had made the prisons less safe.

Smith said that he and Director William Marshall III had been empowered by the Trump administration to “confront these challenges head-on.” “Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of our mission to make the BOP great again, and we’re going to expose the truth and hold those responsible accountable.”

ICE, meanwhile, responded to a request for comment by forwarding a press release that failed to answer specific questions but noted that the agency had made more than 18,000 total tentative job offers as of mid-September.

The BOP has long faced challenges, from sex abuse scandals and contraband problems to crumbling infrastructure and poor medical care. It has repeatedly been deemed the worst federal workplace by one analysis of annual employee surveys, and in 2023 union officials said that some 40% of corrections officer jobs sat vacant.

That dearth of officers helped land the prison system on a government list of high-risk agencies with serious vulnerabilities and attracted the eye of oversight officials, who blamed chronic understaffing for contributing to at least 30 prisoner deaths.

The bureau tried tackling the problem with a long-term hiring push that included signing bonuses, retention pay and a fast-tracked hiring process. By the start of the year, that effort seemed to be working.

Kathleen Toomey, then the bureau’s associate deputy director, told members of Congress in February that the agency had just enjoyed its most successful hiring spree in a decade, increasing its ranks by more than 1,200 in 2024.

“Higher staffing levels make institutions safer,” she told a House appropriations subcommittee.

But the costly efforts to reel in more staff strained a stagnant budget that was already stretched thin. Toomey told Congress the bureau had not seen a funding increase since 2023, even as it absorbed millions in pay raises and retention incentives. As inflation and personnel costs rose, the bureau was forced to cut its operating budgets by 20%, Toomey said.

And despite some improvement, the staffing problems persisted. In her February testimony, Toomey acknowledged there were still at least 4,000 vacant positions, leaving the agency with so few officers that prison teachers, nurses and electricians were regularly being ordered to abandon their normal duties and fill in as corrections officers.

Then ICE rolled out its recruiting drive.

“At first it seemed like it was going to be no big deal, and then over the last week or so we already lost five, and then we have another 10 to 15 in various stages of waiting for a start date,” an employee at one low-security facility told ProPublica in October. “For us that’s almost 20% of our custody staff.”

He, like most of the prison workers and union officials who spoke to ProPublica, asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — a concern that has grown since the agency canceled the union’s contract in September following an executive order. Now union leaders say they’ve been warned that without their union protections, they could be punished for speaking to the media.

After the contract’s cancellation, many of the current staff who had originally spoken on the record asked to have their names withheld. Those who still agreed to be identified asked ProPublica to note that their interviews took place before the agency revoked the union agreement.

Earlier this year, Brandy Moore White, national president of the prison workers union, said it’s not unprecedented to see a string of prison staffers leaving the agency, often in response to changes that significantly impact their working conditions. Prior government shutdowns, changes in leadership and the pandemic all drove away workers — but usually, she said, people leaving the agency en masse tended to be near the end of their careers. Now, that’s not the case.

“This is, from what I can remember, the biggest exodus of younger staff, staff who are not retirement-eligible,” she said. “And that’s super concerning to me.”

ICE’s expansion has even thrown a wrench into BOP’s usual training program for rookies. Normally, new officers have to take a three-week Introduction to Correctional Techniques course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Georgia within their first 60 days on the job, according to the prisons bureau’s website. In August, FLETC announced that it would focus only on “surge-related training,” pausing programs for other law enforcement agencies until at least early 2026, according to an internal email obtained by ProPublica. Afterward, FLETC said in a press release that it was “exploring temporary solutions” to “meet the needs of all partner agencies,” though it’s not clear whether any of those solutions have since been implemented. The centers did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

At the same time, the effects of the budget crunch were starting to show. In recent months, more than 40 staff and prisoners at facilities across the country have reported cutbacks even more severe than the usual prison scarcities.

In September, Moore White told ProPublica some prisons had fallen behind on utility and trash bills. At one point, she said, the prison complex in Oakdale, Louisiana, was days away from running out of food for inmates before the union — worried that hungry prisoners would be more apt to riot — intervened, nudging agency higher-ups to address the problem, an account confirmed by two other prison workers. (Officials at the prison complex declined to comment.) Elsewhere, staff and prisoners reported shortages — no eggs in a California facility and no beef in a Texas lockup where staff said they were doling out smaller portions at mealtimes.

Earlier this year, a defense lawyer complained that the Los Angeles detention center ran out of pens for prisoners in solitary confinement, where people without phone or e-messaging privileges rely on snail mail to contact the outside world. One of his clients was “rationing his ink to write letters to his family,” the attorney said. The center didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Personal hygiene supplies have been running low, too. Several prisoners said their facilities had become stingier than usual with toilet paper, and women incarcerated in Carswell in Texas reported a shortage of tampons. “I was told to use my socks,” one said. The facility did not answer questions from ProPublica about conditions there.

Fewer staff has meant in some cases that inmates have lost access to care. At the prison complex in Victorville, California, staff lodged written complaints accusing the warden of skimping on the number of officers assigned to inmate hospital visits in order to cut back on overtime. (The complex did not respond to a request for comment.) In some instances, the complaints alleged, that left so few officers at the hospital that ailing inmates missed the procedures that had landed them there in the first place.

Chyann Bratcher, a prisoner at Carswell, a medical lockup in Texas, said she missed an appointment for rectal surgery — something she’d been waiting on for two years — because there weren’t enough staff to take her there. She was able to have the procedure almost two months later, after another cancellation.

Staffers say several facilities have started scheduling recurring “blackout” days, when officers are banned from working overtime in an effort to save money. Instead, prison officials turn to a practice known as “augmentation,” where they direct teachers, plumbers and medical staff to fill in as corrections officers.

“That’s why I left,” said Tom Kamm, who retired in September from the federal prison in Pekin, Illinois, after 29 years with the bureau. “My job was to try to settle EEO complaints, so if somebody alleged discrimination against the agency it was my job to look into it and try to resolve it.”

When he found out earlier this year that he would soon be required to work two shifts per week as a corrections officer, he decided to retire instead.

“I hadn’t been an officer in a housing unit since like 2001 — it had been like 24 years,” he said. “I had really no clue how to do that anymore.”

Augmentation isn’t new, but staff and prisoners at some facilities say it’s being used more often than it once was. It also means fewer medical staff available to address inmates’ needs. “Today we had a Physical Therapist as a unit officer so all of his PT appointments would have been cancelled,” Brian Casper, an inmate at the federal medical prison in Missouri, wrote in an email earlier this year. “Yesterday one of the other units had the head of Radiology for the unit officer so there would have been one less person doing x-rays and CT scans.” The prison didn’t respond to emailed questions.

When the government shutdown hit in October, it only made the situation worse, exacerbating the shortages and increasing the allure of leaving the bureau. While ICE agents and corrections officers continued bringing home paychecks, thousands of prison teachers, plumbers and nurses did not.

The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the domestic policy megabill that Trump signed into law on July 4, could offer some financial support for the agency’s staffing woes, as it will route another $5 billion to the prisons bureau over four years — $3 billion of which is specifically earmarked to improve retention, hiring and training. Yet exactly what the effects of that cash infusion will look like remains to be seen: Though the funding bill passed more than four months ago, in November the bureau declined to answer questions about when it will receive the money or how it will be spent.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bop-ice-diptych.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-11-22 01:56:46.036768

By using human rights rhetoric to enforce an ideological framework, the US risks diluting universally accepted human rights standards and encouraging a fragmented global human rights regime.
Consequences for Global Human Rights Advocacy The Trump administration's new human rights policy represents a paradigm shift in international rights discourse.
By redefining human rights through a narrowly conservative lens, it threatens the universality that underpins human rights law and advocacy.","The Trump administration’s recent overhaul of the US State Department’s human rights policy represents a fundamental shift in how global human rights violations are identified and reported. Central to this redefined framework is the classification of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies as potential infringements on human rights. This marks a departure from the traditional universal human rights approach toward an ideology-driven narrative that places conservative domestic priorities at the heart of international human rights advocacy.

Redefining Human Rights Through Policy

The updated US human rights framework instructs diplomats worldwide to categorize certain policies—including DEI initiatives related to race, gender, and caste—as violations of fundamental human rights. This includes affirmative action programs and state subsidies for abortion, as well as gender-transition surgeries for minors and migration policies. The State Department’s deputy spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, emphasized that the administration aims to stop

“new harmful ideologies that have provided cover for human rights abuses.”

He affirmed,

“The Trump administration will not permit these human rights violations, including the mutilation of children, restrictions on free speech, and racially biased employment practices, to continue unchecked.”

This repositioning frames many DEI policies, traditionally viewed as rights-enhancing, as government overreach or ideologically motivated interventions that harm individual liberties. The administration advocates a perspective that rights are ""bestowed by God, not governments,"" reflecting a theological underpinning that informs its conception of human rights as natural, individual entitlements rather than group-based or social justice claims.

Ideology Over Universality

By associating DEI with human rights violations, the administration adopts an explicitly ideological stance that reshapes what constitutes a human rights abuse. This ideological weaponization prioritizes conservative values and reframes social justice mechanisms—such as anti-discrimination policies—as forms of state overreach or bias.

The focus shifts away from protecting marginalized groups specifically defined by identity categories, toward an emphasis on rights as inherent to the individual irrespective of group identities. A senior State Department official stated,

“We believe that every individual has these rights, no matter their group identity... It’s not because of their group identity, it’s because they have had a right taken away from them, whether it’s freedom of speech, freedom religion, you name the right, we are here to protect them and to hold governments accountable.”

This approach rejects prior human rights efforts aimed at combating systemic oppression based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or other social identities, recasting those efforts as biased or harmful ideologies.

Narrowing the Scope of Human Rights Reporting

The human rights report under the new guidelines significantly narrows its scope, omitting many longstanding human rights concerns such as corruption, persecution of vulnerable groups, and police abuses. Instead, the reports emphasize issues aligned with the administration’s ideological agenda, including opposing affirmative action, abortion access, and immigration policies it deems excessive.

This selective focus raises concerns about politicizing human rights reporting, undermining its impartiality and credibility. Critics argue such narrowing erodes global confidence in the US as a leader on human rights advocacy, as reports appear to serve domestic political agendas rather than a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of human rights conditions.

International Ramifications

Internationally, this reframing threatens to reshape diplomatic relations by pressuring countries with DEI policies to alter or abandon them to avoid being labeled human rights violators. The policy also casts European online hate speech legislation as restrictions on free speech, alleging such laws harm human rights. This stance risks alienating Western allies and emboldening authoritarian regimes that reject progressive social policies.

By using human rights rhetoric to enforce an ideological framework, the US risks diluting universally accepted human rights standards and encouraging a fragmented global human rights regime. The conflation of legitimate policy differences with human rights violations complicates international consensus-building and may undercut protections for historically marginalized groups.

Consequences for Global Human Rights Advocacy

The Trump administration's new human rights policy represents a paradigm shift in international rights discourse. By redefining human rights through a narrowly conservative lens, it threatens the universality that underpins human rights law and advocacy. The theological assertion that rights are “bestowed upon us by God” rather than recognized through governments signals a retreat from secular and pluralistic human rights frameworks.

This redefinition may have widespread ramifications for human rights defenders worldwide, shifting policy debates away from collective social justice toward prioritizing individual rights as conceptualized by specific ideological views. It could also embolden governments engaging in discrimination and repression to dismiss international criticism as biased interference based on ideological differences.

Balancing Policy and Rights

The administration argues that policies promoting DEI and abortion access, for example, should be scrutinized as they allegedly violate individual rights or impose harmful ideologies. While those protections have historically sought to address systemic inequalities, the new policy frames them as discriminatory against other groups or as ideological impositions.

This tension between competing understandings of human rights—between collective remedies for historic injustice versus individual, non-group-based freedoms—underscores the broader debates in human rights theory and practice that currently divide governments and civil society.",https://impactpolicies.org/admin/storage/photos/shares/2025/Trump’s%20Human%20Rights%20Report%20Weaponizes%20Ideology%20Against%20DEI%20Policies.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 10:59:24.005041

There has been significant political and community pushback since the immigration enforcement operation began. Now that it has wrapped up, Durbin says it was a waste of taxpayer dollars, while the Trump administration is defending every dollar spent.

President Donald Trump federalized 500 members of the Texas and Illinois National Guard to help with ""Operation Midway Blitz."" But a federal judge blocked their actual deployment, and they never played any role in the immigration crackdown that targeted Chicago and surrounding cities for two months.

Now, according to Durbin's office, the Army is reporting that 60-day deployment cost $19.4 million.

That breaks down to more than $323,000 per day for a mission that was grounded before it ever got underway.

""Ninety eight percent of that money was wasted, wasted, to create a reign of fear and terror in the Chicago community,"" Durbin said. ""How many people were actually detained and arrested? Six hundred: How many of that number, 600, were dangerous to the community? Sixteen people.""

Gov. JB Pritzker cited a study that shows the cost to Illinois is far greater.

""It has cost the state of Illinois, the economic situation of the state of Illinois, literally hundreds of millions of dollars, what the president has done,"" Pritzker said.

The assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary defended ""Operation Midway Blitz"" saying, ""The cost of American lives saved is uncalculatable. Our law enforcement is removing thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, child abusers from the country. Sanctuary politicians like Governor Pritzker are providing a safe haven for the world's criminal illegal aliens in Chicago on the taxpayer's dime.""

Pritzker and Durbin also defended six Democrats in Congress with military or intelligence experience who called on soldiers to refuse illegal orders.

Trump called them traitors who should be charged with seditious behavior, punishable by death.

""These are decent, honorable people. They have an absolute right to stand up and say to everyone, 'follow the law,'"" Pritzker said.

""And I'm afraid we've reached a point where we have to say to these soldiers, 'remember your oath to our country. It was an oath to our Constitution,'"" Durbin said.

Trump, who last week announced he was withdrawing his support of Greene, appeared to celebrate her resignation. “I think it’s great news for the country. It’s great,” he told an ABC News reporter.

When asked if Greene had informed him, Trump said: “Nah, it doesn’t matter, you know, but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.”

Greene had said last week she was the subject of “a hotbed of threats” after Trump withdrew his support for and endorsement of her.

Greene reiterated those threats in her statement, saying she had faced “never-ending personal attacks, death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me, that most people could never withstand even for a day”.

Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat, posted on social media: “I’m going to be honest … I didn’t see this coming but the threats that come with being on the opposite side of Trump ARE REAL!”

The move sent shockwaves through US politics. The Republican political strategist Shermichael Singleton called it “a big shocker”.

“Maybe she’s looking at future plans,” Singleton told CNN.

Greene may have an ally in Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, who worked with her to pass the bill to release the files related to the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein.

“MTG is likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate,” Khanna told NBC News. “Her stances on Epstein, on regulating AI, and anti-war are more in touch with MAGA voters than JD Vance.”

Some observers couldn’t help but point out the strange turn of events – a one-time Trump ally resigning hours after an Oval Office meeting in which Trump heaped praise on Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City whom he had called a “100% Communist Lunatic”.

“Trump glazed Mamdani so hard Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned from Congress,” Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic National Committee vice chair, wrote on X.

Shawn Harris, a Georgia Democrat running for Congress in Greene’s solidly Republican district, sought to rally supporters in response to the announcement.

“As you’ve likely heard, Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced her resignation effective January 5, 2026,” Harris said in a post on social media on Friday. “Get ready Georgia! Teachers, farmers, veterans, EVERYONE, I need your support.”

“The privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort.

Court documents released last month revealed an ICE request for nearly 1.3 million taxpayer records.","The IRS can no longer share taxpayer addresses with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a federal judge ruled Friday that that element of the data-sharing pact between the agencies is likely unlawful.

In a 94-page decision, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia found that the IRS’s agreement to provide ICE with requested taxpayer addresses violated the Administrative Procedure Act on how agencies propose and enact regulations.

The judge also ruled that IRS’s implementation of the policy was “arbitrary and capricious,” writing that the tax agency failed to adequately explain why it deviated from its previous policy of “strict confidentiality.”

The plaintiffs in the case — the Center for Taxpayer Rights, Main Street Alliance, the National Federation of Federal Employees and the Communications Workers of America — maintained from the start that the IRS’s disclosure of taxpayer data to ICE without their consent was a violation of privacy requirements in federal tax code.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly agreed with that assertion, writing in her opinion that the IRS’s “unlawful conduct” made it likely that the plaintiffs and their members would “suffer irreparable harm.” She pointed specifically to a “significant decline in interest and engagement” with the Center for Taxpayer Rights, whose pro-bono tax services have long been utilized by taxpaying immigrants.

Without those customers, the judge noted, the low-income tax clinic’s federal funding could be in jeopardy. The plaintiffs had argued that by sharing taxpayer data with ICE, immigrants were disincentivized to pay taxes, fearing harassment or deportation. The judge backed plaintiffs’ claim that immigrants “face an imminent risk that the confidential address information they have provided to the IRS will be impermissibly used by ICE for civil immigration enforcement.”

Regarding the broader data-sharing deal between the IRS and ICE, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said that plaintiffs’ APA claim “should not be dismissed,” but she couldn’t issue similar relief given that the APA “affords a meaningful and adequate basis for judicial review” of the data policy and there has been a “failure to state a claim.”

Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs and filed the emergency motion to halt the IRS’s data-sharing pact with ICE, applauded the ruling. Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the nonprofit legal services group, said in a statement that the case was all about “holding the administration accountable and protecting the privacy of millions of Americans.”

“This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration, and represents the first injunction against this unlawful data sharing,” Perryman said. “The privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort. Paying your taxes does not forfeit your right to privacy.”

The proposal would not apply to arrests made when a judge has signed a valid warrant. But it could apply to civil immigration arrests, though the proposed rule doesn’t explicitly name that occurrence.

The state supreme court sets the rules that govern Michigan's legal system.

Christine Sauvé is with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. She said her group has been getting an increasing number of calls from people worrying about the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, near courthouses.

“It can deter people from using the courts and accessing the court process that they need to preserve individual rights for well-being and again for public safety,” Sauvé said.

Other states, including Illinois and New York, have adopted similar measures.

A federal district judge recently upheld New York’s state law, which dates back to the first Trump administration. The federal government sued New York, claiming the state was unlawfully trying to restrict the federal government's wide power to enforce immigration law.

Sauvé noted ICE agents would still have ample other opportunities to arrest people if they’re no longer allowed to pursue civil arrests in court. She said it’s important people should feel safe to pursue their cases and have full access to the Michigan's justice system.

“Especially given how essential so many of the matters are that go before our state courts. And sometimes the benefits outweighs the potential risk of immigration enforcement,” Sauvé said.

The state is taking feedback on the proposal until December 22.

Tom Boyd is the Michigan state court administrator. He said that feedback will determine what happens next.

“Out-of-state signature collectors are reportedly employing illegal aliens in their efforts to undermine the will of the people’s elected representatives. We’ve launched an investigation into Advanced Micro Targeting,” Hanaway posted on X Thursday evening. “If anyone is creating an environment for exploitation and human trafficking to thrive, we will hold them accountable. We have referred this matter to ICE.”

Hanaway offered no evidence to support any of the allegations in her post, and did not immediately respond to Democracy Docket’s request for comment. Her office has not released documents or reports substanting her claim that the canvassing firm — Advanced Micro Targeting, which is legally contracted to gather signatures for the People Not Politicians (PNP) referendum — employs undocumented workers.

Hanaway’s posts echo key talking points from national Republican operatives attempting to derail direct democracy by casting ordinary petition circulators as nefarious outsiders. But her decision to add federal immigration enforcement — and the language of “human trafficking” — marks a dramatic and potentially dangerous turn.

Missouri Sen. Minority Leader Doug Beck (D) has already filed a misconduct complaint against Hanaway for a separate action — naming the entire Missouri General Assembly as plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit attempting to block the referendum, without legislative authorization.

Beck argues she violated ethical rules by misrepresenting her client and usurping the legislature’s power.

The timing is not subtle. PNP is in the final stretch of collecting signatures for a veto referendum that would suspend House Bill 1 — the mid-decade GOP redraw designed to lock in a 7–1 Republican congressional map — and put it before voters in 2026.

“Just the latest example of desperate politicians seeking to silence the voices of Missourians. It is outrageous and dangerous,” PNP director Richard von Glahn told Democracy Docket Friday. “We’re not backing down. We will defend First Amendment rights. We will qualify this referendum.”

The campaign has already pulled in more than 200,000 signatures, well above the required threshold, despite rolling GOP obstruction efforts.

Missouri Republicans have already employed a sprawling array of tactics to block the referendum. Secretary of State Denny Hoskins (R) threw out tens of thousands of signatures as “premature” and imposed a misleading ballot summary that is now the subject of a separate lawsuit.

Hanaway herself filed a federal lawsuit claiming Missouri voters cannot legally overturn congressional maps at all.

And a GOP-aligned out-of-state PAC has also been caught offering cash bonuses to poach canvassers and disrupt the referendum campaign. They have also been accused of launching a defamatory smear against the referendum canvassing firm.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

In response, Walz said in a social media post on X, ""It's not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.""

The president did not provide further details on the move.

TPS is a federal program that allows migrants from unstable countries to live and work legally in the U.S.

Somalia's TPS designation runs through March 17, 2026, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security. As of March 31, there are 705 Somali immigrants in the U.S. approved for TPS, according to Congress.gov. Minnesota also has the largest Somali population in the U.S., the Associated Press reports.

CBS News has reached out to DHS and Walz for comment.

The Trump administration has also moved to end TPS protections for Afghan, Venezuelan, Syrian and South Sudanese nationals. Those actions have faced significant legal challenges.

Republican Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who represents Cold Spring, said in a written statement that she's ""glad"" that Mr. Trump recognizes the ""seriousness of the fraud problem"" in the state.

""The unfortunate reality is that far too many individuals who were welcomed into this country have abused the trust and support that was extended to them, and Minnesota taxpayers have suffered billions of dollars in consequences as a result,"" Demuth said, without providing evidence.

Jaylani Hussein, president of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations decried the move Friday, saying in a statement that the group was ""deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to end the Somali TPS program in Minnesota, a legal lifeline for families who have built their lives here for decades.""

""This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric,"" Hussein said. ""We strongly urge President Trump to reverse this misguided decision.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/22/815f06fb-22cd-49c2-905a-55d86668ba0e/thumbnail/1200x630/59a515d9af11976567bb0b56f114e282/gettyimages-2247836355.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 00:56:28.114805

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released the following statement after a white powdery substance was discovered in envelopes sent to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the facility in Dallas, Texas where the September terror attack took place, as well as a bomb threat in August.

On Friday morning, an ICE officer at the Dallas facility opened an envelope addressed to “Dallas Field Office,” containing a white powdery substance. Out of precaution, a hazardous materials (hazmat) team was called to the facility. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) and Dallas Fire Department also responded. Following a shelter in place and inspection, the facility is returning to normal operations. A second envelope was also discovered at the ICE offices in Irving, Texas.

“On Friday morning, an ICE officer discovered a white powdery substance in an envelope addressed to the Dallas ICE facility. A second envelope with white powder was also found at the Irving ICE office. ICE staff called a hazmat team to investigate. There is no threat to the public and the matter is under investigation,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This incident comes after the deadly terrorist attack in September and a bomb threat in August at the Dallas facility. Our ICE officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults and an 8000% increase in death threats against them as they remove dangerous criminals from our communities. We call on politicians and activists to tone down their rhetoric before a law enforcement officer is killed.”

Every day, America’s brave ICE officers put their lives on the line to defend our homeland and keep Americans safe. In August, ICE responded to an incident at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City involving a white powder which was also found in ICE offices. Law enforcement has also seen an unprecedented surge in vehicle rammings against federal law enforcement.

Secretary Kristi Noem has been clear: Anyone who lays a hand on law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

His arguments came in response to a preliminary injunction handed down in August from San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria. Chhabria’s order temporarily blocked Medicaid data from being shared for immigration enforcement but said the injunction would be lifted 14 days after the agencies completed a “reasoned decisionmaking process.”

California’s legal team, however, countered that the agencies’ notices appeared inadequate. “My initial impression is they aren’t what the court ordered in terms of a reasoned decision-making practice,” California Deputy Attorney General Anna Rich said during the hearing held by videoconference.

Chhabria encouraged the federal government to delay resuming data sharing until “after the holidays, just to make everyone’s life easier.” Gerardi said he’d take the suggestion back to Trump administration officials for consideration.

The Trump administration has struggled to defend its seizures of government data to meet the president’s goals for mass deportations. A federal judge on Friday in a separate case temporarily barred the Internal Revenue Service from sharing tax information with immigration officials.

CMS has already shared Medicaid data from California and a handful of other blue states with ICE. The agencies have been prohibited from using the information for immigration enforcement since Chhabria’s August ruling.

HHS has insisted the transfer is “supported by lawful interagency data sharing” and is “focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse” of Medicaid benefits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and other Democratic attorneys general challenging the data transfer argue it’s an illegal move designed to foster “a culture of fear” that discourages undocumented immigrants from accessing health care.

The CMS notice is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 25. The existing preliminary injunction blocking information sharing will remain in place for 14 days after the formal publication.

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a once-loyal supporter of President Trump who has become a critic, said Friday that she is resigning from Congress in January.

Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over the Republican Party, particularly his most ardent base.
Such a special election would include party primaries and a general election to fill out the remainder of her term through January 2027.
When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and divisive style in Washington.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a once-loyal supporter of President Trump who has become a critic, said Friday that she is resigning from Congress in January.

Greene, in a more than 10-minute video posted online explaining her decision, said she didn’t want her congressional district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for,” she said.

Greene’s resignation followed a public fallout with Trump in recent months, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on files related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with foreign policy and healthcare.

Trump branded her a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he might endorse a primary challenger against her when she ran for reelection next year.

Greene said her last day would be Jan. 5.

The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night.

Greene was one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” politics, and she embraced some of his abrasive and divisive political style.

Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over the Republican Party, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump.

The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, “My life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.”

A crack in the MAGA movement

Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago.

In her video Friday, she underscored her longtime loyalty to Trump except on a few issues, and said it was “unfair and wrong” that he attacked her for disagreeing.

“Loyalty should be a two-way street, and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district’s interest, because our job title is literally ‘representative,’ ” she said.

Greene swept to office at the forefront of Trump’s MAGA movement and swiftly became a lightning rod on Capitol Hill for her often confrontational, beyond-mainstream views, including advocating conspiracy theories and other falsehoods. In her video Friday, she said she had “always been despised in Washington, D.C., and just never fit in.”

As she embraced QAnon conspiracies and appeared with white supremacists, Greene was opposed by party leaders but welcomed by Trump. He called her “a real WINNER!”

Yet over time she proved a deft legislator, having aligned herself with then-GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who would go on to become House speaker. She was a trusted voice on the right flank until McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) was ousted in 2023.

Though there has been an onslaught of lawmakers from both parties heading for the exits ahead of next fall’s midterm elections, as the House struggles through an often chaotic session, Greene’s announced retirement will ripple throughout the ranks — and raise questions about her next moves.

Greene was first elected to the House in 2020. She initially planned to run in a competitive district in northern Atlanta’s suburbs, but relocated to the much more conservative 14th District in Georgia’s northwestern corner.

The opening in her seat means Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will have to set a special election date within 10 days of Greene’s resignation. Such a special election would include party primaries and a general election to fill out the remainder of her term through January 2027. Those elections could take place before the party primaries in May for the next two-year term.

Conspiracy theory-minded

Even before her election, Greene showed a penchant for harsh rhetoric and conspiracy theories, suggesting a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mused that a “so-called” plane had hit the Pentagon.

Greene argued in 2019 that Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), both Muslim women, weren’t “official” members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.

She was once a QAnon advocate, aligning herself with an online network that believes a global cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got “sucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.”

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she drew backlash and apologized for comparing the wearing of safety masks to the horrors of the Holocaust.

She also drew ridicule and condemnation after a conspiracy theory she speculated about on Facebook in 2018, in which she suggested a California wildfire may have been caused by “lasers or blue beams of light” controlled by a left-wing cabal tied to a prominent Jewish family.

When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and divisive style in Washington.

As then-President Biden delivered his State of the Union address in 2022, Greene stood up and began chanting, “Build the wall,” referring to the U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump began in his first term.

Last year, when Biden gave his last State of the Union address, Greene again drew attention as she confronted him over border security and the killing of a nursing student from Georgia, Laken Riley, by an immigrant in the country illegally.

Greene, wearing a red MAGA hat and a T-shirt about Riley, handed the president a button that said, “Say Her Name.” The congresswoman then shouted that at the president midway through his speech.

But this year, her first serving with Trump in the White House, cracks began to appear slowly in her steadfast support — before it broke wide open.

Greene’s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who expressed concerns she couldn’t win.

Greene’s restlessness only intensified in July, when she announced she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor, either.

She was also frustrated with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, which worked in lockstep with the president.

Greene said in her video that “the legislature has been mostly sidelined” since Republicans took unified control of Washington in January and her bills “just sit collecting dust.”

Messages left with House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) office were not immediately returned.

“That’s how it is for most members of Congress’ bills,” she said. “The speaker never brings them to the floor for a vote.”

Republicans will probably lose the midterm elections next year, Greene said, and then she’d “be expected to defend the president against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me.”

“It’s all so absurd and completely unserious,” she said. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b2358b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2662x1398+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F72%2F3d6a8a4b4ce6a2ac0511794103f0%2F203f5b6436a642c797ea8bf36d5ab510.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 22:56:26.224081

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump 's birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump's appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration's emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump's order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution's 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges' use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump's order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration's ""arguments are so flimsy,"" ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. ""But if the court decides to hear the case, we're more than ready to take Trump on and win.""

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be39b81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F96%2Fd7458e5e45a88d8ddedc195b01ab%2Fimmigration-birthright-citizenship-25325081999485.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 02:56:46.147857

Duffy announced the possible withholding of funds on Thursday, alleging that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had found multiple instances of Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation issuing licenses with expiration dates beyond an immigrant’s authorized stay in the U.S. or failing to secure “proof of lawful presence” before issuing licenses.

“Under President Trump, this Department is taking every measure to ensure dangerous foreign drivers aren’t illegally operating 40-ton vehicles on American roads,” Duffy said in a Transportation Department (DOT) press release.

“Joe Biden allowed tens of millions of illegals to pour into our country through open borders, including a suspected terrorist who Pennsylvania then allowed to get behind the wheel of a semitruck,” he said. “I will continue to fight to get these dangerous drivers off our roads to protect American families and support our national security.”

A survey of 691 health care workers across 30 states who work with immigrant populations, conducted from March to August 2025, spotlights the preventable health impacts for both immigrant and U.S. citizen patients.

The survey finds:

84 percent of surveyed health care workers report significant or moderate decreases in patient visits since January 2025 executive orders on immigration.

26 percent of clinicians report that immigration enforcement has directly affected patient care.

Seven percent reported Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) presence inside of their health care facilities.

Providers report that services affected include preventive services (43 percent), chronic disease management (36 percent), and mental health care (28 percent).

Cited patient concerns affecting health access included fear of deportation (49 percent) and family separation (39 percent).

27 percent of surveyed health care workers identified fear of benefit enrollment or renewal as a primary barrier preventing patients from accessing care or maintaining coverage.

While the broad and chilling disruption to health care access affects immigrant populations of all ages, health care workers consistently report that children – including U.S. citizens – face particularly acute health impacts.

“We are witnessing the creation of a generation with preventable trauma, delayed diagnoses, foregone treatments, and compromised development,” said Katherine Peeler, MD, pediatrician and PHR’s medical advisor. “What we are documenting is systemic, orchestrated harm to immigrants, and therefore their children – harm that is entirely preventable. Parents are making impossible choices: declining surgery for their children, delaying emergency care, and refusing specialty referrals because they have calculated that the risks of deportation or family separation exceed the medical necessity.”

“Our clinical network is sounding the alarm: fear is keeping migrant and immigrant children from critical care to stay safe and healthy,” said Laszlo Madaras, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer for Migrant Clinicians Network. “Health care is a human right. When fear blocks care for some, it harms all of us.”

Survey responses also reveal five ways how children’s access to health care is being impeded by Trump administration immigration enforcement actions:

1. Children forced to navigate health care alone due to deportation fears

Surveyed health care providers report parents are deliberately avoiding hospital settings out of fear of detention.

One Illinois physician reported: “Some children presenting without their parents to the emergency department.” Another physician from Illinois noted: “Children coming to ED by themselves as parents await outside.”

This practice creates cascading problems, as medical histories cannot be obtained from those most familiar with the child’s health, informed consent becomes impossible, children may become distrustful of the medical system if they do not understand the care they are receiving, and follow-up care coordination collapses.

2. Children’s trauma from parents’ detention and threat of family separation

Health care providers report that children as young as six years old are presenting with anxiety, with fear of family separation identified as the primary stressor. One Oregon community health worker observed: “We have minors constantly crying during their well-child checks expressing their fear for themselves and their families.”

A Massachusetts physician described: “Parents of our pediatric patients [have been] detained by ICE, which has led to a great deal of emotional distress in the remaining adult and their children.”

Surveyed health care providers attribute this psychological distress directly to immigration enforcement policies and their chilling effects.

3. Reduced use of outdoor spaces due to fear raises physical health concerns

Providers report observing a concerning pattern: children with restricted physical activity, social isolation, and abnormal weight gain trajectories. The outdoor play essential for healthy child development is being reduced by parents who perceive it as too risky due to the threat of immigration enforcement.

One physician in Massachusetts described: “I have pediatric patients that are flagging in the obese range for weight and when we talk about playing in parks and getting other forms of exercise the parents note that they are not leaving their apartments for fear of encountering ICE. Their children suffer the double trauma of fear of family separation and immigration enforcement as well as lacking a safe place to play and exercise and other healthy outlets for children.”

4. Delayed diagnoses and late-stage disease presentations among children

Health care providers in the survey report children presenting at later disease stages with preventable complications and delayed diagnoses.

Parents are making what providers describe as impossible choices: seeking care only when legally mandated (such as for school enrollment forms) or only when illness severity becomes life-threatening. Routine immunizations, developmental screenings, and preventive interventions are being sacrificed to this risk calculation.

A California physician reported: “I have had multiple parents decline visits with specialists, including delaying surgery, because of the fear of immigration enforcement in the destination city or on the way there.”

5. The safety net as a trap — new threats of surveillance

The pediatric safety net, including Medicaid coverage and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment, is increasingly being avoided because it is perceived as a trap rather than protection, even when U.S. citizen children are eligible for public benefits. Some parents are making the calculated decision that the risk of engaging with these systems outweighs the benefits of coverage.

One community health worker in North Carolina expressed: “We are increasingly alarmed that the children of immigrants may soon lose access to vital programs like SNAP and Medicaid, not because they are ineligible, but because their parents are being targeted and surveilled when attempting to complete these applications on their behalf.”

Many families are actively avoiding benefit renewal. One Oregon community health worker reported: “Families are scared to renew their Medicaid.”

These harms extend beyond mixed-status families. U.S. citizen children are losing health care coverage due to parents’ fear of deportation and surveillance. As one North Carolina community health worker said: “Patients and families are experiencing increasingly severe persecution which is exacerbating or contributing to all of their health problems and making management of chronic conditions and prevention of disease extremely difficult. This actually affects the citizens and non-citizens, negatively impacting the health of the whole community.”

“In light of these mounting health harms, the Trump administration should end actions that directly or indirectly curtail access to critical health care services for children and families,” said Dr. Peeler of PHR. “This includes codifying the ‘Sensitive Locations’ policy and ceasing all immigration enforcement at health care facilities. The administration should also end ICE data-sharing with Medicaid and align broader U.S. immigration policies and practices with international human rights standards.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northcentralpa.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/46/246ae269-467e-42e9-9a8d-89bdd5a73dd8/691df103be6f3.image.png?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C27,N,,2025-11-21 20:57:23.257415

He’s streaming a session to his 4.6 million subscribers of GTA 5 RP, a Grand Theft Auto 5 mod that allows people to role-play with other players. “Really wanna show you guys some real-life scenarios,” he says, offering a little background on his character, a man headed to his job while on a work visa.

His character doesn’t get far before an SUV swings onto the sidewalk in front of him; masked ICE agents spill out of the vehicle. “Stop right there,” one of the uniformed players says. It isn’t long before SteveTheGamer55 is surrounded by agents. He hands over his ID while bystander players yell at the agents and demand his release. “Why are you harassing people?” one says, before the worker is finally let go. Later in SteveTheGamer55’s play session, he stands in front of a large iron gate reminiscent of those in ICE detention centers seen in cities like Chicago. More in-game ICE agents have gathered. He records from his phone. Just in front of him, a player in a red suit demands to see a warrant for his client.

The “special event” held on November 20, where players took on different roles that reflect real-life ICE raids, was the first initiative by New Save Collective, a baker’s dozen of gamers with backgrounds in activism and organizing, whose goal is to educate gamers and teach people about their rights when dealing with ICE in real-world situations. On November 21, at 7:30 pm ET, gamers will gather in Epic’s massively popular battle royale, Fortnite, to hold a closed scavenger hunt that will serve as a more casual educational opportunity. The group is working with several immigration advocacy groups, as well as collaborating with content creators, to spread their message online.

Online gaming spaces have long appealed to the right as a place to push conservative or even extremist ideologies. The US military has been open about its attempts to use games as a recruitment tool, and immigration authorities are no different. In October, the Department of Homeland Security posted an image aping marketing for the Halo series. “Finishing this fight,” the agency’s official account tweeted—a reference to Halo 3’s tagline—alongside an image with the text “Destroy the Flood” slapped over a blurry depiction of the game’s supersoldiers; the Flood are Halo’s alien antagonists. DHS has also riffed off of Pokémon’s “gotta catch ’em all” tagline, going as far as to post a video of ICE agents destroying property and arresting people, interspersed with the show’s opening.

A spokesperson previously told The Hill that the DHS “will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, The Lord of The Rings, or any other medium.” But where movements like Gamergate peddled in harassment, hatred, and exclusion, New Save Collective’s goal is to foster a community that is kind, authentic, and oriented towards doing good.

“Most of us are immigrants, or children of immigrants, or children of refugees,” says one organizer who goes by PitaBreadFace online. (The organizer requested WIRED not use his name out of safety concerns.) “We're here at this stage in the political climate to cultivate some belonging, but also move people towards a shared purpose that everyone seems pretty hungry for.”

PitaBreadFace says that he started digital organizing in gaming spaces in an effort to bring people together through their shared love of video games. “The right has built some pretty strong institutions within gaming that have co-opted and weaponized the social features of gaming for bad,” he says, pointing to Gamergate. “The actual demographic and culture of gaming is changing, but we haven't built as many institutions as the right or those toxic forces.”

Games that serve as platforms are becoming popular places for kids and adults alike to gather in protest. On Roblox, players have held both pro-Palestine rallies and anti-ICE demonstrations. For New Save Collective, games like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto offer a similarly useful place to carry out their events. “Some of the folks who play GTA role-play are [police] officers in real life or are lawyers in real life,” says Anosh Polticoal, who also requested to only be referred to by screen name for safety.

“For a [gaming] stream that's educating the public in a world where many people may not have seen an interaction with ICE yet, it’s a way to get folks to know or get used to what that might look like,” the organizer says. “What their rights are as bystanders, as citizens, as noncitizens, as folks who are documented, undocumented. It felt like a really great way to see all that play out for an audience.”

Friday’s Fortnite event offers a chance for gamers across multiple platforms to learn about community building and how to speak up about xenophobia online. In order to play through the scavenger hunt, players will first have to be onboarded to the server; organizers say they’ve already dealt with people claiming to be ICE agents spreading misinformation and pro-ICE propaganda in their online communities.

Games like Halo or first-person shooters already have built-in messaging around “protect the homeland,” Anosh Polticoal says. “I think [ICE] have seen that as an opportunity to reach an audience that is already engaged in what they may feel is similar work. We want to make sure that our message is showing up in those same places—maybe you are not an immigrant, but someone in your life, in your community definitely is.”

New Save Collective is working with another organization, Define American, which focuses on shifting the portrayal of immigrants in media. Shauna Siggelkow, vice president of programs for the group, says the focus on games is part of that effort. “In order for politics to change around immigration, we first need to change the public discourse,” Siggelkow says. “Not just immigrants, but citizens, whatever your status is—it's really important that we all understand our rights and practice those rights when we're confronted by ICE.”

New Save Collective plans to continue holding future events and organizing gamers. The fight for these communities online is far from over. “Gaming wasn't kind of a random genre that we chose,” says Siggelkow. “We've been tracking anti-immigrant myths and disinformation digitally for years. We really grounded this campaign in a lot of data and research. This really is a space that is critical for immigration narrative.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/6920a060c597ca958cb5bdaf/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Fortnite-Players-Fighting-Ice-Culture-shutterstock_1444806506.jpg",N,,2025-11-21 20:57:39.896332

Joining a host of other states, the Michigan Supreme Court released a draft rule prohibiting ""the civil arrest of a person while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse,"" which would likely bar most Immigration and Customs Enforcement detentions.

The proposal issued Wednesday was supported by all Michigan Supreme Court justices except Justice Brian K. Zahra, who would not have published the matter for public comments, the order said. Comments on the proposal are due by Dec. 22, the court said, noting that this is a shorter than normal period.

If passed, the rule would be one of several measures cropping up around the country to prevent courthouse arrests, including the 2020 Protect Our Courts Act, signed by New York's governor to effectively bar most civil arrests at state courthouses. The constitutionality of the New York act was put to the test this week when a federal judge rejected the U.S. Department of Justice's preemption claims.

In 2020, California and Colorado made it illegal to arrest people for civil matters in their courts and the Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court in Chicago put forth a general administrative order in October reiterating the common law privilege against civil arrest while attending court.

Illinois legislators are waiting for another bill, HB13, aimed at preventing civil arrests at a number of locations including courthouses to be signed by the state's Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

Dan Schneider, who is of counsel at Legal Action Chicago and worked on the courthouse aspects of the proposed Illinois law, said that all of this legislative action came about because ""there absolutely have been an increase in immigration agents picking people up when they are going to and from court proceedings.""

""The federal government shows how this kind of extreme conduct can get in the way of courts doing what they are doing,"" he said, adding that the protection against being arrested for civil matters when showing up in court ""goes back hundreds of years.""

He said the right comes from the time of English common law courts, but recently, the right is not being respected, explaining states' moves toward codification.

Some state rules against arrest go farther than others.

In Connecticut, a state court policy issued in September prevents law enforcement from obscuring their faces inside courthouses and stated ""no person shall be subject to arrest while inside the public areas of a courthouse except pursuant to a judicial warrant or order issued or signed by a judicial officer.""

The legislation Schneider is backing would extend the area where arrests are prohibited to within 1,000 feet of courthouses, he said.

Schneider acknowledged that this wouldn't uniformly prevent all civil arrests, including immigration actions, but said preventing all arrests wasn't really the point.

""The point of this is to make sure whatever needs to happen happens after court proceedings are done,"" he said.

Schneider said those who oppose protecting against civil arrests in court may believe that the government should be able to ""do whatever they want to wherever they want"" to enforce the law.

""Whether you have a witness going to a murder trial or a domestic violence victim — they just don't care,"" he said.

Another set of detractors have concerns that preventing civil arrests through legislation that is written too broadly could put local law enforcement at risk if they, for example, arrest someone for a civil matter not knowing they are on the way to court, Schnieder said.

He discounted this as a possibility, saying that under his state's proposed legislation, only knowing violations were illegal.

The U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Michigan justice who opposed his state high court's proposed rule did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Immigration attorney Carl Hurvich of the Brooks Law Firm often deals with clients involved in criminal matters and said ""there is certainly a valid interest in state courts in allowing people to attend court proceedings without fear of being arrested.""

He said this was particularly important when some undocumented people appearing in court may be ""witnesses that the state thinks are in the public interest.""

Hurvich said that in Rhode Island, where he practices, there has been a recent push to promote virtual hearings to prevent ICE arrests and allow for state court participation without fear. However, he said he has also heard stories of clients being arrested at their lawyers' offices at the time virtual hearings are scheduled.

One of his clients was detained when showing up at court to pay a driving-related fine and state protections against civil arrest might help people in her position, but Hurvich noted there are plenty of public areas where ICE may continue to detain people.

However, he said ICE often preferred to detain people in courthouses because metal detectors prevent weapons and individuals cannot easily run away.

Hurvich said the overall impact of state legislation or court rules against civil arrest on the number of people detained by the government ""given their current policy and very large budget is somewhat limited,"" but he still supported state court efforts to push back against federal interference.

Their crime? Recording a video that reminded members of the military that they are not supposed to obey illegal orders.

“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Mr. Trump wrote in one post. He shared a different post, written by another person, that said: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”

The video that enraged the president had been put out online two days ago by six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom had served in either the military or intelligence community themselves.

One was Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut. “Our laws are clear,” he said in the video. “You can refuse illegal orders.”

Another participant was Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, who also served in the Navy. “You must refuse illegal orders,” he said in the video.

The Democratic lawmakers’ message did not focus on a specific order or scenario, but Trump administration officials have said the lawmakers were encouraging the military to rebel against its commander in chief. As a standard part of their training, members of the military are told that they should refuse to carry out illegal orders. At a briefing for reporters, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said “no” when asked if the president wants to execute members of Congress.

She added: “If this were Republican members of Congress who were encouraging members of the military and members of our United States government to defy orders from the president and from the chain of command, this entire room would be up in arms. But instead it is the other way around, and I think that’s quite telling.”

The video was organized by Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former C.I.A. analyst who served in Iraq.

Mr. Trump has flexed his power over the military during his second term and his attempts to politicize the armed forces have become more overt. He gave a nakedly political address to military leaders and has sent troops into cities around the country. All of which surely contributed to why the Democrats made their video.

And Ms. Slotkin told The New York Times earlier this week that she’d been hearing from active-duty troops concerned about the legality of strikes that targeted people accused of drug-smuggling by the Trump administration.

Mr. Trump’s series of posts about the video on Thursday accused Ms. Slotkin and her fellow Democrats of traitorous conduct. One of his posts carried his signature sign-off which usually indicates he was the actual author of the post as opposed to an aide. It read: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.”

Mr. Trump’s posts appeared at a moment when he is beset by challenges on many sides. His administration is aflame over the Jeffrey Epstein saga; he is contending with a revolt from some of the most loyal members of his party and portions of his political base; and his poll numbers have dipped considerably.

His posts instantly triggered an uproar in Washington.

The six Democrats who produced the video put out a joint statement which read, in part: “What’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.”

Asked about the president’s post that the Democratic lawmakers had committed a crime punishable by death, the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, said: “I don’t agree with that.”

Mr. Thune also criticized the Democrats who made the video. “Obviously everybody has a First Amendment right,” he said. “What they did was ill advised,” he added, “unnecessary” and “provocative.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, condemned the president’s threats from the floor of the Senate and called on members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

“Let’s be crystal clear, the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials,” Mr. Schumer said. “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”

He added: “Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior.”

Mr. Trump’s posts about imprisonment and death by hanging were difficult to square with his recent calls to lower the temperature of political rhetoric in this country. After the conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was murdered in September, Mr. Trump asked in an Oval Office address for “all Americans to commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died — the values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law and the patriotic devotion and love of God.”

Mr. Trump said then that it was “long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree.”

That spirit of free speech and the rule of law was hard to detect in president’s posts and messages he decided to repost Tuesday. He shared one that said, “Indict all of them.”

“Traitors,” said another.

The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro — whose home was firebombed on Passover this year — criticized the president on social media.

“He is actively encouraging political violence once again, ratcheting up the real risk of danger to our elected leaders and deepening the divides in our country,” Mr. Shapiro wrote. “The sycophants and enablers the President surrounds himself with are quick to condemn language like this when it suits their political purposes — but in moments like this, they remain silent.”

The Democrats’ video had already been the object of much indignation among conservatives before the president weighed in. The White House policy czar Stephen Miller had shared the video the day it was published, writing: “Democrat lawmakers are now openly calling for insurrection.”

SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Accountability Commission is continuing to ramp up even as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region winds down, at least for now.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday announced the appointment of two new commissioners and additional staff to the independent commission he created via executive order last month. It is tasked with producing a public record of alleged abuses perpetrated by federal agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” It will also examine the impact of such conduct on Illinois residents and communities and offer recommendations for accountability and reform.

Pritzker appointed attorney Jimmy Arce, a former federal prosecutor who was involved in the Justice Department’s civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department; and Ric Estrada, the CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, which is one the state’s largest human services organizations. Eight commissioners have now been appointed.

“Since I signed the executive order, with guidance from the commissioners, the Illinois Department of Human Rights has been diligently working to set the foundation for this truly ground-breaking work to bring accountability for the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” Pritzker said. “The appointments of Jimmy and Ric to the Commission round out this incredible team of public servants committed to demanding answers and the ongoing pursuit of justice for the people of Illinois.”

Staff Also Hired

The commission has also hired Hina Mahood, a former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Human Services who most recently was director of Illinois initiatives for the JB & MK Pritzker Family Foundation, as its executive director.

The commission has also hired two attorneys with plans to hire more support staff in the coming weeks, the governor’s office said.

Pritzker announced the commission’s formation at the height of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement blitz, which the Department of Homeland Security claims — as of last month — resulted in the arrests of more than 3,300 people.

But it also led to violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, often outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview but also during enforcement operations in Chicago neighborhoods. Agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, often used riot control weapons like tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.

While DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois that the operation is “ongoing,” there is evidence that it quickly wound down last week, with Bovino leaving Chicago for North Carolina and taking many of his agents with him.

And Trump administration lawyers told a federal judge earlier this week that only four detainees were being held in the Broadview facility, a stunning decline from testimony earlier this month of former detainees who described holding rooms stuffed with hundreds of people.

However, the reprieve may be short-lived. The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that as many as 1,000 agents could hit the streets in March — four times the amount in town over the past two months.

Commission Ramping Up

The commission will ramp up its operations during the expected lull period.

Commissioners and staff have started outreach efforts, explored community partnerships and are conducting a “landscape analysis” of information already in the public domain to examine the impact of related and ongoing litigation, according to the governor’s office.

But it’s still a work in progress. Pritzker notably encouraged people to document interactions with federal agents by taking videos with their phones. But on the commission’s website, there was still no method to submit such evidence directly to the commission as of Thursday afternoon. Instead, people are encouraged to contact a hotline operated by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, an outside group.

“The commission will provide updates to the public if there are other avenues to share information,” the website states.

Beyond that, the website lists information about the commissioners and executive staff, the language of the executive order that created it, links to news releases about it and links directing people to legal help and information about their rights when interacting with law enforcement.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials. But no information is yet available about when those will be held or how members of the public can participate.

The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31. A final report will be issued no later than April 30, 2026.

The commission’s website can be found at ilac.illinois.gov.

On Friday, they called for unity in standing up for relatives, neighbors and coworkers allegedly being “indiscriminately” targeted by federal immigration authorities. And they called on local governments to not participate in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, which they say is not their job.

“Border communities for many years experienced what we are seeing now in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and now, in North Carolina. Immigration authorities are basically harassing communities,” said Oscar Chacon, strategy adviser for Alianza Americas.

Chacon praised the response not just of advocates but also of community members in taking to the streets to demand accountability amid a surge of federal agents in cities led by minorities or with large minority populations.

“In Chicago, the life of Mexican and Latin American communities is being deeply disrupted by these actions,” he said at an online conference titled “The Border Becomes the Nation: Understanding the Spread of Militarization from the Border to U.S. Cities.” “It’s not so much if you’re an immigrant or foreigner, but whether federal authorities don’t think you belong here because of how you look.”

The Trump administration insists Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids as necessary to combat transnational criminal organizations and to uphold U.S. immigration law. Republican lawmakers including in Texas have said people who come into the United States illegally have committed a crime. Thousands of foreign nationals are prosecuted for immigration violations in U.S. federal courts and some get jail time.

But advocates say 70 percent of migrants detained by the Trump administration don’t have a criminal record and that some U.S. citizens have been detained for unknown reasons during raids of afterwards.

“They are going to places where they think they can get the numbers they need” in terms of apprehensions, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) of Los Angeles.

She said advocates in targeted cities have rapid response protocols in place to ensure the protection of civil rights and to identify who was taken and where. Others have declared “ICE Free Zones” in workplaces, schools and other sensitive locations.

Some are calling on employers to follow the law when it comes to hiring but not overreach by questioning validity of documents or venting suspicions about a person’s status.

“They want to create a nationwide registry, expand expedited removal and 287(g) agreements. Local governments don’t have to participate or put it in their budgets because it’s not under their jurisdiction,” said Herbert Meisner, integrated campaigns coordinator for Service Employees International Union, which has complained the immigration raids are disrupting workplaces nationwide.

Fernando Garcia, executive director of Border Network for Human Rights, said unity and resistance are best practices to ensure the protection of civil rights.

“El Paso historically has been a city that welcomes refugees and where communities are coming together,” he said. “It also a city with a historic resistance for decades.”

Garcia opined El Paso hasn’t seen the widespread immigration raids that Los Angeles and Chicago are witnessing because its faith-based, civil rights, business and political leadership are united in culture and purpose.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele calls himself the “world’s coolest dictator,” which may be an apt title given his social media savviness, backwards baseball caps, and concerted efforts to undermine democracy. While Bukele has enjoyed widespread popularity for his success in crushing El Salvador’s gangs, this has come at a high cost. Thousands of innocent Salvadorans have been imprisoned without due process as Salvadoran streets become ever more militarized. The “Bukele model” has been emulated by a number of Latin American leaders with authoritarian ambitions, which will likely complicate international efforts to isolate the Salvadoran government. Can Bukele continue to consolidate his personal power and popular support?

In “Does the Bukele Model Have a Future?” Beatriz Magaloni and Alberto Díaz-Cayeros argue that the Salvadoran state’s apparent strength sits atop an extremely fragile foundation: Bukele’s crime policy has successfully improved physical security for some while failing to deliver social and economic gains for El Salvador’s increasingly vulnerable citizenry. As the country’s economic situation worsens, Bukele’s support will decline, likely increasing his reliance on repression. The article is informed by original interview data, which illustrates how dire the situation for ordinary Salvadorans has become both inside and outside of the country’s notorious prisons.

The reader comes away somewhat optimistic that Bukele’s authoritarianism cannot remain popular indefinitely. And although El Salvador has largely evaded international pressure, this could change, for example, after the United States’ 2028 elections. At the same time, domestic efforts to push back against Bukele and his anti-democratic legacy will surely be difficult. The authors predict that Bukele will alternate between moments of popularity, episodes of repression, and external challenges.

The Bukele Model and Its Pitfalls:

Bukele is perhaps best known for his war on crime, which followed his unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with and make concessions to gang leaders. Although Bukele took office at a time when homicide rates had declined considerably, crime has sharply declined during his tenure. Yet El Salvador now enjoys the world’s highest incarceration rate by more than double the next highest country. Bukele has consolidated significant executive power, firing Supreme Court justices and pressuring his opponents via armed military and police incursions into the legislature.

The authors conducted interviews with formerly incarcerated Salvadoreans to better understand how the Bukele model has been experienced both inside and outside of prison. Interviewees report that ordinary people are incentivized to provide information (whether true or false) that leads to arrests because of the cash rewards offered. As the country’s economy worsens, these practices have led to a mushrooming of innocent arrests. Although international observers have tended to focus on human rights abuses in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, the conditions in more peripheral prisons are even more harrowing. As the authors report,

Upon entry, detainees are frequently subjected to a violent initiation ritual involving beatings by multiple prison guards…leav[ing] many prisoners with severe physical injuries…once confined…basic human needs such as rest, sanitation, breathable air, food, and water were denied. Some people…reported guards throwing tear gas into their cells and banging repeatedly on cell bars throughout the night…[they] described cells as so overcrowded that they were often forced to sleep in rotations: one half lying on the floors, with their neighbors’ feet pressed against their faces, while the remainder stood waiting for their turn.

A worrying consequence of Bukele’s rise is the diffusion and emulation of his “model” across the hemisphere. For example, Honduras and Ecuador have implemented states of emergency and deployed the military against domestic gangs, citing Bukele as inspiration. Javier Milei’s cabinet has used Bukele’s alleged success as a justification for undermining judicial autonomy in Argentina. Even Costa Rica — one of Latin America’s most stable democracies — built a CECOT-inspired prison and has witnessed growing support for strongman rule as it faces its highest homicide rates on record.

Possible Scenarios:

The authors identify three routes that might characterize El Salvador’s politics in the coming years, none of which are mutually exclusive. A first scenario would involve support for Bukele continuing or increasing. However, given El Salvador’s economic situation, this situation is very unlikely. In places like Singapore and Kuwait, autocrats have enjoyed steady popularity because they have been able to deliver economic prosperity. Yet Bukele lacks foreign investment and world-class infrastructure, as in Singapore, and it lacks the Gulf oil monies that have been showered on Kuwaiti citizens to buy their acquiescence.

A second scenario, which the authors see as more likely, is that Bukele’s popularity declines, leading him to default to more repression and authoritarianism. This parallels Venezuela under Nicholas Maduro, where the collapse of oil prices — which had previously boosted Hugo Chávez’s popularity — coincided with growing corruption and economic precarity. As the country experienced hyperinflation, Maduro clamped down on his opponents and the media while rigging elections.

There is a widespread perception of a strong link between immigrants and crime. It is common to hear those who oppose immigration argue that the first act illegal immigrants commit on U.S. soil is to break the law-that is, our immigration laws-and that they are ipso facto criminals who will continue to disregard U.S. laws once in the country. Those making this argument are generally steadfastly opposed to any immigration reform that will provide the 10 million to 12 million illegals already in the country any path to citizenship, on the grounds that such an ""amnesty"" would reward law-breaking.

The association of immigrants with crime is strengthened by the weekly barrage of news about drug and gang violence in Mexico as the government of Mexican President Felipe Calderón seeks to crack down on that country's powerful drug mafias. And long before the Mexican drug war, Americans were threatened by Colombian cartels, Salvadoran street gangs, and other criminal groups from Latin America. Moreover, it is perfectly true that the simple fact of being an illegal immigrant induces one to break further laws: One is reluctant to buy mandated auto insurance, pay taxes, or register businesses for fear of deportation.

There is indeed a huge problem of crime originating in Latin America and spilling into the United States. This is almost wholly driven by the enormous demand for drugs from the U.S. There are many things we can and should do to mitigate this problem, but it will persist as long as that demand remains high.

But the problem of gangs and drug violence should not be confounded with the behavior of the vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S., who by and large are seeking the same thing that every immigrant to America has wanted since the time of the Mayflower: to better their condition and that of their families. They are not criminals in the sense of people who make a living by breaking the law. They would be happy to live legally, but they come from societies in which legal rules were never quite extended to them. They are therefore better described as ""informal"" rather than ""illegal.""

Understanding this distinction requires knowing something about the social order in Latin America or, for that matter, in many other developing countries. These societies are often characterized by sharp class distinctions between a relatively small, well-educated elite and a much broader and poorer population.

The rule of law exists in places like Mexico, Colombia and El Salvador; the problem is that access to the legal system tends to be a privilege of the well-to-do. The vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S. come from poor rural areas, or shantytowns in large cities, where the state-in the form of courts, government agencies and the like-is often absent. Registering a small business, or seeking help from the police, or negotiating a contract requires money, time and political influence that the poor do not possess. In many Latin American countries, as much as 70%-80% of the population lives and works in the informal sector.

The lack of legal access does not make everyone in these regions criminals. It simply means that they get by as best they can through informal institutions they themselves create. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has written extensively about the lack of formal property rights, not just in his own country but throughout the developing world. The poor do not hold legal title to their homes, despite having lived in them for years, because of the insuperable barriers the system throws up to formal registration. So they squat in their homes, constantly insecure and unable to use their property as collateral.

The poor are entrepreneurial and form businesses like restaurants and bus companies, but they are unlicensed and don't conform to official safety rules. They and everyone else would be much better off if they could be brought into the formal legal system, but it is a dysfunctional political system that prevents that from happening.

What illegal immigrants to the U.S. have done is to recreate the informal system within our borders. The Americans who hire them are often complicit in this system by not providing benefits or helping them avoid taxes through cash payments. The gardeners and maids and busboys who participate in this game, along with their employers, are indeed breaking the law. But they are in a very different category from the tattooed Salvatrucha gang member who lives by extortion and drug-dealing.

A comprehensive immigration reform that provides hardworking illegal immigrants with an ultimate path to citizenship should not be regarded as rewarding criminal behavior. It should be seen as an effort to move people from a dangerous informal system to one characterized by a modern rule of law.

We need, of course, to control much better the total number of people coming into the country, which can ultimately be done only through stronger enforcement of employment rules. If we can better distinguish between illegal and informal in our political discourse, then we can begin to concentrate our resources on going after those in the immigrant population who are genuinely dangerous criminals.",https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/themes/custom/stanford_fsi/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-21 20:57:33.536714

The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant-rights group and liberal activists who are trying to resist the mass deportations that President Donald Trump has made a top priority for the first year of his second term.

The Trump administration can appeal the decision, and it has a decent track record this year of overturning lower-court losses. A separate federal judge in a related case previously declined to block the data-sharing deal between Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Court records indicate that the IRS has provided ICE with information about 47,000 potentially undocumented taxpayers so far as part of the controversial data-sharing deal, a fraction of what the Trump administration requested. The Department of Homeland Security has said it wants this information to find people who came to the US illegally and have already been ordered by a judge to leave the country.

The IRS rebuffed, and ultimately rejected, attempts to get information on millions of suspected undocumented immigrants with existing deportation orders. These disagreements created months of tension between IRS leadership and the White House, leading to the resignation and ouster of multiple IRS commissioners this year including Billy Long, a Trump loyalist.

CNN has reached out to the IRS and Treasury Department for comment.

District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in her 94-page ruling Friday that the data-sharing program was unlawful for several reasons, including because it violated legal requirements to keep sensitive taxpayer information private except for very strict exceptions, regardless of their immigration status.

“Plaintiffs have shown that the IRS’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law because it did not comply with certain requirements in (the) Internal Revenue Code,” wrote Kollar-Kotelly, a Bill Clinton appointee.

An order blocking the program was necessary because undocumented taxpayers were suffering irreparable harm, she said.

The judge rejected many of the Justice Department’s arguments for why the program was legal, concluding, among other things, that certain assertions were not credible. For instance, DOJ officials claimed that one single ICE agent was personally overseeing tens of thousands of investigations that might lead to criminal prosecutions and deportations.

“The Court finds it unlikely that a single individual could be ‘personally and directly engaged’ in approximately 47,000 criminal matters, let alone 1.28 million of them, as ICE represented to the IRS,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

This case was brought by the Center for Taxpayer Rights, a nonpartisan nonprofit that said the policy was hurting its clients at a low-income clinic, including undocumented immigrants. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year — for decades, they have been encouraged to register with the IRS and pay what they owe, with assurances that their private information would stay confidential except for extremely rare cases.

Other anti-Trump groups involved in the lawsuit praised the ruling.

“This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration… the privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort,” Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-02-20t180531z-963080443-rc2hycask8jh-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-irs.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-21 18:58:29.879696

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

California’s statute, Education Code Section 68130.5, treats non-state residents unfairly by allowing qualifying immigrants to receive in-state college tuition rates, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) claimed in its lawsuit. The law states that immigrants who are in the country illegally can’t pay out-of-state tuition rates if they meet educational requirements.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

“This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The California Community Colleges system, one of the case’s defendants, said in a statement that the law in question has been in place for many years and was implemented in accordance with long-standing legal guidance. The DOJ claimed that federal law contradicts the state’s statute, however. Section 1623 of U.S. Code's Title 8 states that an immigrant who is in the U.S. illegally is ineligible for in-state college benefits unless U.S. citizens are eligible for them.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens ... There are no exceptions,” the DOJ wrote in its complaint. “Yet California Education Code ... extends eligibility for in-state tuition benefits at state postsecondary educational institutions, including resident tuition, scholarships, and subsidized loans, to illegal aliens, while requiring U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.”

A spokesperson for Gov. Newsom, who, along with state Attorney General Rob Bonta and the University of California and California State University systems, is also a defendant, said that the DOJ has filed three “meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California.""

“Good luck, Trump. We’ll see you in court,” the spokesperson added.

An official in the governor’s office noted that California’s “approach” to tuition “applies to all residents, regardless of where they were born.” U.S. citizens and non-citizens receive the same tuition benefits if they meet the criteria, the official explained.

Woodburn joins Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Cornelius and Washington County in passing emergency ordinances in response to an increase in ICE activity in the state.","The Woodburn City Council declared a state of emergency Nov. 21 in response to the impact of increased U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the region.

The largest immigration operation in the state since President Donald Trump took office happened in Woodburn in October, when ICE arrested at least 35 people. Advocates estimated more than 80 people had been detained in Woodburn by the end of October.

The move by the city council comes after residents and local organizations called on city leaders to do more in response to the increase in ICE activity and after the Statesman Journal published a story detailing residents' fears and the impact on businesses.

""It’s outrageous that masked agents, many who are unidentified as agents, are sweeping people off our streets, leaving families, children and employers in fear and complete limbo,” Mayor Frank Lonergan said in a statement.

Residents and business owners described downtown Woodburn as a ""ghost town"" in the wake of the arrests. Officials estimated 50% to 80% fewer people were walking around the city's center.

An estimated 63% of the city's population is Hispanic, and 31% of the population was born outside the United States.

The city council voted Nov. 10 to suspend the use of Flock safety cameras for 60 days in response to concerns that the system could be used for ICE operations.

In its statement announcing the emergency declaration, the city said it heard from community members and partners about widespread fear and a ""measured decline"" in people going to work, attending school and willing to report crime.

""The current crisis also further strains local food banks and other nonprofit service providers,"" the statement said.

Reyna Lopez, executive director of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, the farmworker union based in Woodburn, said the declaration was a good step for the community, businesses and organizations. She described the past month as one of terror and trauma.

The resolution declares a local state of emergency ""due to the economic and humanitarian crisis"" and authorizes the Woodburn City Administrator to direct $30,000 toward mitigating the impacts of ICE actions.

It also requests emergency assistance from the state, including relief for affected families and small businesses, expanded access to food, housing, and mental health services, support for local providers responding to increased demand, and coordination with agencies to ensure compliance with the state's sanctuary laws.

The resolution also calls on Oregon's congressional delegation to publicly denounce ""all unconstitutional actions"" and demand immediate oversight and transparency from federal immigration enforcement agencies.

“I want people to understand that it’s not just undocumented farmworkers that are being impacted, but American citizens. Citizens who are afraid to do business and go to work out of fear of being targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin alone,” added City Councilor Mark Wilk. “Not only does racial profiling set our country back decades, it undermines the legitimacy of all law enforcement as well as our local economy. The erosion of civil liberties affects everyone.”

Woodburn City Council President Sharon Schaub said the impact breaks her heart.

""It is imperative that we treat people with dignity and respect and honor the civil rights of all people,"" Schaub said. ""We cannot overlook these core American values in our own community.”

Lopez said the community wants to see their local governments step up and do what they can to help mitigate harm.

""This is really going to provide people some peace of mind that their city government is listening, they're watching, and they're going to do something to support families in this difficult time,"" she said.

The California State University system is the nation's largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students.","The Trump administration has sued California for providing in-state college tuition, scholarships, and state-funded financial aid to students who aren't legally in the United States.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleges the practice harms U.S. citizens and encourages illegal immigration. Among the defendants are the state, top state officials, and the state's two public university systems, the University of California and California State.

President Donald Trump's administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California's.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren't in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don't violate federal law if they provide the same rates to U.S. citizens in the same circumstances — meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as U.S. citizens.

It is the latest action by Trump's administration since he issued executive orders in February directing federal agencies to stop public benefits from going to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and to challenge state and local policies seen as favoring those immigrants over some citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president's orders enforce federal immigration laws.

""California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,"" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. ""This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.""

The Justice Department also recently sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters, and over California's new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a statement: ""The DOJ has now filed three meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California in a single week. Good luck, Trump. We'll see you in court.""

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

""While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,"" it said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the California Supreme Court let stand a lower-court ruling that the University of California's policy barring students without legal status in the U.S. from campus jobs is discriminatory and must be reconsidered.

University system officials had warned that the decision would put them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

The UC is dealing with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1 billion fine over allegations including antisemitism and the illegal consideration of race in admitting students to its Los Angeles campus.

The California State University system is the nation's largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students. More than a quarter of undergraduates are first-generation college students, according to the university system.

Trump’s obsession with public charge is horribly consistent with his vision to remake the U.S. into a country where only the white and wealthy belong and can get ahead.” Read the full statement here.","After the longest government shutdown in United States history, many people have become aware of just how necessary public benefits like SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and others are to our communities. With the lowest hiring rates since 2009 and other economic pressures mounting, many of us are closer to relying on public benefits than we think. But this summer, Congress passed a law that will take away access to health care, SNAP, and other essential services for many people with specific immigration statuses. Now, a new action by the Trump administration goes one step further, scaring people out of trying to access programs they remain eligible for.

On November 19, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a proposed change in regulation that would alter the impact of “public charge.” This is a long-standing concept in the immigration system, but the Trump administration wants to ignore the system’s focus on family unification to favor wealthy and white immigrants. Here’s what the government is doing now. For someone who might apply for a green card in the future, this is especially applicable.

What is public charge?

Since the 19th century, immigration laws have included a restriction for people who would become primarily dependent on the government for day-to-day living. Historically, however, only people who have used or may need certain types of government assistance (such as cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, like in a medical facility) could be found ineligible for a visa or a green card, because they may become a “public charge.”

This is the way the “public charge” test has been narrowly defined and has not included the use of SNAP or other non-cash public benefits and social safety-net programs, or emergency support services.

What are the current public charge rules?

As the law stands now, people applying for green cards must have a clear understanding of which benefits do and do not apply to them. This can offer them clarity and peace of mind in getting the support they need to protect their families and thrive in their communities. With clear information, they can more confidently adjust their status to get a green card, knowing it will not jeopardize their ability to remain in the United States with their loved ones, the careers they’ve developed, the friendships they’ve made, and the neighborhoods they’ve contributed to.

Although the regulation was finalized in 2022, it follows decades of precedent that have survived various political headwinds, proving that it’s a clear interpretation of the law as written and it is effective at providing guidance for immigration officials.

What could change under the new proposed rule?

Right now, the Trump administration’s proposal is to get rid of the rule altogether, with no replacement, meaning there won’t be any clear guidance on what benefits will count toward public charge, and how they will be applied. If that proposal is finalized, immigration officers may be directed to “use their discretion,” a recipe for arbitrary and discriminatory application of the law.

It creates inconsistency and inequity while upending the long-settled definition of “public charge,” reaching beyond even the first Trump administration’s proposed changes in 2019, which were resoundingly rejected by the courts. As a result, people may avoid health care and nutrition services they are eligible for, which lays the groundwork for public health crises and skyrocketing public health costs, among other negative outcomes.

Why does this matter?

According to NILC president Kica Matos, this is “another attack designed to sow fear and confusion in immigrant communities. Trump’s obsession with public charge is horribly consistent with his vision to remake the U.S. into a country where only the white and wealthy belong and can get ahead.” Read the full statement here.

While those applying for a visa or green card will experience the most immediate effects, all Americans should be concerned about the vision of evaluating a person’s wealth to determine their value. Given the Trump administration’s drawn-out fight to keep SNAP benefits from those who qualify, it’s clear that the government’s focus is not on sustaining American livelihoods, but on leveraging poverty and assumptions about race, national origin, and economic status for political gain.

How can I comment on this change?

You have until December 19, 2025, to let the government know you oppose getting rid of the 2022 guidance. The government has to consider any comments it receives, but it does not have to make changes in response.

You can also share this information widely with your family, friends, and community members. Let them know about this proposed change, how it affects them and their loved ones, and what they can do to be proactive and assert their voice.

I was eight years old when I first learned the word “migrant”. It was August 2008, when the war between Russia and Georgia left thousands of people displaced, homeless and uncertain about the future. I remember asking my mother where our relatives had gone, and she gently said, “They migrated to rebuild their lives.”

At that time, migration seemed to me like a word connected with hardships, but as I grew older, life showed me a new meaning of that word – one defined by resilience, courage, and hope.

Years later, at the age of 19, I became a migrant myself. I moved from Georgia to Hungary after being awarded a scholarship to pursue my studies. It was one of the most exciting yet intimidating moments of my life. I still remember the silence of my first evenings – coming back to an empty room, speaking to my loved ones only through a phone screen. But I did not allow hardships to define my journey. Instead, I turned them into motivation. I learned the language, immersed myself in local traditions, and opened my mind to new perspectives.

Through my everyday interactions, I realized that migration was often misunderstood. I saw how easily stereotypes could shape perceptions and create distance. That understanding inspired me to become a bridge between cultures. I had the honour of serving as the Young Ambassador of Georgia to Hungary. It was a role that allowed me to connect Georgian and Hungarian youth, to share our cultures, and to show that migration can unite people rather than divide them. Many of those I met through this initiative were also migrants – students, dreamers, and professionals, each with a story of courage and perseverance.

Those experiences deepened my belief that migration, when managed with dignity and understanding, is one of humanity’s greatest strengths. It connects people, spreads ideas, and builds the foundation for a more inclusive and compassionate world.

That belief guided me toward the next chapter of my journey as I joined IOM. When the war in Ukraine broke out, I became part of the IOM Hungary team as a Senior Human Resources Associate. My work focuses on supporting both the Ukraine emergency response and inclusion and integration projects. Having experienced war during my own childhood, I felt a deep personal connection to the Ukrainian people forced to leave their homes. I understood, on a human level, what it means to lose a sense of normalcy overnight and what it takes to rebuild it.

At IOM, I have witnessed the true impact of well-governed migration. I have seen families find safety and dignity, children return to school, and individuals rediscover hope. Each success story reminds me why our mission matters. Every day, I am proud to contribute to this work, knowing that behind every document, every placement, and every decision, there are real lives being changed.

My journey has taught me that migration is not merely a movement of people – it’s a movement of potential. When managed responsibly, it drives development, innovation, and shared growth. Migrants are not defined by where they come from, but by the courage it takes to move forward. They bring skills, knowledge, and cultural richness that benefit both their countries of origin and destination. As someone who has lived both sides of this story – a migrant and a professional working for migrants – I see how much stronger societies become when diversity is embraced.

Today, when I reflect on my path, I see migration not as an act of leaving, but as an act of finding one’s place in the world while contributing to a greater good.

My story began with hearing about people who had to move to find safety. It continues with the privilege of helping others rebuild their lives with dignity and hope. Migration shaped who I am. It gave me empathy, resilience, and a purpose: to make sure that no one’s journey is defined by loss but by possibility. I strive every day to help build a world where every migrant is seen, supported, and celebrated.",https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl2616/files/styles/social_media/public/banner/tamuna-japharidze_.jpg?h=acc8b323&itok=NzZaHM03,N,,2025-11-21 18:58:15.688109

Further, the number of deaths this year exceeds every year on record since reporting began in 2018, including Fiscal Year 2020, when deaths spiked in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic” wrote the representatives.

They continued, “ICE appears to have repeatedly failed to comply with internal standards, and these failures have contributed to deaths in custody. For example, over the last decade, ICE has delayed or provided substandard medical care, neglected to provide proper medication, and falsified medical records. ICE has also failed to notify next of kin following the death of a detainee “timely, accurately, appropriately, and with sufficient detail” despite being required to by ICE Directive 11003.6 and PBNDS. ICE’s failure to adhere to basic standards of care for individuals in its custody is inexcusable.”

“These are not just numbers on a website, but real people—with families, jobs, and hopes and dreams—each of whom died in ICE custody.

For more than a decade, Rep. Chu has repeatedly visited and called for the closure of the Adelanto ICE facility in San Bernardino County because of its long, alarming record of abuse, medical neglect, and human rights violations that have led to preventable deaths.

Federal

DHS Proposes Reinstatement of Public Charge Rule

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has introduced a proposed rule that would reinstate and expand the “public charge” policy of the first Trump administration, rolling back protections from the 2022 Biden administration rule. If finalized, the measure would allow immigration officers to deny green cards and other legal status to applicants who have used, or may use, public benefits such as SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, housing assistance, and state-funded social programs, even for short periods or limited amounts. Advocacy organizations and health policy experts warn the proposal is intentionally vague, designed to create confusion and deter lawfully present immigrants from accessing critical health and nutrition programs they qualify for under federal law.

Unlike prior rules, the new DHS plan lacks clear guidance for adjudicators and instead grants officers wide discretion to deem applicants “likely” to become a public charge based on past or potential benefit use, as well as on the use of benefits by household members. DHS suggests that one of the benefits of the rule would be “a reduction in the number of aliens dependent on public benefit programs” and notes that it will result in reduced federal and state payments for individuals who no longer enroll in such programs, including U.S. citizens in mixed status households. Advocates highlight evidence that similar changes led to a dramatic chilling effect during the pandemic, with immigrant families, including U.S. citizen children, skipping medical care, nutrition assistance, or housing support out of fear for their immigration status.

The Trump administration is reportedly weighing new policy changes to deny green cards to immigrants from countries covered by the president’s June 2025 travel ban. The proposed guidance would treat nationality from a travel ban country as a “significant negative factor” in green card adjudications, further compounding the widespread visa and entry restrictions that have already impacted millions of people. The list of fully and partially banned countries currently includes Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Haiti, Myanmar, Chad, and others under either a total or partial visa suspension.

Past green card denials were largely based on admissibility grounds such as criminal history, health, or use of certain public benefits. Under the draft policy, consular officers and immigration officials could deny applicants solely for being from a travel ban country, even absent individual disqualifying factors. Immigrant rights groups have signaled plans to challenge any new restrictions in court. Advocates have raised particular alarm about the impact of the proposed green card restrictions on Afghans. Many of the tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated after the 2021 fall of Kabul are living in the United States under temporary humanitarian parole or other short-term protections, with no pathway to permanent residency. The administration’s new policy would potentially bar even those already present in the U.S. from securing lawful permanent residence, separating families, and undermining commitments made to American allies.

Border Patrol Operations Planned for New York City and New Orleans

Federal officials have announced plans for ramped-up immigration enforcement in New York City and New Orleans, with major operations slated to begin in December in response to what the administration calls “public safety threats” and sanctuary city policies. According to Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, enforcement teams are already active in New York and additional agents are preparing to conduct widespread raids at courthouses, transit hubs, and immigrant neighborhoods. In New Orleans, up to 250 Border Patrol agents are expected to deploy for a two-month campaign, while local advocates and officials brace for a sharp increase in arrests targeting individuals with prior removal orders, asylum lapses, and minor immigration violations.

Meanwhile, Charlotte, North Carolina has experienced days of uncertainty and disruption stemming from the “Charlotte’s Web” enforcement operation led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. Local authorities initially declared the operation over, but the Department of Homeland Security quickly contradicted those statements, asserting the crackdown is “not ending anytime soon” and confirming that immigration enforcement remains active in Charlotte and Raleigh. Over five days, federal actions resulted in more than 370 arrests and citywide impacts, with businesses shuttered, construction sites left empty, and nearly 30,000 students absent from local schools.

Survey Shows Decline in New International Student Enrollment

New survey data show that U.S. colleges and universities saw a 17% decline in new international student enrollment this fall, the largest non-pandemic drop in more than a decade. While total international student headcount fell by 1%, first-year international students saw pronounced decreases, hitting public universities hardest. Graduate programs, which typically rely heavily on international students for tuition and research contributions, reported a 12% drop in new enrollments, intensifying financial pressures for campuses dependent on international revenue streams.

Analysts and university leaders attribute the contraction to recent federal visa and travel policies, ongoing administrative review delays, and a sense that the U.S. is less welcoming to prospective international students. The economic consequences are significant, with estimates of more than $1.1 billion in lost revenue and up to 23,000 fewer jobs supported by international enrollment across the country. Many institutions are urging prompt federal action to address visa backlogs and to protect student and graduate work programs, warning that continued declines could undermine educational, economic, and diplomatic interests long term.

Priority Visa Interviews Announced for Foreign World Cup Ticket Holders

On November 17, the Trump Administration and FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced a new visa system for ticket holders to 2026 World Cup games in the United States. The system entitled the “FIFA Pass,” allows ticket holders to receive priority interview times to obtain a U.S. visa to attend a World Cup game. The partnership between the U.S. Department of State, the White House’s FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force (established in March 2025 via executive order) and FIFA will see the hiring of an additional 400 consular officers to process visas. Infantino stated that between five and ten million people from over 200 countries will be traveling to attend the games. The Trump administration has reiterated their commitment to the success of the games while also prioritizing maintaining a firm stance on security. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that having a ticket does not guarantee a U.S. Visa and only allows for an expedited process to getting a visa appointment, while the vetting process remains the same.

Legal

Federal Judge Blocks Termination of Temporary Protected Status for Syrians

On November 19, a federal judge in New York blocked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syrians, granting an emergency reprieve for more than 6,100 TPS holders just days before their protections were set to expire. The court’s order followed legal challenges from advocacy groups who argued that ending TPS for Syrians would violate federal law and expose individuals to grave harm due to ongoing conflict in Syria. The judge cited the severe risks and devastating repercussions of terminating protections, noting that hundreds of families, students, doctors, and other professionals would lose lawful status and face possible deportation.

The ruling temporarily halts the Trump administration’s efforts to end TPS for Syrian nationals, preserving their ability to live and work legally in the United States while litigation continues. Advocates welcomed the decision as a lifeline for community members and a check against an abrupt policy change that would have forced people to return to a country still affected by war and instability. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the administration to move forward with ending TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelan migrants, exposing them to the risk of losing their protections. Meanwhile, federal courts are still weighing legal challenges to the termination of TPS for nationals of Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua.

Judge Dismisses DOJ Challenge to New York Courthouse Protections Law

A federal judge has dismissed the Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, which restricts federal immigration agents from making civil arrests at state courthouses without a judge-signed criminal warrant. The court concluded that New York acted within its authority to regulate courthouse safety and access, and that the state’s law does not conflict with federal immigration enforcement powers. Advocates and state officials argued that courthouse arrests deter witnesses and victims from participating in legal proceedings, undermining justice and due process.

Prior to 2025, federal guidance limited immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as schools, medical facilities, courthouses, and other sites providing essential services. This long-standing policy was first established in 2011 and eventually expanded under the previous administration, aiming to ensure immigrants could safely access critical services without fear of enforcement actions. On the first day of the new Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded these protections and encouraged enforcement wherever agents deemed necessary, including courthouses. The policy shift led to heightened fears and avoidance of essential services among immigrant communities, with reports of decreased school attendance and increased missed medical appointments.

Appeals Court Pauses Chicago Ruling Limiting Federal Agents’ Use of Force

A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a order issued by a Chicago district judge that restricted federal immigration agents’ use of force in the Chicago area. The judge’s ruling on November 6 mandated agents to provide clear warnings before deploying tear gas, pepper balls, and other riot control weapons, prohibited the use of force against peaceful protesters and journalists, and required agents to wear clear identification and body cameras. The judge also required federal agencies to provide detailed records of use-of-force incidents in connection with recent protests and enforcement operations.

The appeals panel, responding to an emergency request from the Trump administration, found the judge’s order “overbroad,” stating that such detailed restrictions resembled federal regulation and encroached upon executive authority over law enforcement. The court’s stay is only temporary, noting that the district judge had assembled robust factual findings suggesting the need for a more tailored injunction, and warning parties not to “overread” the suspension as a final decision. The case remains pending as the judges weigh whether narrower limits on federal agents’ use of force in Chicago are required under First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by the plaintiffs.

Orozco-Vasquez has been convicted of two DWI charges, along with reckless driving, improper entry and illegal re-entry.
These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S.","SAN ANTONIO – United States Attorney Justin R. Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 233 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Nov. 14 to Nov. 20. Charges were brought against individuals with multiple prior removals, DWI convictions, kidnapping convictions, and at least two with prior convictions for sex crimes, including child sex crimes.

Salvadoran national Elmer Alexander Ramirez Cerna was charged with illegal re-entry in Austin. Ramirez Cerna was found in the Williamson County Jail on Nov. 4. He was convicted of sexual assault of a child in 2017 and removed from the U.S. to El Salvador in April 2019.

In Del Rio, USBP agents arrested Honduran national Noel Jose Funez-Antunez. Funez-Antunez was previously deported twice, most recently in June 2024 after he was convicted of sexual assault in Houston and sentenced to two years of confinement. Funez-Antunez was also convicted in 2010 for kidnapping.

Honduran nationals Marcos Joel Contreras-Max and Edwin Javier Chinchilla-Lopez were arrested during a multi-agency operation conducted in San Antonio on Nov. 16. Databases revealed that both individuals were in the United States illegally and had previously been removed from the U.S. to Honduras. The two defendants are each charged with one count of illegal re-entry. If convicted, they face up to two years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine.

In El Paso, Mexican national Miriam Lizeth Gutierrez-Montanez was arrested and charged with human smuggling after she allegedly attempted to enter the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry with two minors in her vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that the Customs and Border Protection officer received a system-generated alert that Gutierrez-Montanez was a possible child smuggler. Further inspection allegedly revealed that the minors were found to be Mexican citizens and not in possession of any legal documents to enter or be present in the U.S.

A U.S. citizen was also arrested and charged with human smuggling in El Paso. U.S. Border Patrol agents allegedly tracked Luis Ramon Carmona to the Cielo Vista Mall after he had picked up seven illegal aliens near the U.S./Mexico border. All eight individuals were placed under arrest and transported to the Clint Border Patrol Station for further processing. A criminal complaint alleges that Carmona was being paid $500 per illegal alien and that he had participated in the same smuggling scheme once before.

Mexican national Agustin Cano-Quintero was charged with illegal re-entry after he was found in the Travis County Jail. Cano-Quintero has been convicted three times for driving while intoxicated and has also been previously convicted for improper entry by an alien as well as illegal re-entry.

On Tuesday, USBP agents arrested Mexican national Amado Tovar-Tovar, who has three DWI convictions and, in August 2024, was removed from the U.S. to Mexico for the fourth time.

Pablo Orozco-Vasquez, also a Mexican national, was arrested near Webb after being previously deported for the fifth time in April. Orozco-Vasquez has been convicted of two DWI charges, along with reckless driving, improper entry and illegal re-entry.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Woessner said local church leaders are concerned but in a holding pattern, waiting to see if a larger news outlet might confirm the story.
""We didn't want to panic,"" he said, adding that church leaders are preparing for the worst, in case the story turns out to be true.
Everett said churches have been worried about potential raids ever since the Trump administration ended the restriction on raids at sensitive locations.
But, by now, they've seen news reports of immigration enforcement outside churches and cases where immigration authorities don't appear to respect someone's documents.","On Tuesday (Nov. 18), the pastor of an 80-person Latino Pentecostal church got a concerning WhatsApp audio message. The message, allegedly created by an unidentified pastor, circulating among Atlanta-area evangelical faith leaders, claimed massive immigration raids would occur there on Thursday and Friday.

Soon, church members were sending him messages asking what they should do about the potential raids. By that evening at their teaching and prayer service, he had to address the rumor with his congregation.

""Stay calm,"" he told them in Spanish, but ""take care of yourselves. Don't go out if you don't need to go out.""

The pastor, who requested anonymity to protect his congregation, said he'd evaluate the situation on Thursday and make a decision about whether to cancel that day's service three hours before its scheduled start.

By Thursday afternoon, he decided to go on with his service, having seen a video from Luis Estrada, a Telemundo Atlanta anchor, saying the viral message was unreliable because of lack of evidence. The anchor noted the Trump administration's pattern of targeting Democratic-led states, which if consistent, would exclude Georgia. But other pastors canceled their services, and Estrada said in the video he received over 100 messages asking about the mysterious audio.

Faith leaders in other parts of the country were also worried this week, after a local news site in Massachusetts published a story warning of potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on churches over the upcoming holidays went viral. The story was shared through social media channels and messaging apps before leaders could sort out whether the reports were true or not.

ICE and other Department of Homeland Security officials have yet to raid a church building. But immigration agents have arrested immigrants on or near church property in at least a dozen instances so far this year, after the Trump administration rescinded an internal government policy discouraging raids on sensitive places like houses of worship. And fear of further escalation remains at the forefront in the minds of many worshippers at immigrant-heavy and Spanish-speaking churches, where attendance is down in many congregations. Viral stories like the one from New England only magnify those concerns, faith leaders say. Published on a local news website called This Week in Worcester, the story cites unnamed Department of Justice sources in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York who claimed that DHS plans to raid Spanish-language churches and other houses of worship over the holidays.

The story also cited an unnamed Hispanic pastor who said government agents had already been to his church to ask about the names and addresses of church members, as well as several pastors who said they received advertisements for the CBP Home app, which DHS uses to encourage people to self-deport. It said evangelical leaders such as the Rev. Clint Pressley, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, were briefed on the plan.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the report of church raids in a statement to RNS.

""Stop with the smears,"" the statement read. ""ICE does not raid churches — regardless of if it is Holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.""

However, McLaughlin did not rule out a raid on a church, saying in the statement, ""If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a church, or a child sex offender was working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety.""

Southern Baptist leaders said they have had no discussion with the DHS about any raids on churches.

""Neither the SBC President nor the Executive Committee has participated in briefings or been in any discussions with governmental officials about these immigration enforcement operations,"" Brandon Porter, the SBC Executive Committee's vice president for communications, told RNS in an email.

Pressley, who is pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, told RNS he'd had no contact with DHS.

""It's completely fabricated. All false,"" Pressley told RNS in a text.

Pressley said that if he had been asked about raids on churches, he would have opposed them.

""Law and order should prevail and can prevail without raiding churches,"" he said.

Even so, the Rev. Dave Woessner, an Episcopal priest who lives in Worcester and works for the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said the article caught local church leaders by surprise. The website in question generally covers local news and is not known for investigative journalism. At first, the story caused alarm as it began to spread through social media.

Woessner said local church leaders are concerned but in a holding pattern, waiting to see if a larger news outlet might confirm the story.

""We didn't want to panic,"" he said, adding that church leaders are preparing for the worst, in case the story turns out to be true.

John Keough, a 43-year-old local reporter, media consultant and former staffer for the Baptist Churches of New England, stood by his reporting in an interview with RNS, saying he wrote the story to warn churches. He said the issue is personal to him: A Hispanic congregation had taken him in when he got out of prison after being convicted on charges related to a home invasion in his 20s. It helped him reintegrate into society, and he said he still has close ties to local Spanish-speaking churches. He got to know some DOJ officials while reporting on an investigation into the Worcester Police Department.

Keough said one of those officials, a fellow Christian, told him about the possible raids, and that led him to look into the story. He'd already been concerned about ICE activity in Worcester, especially after a 16-year-old girl was arrested in May.

""That doesn't line up for me with America,"" he said.

Keough said he'd already seen that Spanish-speaking worshippers were staying away from churches out of fear of ICE, and he feared things could get worse. Then, he heard that ICE had conducted an immigration enforcement action on the grounds of a church in Charlotte last weekend, which pushed him to publish the story.

""I hope the administration will back off on the plan a little bit and maybe think twice,"" he said. ""Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in America.""

DOJ officials in Massachusetts and Rhode Island did not respond to a request for comment.

The Rev. Laura Everett, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, has been fielding calls and emails from pastors and other church leaders who read the story and are worried about possible raids. She and other staffers have been trying to sort out whether the stories about raids are true and helping churches prepare to protect parishioners.

""At a minimum, what we need to be doing is ensuring the safety of all of God's people,"" she said.

Everett said churches have been worried about potential raids ever since the Trump administration ended the restriction on raids at sensitive locations. The Massachusetts Council of Churches is one of a number of religious groups suing the Trump administration over the policy change. The latest rumors have only made things worse, she said.

In Atlanta, the Pentecostal pastor said most of his congregation has some type of legal documents, but even for them, ""the fear comes because of the separation of their families, children, wives, husbands."" With the whispers of massive raids, the ""uncertainty of what will happen, will they come? Will they not come?"" looms large, he said

Church members felt reassured early on in Trump's second term that immigration enforcement would target criminals, and the pastor encouraged members to pay any fines and get right with the law. But, by now, they've seen news reports of immigration enforcement outside churches and cases where immigration authorities don't appear to respect someone's documents.

The congregation has drastically rolled back its street evangelization ministry for fear of being out in public too long. Yet despite lingering anxiety, the pastor said he did not want to cancel Thursday worship if it was not necessary.

As of Thursday, increased immigration enforcement activity had not been reported in Atlanta, and the pastor said he hadn't seen anything notable.

""The Bible demands that we pray for people in positions of authority, and our only desire is to serve God freely without any fear,"" the pastor said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/webRNS-ICE-Immigration1.jpg?h=ada05aa9&itok=S0N09QTn,N,,2025-11-21 15:57:50.968356

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren't in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don’t violate federal law if they provide the same rates to U.S. citizens in the same circumstances — meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as U.S. citizens.

It is the latest action by Trump's administration since he issued executive orders in February directing federal agencies to stop public benefits from going to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and to challenge state and local policies seen as favoring those immigrants over some citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president’s orders enforce federal immigration laws.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The Justice Department also sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, and over California’s new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” it said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the California Supreme Court let stand a lower-court ruling that the University of California’s policy barring students without legal status in the U.S. from campus jobs is discriminatory and must be reconsidered.

University system officials had warned that the decision would put them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

The UC is dealing with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1 billion fine over allegations including antisemitism and the illegal consideration of race in admitting students to its Los Angeles campus.

The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students. More than a quarter of undergraduates are first-generation college students, according to the university system.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration has sued California for providing in-state college tuition, scholarships, and state-funded financial aid to students who do not have legal status to be in the United States.

Kennedy, Jr. refused to meet their legal obligation to consult with Congress on the Administration’s refugee admissions plan — sending deputies to stage a charade consultation instead:

“51 days after the legal deadline, the Trump Administration today came to Capitol Hill in response to our monthslong demands that they follow the law and consult with Congress on their refugee admissions plan.

“It is outrageous that Secretaries Noem, Rubio, and Kennedy were too cowardly to come before us and explain their shocking decision to abandon nearly 130,000 vetted, approved refugees facing persecution and violence abroad. Instead, they sent their deputies, in brazen violation of the law which explicitly requires a consultation by ‘Cabinet-level representatives of the President.’

“The Trump Secretaries ignored their legal obligations to face us because their policy is indefensible.

It is impossible to justify a policy that abandons America’s historic commitment to offering safe harbor to the persecuted. Trump’s team has slashed refugee admissions to the lowest level in our nation’s history and reserved the bulk of the few remaining slots for white South African Afrikaners. They didn’t show up because their betrayal is unspeakable.

“The U.S. Refugee Resettlement program has always been a bipartisan matter of pride for our country, and a critically important tool in our toolbox for achieving multiple goals that are critically important to American interests. The destruction of the program will hurt our humanitarian and diplomacy efforts for decades to come.

“After months of evasion, diversion, and invoking the Republican shutdown as an alibi, the Administration thought they’d pacify us with more disrespect for the law. They were sorely mistaken.

“The Secretaries couldn’t be bothered to come to Congress today, but they should at least learn the route: they’ll be spending plenty of time here when Democrats retake the gavel.”

Last month, Padilla, Durbin, Raskin, and Jayapal slammed the Trump Administration’s decision to slash refugee admissions to 7,500 — almost entirely limited to white Afrikaners from South Africa — without the legally required consultation with Congress.

In 2021, Biden issued an executive order that resulted in the creation of the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, which worked to prioritize the return of deported veterans and their families.
“It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.” While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship.
To be eligible for naturalization through military service, a person must demonstrate “good moral character” for at least five years before applying.
Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.","Just a week after a Purple Heart recipient was deported from an immigration detention center in Florence, veterans and advocates gathered at the Arizona Capitol to condemn the removal of immigrant service members under President Donald Trump.

Michelle Byrd, who spent two decades in the U.S. Air Force and was deployed six times, criticized the deportations of veterans as disrespectful.

“That’s just the ultimate slap in the face, and we should be ashamed of ourselves for letting it happen,” she said. “They defended this country. They raised their hand and they swore to uphold the Constitution, and then they come home and we say, ‘Oh, thanks for your service, get out.’ It’s wrong.”

In an effort to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation promise, immigration enforcement activity has surged, and noncitizen service members, who were previously afforded limited protections from detainment and removal, have been caught in the crosshairs.

The deportation of veterans has been an ongoing issue, though a spotlight on an increase of removals by the Trump administration has prompted vocal criticism. In 2021, Biden issued an executive order that resulted in the creation of the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, which worked to prioritize the return of deported veterans and their families.

Signing up to join the military doesn’t require citizenship, just lawful permanent residency. During Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were directed to take a person’s military record into consideration before arresting them. But under Trump, that guidance was replaced in April with a memo emphasizing that, while it would still be considered, military service alone doesn’t “automatically exempt aliens from the consequences of violating U.S. immigration laws.”

It’s unclear how many foreign-born veterans have been deported since Trump took office. Some estimates project as many as 10,000 were expelled from the country between January and June, according to a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by Democratic members of Congress.

At least two Iraq war veterans have been deported from Arizona. Marlon Parris, who was born in Trinidad but lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, was arrested outside his Laveen home two days after Trump’s inauguration, despite previous assurances from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security that his nonviolent drug charge from 2011 wouldn’t result in his removal. He has since been deported to Mexico. And last week, José Barco, a Purple Heart recipient who was born in Venezuela to Cuban exiles, was deported to Mexico following 10 months in detention.

Advocates argue that immigrants who have served in the military should be exempted from deportation. Mike Olivas, a Vietnam war veteran who drove to the Capitol from Tucson, highlighted the sacrifice of military service as proof that immigrants who sign up for it deserve more.

“They should be at a different level,” he said. “I mean, they fought for their country. They did more than a lot of people did.”

Chris Hill, an organizing fellow with the progressive veterans group Common Defense, added that the government needs to improve its naturalization processes for military members. He noted that the current process puts too much of the burden on military members themselves, and he’s heard about several cases when a person’s citizenship application was waylaid by a deployment order that made them miss critical court appointments.

“We need to codify a practice within the Department of Defense that, if you’re an immigrant and you served your tour of service, that it’s incumbent on the Department of Defense to ensure that you go through that process and you become a citizen while you’re on active duty,” he said. “It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.”

While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship. But the rate of naturalization lags far behind the share of veterans who are immigrants. In 2022, an estimated 16.2 million veterans were born in another country. That same year, only 10,690 military-based naturalizations were approved.

The rate of naturalization is further complicated by the heightened risk of criminal conviction among veterans. To be eligible for naturalization through military service, a person must demonstrate “good moral character” for at least five years before applying. One-third of veterans report being arrested, compared to just one-fifth of non-veterans, due in part to post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injuries or substance abuse. Barco, whose 2006 naturalization application was lost before it could get approved while he was on active duty, was convicted of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of menacing when he fired a handgun into a crowd of teenagers in Colorado two years later, just months after being discharged because of a worsening traumatic brain injury.

Hill argued that a criminal record shouldn’t be the sole determinant of when a foreign-born veteran should be expelled from the country.

“These are soldiers who deployed in very stressful situations, oftentimes were injured, oftentimes have traumatic brain injuries, oftentimes have PTSD and other symptoms,” he said. “To think that they can come back and make mistakes and pay their time, and then get deported? And get deported to a country they don’t know? It’s a tragedy, and it’s not a one-size-fits-all.”

Barcos was sentenced to 52 years in prison when one of the bullets he fired struck 19-year-old Ginny Clemens, who was pregnant. He was ultimately released on Jan. 21 — the day after Trump became president for the second time — after serving 15 years. ICE agents detained him minutes after he walked out.

Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.

“We need to repatriate any veteran who has already been exiled and sent away, because they served this country,” she said. “No matter what their flaws are, or who they are as a human being, they are American because they swore that oath, they defended this country, and whatever happened to them after that service and spending time in war, it’s up to our country to take care of them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-79/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/no-veteran-deportations-1024x6831763686665.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=3QreHcLi,N,,2025-11-21 18:58:25.660905

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

Despite the ruling of Judge Talwani in the District Court, class members who arrived on parole are facing hold ups in the processing of their applications. As the plaintiffs write in a November 5 motion for expedited discovery in the case:

“As time is running out for many, the fear of removal is also real. The stakes simply could not be higher for those who remain in legal limbo while the clock is ticking…[T]here is a pressing need to ensure that Defendants have made good faith efforts in fact to resume processing of applications in the ordinary course.”

On November 10, the plaintiffs also filed a new motion for partial summary judgement on the issue of DHS’s mass termination of the paroles of people who arrived on CHNV. The plaintiffs write:

“The administrative record in this case exposes a stark truth: Secretary Noem’s mass truncation of CHNV parole was not a reasoned policy decision but an exercise in predetermined conclusion-reaching…the Secretary’s administrative record terminating parole grants for hundreds of thousands of people contains literally nothing—not a single document—evaluating whether the crises [in their countries of origin] persist…Nothing in the administrative record grapples with the fact that allowing parolees to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits was an explicit purpose of the processes… that at least half of parolees (212,542 as of March 9) had pending applications for such relief….the administrative record has no information about how many parolees had U.S. citizen children enrolled in schools, how many had employment contracts or leases extending through their parole periods….There is likewise nothing in the administrative record about the impact on third parties who might have relied on the parolees.”

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order blocking three directives from the Trump administration authorizing expedited removal of individuals who were paroled into the United States at a port of entry. But, since mid October, the Trump administration has claimed authority to apply expedited removal to people previously paroled at ports of entry pursuant to regulations deeming them “arriving aliens.” (8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2 and 235.3(b)(1)(i)), a position it explained in a November 17 brief to the First Circuit.

***If you learn of DHS invoking this authority in cases of people who were previously paroled into the U.S. at a port of entry, please report them to JAC, which is continuing to challenge the use of expedited removal against parolees.

Sileiri Doe et. al. v. DHS et. al. is a new class action lawsuit filed on August 11 challenging mass termination of parole and revocation of work authorization of people who waited for CBP One appointments and entered through land border ports of entry.

Here’s where we are:

On October 16, the plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgement asking the court to vacate DHS’s decision to terminate en masse the parole of people who entered with CBP One appointments and vacate DHS revocations of employment authorizations based on the unlawful parole terminations. On November 6, the government responded that DHS was not required to provide individualized reasons for termination and that the termination emails sent to parolees was adequate notice.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

As indicated in the Doe v. Noem litigation, the Trump administration is finding numerous ways to slow the processing and reject applications for people who arrived on parole. One recent policy may require USCIS to “consider country-specific factors” within the countries listed in the ongoing travel bans as “significant negative factors” counting against people applying for immigration statuses that require a discretionary analysis. This would affect people who came on parole from countries subject to travel bans such as Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Afghanistan. This means that since Afghanistan, according to the travel ban, “lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents” and Haiti “lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information,” USCIS could deny green cards to individual Afghans and Haitians who came on parole.

Even as it continues to arrest people who arrived on parole in its enforcement sweeps, the Trump administration has also begun to publish regulations that limit the ability of those who arrived on parole to work. It has issued a regulation eliminating the 540 day extension on work authorization for those who filed to renew their work permits. It has also issued a regulation precluding people who arrived on parole, among many other immigration statuses, from eligibility for commercial driver’s licenses, though this rule has been stayed temporarily by litigation and states should continue to issue licenses while litigation proceeds.

If you or people you know are affected by these rules, please submit comments to the federal register about their harmful impact. Here are template comments about the revocation of the 540 day extension (comments due December 1) and for the commercial driver’s licenses (comments due November 28).

The administration will soon publish proposed regulations limiting the eligibility of asylum seekers and parolees for work permits. We will keep you updated about these regulations and how to oppose them through comments and take actions.

Latest from Congress

Earlier this month, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to reopen the government, extending FY 2025 funding levels through January 30 and barring agencies from projects not funded in the previous fiscal year. There is very limited time left in the session for committees of jurisdiction over immigration to advance meaningful oversight or legislative work.

On November 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Border Security and Immigration Subcommittee convened a hearing, “ICE Under Fire: The Radical Left’s Crusade Against Immigration Enforcement.” Witnesses fielded member questions on recent ICE operations in Chicago, and Senator Alex Padilla walked out in protest. Speakers at a shadow hearing convened by House Democrats attested to the harm inflicted during Operation Midway Blitz and highlighted efforts to show solidarity and support for community-members from rapid responders, faith leaders, and court action.

The appeals court temporarily blocked Ellis' order earlier this week, while an appeal by the Trump administration is considered.

The report pointed to an incident outside the Broadview processing center on Sept. 19, where pepper balls and tear gas were deployed to a crowd. Judge Ellis said she did not find the defendant's evidence and witnesses credible.

The report also noted that in one instance, an agent asked ChatGPT to create their use of force reports based off a brief sentence and several images.

The court says this ""further undermines the credibility and may explain the inaccuracy of these reports when viewed in the light of body worn camera footage.""

DHS issued a statement late Friday afternoon, calling the 7th Circuit Appellate ruling a win for law enforcement across America, while also responding to Ellis' written opinion.

They said in part, ""Judge Ellis' thoughts on 20th century poetry and Chief Bovino's conduct in the order are noted.

The move by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to target Pennsylvania follows similar action against California. Both states are run by Democratic governors who have criticized President Donald Trump’s administration and who are viewed as potential top-shelf contenders to be the party’s 2028 presidential nominee.

Duffy has made it a priority to scrutinize how the licenses are issued since August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. That incident thrust the issue into the public’s consciousness.

It’s unclear how many people would be affected in Pennsylvania. A letter from the Republican administration to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro cited an audit that found two out of 150 people whose licenses exceeded their lawful presence in the country.

The Trump administration is calling on Pennsylvania to pause the issuance of new, renewed and transferred commercial driver’s licenses and permits, as well as conduct an audit to identify those licenses whose expirations exceed the driver’s lawful stay in the U.S.

It is also asking the state to void noncompliant licenses and remove those drivers from the road.

The governors of California and Pennsylvania — Gavin Newsom and Shapiro — are tough critics of Trump, and both have been repeated targets of Trump’s administration.

Shapiro’s administration has said the state transportation department ceased issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published a regulation in late September that would severely limit which immigrants can get one.

A federal court has put the rule on hold for now, but Shapiro’s administration said its transportation department still hasn’t resumed issuing what are called “non-domiciled CDLs.”

The state transportation department said this week that whenever non-citizen applicants apply for a CDL in Pennsylvania, the agency reviews the necessary immigration and naturalization documents and verifies their lawful presence by checking the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s database.

But Shapiro this week suggested that DHS was falling short by failing to properly maintain that database, which states use to check an immigrant’s legal status before issuing a driver’s license to a noncitizen.

His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania. The man, who had a work authorization granted in 2024, was wanted in his home country for belonging to a terrorist organization, the department said.

But Shapiro said the state transportation department checked the federal database over the summer before issuing a CDL to the man, and he was authorized to get one. The state rechecked the database this week, and it still listed him as qualified to get a CDL, Shapiro said.

“They clearly are not minding the shop, and they’ve gotta get better, because every single state in the country relies on this database when making a determination as to who qualifies for a CDL. We relied on the feds before issuing this one,” Shapiro said.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.lockhaven.com/images/2016/10/18200525/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:59:04.209278

Later on, many who were motivated by the issue gathered at CCB Plaza in downtown Durham for an upbeat gathering with traditional dancing and drumming. Students from J.D. Clement Early College, Southern High School and Durham School of the Arts were in attendance.

Students and other invested community members wanted to stand in solidarity, including high school senior Heavenlie Williams.

Jeanell’s sister was granted British citizenship under the Windrush Scheme in 2018, and her two brothers were granted ILR under the Windrush Scheme before being naturalised in 2019.
In November 2024, the High Court ruled in favour of the Home Office, but Jeanell took her case to the Court of Appeal.
Judges said the Home Office had failed to exercise discretion in Jeanell’s case and the decision will now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.
""Today’s judgment rightly recognises that the Home Office should have considered exercising discretion under the Windrush Scheme.","It is the first successful case related to Windrush to be brought at the Court of Appeal.

In a judgment handed down today, the Court of Appeal ruled the Home Office was wrong when it failed to consider exercising its discretion to grant Jeanell's application, even though she did not squarely meet the criteria for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the Windrush scheme.

The Home Office and High Court denied Jeanell ILR because she had not fulfilled the requirement to be continuously resident in the UK.

Jeanell had been unable to fulfil the continuous residency criteria because her father’s Windrush ILR status was not confirmed in time to make it possible for her to apply to stay legally in the UK.

Jeanell arrived in the UK in August 2000 when she was aged 17 but had to leave the country when her student visa expired in 2002.

Her father, Cletus Hippolyte, who had arrived in 1956 as part of the Windrush Generation, was only granted proof of his ILR a year later in 2003.

Jeanell's applications to return to the UK, made in February 2006 and 2008, were then refused.

Jeanell lived in St Lucia with frequent family visits to the UK, until August 2020, and has since been continuously in the UK. Cletus was granted British citizenship in 2018 and had Windrush status. Jeanell’s sister was granted British citizenship under the Windrush Scheme in 2018, and her two brothers were granted ILR under the Windrush Scheme before being naturalised in 2019. Her father disappeared following a visit to St Lucia in 2019 and is now sadly presumed to be dead.

The Court of Appeal accepted that the purpose of the continuous residence requirement in the Windrush policy is to show strong and subsisting ties to the UK.

Jeanell’s case was that she could show her close ties to the UK in other ways, such as her history of extensive visits to the UK, her children being born in the UK and her eldest child attending school in the UK and given this, she fell within the ‘spirit’ of the Windrush Scheme, even if she did not strictly fall within the exact terms of the continuous residency requirement.

However the Home Office never considered this.

In November 2024, the High Court ruled in favour of the Home Office, but Jeanell took her case to the Court of Appeal.

Her legal team argued that as the Home Office failed to consider whether to exercise discretion in her circumstances, the decision should now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.

Today, the Court of Appeal ruled the High Court had erred in law and agreed with Jeanell’s legal team. Judges said the Home Office had failed to exercise discretion in Jeanell’s case and the decision will now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.

In its judgment, the Court of Appeal said:

“It is important that the general discretion which Parliament has conferred on the [Home Office] should be capable of being exercised in a holistic way, having regard to all the circumstances of an individual application.”

Freya Danby, solicitor at Leigh Day said:

“I am delighted that Jeanell’s appeal has succeeded. Throughout this process, she has shown remarkable courage and resilience, continuing her fight for indefinite leave to remain despite numerous setbacks.

""Today’s judgment rightly recognises that the Home Office should have considered exercising discretion under the Windrush Scheme. While Jeanell did not strictly meet the scheme’s criteria, her circumstances fall within its spirit. I hope this decision encourages greater flexibility for others in similar situations.

""This case could have a significant impact on other cases where people don't squarely meet the rules. The Home Office may have to update its guidance in light of the judgment.""

Jeanell Hippolyte said:

“I’m delighted by the Court’s decision and I am so grateful that the right outcome has happened. I feel that justice has been served. I am grateful for the chance to have my voice heard and to my legal team, Freya Danby, Jacqueline McKenzie, Chris Butler KC and Grace Brown, for all of their help and support throughout.""

In a statement released through a spokesperson, Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell responded directly to the day’s events.
“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” Suttell said.
“We know we can do the same again.” In the chief justice’s public statement, Suttell said he cannot require judges to pivot entirely to virtual hearings at this time.
“The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system,” he said.","As federal ICE agents continue to make arrests outside local courthouses, Rhode Island’s highest-ranking judge issued a rare press release on Thursday announcing that the state court system needs to “focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings.”

The statement arrived at the end of a chaotic Thursday, during which court officials said ICE agents mistakenly detained a high school intern working in the Providence County Superior Court.

Those agents wound up face to face with protesters, who had gathered for a pre-scheduled rally to call on court officials to expand virtual hearing access. During the confrontation, a masked ICE agent stepped out of an unmarked vehicle to aim a taser at protesters before driving away.

“ICE is coming to court houses to pick people up because they know they have to come to court, right?” Providence City Council President Rachel Miller, who spoke at the rally, said in an interview. “And so by letting people engage the legal system in a virtual way, it eliminates that danger.”

Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the recently formed Rhode Island Deportation Defense Network, which hosted the rally, said the group began stationing volunteers outside local courthouses in September, and documenting frequent instances where ICE detained people on their way in or out.

On Thursday, though, ICE agents appeared to cross a line that drew a stern response from the state court system. In a statement released through a spokesperson, Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell responded directly to the day’s events.

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” Suttell said. “Given this climate, the judiciary understands the call to implement remote hearings in Providence County, and beyond.”

The Deportation Defense Network had issued a public demand earlier in the week for Suttell to “remove the legal red tape and require judges to offer virtual hearings, trials, and conferences, except in extraordinary circumstances.”

“This could instantly cut off a major source of ICE detentions in Rhode Island and allow immigrant community members to access the legal system without fear,” the network’s statement said.

Under current court policy, the network said that virtual court hearings can be requested, but few community members know how to access them, and the process requires a lawyer or legal advocate to effectively navigate.

“We did go fully virtual to protect families during Covid,” Miller said. “We know we can do the same again.”

In the chief justice’s public statement, Suttell said he cannot require judges to pivot entirely to virtual hearings at this time.

“The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system,” he said. “What occurred today, however, reinforces the Judiciary’s need to focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings.”

A court spokesperson, Alexandra Kriss, said the intern detained by ICE was released after agents confirmed they had the wrong person.

“If not for the intervention of a Superior Court judge who insisted that ICE had wrongfully identified his intern as their target,” Kriss said, “this young person would have been taken into ICE custody.”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ri-remote-court-1-1000x750.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 16:57:49.348596

However, a June federal court order blocked Texas from enforcing this law. Now, undocumented students must provide evidence of lawful presence to qualify for these benefits, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

To comply, the board adopted new rules, which went into effect on Nov. 13, that allow universities to verify student immigration status with a federal agency, which may pose privacy risks, said Garibay, a senior strategist and consultant at the Intercultural Development Research Association, a nonprofit that helps students from underserved communities access public education.

The rules require non-citizen students applying for in-state tuition to submit a residency questionnaire and an affidavit affirming lawful presence. Federal immigration law does not define “lawful presence” — only “unlawful presence,” which refers to any time when a person is present in the country without being admitted or paroled, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Several public interest groups were concerned about the lack of a definition for “lawful presence” after the board proposed the rules in August. In response, the board stated that institutions should consult their own legal counsel to “determine the status(es) that may be considered lawfully present.”

“The lawfully present standard is required by federal law,” a board spokesperson wrote in a statement. “Our discretion in the matter is limited.”

The board does not have authority to determine what lawful presence is, but it could clarify how it interprets current provisions of immigration law, said Danny Woodward, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.

“Schools are going to probably … be treating students differently because they’re using different definitions of lawful presence,” Woodward said.

The adopted rules now allow schools to verify evidence of lawful presence using Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, a federal program administered by USCIS. The system helps government agencies confirm the immigration status of people applying for public benefits.

In Texas, eight state agencies are authorized to use SAVE, according to USCIS. However, no Texas university currently uses the system to independently verify lawful presence. Typically, schools do not need independent access to SAVE and instead use it in conjunction with another government agency, like the Department of Education, when administering federal student aid.

“USCIS welcomes the opportunity to work with universities in Texas or other states to ensure that only eligible aliens are receiving taxpayer funded benefits such as in-state tuition,” a USCIS spokesperson wrote in an email.

UT is considering the feasibility of using SAVE to confirm lawful presence.

To use SAVE, an agency must enter a formal agreement with USCIS, according to a sample contract. However, Garibay said she is concerned that sharing student information with the agency could lead to violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which protects students’ identifiable information, such as citizenship status or social security number.

“From our perspective, colleges and universities need to continue to protect students’ information,” Garibay said. “Our universities and colleges should not be the arm of USCIS.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-2-25_Capitol_Makenna-Morgan-12.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:57:22.230881

‘I consider America my home’ Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone.","A Maryland family is trying to get their loved one back after she was deported from the U.S. to a country they say she had no ties to. Video that’s made international news showed her being dragged by people her family believes worked for Ghana’s government.

The videos obtained by the News4 I-Team are raising questions from her family about how people are treated after they are deported from the U.S. to countries other than their countries of origin.

As part of the Trump administration’s third-country deportation program, dozens of deportees have been sent from the U.S. to Africa since this summer, NBC News reported.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old mother and grandmother, moved to the D.C. area 30 years ago as she fled Sierra Leone’s civil war, said Mohamed Alghali, her son. He owns a home in Bowie with his mom, who he called his best friend.

“I felt defeated. Felt like I failed my mom,” he said.

Alghali was born in the U.S. and his family put down roots in the D.C. area. His grandparents joined them and became citizens. Kuyateh’s attorney says she was a nurse with a work permit but never became a citizen.

‘My heart just broke’

Alghali was required to check in every year with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.

Her check-in this July was different.

“They called her to the back. They said, ‘Yeah, Rabbiatu, you have a order of removal. So, we're, you know, yeah, we're detaining you,” her son said.

“I mean, my heart just broke,” he said.

Alghali was optimistic he would see his mother again. But he wouldn’t see her face-to-face. After several days at Maryland ICE’s temporary holding area, she was moved to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she was held for months, her attorney said.

“I don't think anyone expected her to be detained, just because nothing had changed with her circumstances,” attorney Hannah Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s attorney said Kuyateh was still in Louisiana in September when a judge granted an order saying she could not be sent back to Sierra Leone, where she said her client had been tortured.

Bridges said the U.S. immediately began exploring other countries to send her to, which the attorney tried to fight in court with requests for hearings.

“Those requests went unacknowledged,” Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s civil rights have been violated, her attorney said.

“She should have been given notice and an opportunity to seek protection from removal to a third country, and the government had multiple opportunities to do this,” Bridges said.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh says she was flown to Ghana in shackles

Earlier this month, Kuyateh was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, a country she said she had never been to.

Alghali called his mother while the I-Team was with him. She said as she was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, her wrists and ankles were shackled for the entire 10-hour flight. Some had it even worse, she said.

“There was another guy on the floor. That guy, they chained from the head. Down to the feet,” Kuyateh said. “They said if you don't cooperate with us, that's how we're going to tie you.”

Kuyateh told the I-Team she and other deportees were sent to a hotel in Ghana. She said she was there for six days before video captured her being dragged.

A bus arrived to take Kuyateh to Sierra Leone – though a U.S. judge had ordered that she could not be sent there. She told News4 she resisted.

“That’s when they dragged me. So, they bumped the back of my head,” Kuyateh said.

The I-Team obtained multiple videos of the dragging, which were sent to her family and provided to News4.

Kuyateh said she believes the people on video in green uniforms worked for Ghana's government.

Photos show some of the injuries Kuyateh said she sustained from being dragged.

The video went viral overseas, and several media outlets in West Africa reported that the Sierra Leone High Commission, which is like its embassy in Ghana, said it’s aware of what happened and will investigate.

News4 asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

NBC Washington asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

‘I consider America my home’

Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone. But she wants to be with her family.

“I consider America my home. It's like, I built relationships there,” she said.

In the home she owns in Bowie, her family asked what her future would hold and if she would ever return. The I-Team asked her son if she felt that the U.S. had failed his mom.

“Yes, one hundred percent. I felt like they’ve been failing her,” Alghali said.

The I-Team reached out to ICE in Maryland for comment several days ago. They asked that we share our videos of Kuyateh being dragged, which we did. They still have not responded to our questions about her case.

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice argued in federal court that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees. It said that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. that it wouldn't send deportees back to their home countries.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Ghana to stop deporting people from the U.S. to their home countries if U.S. courts have said it’s dangerous for them to return.

Kuyateh was the primary caregiver for her mother and father. She told the I-Team she’s worried about who will take care of them now. When she was detained in the U.S., she thought she was being released to head back to Maryland when she was forced to board the flight to Ghana.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling.
The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.
“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump’s order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration’s “arguments are so flimsy,” ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. “But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/VLW-digital-product-mockup-for-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:59:21.035978

The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).

At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.

“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.

The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.

Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.

But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”

Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.

The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.

Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).

Lower wages

The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.

“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.

“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.

Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.

“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”

Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.

The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.

“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”

Fewer raids

The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.

In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.

For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.

Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.

Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.

“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”

While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.

“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, is the latest action by the Trump administration against California. It is the third lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against the state in a week, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens,” the government said in the complaint. “There are no exceptions.”

The complaint refers to California’s exemption from out-of-state rates for applicants, including students living in the country illegally, who have graduated from the state’s high schools or meet education requirements at other institutions in the state. It asks the court to declare this rule unconstitutional and invalid, and to bar the defendants from enforcing it.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California; Rob Bonta, the state’s attorney general; the University of California system; and California Community Colleges are listed among the defendants.

Rachel Zaentz, a University of California spokesperson, said it followed state and federal laws regarding eligibility for in-state tuition, financial aid and scholarships.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” she said.

The rules targeted by the complaint affect thousands of students lacking permanent legal status in California’s colleges and universities. The California Community Colleges system, with 116 campuses, is one of the largest in the country. Like the University of California system, it says it does not discriminate on the basis of an applicant’s immigration status.

California is not the first state to be targeted by the Trump administration over tuition benefits for students living in the country illegally. The Justice Department has filed similar suits against Illinois, Kentucky, Texas, Minnesota and Oklahoma. The department noted its actions followed Trump executive orders this year barring those not in the country legally from receiving taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment.

Washington, D.C. – Democracy Forward is taking the Trump-Vance administration to court to uncover raw footage connected to social media videos produced during raids perpetrated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in Chicago last month and information pertaining to training and operational guidance.

In a lawsuit filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE, Democracy Forward is asking a federal court to help shed light on the administration’s unconstitutional and unconscionable pursuit of its immigration agenda. The suit asks a federal court to order DHS and ICE to disclose the public documents, as required by law.

On September 30, 2025, at around 1 am local time, federal agents conducted a military-style raid on a Chicago apartment building—a deeply concerning operation in the Trump-Vance administration’s approach to immigration enforcement. As agents worked their way through the building, media outlets reported that they kicked down doors, detonated flash bang grenades, and zip tied sobbing children. Reportedly, nearly all residents in the building were detained as part of this immigration raid, including U.S. citizens. Members of Congress have expressed outrage over the conduct of this operation and have pressed DHS for information about the manner in which the raid was conducted. Subsequent reporting has revealed that many detained in the raid had no criminal records.

A few days after the raid, DHS published a video on its social media accounts valorizing the dangerous and unjustified action. The video uses numerous camera angles of the raid, indicating that it was a compilation of a substantial quantity of footage edited for public relations purposes.

“The administration cannot ignore the Constitution in their pursuit of social media clicks. The public deserves to see the full extent of the horror inflicted on American neighborhoods by the Trump-Vance administration’s unconstitutional and unlawful PR stunt,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “The government cannot legally hide the footage captured at the raid, nor can they cover up the public documents used in the raid’s preparation and execution. We are eager to argue this case in court.”

In the wake of the raid, Democracy Forward filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), asking for all documents relating to the planning and execution of the raid, as well as all of the raw footage – not just the selectively edited social media video – that was captured during the raid. The requests were not addressed within the legally required time for the government to respond, forcing Democracy Forward to move forward with this lawsuit to compel the disclosure of all documents and video footage.

The case is Democracy Forward Foundation v. DHS et al, and the legal team in this case includes Daniel McGrath, Amy Vickery, and Robin Thurston.

Sexual abuse can also be used to coerce incarcerated people into making a warden appear “productive” or “helpful” to external stakeholders.
On its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that former FCI Dublin Warden Wiley Z. Jenkins received the Army Community Partnership Award.
They argue reopening FCI Dublin under ICE would not prevent future harm — it would replicate it.","SAN FRANCISCO – Human rights activists are urging the federal government not to reopen Federal Correctional Institute (FCI) Dublin, California, as an ICE detention center, arguing the facility has a documented history of sexual violence and human rights violations, according to an ActionNow petition.

The Los Angeles Times reported that multiple officers, including former Warden Ray J. Garcia and prison chaplain Jesse Highhouse, were convicted of sexual abuse at the facility.

Now, the immigrant women who testified against them are being deported even though they qualify for U Visas, which provide a pathway to citizenship, according to KTVU. Human rights advocates worry that ICE will repeat the same abuses or retaliate against these immigrants with deportation, according to the ActionNow petition.

While no official announcements have been made, “BOP [Bureau of Prisons] Central Office staff, BOP Western Regional Staff and ICE representatives did a visual structural assessment on FCI Dublin,” American Federation of Government Employees Local 3584 President Edward Canales told KQED. “Basically, can the prison hold detainees as is, or [does it] need repairs.”

Not only have protests come from women who survived abuse at FCI Dublin, but Japanese Americans who lived through U.S. wartime incarceration have also joined in opposition, drawing parallels to xenophobic detention policies they vowed would “never happen again.” Research shows communities near ICE detention centers experience higher immigration arrest and deportation rates.

In addition, recidivism for staff-perpetrated prison sexual abuse is high. Susan Beaty of the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice told Truthout that transferring incarcerated women to another facility after FCI Dublin shut down did not protect them. “Sexual abuse, medical neglect and retaliation exists across the system,” she said. “It doesn’t solve the problems to move people who have already been through so much to other places — farther away from their families and their attorneys — where they’re going to be subjected to very similar kinds of harm.”

Sexual abuse has been documented in U.S. correctional systems since the nation’s founding. Prisons are structured around control, and sexual abuse functions as a tool of domination with roots connected to colonial and chattel slavery power systems.

Sexual abuse can also be used to coerce incarcerated people into making a warden appear “productive” or “helpful” to external stakeholders. When wardens are labeled “productive” without a formal rating system, they may receive financial bonuses.

On its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that former FCI Dublin Warden Wiley Z. Jenkins received the Army Community Partnership Award. FCI Dublin sits adjacent to the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area on a former air base and uses incarcerated workers to provide labor below minimum wage in exchange for job training. The maximum a federal prisoner can earn is $2 per hour.

Despite accessing what amounts to nearly free labor while the government spends approximately $80 billion annually on corrections and $1.2 trillion to operate government-run facilities, historian Alexander Lichtenstein and Michael Kroll wrote in a project of the American Friends Service Committee, “Prisons, filled with unemployed people of color from the inner cities, are being sold to economically depressed rural communities as a source of jobs for their growing numbers of unemployed — who are usually whites.”

Women are disproportionately targeted by economic conditions that lead to incarceration. The Prison Policy Initiative reported that “35% of women experienced homelessness, eviction, or struggled to make rent or mortgage payments as a result of bail, court fees and lost economic opportunities. Incarceration cost one-third of women their household’s primary source of income, and 43% were forced to work more hours, get a different job, or turn down an educational opportunity as a result.”

In The New Yorker, reporter Eric Markowitz explained that “the country’s historic incarceration boom has given rise to companies that provide services and products to government prisons. Many of these provide necessary equipment and services, of course, but some do so in rather unsavory ways.”

Markowitz pointed to the prison phone industry, which is dominated by a small number of private companies that make an estimated $1.2 billion annually from phone and video call fees. These calls can cost up to $30 for 40 minutes.

The prison health care provider Corizon Health earns $1.4 billion per year and has faced allegations including failing to hire registered nurses for intake evaluations and leaving terminally ill patients in soiled beds without food or water.

Commissary prices inside prisons can be five times higher than retail stores, resulting in approximately $1.6 billion in annual profit for the commissary industry.

Markowitz wrote that Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, told him, “I expect the government to waste money. But it’s totally different for the government to collude with a private company to make poor people lose money.”

With the U.S. economy benefiting from the detention system and wardens allegedly using sexual abuse to maintain obedience, advocates argue that the location of future ICE facilities is not the issue. They say the problem is the carceral structure itself.

Advocates warn systemic profit incentives, retaliation against survivors and staff transfers normalize abuse and create a culture of impunity. They argue reopening FCI Dublin under ICE would not prevent future harm — it would replicate it.

“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump’s order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration’s “arguments are so flimsy,” ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. “But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Immigration_Birthright_Citizenship_25325081999485-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:57:40.802495

The Path Ahead The MRA is meant to ensure that the power of the purse remains in Congress’s hands.","President Trump has co-opted Congress’s power of the purse by privately raising hundreds of billions of dollars from corporations and foreign governments outside the legally required appropriations process. In recent months, the administration has used corporate donations to start construction on a White House ballroom, accepted a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family, and used $130 million in privately donated funds to pay service members during a government shutdown. Each of these arrangements channels private or foreign money into public functions without a congressional appropriation. They are violations, in letter or in spirit, of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, a core fiscal statute that requires all money or property “received for the Government” to be deposited in the Treasury unless Congress says otherwise.

The Trump administration’s growing use of private donations and foreign financing to supplement congressional appropriations illustrates how easily the Miscellaneous Receipts Act and Congress’s power of the purse can be bypassed. These “shadow appropriations” empower the executive branch to direct money toward its own priorities without congressional authorization or oversight.

Unless Congress acts, the presidency will acquire a second, hidden budget: slush funds drawn from corporations and foreign governments with no external oversight. The power of the purse anchors Congress’s independence, keeping the legislature from becoming a spectator to executive power. Unless Congress reasserts control over federal spending, the balance the framers designed could collapse into a self-financing presidency.

The Legal Framework

The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” The Miscellaneous Receipts Act (MRA) gives that command practical force: “an official or agent of the Government receiving money for the Government from any source shall deposit the money in the Treasury.” In other words, the MRA applies when (1) a government official or agent receives funds and (2) those funds are for the government. Once deposited in the Treasury, the funds can be withdrawn only through an appropriation enacted by Congress.

Congress has carved out limited exceptions to the MRA by authorizing certain agencies to accept private gifts. These agencies have specific gift-acceptance statutes allowing them to accept money, services, or property from private donors without violating the MRA. Other agencies have no such authority at all. Where these statutes exist, their terms vary: some require ethics reviews, limit gifts to particular purposes, or bar donors from placing conditions on how their contributions are used. When a gift fits within a valid statutory authorization, the agency may keep it without breaching the MRA. But, unless the law also authorizes the agency to spend those funds, using them would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, which forbids federal officials from obligating or spending money without an appropriation or other legal authority.

The MRA underpins a longstanding rule of appropriations law known as the anti-augmentation principle: an agency’s lawful funding equals, and cannot exceed, the funds Congress has appropriated. Any outside money or in-kind benefit used to expand an agency’s budget violates that rule. To prevent circumvention, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), and the courts have recognized the doctrine of constructive receipt, treating money or property as “received” when the government effectively controls their use, even if never directly taking possession. The doctrine ensures that agencies cannot evade the MRA simply by structuring transactions such that no federal official ever handles the money.

GAO and OLC have applied the constructive-receipt doctrine differently. OLC takes a narrower view, permitting third-party settlements so long as the government retains no control over the funds after the agreement is executed. GAO applies a broader, substance-focused standard that looks to the government’s practical influence or involvement in how the funds are used. It has historically viewed third-party payments as bypassing Congress’s control absent strong justification.

Officials who violate the MRA may be removed from office and required to forfeit any portion of the funds they hold or would otherwise be entitled to. Though the statute carries no criminal penalties, related laws prohibiting the misuse of government resources can still apply. Together, these safeguards uphold the MRA’s deeper purpose: preserving Congress’s power of the purse and ensuring that the executive spends only what the people’s representatives have approved.

Shadow Appropriations in Practice

Throughout 2025, the administration’s approach to the MRA has evolved from quiet workarounds to overt evasion, an experiment in ever more aggressive executive self-financing. It began in March, when several major law firms agreed to provide roughly $1 billion in pro bono legal services for causes chosen by the administration. Because the government retained post-settlement control over which organizations would receive those services, it constructively received the funds in violation of the MRA even under OLC’s narrower reading of the Act. The deals offered a blueprint for how the executive could pressure private actors to fund public priorities without an appropriation, a dangerous precedent I have analyzed separately.

By May, that blueprint was being put into practice. The Trump administration confirmed that it would accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One. The jet, worth roughly $400 million, may be the largest gift ever given to the United States by a foreign government. Now being modified for presidential travel, it will later be transferred to President Trump’s presidential library. Although the Justice Department approved the transfer, the administration has refused to release its legal rationale, which likely relies on the Defense Department’s gift-acceptance authorities. Whatever the justification, accepting a half-billion-dollar aircraft for use as Air Force One stretches the concept of a “gift” well beyond what Congress ever intended.

Two months later, in July, the same disregard reached the Justice Department. It entered a settlement requiring Brown University to pay $50 million to “state workforce development organizations,” rather than to the Treasury, and in November entered a similar settlement requiring Cornell University to invest $30 million in research projects that benefit U.S. farmers. Because the DOJ retained no post-settlement control over the funds, the agreements likely complied with OLC’s longstanding interpretation of the MRA. But they appear inconsistent with GAO’s broader approach to constructive receipt, as the payment neither compensated victims nor related to the underlying discrimination case. Moreover, they violated DOJ’s current settlements policy, contravening the Attorney General’s February 2025 directive not to use third-party payments to non-victims except in limited circumstances.

In July, the White House also announced plans for a 90,000-square-foot “Presidential Ballroom,” projected to cost roughly $300 million and to be funded entirely by private donors. Reporting identified multiple corporate pledges of more than $10 million each. President Trump later hosted the ballroom’s corporate donors at a White House reception, giving private financiers of a federal building access to the president at a taxpayer-funded event. Although he initially claimed the construction would not affect the East Wing, he subsequently demolished it. The administration has offered no legal theory for the donations but is likely relying on a gift statute for the Department of the Interior or the National Park Service. Like the Qatari jet, the project would stretch any such authority well past its intended scope, turning permission for routine donations into a vehicle for privately financing presidential construction.

By fall, what began as discrete gifts and settlements had expanded into a slush fund measured in the hundreds of billions. In exchange for partial tariff relief, Japan agreed to provide $550 billion in investment capital that President Trump would personally select. Because the administration determines which projects Japan must fund, the money is “received for the Government” under the MRA and must be deposited in the Treasury. Instead, it created a parallel, foreign-financed shadow budget under presidential control and outside Congress’s appropriations process. On November 14, South Korea struck a similar deal with the United States, committing $200 billion under essentially the same model. The following week, the Department of Energy’s chief of staff reportedly said in a conference speech that the Japanese funds may be used to buy and own as many as ten new nuclear reactors.

In October, the Trump administration announced that it intended to use a $130 million donation from billionaire Timothy Mellon to pay service members during the shutdown, but it has not disclosed whether any of the funds were actually spent. Using the donation for troop pay would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, as the Department’s gift-acceptance statutes authorize it to receive such funds but not to spend them on salaries.

The Risks of Unchecked Violations

The MRA may seem like bureaucratic bookkeeping, but it embodies a deeper constitutional principle. The power of the purse is Congress’s ultimate check on executive power, ensuring a government of laws, not of men. As Madison wrote in Federalist 58, the “power over the purse” is the people’s “most complete and effectual weapon . . . for obtaining a redress of every grievance.”

History shows what happens when presidents raise and spend money outside Congress’s control. During the Iran-Contra affair, White House officials secretly sold weapons to Iran and used the proceeds—along with funds solicited from foreign governments—to support the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The episode showed how executive self-financing—raising and spending money outside the appropriations process—undermines Congress’s control over public spending and allows presidents to act unilaterally on major policies.

When presidents can raise and spend money outside Congress, the constitutional balance between democratic accountability and executive authority threatens to give way. Once executive financing moves off budget, the damage radiates outward. Accountability erodes first, as presidents make unilateral decisions—even demolishing parts of the White House—without congressional consent. Transparency disappears next: appropriations are debated, recorded, and audited; donations and foreign transfers are often not. Then comes influence as companies or benefactors that finance presidential projects gain improper access and influence, blurring the line between public policy and private patronage. And when the money comes from abroad, leverage follows, embedding subtle obligations in the very assets meant to symbolize national sovereignty.

These constitutional breaches accumulate power in the presidency at the expense of Congress and, ultimately, the electorate. The MRA and other fiscal laws are how Congress restrains the executive, insisting that no president, however popular or powerful, may spend money without the people’s consent.

A Reform Agenda

To restore control over the public purse, Congress should begin by addressing the four recent executive actions that implicate the MRA.

(1) Qatari Jet: The Qatari jet could be auctioned off and the proceeds deposited in the Treasury, reaffirming that foreign governments may not endow the presidency directly.

(2) White House Ballroom: Congress could require the administration to disclose the size of each donation, provide transparent accounting of costs, and cap the total private budget or shift the project to taxpayer funding to mitigate conflicts. In essence, Congress should hold the project to at least the same standards of oversight and accountability that apply to any federally funded construction.

(3) Foreign Deals: For the Japan and South Korea deals, Congress should not allow any president to personally direct hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign-financed spending outside the appropriations process. At a minimum, it should either prohibit them from proceeding or else enact a statutory framework to bring them under transparent governance and appropriations control.

(4) Private Donation to Pay Troop Salaries: For the $130 million in privately donated troop pay, Congress should clarify that no gift authority permits substituting private funds for appropriated military pay and should require the Defense Department to unwind the transaction and restore compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act. If that would violate the terms of the gift, the Department should return the funds to the donor or seek congressional authorization to do so.

These steps may face political resistance, but they show the scope of Congress’s authority to correct existing breaches. Even short of legislation, members of Congress can seek GAO opinions and request the ethics analyses and legal authorities the agencies relied upon. Over the longer term, Congress should strengthen the MRA’s enforcement mechanisms and narrow the exceptions the Trump administration has sought to exploit.

Congress Should Strengthen and Enforce the Miscellaneous Receipts Act

Congress should strengthen and enforce the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in several key ways:

1. Require Mandatory Reporting and Real Consequences for Violations

Congress should require agency heads to notify Congress and GAO of any MRA breach—mirroring the reporting obligations in the Anti-Deficiency Act—and to document corrective steps taken. To ensure compliance, Congress should attach meaningful penalties: civil or administrative sanctions for reckless conduct and criminal liability for knowing or willful violations, with a ten-year statute of limitations to preserve accountability across administrations.

Private entities should share responsibility as well. Corporations and executives who knowingly fund projects in violation of the MRA should face civil penalties proportionate to the amount contributed, deterring both improper government requests and improper private attempts to curry favor.

2. Modernize the Financial Oversight Infrastructure

Congress should integrate MRA oversight into the financial-integrity frameworks required under the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act and the Chief Financial Officers Act. Incorporating MRA compliance into these internal-control systems would ensure that agencies treat MRA risks with the same rigor as other financial-integrity obligations and would institutionalize early detection and correction of violations.

3. Create Standardized Limits on Agency Gift Authorities

As GAO recommended in 1980, Congress should establish uniform criteria for the solicitation, acceptance, and use of gift funds. Those criteria should include clear statutory definitions, a consistent ethics-review process, and limits on what agencies may accept and what conditions—if any—donors may impose. Gift authorities should be confined to small, mission-related support, not major capital projects or operational assets such as a presidential aircraft.

4. Impose Dollar Caps on All Gifts and Donations

Congress should impose annual dollar limits on gifts an agency may accept—both from any single donor and in the aggregate for the agency—to ensure that gifts remain supplementary and mission-related rather than a parallel funding stream for major projects. Large gifts should also trigger an inspector general review and a written report to Congress, preventing agencies from using gift authority to finance major initiatives outside the appropriations process.

5. Require Comprehensive Notice and Disclosure

Congress should mandate a comprehensive transparency regime for significant gifts, donations, and third-party settlements. For any transfer over a specified dollar threshold, agencies should be required to provide at least 45 days’ advance written notice to the appropriations and authorizing committees and to GAO. Each notice should include the source and value of the contribution, any conditions the donor attached, the ethics review, and the legal analysis supporting the agency’s claimed statutory authority. Agencies should also report basic information on each donation to GAO on a quarterly basis, creating a continuous audit trail.

6. Impose Additional Safeguards Against Influencing the White House

Agency gifts directed to the President or Vice President raise special concerns and warrant heightened standards and review. Reflecting this concern, the recently introduced Stop Ballroom Bribery Act would apply additional limitations in the context of the National Park Service’s gift authorities, which the administration likely relied on for donations to the White House ballroom. Congress should adopt a complementary, government-wide rule—applicable across all statutory gift authorities—requiring heightened ethics review for any gift intended for presidential or vice-presidential use or whose primary function is to support their facilities, activities, or operations.

7. Codify and Clarify Limits on Third-Party Payments

Executive agreements and settlements that direct a counterparty to pay a third party can allow the executive branch to influence the use of funds outside the appropriations process, creating risks under the MRA. GAO and the Justice Department have recognized these risks, and DOJ adopted safeguards under the Biden Administration to prevent third-party payments from drifting beyond legitimate statutory purposes.

Congress should codify those principles. First, it should make explicit that funds effectively controlled by the United States may fall under the MRA even if the government never touches the money. Second, Congress should bar agencies from retaining any control or direction over unappropriated funds once an agreement is executed. Third, Congress should establish uniform guardrails modeled on the Biden administration’s safeguards. For example, any payment must have a direct nexus to the statutory authority or violation at issue, and the government may not direct payments to specific recipients.

These requirements should apply across all agencies with enforcement, regulatory, or negotiation authority, not just DOJ. They would preserve legitimate uses of third-party payments—such as victim compensation or remedies tied to statutory violations—while preventing agencies from using such arrangements to finance priorities Congress has not approved. To ensure oversight, any agreement requiring payment to a non-victim third party should be reported to GAO on a quarterly basis.

The Path Ahead

The MRA is meant to ensure that the power of the purse remains in Congress’s hands. Yet, shadow appropriations are emerging in real time and risk becoming normalized. The question before Congress is whether public spending will remain governed by law or drift toward presidential discretion. The power of the purse will endure only if Congress insists on exercising it.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2223443087.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 10:58:03.202348

They won at the trial level, but the Supreme Court stayed that ruling on grounds that the case may have been brought in the wrong federal court.","On Nov. 14 the faculty and staff of the University of California won a significant victory over President Trump in his effort to fine UCLA $1.2 billion for resisting his efforts to bend the university to his ideological demands.

Finding that the plaintiffs submitted “overwhelming evidence” that Trump and his cabinet members pursued a campaign of cutting off government funding with the goal of “bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,” federal Judge Rita Lin of San Francisco blocked the fine and nearly $600 million in funding cuts. She ordered the money to start flowing again.

Lin’s ruling resembles those by other federal judges who blocked Trump’s funding cutoffs. Faculty and staff representatives, with the American Assn. of University Professors as the lead plaintiff, justly celebrated the UC injunction, even though it’s likely that the government will appeal.

But two entities with an interest in the case’s outcome have been silent: the state of California and UC itself. Neither joined the AAUP lawsuit, which was filed in September, and neither has commented since.

It’s not as though the state and the university are blind to the potential impact of Trump’s funding cutoff. When Trump’s demands and threats were made public in August, Gov. Newsom termed them “extortion” and threatened to sue. UC President James B. Milliken said the announced cuts would be a “death knell for innovative work that saves lives, grows our economy and fortifies our national security.”

Addressing the UC Board of Regents at its meeting Wednesday, Milliken stated that the university system still faces the loss of more than $1 billion in federal research funding, but didn’t mention the AAUP lawsuit.

UC reportedly has continued negotiations with the White House. A UC spokesperson wouldn’t comment on any such talks, even to confirm them. A spokesman for Gov. Newsom said he’s closely watching the numerous court cases challenging Trump’s funding threats, and “he’s pleased with the recent court rulings affirming that Trump’s assault on California’s world-class research institutions was reckless and illegal.”

Let’s keep in mind what’s at stake in this battle. The University of California is the premier public university system in the nation. It’s the second-largest employer in the state and one of the most important providers of healthcare. The productivity of its research is spectacular. Much of the universities’ work is supported by the government — $17 billion a year, including matching Medicaid and Medicare funding and student aid.

“We were hopeful that the UC system would defend itself legally,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine and general counsel to the AAUP. After UCLA published the administration’s 27-page list of demands in August, she says, the AAUP decided it couldn’t wait any longer: “We couldn’t not sue, they were so outrageous.”

The demands included bans on diversity programs, public demonstrations across much of the campus and provisions for transgender students. UCLA also would be required to refuse admission to foreign students “likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American, or antisemitic disruptions,” and to comply with Trump’s ban on “gender ideology” — that is, defining males and females as anything other than the sex they were assigned at birth.

The state and the UC system haven’t entirely avoided legal jousting with Trump. California led seven other states into federal court to challenge the Dept. of Education’s termination of $65 million in grants funding programs that included diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. They won at the trial level, but the Supreme Court stayed that ruling on grounds that the case may have been brought in the wrong federal court.

The regents also joined a lawsuit brought by the Assn. of American Universities and 13 other universities challenging the Dept. of Health and Human Services limit on reimbursements for overhead costs on government-funded research, which would cost universities billions of dollars. They won at the trial level, but the government appealed that ruling. The state also sued Trump or participated in lawsuits on other topics.

One can understand, even sympathize with, the reluctance of UC to pursue a courtroom fight over Trump’s demands. UC faces the same quandary as other institutions that have tried to reach accords with the administration.

Trump has almost unlimited tools at his discretion to harass his adversaries for years to come through endless “investigations” of purported statutory violations, among other things. Courtroom battles take time and money, resources that may never be recovered. Plus with a pro-Trump majority on the Supreme Court, ultimate victory is nothing like a certainty.

And while Trump’s term won’t last beyond January 2029, at which point his anti-university campaign might end, that may be cold comfort for institutions facing an immediate financial crisis.

“It may be hard for an educational institution to ride this out until 2029,” says Dan Schnur, a veteran political consultant on the faculty of UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies. “For an institution that budgets on an annual basis, three years is a long time, and for a student, it’s three-fourths of an undergraduate experience.”

That brings us to the case the UC faculty and staff made in court. It’s as clear and concise a description of the noxious campaign Trump has conducted against American higher education that one will find anywhere. It was accepted almost in its entirety by Judge Lin.

The administration consistently has portrayed the funding cutoffs as a response to what it claims to be pervasive antisemitism at UCLA and other targeted campuses. Yet as federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs of Boston found in September when she blocked Trump’s grant terminations against Harvard, it’s “difficult to conclude anything other than that [the government] used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

Indeed, the UC plaintiffs show that the funding cutoffs were motivated purely by ideology, and flagrantly infringed on free speech rights. Just a week after Trump’s inauguration, the White House issued an order suspending all financial disbursements that involved “DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” (“DEI” refers to programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion, a favored target of the right.)

The faculty lawsuit quotes Leo Terrell, an assistant attorney general for civil rights and a named defendant, telling Fox News, “The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists.” He said, “We’re gonna bankrupt these universities. We’re gonna take away every single dollar.” In an interview he said he had “targeted 10 schools. Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC... We’re going to take away [their] funding.”

The lawsuit positions the administration’s campaign against UCLA against its similar attacks on funding at Columbia, Brown and Harvard. It also points to the folly of trying to settle with Trump out of court.

Columbia was among the first universities to settle with Trump — it agreed in March to a $221-million payment and to give the government extraordinary oversight of its hiring, pedagogical and social policies in order to free up $400 million in blocked funding and restore access to billions of dollars in current and future federal grants.

But the capitulation didn’t yield those results. Instead, Trump blocked a further $1.2 billion in funding until Columbia agreed to additional demands in July.

As Judge Lin described the government campaign against UCLA and other universities launched by the White House, it starts when “one or more ... agencies open civil rights investigations into a university.... Before the investigations are concluded, Funding Agencies cancel large amounts of federal funding.” Then the Justice Department offers to settle with the targets “in exchange for further burdening faculty, staff, and student speech.”

It’s theoretically possible that the Trump administration could make its funding cutoffs stick if it follows the procedures enshrined in law for terminating federal grants (and it may yet prevail in appeals to the Supreme Court).

The rules require government agencies to issue a notice of possible violation and attempt to negotiate a settlement and hold a hearing, then file a report with the House and Senate specifying “the circumstances and grounds for such action” and wait at least 30 days more before canceling any funding. The cancellations can apply only to the specific program deemed to be violating the law.

The goal of these safeguards, Lin observed, is to protect grant recipients from “‘vindictive’ or ‘punitive’” actions by the government. In these cases, the government followed none of the mandated procedures.

The administration‘s defense, in part, is that the funding cutoffs are entirely within its discretion and can’t be reviewed by a judge, assertions Lin specifically rejected. The administration also stated that the August demand letter to UCLA was merely an “opening settlement offer” in ongoing “confidential settlement negotiations” with the university.

Given the findings from federal judges that Trump has flouted the legal safeguards against abrupt and arbitrary grant cancellations in favor of illicit bullying, the question facing universities trying to negotiate their way out is: What is there to negotiate? The record so far indicates that no settlement will fully satisfy Trump or his anti-woke warriors; only judges can bring the campaign to a halt.

It’s certainly true that in the short run, Trump’s targets will suffer great pain. He knows well that they’re vulnerable to blunt force. “With every day that passes,” Lin observed, “UCLA continues to be denied the chance to win new grants, ratcheting up [the government’s] pressure campaign.”

In the long run, however, there are limits to how much an educational institution can concede.

One is tempted to recall what Michael Corleone said in “The Godfather Part II” when he was being bullied by the corrupt Sen. Pat Geary into paying a bribe: “My offer is this,” he said. “Nothing.”

It may not be so easy for even powerful universities to take such an uncompromising stand. But it may be necessary.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9445cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5467x2870+0+387/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F30%2Fc53ffc51479997d7cffe333b97f7%2F1531023-me-ucla-file-images-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:57:20.105562

The education lawsuit is the administration’s third action against California in a week. On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sued in federal court to overturn the state’s ban on ski masks and other full face coverings worn by immigration agents and other law enforcement officers.

And on Nov. 13, she sued to overturn the new congressional district maps approved by voters with the passage of Prop. 50. That measure authorized state leaders to redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats, after Trump asked the state of Texas to redraw its maps to favor Republicans. The Texas effort was held up this week when a federal judge ruled that those maps were racially discriminatory.

“We will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law,” Bondi said in a news release late Thursday.

For its part, California has filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the Republican on numerous issues including its decision to take over the state’s National Guard and deploy troops to Los Angeles amid protests over federal immigration sweeps.

California has offered in-state tuition, loans and other help to immigrant students who graduate from high school in California and meet certain criteria since 2011, when passage of the California Dream Act and other supports were signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown.

Trump accused of calling for execution of Democratic lawmakers

Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that Donald Trump has been accused of calling for the “execution” of elected Democratic lawmakers following his comments on social media.

The president said the group has engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.

The video, released on Tuesday, features six Democratic lawmakers who have previously served in the military or in intelligence roles – senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and representatives Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow.

“Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution,” the lawmakers said in the 90-second video. “And right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here at home. Our laws are clear, you can refuse illegal orders, you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”

That seemed to prompt a furious response from the US president. On Thursday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.”

In another post, he wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.” In a third post, he added: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted a statement that said: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”

In response, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, condemned Trump’s remarks and posted on X: “Let’s be crystal clear: the President of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials.”

He added: “This is an outright THREAT. Every Senator, every Representative, every American – regardless of party – should condemn this immediately and without qualification.”

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, defended Trump’s claim that the Democrats had engaged in “sedition”, describing the video as “wildly inappropriate”, adding: “It is very dangerous, you have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders, I think that’s unprecedented in American history.”

Following Trump’s statements on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic whip Katherine Clark and Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement condemning the remarks.

“Political violence has no place in America,” they wrote. “Representatives Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan and Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin all served our country with tremendous patriotism and distinction. We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump’s disgusting and dangerous death threats against members of Congress, and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same.”

In other developments:

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will negotiate with Donald Trump on a US-backed peace plan that called on Kyiv to make painful concessions in order to end the Kremlin’s invasion of his country. Zelenskyy’s office on Thursday confirmed that he had received the draft peace plan, which was prepared by US and Russian officials, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days about “existing diplomatic opportunities and the main points that are necessary for peace”.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced new oil and gas drilling off California’s and Florida’s coasts, setting the stage for a political showdown – including with Sunshine state Republicans who have largely opposed petroleum development in the Gulf of Mexico. This announcement comes as the US petroleum industry, despite contending with low crude prices, has been pushing for an entree to additional offshore drilling areas.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has been changed to reflect the belief of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health and human services secretary, that there is a link between vaccines and autism, a view flatly contradicted by experts and scientifically validated studies. Public health and autism specialists roundly condemned the alteration to the CDC’s “vaccine safety” webpage, after it was changed to read: “The statement ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim.”

US district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former president Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying national guard troops to enforce the law in Washington DC without approval from its mayor. Cobb paused her ruling until 11 December to allow the Trump administration to appeal.

The justice department is investigating how two Trump allies handled the investigation into whether California senator, Adam Schiff, committed mortgage fraud, according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by the Guardian and a person familiar with the matter. The office of the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche is overseeing the inquiry, which appears to have developed as an offshoot of the main case into Schiff – a notable development since the justice department is essentially investigating activities of two close allies of the president.

Trump has assembled least diverse US government this century, study shows

David Smith

Donald Trump has assembled the least diverse US government of the 21st century, filling the corridors of power with white men at the expense of women and people of colour, research shows.

Nine in 10 individuals confirmed by the Senate in the first 300 days of the second Trump administration were white, according to the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.

The total percentage of women confirmed was just 16%, the lowest rate among the past four administrations, including during Trump’s first term (23%).

“For the Biden administration at the one-year point it was 50% male, 50% female, and right now in the Trump administration it’s 84% male, 16% female,” Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, director of the initiative on improving inter-branch relations and government, told the Guardian in an interview at Brookings on Wednesday.

“Probably that’s the starkest contrast. But even if you go all the way back to George W Bush in 2001, Trump’s confirmed nominees are whiter and less ethnically diverse and more male than his predecessors going back that far.”

Trump claims to have broad appeal, pointing to vocal groups such as Women for Trump and incremental gains among Latino and Black voters in last year’s presidential election. But his actions as president suggest that diversity as a hiring priority has been explicitly abandoned.

He has overwhelmingly favoured white men in his appointments while firing prominent African Americans such as Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, and Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress. He issued executive orders to curb diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the federal government and is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” from Smithsonian Institution museums.

Schumer calls for extension of Obamacare tax credits as healthcare talks stall on Capitol Hill

As both chambers of Congress prepare to head into Thanksgiving recess, after the government returned to work following a record-breaking shutdown, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, is reminding lawmakers that there’s been little headway on discussions to extend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year. Democrats were promised a vote on the extension of these subsidies, after a faction of the caucus voted with Republicans to pass a funding bill that didn’t contain any healthcare provisions – arguably the focal point of their negotiations.

“Americans are now about to fall off a healthcare cliff, and Donald Trump doesn’t even have a concept of a plan to fix it,” Schumer said. “We must extend the ACA premium tax credits NOW to lower healthcare costs for the American people.”

On the Hill, there have been alternative proposals to Obamacare subsidies, with the chair of the Senate health committee, Bill Cassidy, suggesting that the credits could be replaced with pre-paid health savings accounts. Some health policy experts have pushed pack, saying that while these would help with out-of-pocket costs, it wouldn’t help those ACA enrollees who can’t afford insurance premiums to begin with.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced new oil and gas drilling off California’s and Florida’s coasts, setting the stage for a political showdown – including with Sunshine state Republicans who have largely opposed petroleum development in the Gulf of Mexico.

This announcement comes as the US petroleum industry, despite contending with low crude prices, has been pushing for an entree to additional offshore drilling areas. The industry’s move for increased access also marks an effort to increase jobs and US energy independence, according to the Associated Press.

The federal government has prohibited offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which extends from Florida shores to portions of Alabama, since 1995. The ban stemmed from worries about potential oil spills.

While California does have some offshore oil development, there have not been new leases in federal waters for nearly 30 years, the AP said.

A proposed schedule for petroleum leasing in federal waters includes up to 34 auctions from 2026 to 2031; these auctions include up to six sales off California’s coastline, 21 off of Alaska’s coastline, and two in the Gulf of Mexico’s eastern portion, Politico said. The sales in Alaska would reportedly include a region that has never had oil drilling.

The move reflects Trump’s dogged efforts to roll back former president Joe Biden’s efforts against global heating. Trump has described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, and launched a National Energy Dominance Council to boost domestic energy production, with an emphasis on fossil fuels, AP noted.

Trump has simultaneously thwarted renewable energy development including offshore windfarms. His administration has also axed billions in green energy grants, the AP said.

California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe weighing a presidential run, rejected offshore drilling expansion, calling it “dead on arrival”.

Offshore oil development has faced bipartisan opposition in Florida, where unblemished beaches and sparkling waters underpin the state’s $131bn tourism industry.

The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda – president Donald Trump’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions, AP reports. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown.

Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top security official denied on Friday he had agreed to a Trump administration peace plan, and European leaders hastily sought a response to a draft that endorses most of Russia’s key wartime demands.

Washington has presented Kyiv with a 28-point plan that would require Kyiv to give up additional territory, scale back the size of its military and forever abandon hope of joining the Nato western military alliance.

Ukraine’s European allies said they had not been consulted over the plan and scheduled an urgent phone call to discuss the situation. Britain and Germany said their leaders would take part. Zelenskyy’s office did not say whether he would join in.

US officials said the plan was drafted after consultations with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council, a close Zelenskyy ally who served as defence minister until July.

“This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of president Zelenskyy’s administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to president Zelenskyy,” a senior US official said on Thursday.

But Umerov said on Friday he had not discussed the plan’s terms, much less approved them, according to a Reuters report.

The White House is preparing for possible turnover in the cabinet after president Donald Trump reaches the one-year mark of his term, potentially shaking up his otherwise stable team of secretaries, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple people familiar with the discussions.

At least one agency that could see a leadership change is the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported.

The Department of Energy, led by Chris Wright, a former Colorado fracking executive whose ties with the White House have reportedly frayed in recent months, may also be affected, the report added.

Trump to meet New York's Mamdani later today

President Donald Trump will meet with incoming New York mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday, the first in-person talks between political opposites who have clashed over everything from immigration to economic policy.

A democratic socialist and little-known state lawmaker who won New York’s mayoral race earlier this month, Mamdani requested the sit-down with Trump to discuss cost-of-living issues and public safety, Reuters reports.

The Republican president has threatened to strip federal funding from the biggest US city, while the mayor-elect has regularly criticized a range of Trump’s policies, including plans to ramp up federal immigration enforcement efforts in New York, where four in ten people are foreign-born.

The 79-year-old president, a former New York resident, has labeled Mamdani, 34, as a “radical left lunatic,” a communist and “Jew hater,” without offering evidence for those assertions.

Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on 1 January, said at a press conference on Thursday: “Being a New Yorker means that you’re prepared for all situations.”

The justice department is investigating how two Trump allies handled the investigation into whether California senator, Adam Schiff, committed mortgage fraud, according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by the Guardian and a person familiar with the matter. The office of the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche is overseeing the inquiry, which appears to have developed as an offshoot of the main case into Schiff – a notable development since the justice department is essentially investigating activities of two close allies of the president.

Hanne Daguman was arrested Monday at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office downtown after acknowledging she had overstayed her visa. Her husband, Joshua Daguman, said the interview seemed to be going well before three ICE officers entered the room.

""We went to our interview, we got called in, an hour and a half of questions, and it seems like we were doing great,"" Joshua Daguman said. ""When my wife signed on the iPad that she had an overstay, three officers came in with like bulletproof vests, with their badges. She gives me a card, says, 'scan this', We're gonna arrest your wife for an overstay on her visa.""

The couple has been married for over a year. They got married in Mission Bay, an area where they frequently spend time with friends and family. Hanne Daguman originally came to the U.S. on a student visa, then completed her year of temporary employment authorization, but that status had expired, making her what's called a visa overstay.

Hanne Daguman is now being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Her husband expressed particular concern about her medical care, as she is a Type 1 diabetic.

""You need your glucose. They took out her glucose monitoring system, so she doesn't know if she's low or high,"" Joshua Daguman said.

CoreCivic, which operates the detention center, said it cannot comment on specific medical records but stated that it is committed to providing access to high-quality medical and mental health care for those in custody, including those with diabetes. The company said three nutritious meals are provided daily, including meals that support specialized diets.

ICE told ABC 10News Monday that they are committed to enforcing federal immigration laws and said individuals unlawfully present in the U.S., including those out of status in places like USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal.

What the judge said,Carolyn Komatsoulis,,,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article312985121.html,"In a flurry of nearly identical orders Wednesday, Idaho’s Senior U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ordered the release of 15 immigrants picked up during the Wilder raid.
The immigrants who were in the U.S. had due-process rights, regardless of their citizenship status, according to court filings.
Only two judges among over 100 have sided with the government in federal cases challenging its expansion of mandatory detention, Winmill said in court filings.
Of the 15 whose cases came before Winmill, many had no criminal history, according to the court filings.
For two of the immigrants, Winmill listed past convictions: one for misdemeanor disturbing the peace and one for driving without privileges.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a mother of three U.S. citizens during the FBI and ICE raid at a Wilder racetrack, according to court filings.

The mother had lived in the U.S. for 21 years and had an active visa petition for permanent residence. A second arrested immigrant came to the U.S. last year and has a work permit and a pending asylum application, with a 2027 hearing on the docket.

They were both detained for a month in the Elmore County Detention Center after the Oct. 19 raid.

Now they’ve been released. In a flurry of nearly identical orders Wednesday, Idaho’s Senior U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ordered the release of 15 immigrants picked up during the Wilder raid.

In the past, immigrants already in the U.S. whom ICE detained would have been entitled to an immigration court hearing, according to Oregon immigration lawyer Casey Parsons. In the hearing, the government would try to show if they were a flight risk or a danger and whether they should remain locked up. The immigrants who were in the U.S. had due-process rights, regardless of their citizenship status, according to court filings.

But as part of the Trump administration’s hardening attitude towards immigrants, his administration has been pushing for mandatory detention for all immigrants who entered the U.S. without permission, Winmill said in court filings.

Only two judges among over 100 have sided with the government in federal cases challenging its expansion of mandatory detention, Winmill said in court filings. He said the constitutional right of due process applies to everyone within the U.S., not just citizens.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation – with more each day – have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention to noncitizens already residing here,” Winmill wrote in the 15 decisions, one for each detainee. DHS stands for the Department of Homeland Security. “This Court joins the overwhelming majority.”

Homeland Security says ‘activist judge’ frees ‘lawbreakers’

Winmill’s ruling drew condemnation from the Trump administration.

“Now, an activist judge is ordering lawbreakers to roam free,” a spokesperson for Homeland Security, which includes ICE, told the Idaho Statesman by email. “This is just yet another example of activist judges attempting to obstruct President Trump from delivering on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of illegal aliens.”

At the raid, hundreds of law enforcement officers disrupted the final horse race of the season, detaining and zip-tying attendees, including some children. Law enforcement arrested four people for alleged illegal gambling, with a fifth arrested the next day. Of those five, four have been released from detention.

ICE arrested 105 immigrants, although some were legally in the U.S. Human rights activists have criticized the raid, saying families were torn apart and the operation sparked fear in the community.

Of the 15 whose cases came before Winmill, many had no criminal history, according to the court filings. For two of the immigrants, Winmill listed past convictions: one for misdemeanor disturbing the peace and one for driving without privileges.

In every one of the 15 orders, Winmill said the government had shown no information that the immigrant was a danger or flight risk. Instead, he suggested ICE was bowing to President Donald Trump’s hardline tactics on immigration enforcement.

“Its only apparent interest in detaining Petitioner — which imposes additional fiscal and administrative burdens — is to fulfill an arrest quota of 3,000 immigration arrests per day set by the current administration,” Winmill wrote in multiple orders.

One of the immigrants picked up by agents at the Wilder FBI and ICE raid had been present in the U.S. for 35 years, according to court filings. He has two U.S. citizen children and a lawful permanent resident mother who suffered from an end-stage renal disease and who relied on her son, Winmill wrote.

His father had previously filed a visa petition for him in 1999 and he could yet become eligible for legal status, the judge wrote. It wasn’t clear from the order what happened, or didn’t, with the 1999 petition.

“This ruling is a major vindication of due process and the constitutional rights of people caught up in enforcement actions that sweep up more than just targeted suspects,” Parsons said in a news release. “The court recognized that detention without lawful justification violates fundamental liberties.”

The Homeland Security spokesperson said the administration would continue to “fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country.”

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown.
Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling.
The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.
“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration's emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump's order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration's “arguments are so flimsy,"" ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. ""But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2c7437cc-1d90-4eee-942a-cc717d2c92e7/wirestory_83f70d58636219c0ff98c7d765ab2b4d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-21 09:57:41.451310

Thus there could be challenges under the Human Rights Act – unless the legislation excludes those too – and claims before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
This is not the first time a government has sought to set legislative boundaries around the application of Article 8 in immigration cases.","Revoking the duty to support

The government proposes to replace the current duty to provide support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute with a discretion to do so. This discretion will be limited in various ways – for example, support will not be available to those who deliberately make themselves destitute, or who “break the law.”

Any discretionary power conferred on a public body must be exercised rationally and in accordance with the law. Thus decisions not to grant support will in principle be subject to judicial review (or possibly some specific form of appeal if the legislation creates one). “The law” here includes (unless the new legislation excludes it) the Human Rights Act 1998, which requires courts and decision makers to give effect to the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). There will thus be scope for legal challenges if claimants are denied support in circumstances which breach their Convention rights – for instance, where the effect is that they suffer hardship so extreme as to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment within Article 3 of the ECHR.

Article 3 is an absolute right – that is, it is not subject to balancing with other factors. So the right not to be tortured, or to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment, is not conditional on compliance with national law or other kinds of “good behaviour”. That aspect of the government’s proposals will therefore potentially be vulnerable to challenge.

Resuming removals to certain countries

The government has decided that refugee status should be temporary, and that individuals should be returned to their country of origin if there has been a regime change. That seems over-simplistic. The ECHR, the UN Refugee Convention and the international law principle of “non-refoulement” prevent a refugee from being removed to a territory where they would face serious harm or persecution.

Removal to a safe territory is permissible. But the mere fact that there has been a regime change in a previously unsafe country plainly does not automatically mean it is now safe. Compliance with the principle of “non-refoulement” will require case-by-case assessment of the situation in any particular country, and of the risks to any particular refugee.

Creating a new appeals body

The details here are thin. The government says the proposed new appeals body will be “independent” and “staffed by professionally trained adjudicators”. But it is not clear whether it will be a judicial body, that is, a court. The government’s document says that in Denmark decisions of the Refugee Appeals Board “are considered final and generally cannot be challenged in ordinary civil or administrative courts”, but does not say explicitly that it intends to replicate that model in the UK.

Decisions of public bodies (including lower tribunals) are generally subject to judicial supervision and review by the High Court. If the UK appeals body is not itself a court but an administrative body (however competently staffed), any attempt to oust judicial review of its decisions entirely will be highly controversial and viewed as undermining the rule of law. It is also likely to breach Article 6 of the ECHR, which confers a right “to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law” for the purposes of determining a person’s civil rights and obligations.

The same applies to the government’s proposal that certain claims which are “clearly without merit [will] move straight to removal without an appeal” if that means some categories of case will receive no judicial supervision at all. Thus there could be challenges under the Human Rights Act – unless the legislation excludes those too – and claims before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Article 8 of the ECHR

The government is concerned that Article 8 of the ECHR (which provides a right to respect for family and private life) is used too often as a ground to block removals. Article 8 is a qualified right which can be limited on certain public interest grounds. The government proposes to legislate to narrow its scope in three ways:

To strengthen the public interest test which decision makers and courts must apply in determining whether removal would breach Article 8.

To set out a narrower definition of who counts as a family member for the purposes of Article 8, to include “normally” only “immediate family members”.

To limit how and when Article 8 claims can be made.

This is not the first time a government has sought to set legislative boundaries around the application of Article 8 in immigration cases. The Immigration Act 2014 set out public interest factors which must be taken into account in such cases – for example, that “the maintenance of effective immigration controls” and “the deportation of foreign criminals” are in the public interest; as well as factors that should be given “little weight” – for example private life or relationships established at a time when a person is in the UK unlawfully. It is not clear how the proposals in the first bullet above will add to the measures introduced by the 2014 Act.

In any case, the further the government goes in trying to limit Article 8 rights in national law, the more likely it is that the legislation or decisions under it will be challenged under the Human Rights Act. In particular it might be argued that the legislation goes beyond what is permissible under the ECHR, for example that the public policy justification for it does not fall within one the permitted factors set out in Article 8 (namely national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others).

The UK courts will be bound to apply the new legislation and have no power to set aside an Act of Parliament, but under section 4 of the Human Rights Act they could make a declaration that the legislation is incompatible with the ECHR, and claimants whose claims have failed in the domestic courts could take their cases to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg court typically allows states a “margin of appreciation” in determining where the balance between different public interest factors should be struck in giving effect to qualified rights.

That court already takes a fairly narrow approach to some aspects of Article 8, for example the definition of family members, and has upheld provisions of the UK law (pursuant to the 2014 Act mentioned above) stating that the public interest in deporting certain foreign criminals could be overridden only in exceptional cases.

However in that judgment the Strasbourg court observed:

“where the domestic courts do not carefully examine the facts, apply the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and the Court’s case-law, and adequately balance the interests of the applicant against those of the general public, the Court remains empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8” .

So again the details of the proposed legislation will matter. The greater the restrictions it places on Article 8 rights, or on the ability of domestic courts to weigh the relevant factors, the greater the chance that the Strasbourg court will say it has gone too far.

Article 3 of the ECHR

The government is also concerned that the interpretation of Article 3 of the ECHR, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, has expanded over time. It correctly notes that Article 3 is an absolute right and so cannot be balanced against other public interest considerations (and see above on the duty to provide support).

It seems therefore that the government does not propose to legislate to try and alter the interpretation of Article 3 in domestic law (which would indeed be very challenging). Instead, it is “working with key partner countries” on the definition of “inhuman or degrading treatment”. Presumably the aim is to agree an amendment to the text of Article 3 or at least some form of interpretative statement.

He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars.
However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE.
“Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October.","A Northern Kentucky Republican is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies to enter federal agreements for immigration enforcement under a program that has rapidly expanded during the Trump administration.

Rep. TJ Roberts, of Burlington, presented the proposal during a Thursday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government. He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars.

However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE.

“I think this really gets down to being a local control issue for me,” said Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville. “Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best. They know where their resources need to be allocated.”

Roberts later said that his bill would be “a way to ensure greater senses of community policing, of allowing it to be done and administered by the local level.”

Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly could consider the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January.

Roberts called the agreements an “incredible opportunity to provide more resources to our law enforcement community, to promote public safety and to align us with the priorities of the federal government.” He added that local police officers would be “deputized for limited immigration enforcement,” such as during traffic stops when they have “reasonable suspicion” to further investigate the driver’s or passengers’ citizenship or immigration status.

Roberts acknowledged that while some Kentucky law enforcement agencies have entered ICE agreements, he believes “we do not have that in the areas that we need it at.”

According to ICE’s website, 22 law enforcement agencies within Kentucky have an active 287(g) program to date. The agencies include mostly county sheriffs’ departments but also some local jails and a local police department. All of the agreements were signed this year.

Roarx questioned what Roberts meant by not having the agreements “in the areas that need it most.” Roberts said his home region of Northern Kentucky, which has major highways, should have such agreements. He added that “it’s needed everywhere in Kentucky” and not just in the counties with current programs.

“Once they complete that 40 hours of training that is all online, that is paid for by the federal government, these officers are deputized by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Roberts said. “And they can only engage in this limited enforcement while under the supervision of the federal authorities in order to ensure that there is oversight, that there is accountability.”

If approved, Roberts’ proposal would direct the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement agencies to have a written agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The program is often referred to as the 287(g) Program.

Under such agreements, ICE can delegate “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions” to state and law enforcement officers, the federal agency’s website says.

ICE expanded the number of agreements by 641% after Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. However, immigrants and their advocates have argued that these agreements can lead to racial profiling and lack oversight.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October. An example of that is that ICE may reimburse an agency for “the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary.”

Roberts argued the agreements would bring in significant dollars to Kentucky law enforcement agencies. He added that he had been working with legislative liaisons for DHS and ICE on the legislation and it was “one of their top priorities.”

Committee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, emphasized that he viewed the agreements as “an opportunity to potentially utilize resources from the federal government to implement those into our local communities that we serve.”

Democratic lawmakers took issue with the proposal. Rep. Sarah Stalker, of Louisville, said she had “a lot of concern” about deputizing officers for a new jurisdiction, particularly when news reports across the country have highlighted what many see as cruelty and abuse during arrests and mass raids.

“I feel like this would simply exacerbate an issue that is already on its own out of control,” Stalker said.

Before the meeting, advocacy group Kentucky Citizens for Democracy expressed concerns about Roberts’ proposal and encouraged lawmakers to reject the legislation.

“This proposal, which strips local governments of the ability to decide their own level of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, is fundamentally unacceptable,” the group said in a statement. “Our cities and counties know their communities best. Forcing them into mandatory cooperation with ICE, given its long history of egregious and cruel actions, violence, and overly aggressive tactics, will deepen fear, break trust, and push our immigrant neighbors further into the shadows.”

The man had apparently dropped off a child at Hoover Elementary School or a nearby preschool or childcare campus when he was spooked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to Councilmember Carroll Fife.

The man drove off with agents in pursuit and soon allegedly crashed into a car parked near the intersection of 31st and West streets, just a few blocks away, Oakland police confirmed Thursday.

""So this high-speed chase in a residential neighborhood led to this grandfather, um, who was just deeply afraid, hitting a parked car, which totaled the car of a young mother, a pregnant young mother who now does not have access to a car,"" Fife said in a social media post.

""This type of activity could have led to not only a detention of a person who was just dropping a child off at school but also it could have led to serious injury or death,"" Fife said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that ICE agents weren't targeting Hoover Elementary and didn't go on school grounds, but were in the area looking for a specific person with ""multiple arrests"" in California and Nevada.

The man agents were chasing fled on foot following the crash and remains at large, according to DHS officials.

Fife said several people who live in the area came out to help the man and the ICE agents eventually left the area.

""They didn't stay to address the harm that they caused in this neighborhood, they didn't take accountability,"" Fife said.

Both Fife and an OPD spokesperson said ICE didn't inform local police about their activities Wednesday.

""This is what happens when federal agencies operate with no oversight and no guardrails, no accountability,"" Fife said.

Administrators at Hoover Elementary and the nearby Harriet Tubman Preschool initiated their ""secure school protocol"" sometime between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. following reports that ICE agents were in the area.

He was detained by ICE for 73 days, and now shares his experience.

Soliman has been in the U.S. since 2014 fleeing persecution from the Egyptian government, where Ayman was detained and tortured for his work as a journalist. In 2018 he was granted asylum in the U.S.

However, his asylum was revoked in June and he was asked to meet with ICE officials on July 9. At the check-in, Ayman was detained by ICE and sent to Butler County Jail in Hamilton, Ohio.

Although the Trump administration contends that ICE is focused on detaining and deporting hardened criminals, Ayman disagrees.

“I don’t think these are the worst of the worst. This is just a statement that they made to convince the American public that these people deserve to be deported and to cover their racist reasons behind the deportation.”

With increased ICE raids, many U.S. citizens also have been swept up and detained. You’ll hear from Washington, D.C., Bureau reporter Ariana Figueroa, who has reported about this development.

Prosecutors said Border Patrol agent Charles Exum shot Martinez in self-defense after she and Santos Ruiz allegedly rammed their cars into a federal vehicle on Oct. 4.
“After striking the agents’ vehicle, the defendants’ vehicles boxed in the agents’ vehicle, the complaint states,” prosecutors said in a statement when charges were announced last month.
Martinez’s case was a high-profile example cited by DHS that had led to federal charges.
At the time, the agency said Border Patrol officers had been “ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.” A court hearing is set for Thursday afternoon.","Federal prosecutors moved Thursday to dismiss charges against Marimar Martinez, a woman who was shot by a Border Patrol agent multiple times after allegedly using her car to assault and impede federal law enforcement six weeks ago in Chicago.

Martinez and co-defendant Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz pleaded not guilty last month to Justice Department charges that they used “their vehicles to assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.”

Andrew S. Boutros, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, filed court documents Thursday morning to dismiss the charges.

Prosecutors said Border Patrol agent Charles Exum shot Martinez in self-defense after she and Santos Ruiz allegedly rammed their cars into a federal vehicle on Oct. 4.

“After striking the agents’ vehicle, the defendants’ vehicles boxed in the agents’ vehicle, the complaint states,” prosecutors said in a statement when charges were announced last month. “The agent was unable to move his vehicle and exited the car, at which point he fired approximately five shots from his service weapon at Martinez, the complaint states.”

Martinez’s legal team had argued that it was federal agents who rammed her car with their vehicle and that the shooting was unjustified and an excessive use of force.

The motion to dismiss comes after it was revealed last week at a court hearing that the Customs and Border Protection agent who shot Martinez multiple times had bragged about it in messages to other officers.

According to Reuters, records presented at the hearing showed that in a group Signal chat with other agents, Exum wrote: “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”

In a message to another recipient, Exum sent a news article about the event followed by the message: “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Reuters reported.

Christopher Parente, an attorney for Martinez, asked the agent what he meant by those messages. According to records presented earlier this month at a hearing against her, Exum responded: “I’m a firearms instructor and I take pride in my shooting skills.”

The Department of Homeland Security referred questions about charges in the case Thursday to the Justice Department.

The agency also shared a statement with its description of the alleged incident involving Martinez and Santos Ruiz, saying, “Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.”

The statement said Martinez “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxing federal agents.”

The complaint against Martinez did not mention or include charges related to a firearm.

Parente has said in court and to Reuters that Martinez is a licensed gun owner with a permit for concealed carry in Illinois and that her firearm remained stored in her purse throughout the incident.

“This gun was never in her hand,” Parente said.

Parente and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the motion to dismiss.

DHS said this week that incidents in which civilians have allegedly used their cars to strike federal agents or their vehicles have greatly increased.

Martinez’s case was a high-profile example cited by DHS that had led to federal charges. At the time, the agency said Border Patrol officers had been “ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.”

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.
The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.
NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.” “Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.
Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.","WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as “federal public benefits,"" which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify.

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a “ whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump's broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”

The final regulation is expected to apply beginning in tax year 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that “we are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.” Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said.

Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said since people without work authorization already don’t qualify for these refundable tax credits, “the folks who are really going to be impacted are people who are really trying to do the right thing, the people authorized to work and paying their taxes.”

He said he believed the administration was trying to make the lives of taxpaying immigrants more difficult.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.”

“Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.

Davis said there probably wouldn't be majority support for the move in Congress, which he said probably prompted the administration to act unilaterally on the issue instead.

“The American people are broadly sympathetic to the Dreamers and DACA recipients. Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.

North Carolina man sentenced after threatening to kill ICE agents

A North Carolina man threatened to kill Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and Charlotte officers if immigration enforcement actions did not stop.Johnathan Trent Thomas, 27, of Linwood, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to making threats to murder federal officers to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the performance of their official duties, according to Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.According to filed court documents and court proceedings, on May 14, a caller, later identified as Thomas, contacted the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) and threatened to kill ICE and officers.During a second telephone call with a CMPD officer, Thomas warned that he was coming to Charlotte with armor-piercing ammunition, night-vision devices, and body armor to kill law enforcement officers and threatened to “shoot them all” if he observed anyone making arrests. Thomas was referencing arrests made previously by ICE federal agents on Albemarle Road in Charlotte.Court documents show that Thomas stated that if a police officer pointed a gun at him, he was just going to open fire. He also said that he would “Swiss cheese” the officers if they were doing the same thing they did before, meaning making arrests. Thomas made additional threats to law enforcement, including that he had Tannerite (an explosive) all around his house if the police came, and referenced April 29, 2024, which is the date that four law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in Charlotte, warning that he “could do a whole lot better than that.”Law enforcement executed a search warrant at Thomas’s residence, seizing three rifles, a handgun, and a variety of ammunition.According to court records, Thomas has an extensive history of threatening law enforcement, to include the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office and CMPD, and had previously followed CMPD officers in marked patrol cars while they were performing their official duties.Thomas pleaded guilty to one count of threatening to murder federal law enforcement officers, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Thomas remains in federal custody.A sentencing date has not been set.

Why it matters: Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said Thursday morning that federal officials told him ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" was over. But just hours later, U.S. Customs and Border Protection sent a contradictory message — prompting citywide confusion and uncertainty.

""The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

A sheriff's office spokesperson told Axios they're standing by the statement because that's what they were told.

ABC News reported earlier this week that agents were supposed to move out on Friday, citing ""preliminary information from federal authorities.""

ICE, a separate agency from CBP, can also continue to have a presence and take people into custody in Charlotte, as it's been doing amid Trump's heightened arrest quota.

Catch up quick: In its latest update, DHS reported around 370 arrests in five days, though it's only released a sample of names.

CBP agents were also spotted this week in Raleigh and Durham.

A family in Franklin Park spent the afternoon fixing the front door which federal agents knocked down Thursday morning while executing an arrest warrant for a man in his 60s. The family says that man and his wife were both taken into DHS custody for allegedly living in the country illegally.

The granddaughter of those two people was in the house as federal agents rushed in.

""It was very scary because even with the speaker they kept repeating his name that they had a warrant for his arrest it was really terrifying,"" she said.

The woman says she was raised by her grandparents and often helped them with their jobs in the area.

The family says the man who was detained had already been deported about six years ago and then returned to the country, but his wife has been in the country for decades and allegedly has a workers permit in the U.S. They say they understand the realities of this immigration process, but are now figuring out how to move forward.

""It's gonna be hard because now we need to take care of them and his job and the house and everything so it's gonna be hard,"" said Jesus Cano, whose brother-in-law was detained.

Carla Espinoza and Samuel Cole were longtime immigration judges in Chicago. After President Donald Trump took office, Espinoza says she was fired without cause.

""I would say it takes about six months to a year to feel comfortable being a judge and adjudicating cases fairly and efficiently,"" she said.

Espinoza is now an immigration attorney. Cole is now Chief Immigration Litigation Counsel at ACLU of Illinois after choosing to retire early, fearing his ability to rule impartially was under attack.

""I saw at the beginning of this new administration that I would no longer be able to make independent decisions,"" Cole said.

Now that question of impartiality and due process has resurfaced again in their replacements. The Department of Defense just issued a legal opinion allowing any military attorney to become an immigration judge.

""Before this administration, you needed seven years of experience in immigration law or administrative law. We certainly respect their service to the nation, but they're not qualified to do these jobs,"" said Matthew Biggs, President of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration judges.

He said these temporary replacements now filling dozens of vacancies made by Trump administration firings may have no immigration law experience and only one or two weeks of training before they take the bench to rule on cases.

Espinoza is concerned immigrants before the court will be stripped of due process.

""To have one week or two weeks of training without prior knowledge in immigration law, to me, just seems absurd,"" she said.

Cole is echoing that fear. Both said they have seen the current administration pressure judges to rule in the government's favor.

And with temporary active military judges, Cole believes they could face retribution if they rule impartially.

""I think they would have to worry about if they make certain decisions that goes against what this administration might want them to do, they'd have to worry about their job security, not just as a temporary immigration judge, but in the military as well,"" he said.

In other words, although the new law reinforces the narrative that irregular migration constitutes a direct threat to national security, the evidence points to the contrary.
Therefore, the question is not whether Ecuador should reform its migration policy, but how to do so.
A similar approach would allow Ecuador to transform its current situation into an opportunity: moving from a reactive, control-focused policy to a strategy that combines security, integration, and sustainable development.
This dispersion has made it difficult to translate evidence into concrete decisions and align migration policy with national security and development priorities.","The President of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, recently signed into law a reform of the Organic Law on Human Mobility (LOMH) that imposes stricter immigration controls and seeks to speed deportations. This measure represents a first step in responding to the country’s rising violence and restoring social cohesion. However, it should not be the end of the discussion on how to guarantee security and strengthen Ecuador's social fabric.

While the reform seeks to strengthen national security, it appears to have misidentified the causes of the violence affecting Ecuador. By focusing its attention on the immigrant population as one of the main sources of insecurity, the government may be diverting institutional resources and fueling a narrative that does not solve the country’s underlying problem.

Ecuador is experiencing a deep and sustained security crisis. The homicide rate rose from 13.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2021 to almost 43 per 100,000 in 2023, a sharp increase that has transformed daily life, altered communities' relationship with public spaces, and generated an urgent demand for state responses.

During the same period, the Venezuelan population in the country increased from 72,000 in 2018 to more than 440,000 today—now representing close to 2.5 percent of the national population.

It is not surprising that some have linked the two phenomena. But the fact that two events occur simultaneously does not imply that one causes the other. This distinction between correlation and causation is essential to ensure the promotion and implementation of effective public policies. The available evidence shows that violence in Ecuador is a response to the expansion of illicit economies, territorial disputes between criminal groups, and institutional fragmentation—not the arrival of migrants.

A recent study by economist Dany Bahar at the Center for Global Development (CGD) shows that in 2024, just 1.3 percent of all arrests in Ecuador were of Venezuelan nationals, about half their share of the total population. Between 2019 and 2025, the proportion of arrests among the Venezuelan population remained stable—between 1 percent and 1.5 percent—even as Ecuador’s violence and homicide rates tripled. Furthermore, when a Venezuelan migrant is apprehended, formal detention occurs in just 10 to 15 percent of cases, compared to 35 to 40 percent in the case of Ecuadorian nationals. These data show that linking migration with crime is not supported by reality.

More than 40 percent of court cases involving Venezuelans relate to property crimes, generally linked to subsistence economies and vulnerability resulting from irregular migration. Involvement of Venezuelan migrants in homicides, kidnappings, or organized crime is minimal and shows no upward trend. In other words, although the new law reinforces the narrative that irregular migration constitutes a direct threat to national security, the evidence points to the contrary.

The new provisions—which seek to accelerate deportations, require criminal background checks, and tighten residency requirements—could divert institutional capacities and resources that the state needs to address the real causes of violence.

Focusing the debate on immigration controls may exacerbate the exclusion of a population that already lives in precarious conditions, without full access to education, formal employment, or health services. This marginalization not only violates rights but also weakens social cohesion and deprives the country of the talent and productivity of thousands of newcomers.

This is where the Noboa administration has an opportunity: not to declare the task complete after the enactment of the LOMH, but to promote an integration agenda that contributes to the security and development of the country.

The Need for a Phase Two

For security measures to be sustainable over time, Ecuador will need to move toward a second phase of its migration policy, one focused on integration. This means recognizing that a large part of the migrant population will remain in the country and that their social and economic inclusion is essential for national stability. A key element of this second-stage agenda would be the implementation of a regularization program that allows for the full integration of Venezuelan immigrants—benefiting not only those who migrate, but Ecuadorian society overall.

To be clear, regularization does not eliminate crime. No policy does that on its own. But it reduces the social base on which organized crime thrives, and that is precisely an effective security measure. Therefore, the question is not whether Ecuador should reform its migration policy, but how to do so. Now that the LOMH reform has been approved, the implementation stage comes next. Implementation based on the mistaken premise that migration is a threat would end up acting on a correlation that does not reflect reality.

Externally, the reform of the Organic Law on Human Mobility reveals a paradox: while Ecuador seeks to strengthen its defense and intelligence cooperation with the United States, its migration narrative aligned with Washington's rhetoric of control is not in sync with the underlying interests that guide its hemispheric policy. Ecuador is providing fewer resources to support regularization, integration, and voluntary return. In practice, this leaves the country with limited tools to manage the downstream effects of U.S. policies, especially if the large-scale deportations pledged by the Trump administration materialize.

By narrowing its focus to control and enforcement, Ecuador adopts the language of Washington without becoming the strategic partner the United States actually needs. For the U.S. government, reliable allies in the region are those capable of receiving deportees and returnees, advancing regularization and integration efforts, and offering alternatives to irregular movement. Without investments in these capacities, Ecuador risks heightened pressure on already strained systems, rising anxiety in skeptical communities, and the potential for social tension—particularly in a context where security concerns already dominate the national debate. A more balanced approach to migration governance could not only help Ecuador mitigate these risks but also open doors to support from the United States and international donors for sustainable reintegration and even broader priorities such as security and conflict stabilization.

Furthermore, human mobility in Ecuador is not limited to entry. In recent years, more than half a million Ecuadorians have left the country, many following irregular routes northward, often in mixed households with Venezuelans or other nationalities. Rising deportations from the United States and Mexico could generate new waves of return and mixed transit that the country will need to manage urgently. An integration and reintegration agenda in Ecuador would not only be more consistent with Washington's interests but would respond to the country’s own migration governance needs.

Regional evidence shows that this approach can translate into greater security, stability, and development. In Colombia, between 2018 and 2022, large-scale regularization programs attracted international cooperation—mainly from the United States—and contributed to modernizing health, education, and rural productivity systems, strengthening sectors such as coffee production and horticulture. In Chile and Peru, labor integration policies and temporary permits for Venezuelan migrants helped reduce informality and social tension. A similar approach would allow Ecuador to transform its current situation into an opportunity: moving from a reactive, control-focused policy to a strategy that combines security, integration, and sustainable development.

For this reason, the human mobility agenda must become a catalyst for the National Development Plan, and its focus on productive transformation, territorial development, and the strengthening of social protection systems. A policy that combines integration, diaspora engagement, the retention and development of talent, and labor mobility can translate into a real productive boost. Integration—through regularization, a focus on reducing employment informality, and improved access to services—broadens the tax base, strengthens health and education systems, and stimulates investment and consumption. At the same time, links with the diaspora and the attraction of foreign talent expand capabilities and innovation, while remittances and labor mobility generate new flows of income and cooperation. Remittances alone now account for more than 6 percent of Ecuador’s GDP—more than traditional sectors such as bananas or cocoa—and their potential can be expanded if the country manages to connect this agenda with its vision of productive and territorial development.

Transforming the Migration Management Architecture

The current institutional architecture for migration management in Ecuador remains fragmented. Responsibilities are distributed among different ministries and levels of government without a clear coordination mechanism or common public messaging. This dispersion has made it difficult to translate evidence into concrete decisions and align migration policy with national security and development priorities.

Therefore, Ecuador should consider institutional adjustments that strengthen coordination at a strategic level—close to the presidency—to articulate efforts, unify discourse, and improve communication with the public, civil society, and the private sector. This is not a matter of taking away powers from existing institutions, but rather of organizing and strengthening their work under a single vision.

What comes next will be crucial. This second phase—which should go beyond the regulation and implementation of the new law and seek to move toward long-needed integration solutions—will determine whether Ecuador succeeds in turning a reactive reform into a modern and sustainable migration policy.

If anchored in evidence, dialogue, and a long-term vision, the new law can be a starting point for a model that sees migration not as a threat but as an opportunity. Its success will depend on political leadership, messaging clarity, and the support of the private sector and civil society, which can be key allies in achieving labor market integration and social cohesion.

A mobility policy that recognizes the economic and social contributions of those who migrate—as well as those who return—and the potential of the diaspora and the foreign talent that Ecuador can attract, can strengthen the social fabric, boost the economy, and contribute to the country's stability.

Martinez's attorney said federal prosecutors did the right thing by dropping the charges.
Parente said prosecutors' agreement to drop charges against Martinez is only the first step in getting her justice.
Meantime, federal prosecutors on Thursday also dismissed charges against 70-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran Dana Briggs, who was arrested in September during protests in Broadview.
He was accused of making contact with a federal agent while handing his cell phone to another protester as he was taken into custody for ignoring orders to clear the street.","Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against a woman who was shot by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood last month.

At a brief hearing at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis dismissed the indictment against 30-year-old Marimar Martinez and her co-defendant, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, granting federal prosecutors' motion to drop the case. The charges were dismissed with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot refile them in the future.

In a statement on the decision to dismiss the charges, U.S. Attorney's office spokesman Joseph Fitzpatrick said in a statement that federal prosecutors are ""constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.""

""This continuous review process applies to all matters—whether charged or under investigation. It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system,"" he added.

Federal prosecutors have said the pair were part of a group of vehicles that ""boxed in"" federal immigration agents near Kedzie Avenue and Pershing Road on Oct. 4, before Martinez and Ruiz allegedly rammed one agent's vehicle. The Justice Department has said agents got out and fired five shots at Martinez, who was still inside her car at the time.

Martinez's attorney said federal prosecutors did the right thing by dropping the charges.

""These agents were lying about what happened. Ms. Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Ms. Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Ms. Martinez, a U.S. citizen, whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood,"" attorney Christopher Parente said. ""That is not a crime. She didn't deserve to be shot.""

Martinez thanked the judge, her attorneys, her family, and others for their support as she fought the charges against her.

""I'm just happy. I'm excited,"" she said.

Parente said prosecutors' agreement to drop charges against Martinez is only the first step in getting her justice. While he did not say what the next step would be, he said Martinez' vehicle is now part of an investigation with a separate U.S. Attorney's office – not involving Martinez herself – and he said he's confident the agent who shot her will ultimately be held responsible for wrongly shooting her.

""He's going to pay for those shots. They were not good shots. You will see, eventually, that that was a bad shoot. It was a violation of CBP's use of force policy, and he is going to pay for those shots, and he is not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago,"" Parente said.

In a court filing, her attorneys pointed to body camera video they said shows the agent turned his wheel and caused the crash before he jumped out of the car and started shooting.

That video has not been made public.

Parente also has rgued that crucial evidence was tampered with when federal authorities allowed the agent to drive his car back to Maine after the shooting, rather than holding it as evidence.

Meantime, federal prosecutors on Thursday also dismissed charges against 70-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran Dana Briggs, who was arrested in September during protests in Broadview.

A recent poll by conservative news outlet Carolina Journal found that Trump’s approval rating is falling in North Carolina.","Sen. Thom Tillis called for oversight of the use of the U.S. Border Patrol in Charlotte during a Senate hearing Thursday.

Border Patrol agents began appearing throughout Charlotte Saturday near places like grocery stores, schools and churches, rounding up Hispanic residents, often forcefully, and with little information about what happens next to the people detained.

The agents have since expanded throughout North Carolina, to other cities including Raleigh, Winston-Salem and Hickory.

“I want to make sure that Homeland Security can provide me with the definitive list of people who were detained, how long they were detained, whether or not they were released and, when property was damaged, whether or not they’ve been provided proper restitution,” Tillis said, in the hearing. “We’re the party of law and order, and I want to make sure that we’re also orderly in the process of enforcing it.”

Tillis’ staff said his office has formally asked for this information from the Department of Homeland Security.

Many of Tillis’ Republican colleagues have celebrated the Border Patrol’s presence in North Carolina as part of what it calls Operation Charlotte’s Web.

“I’m very proud of what these men and women are doing to keep our border secure and remove dangerous folks from our community and other communities around the country,” said Rep. Tim Moore, a Republican from Kings Mountain, in an interview on Queen City News.

Rep. Pat Harrigan, a Republican from Hickory, also lent his support to the Border Patrol in several interviews throughout the week.

“What I think that people do not realize is that sanctuary cities are not protecting immigrants,” Harrigan said in an interview with Real America’s Voice. “They are protecting criminals. That is a key distinction that we’ve got to understand, because when you partner these sanctuary cities with ultra-liberal policies that allow judges and magistrates to simply release people back out to the community, when they do not force consequences for criminal conduct, you end up having mayhem and chaos in your city, and we’ve got to get back over the hurdle and make Charlotte safe again.”

Last year, Charlotte had about 12 homicides per 100,000 people, compared to Washington’s 27.3 per 100,000 people, The Charlotte Observer previously reported.

But Charlotte drew national attention in September after video was publicly released of the August stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, by a man with 14 previous arrests, who was out of jail on bail on a charge of misusing the 911 system. He was native to the United States.

That led to calls from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance, for Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to ask for help from the National Guard.

Last month, Tillis told Attorney General Pam Bondi that calling in the National Guard could mask “an abject failure” by state and local leaders and that he didn’t believe North Carolina needed the help.

“If I thought that I needed the president to deploy troops to keep North Carolina safe, I would have considered myself a failure as a state leader,” Tillis said, drawing from his experience as the state’s previous House speaker.

Why is Border Patrol in Charlotte? Tillis points to sheriff

Tillis lives in Huntersville, 20 minutes from Charlotte.

On Thursday, he said during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary that he believes Border Patrol is now in his state because Sheriff Garry McFadden used “sanctuary city policy.”

“There have been people released,” Tillis said. “There have been bad outcomes. So a part of the reason that we’re here is because of those bad decisions.”

Tillis didn’t get into further details, and was interrupted for unrelated votes when the committee reached a quorum as he spoke.

Sanctuary cities are banned under state law, and North Carolina lawmakers recently passed a bill that requires sheriffs to comply with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

McFadden has argued for years that holding defendants at the request of ICE after they have posted bond and complied with court-ordered terms of release is unconstitutional.

Charlotte is considered, by the nonprofit Welcoming America, “a Certified Welcoming City.” This distinction means it’s known for policies and programs surrounding immigrant inclusion, The Charlotte Observer previously reported.

That doesn’t keep the sheriff from cooperating with ICE.

Despite that, Trump deemed it a sanctuary city.

Trump has benefited from the support of North Carolinians. The purple state has elected Trump to the White House in the past three elections, despite simultaneously electing Democratic governors. A recent poll by conservative news outlet Carolina Journal found that Trump’s approval rating is falling in North Carolina.

Tuition for out-of-state students at the University of California and the California State University is roughly three times as much as that for state residents.
The Justice Department says that the California laws that allow immigrants without legal status in-state tuition benefits are preempted by federal law and should be blocked.
The department lists California Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, the Regents of the University of California, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges as defendants.
Additionally, the Justice Department is asking for a court order stopping California from enforcing its so-called “California Dream Act,” which affords scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants who don’t have legal authority to live in the country.","(CN) — The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday sued California over a state law provision that allows immigrant college students without permanent legal status to pay in-state tuition that isn’t available for out-of-state students.

Federal law, according to the Justice Department in its complaint filed in Sacramento, makes individuals who are unlawfully present in the U.S. ineligible for postsecondary education benefits based on state residency unless those same benefits are offered to all U.S. citizens, regardless of their state of residence.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.""

Tuition for out-of-state students at the University of California and the California State University is roughly three times as much as that for state residents. Both university systems, as well as California’s community colleges, allow that students who live in the state without legal immigration status can qualify as California residents if they meet certain criteria as stipulated by state law.

These students are also eligible for scholarships and subsidized loans that aren’t available to out-of-state U.S. citizens, according to the Justice Department.

The lawsuit adds to barrage of litigation between the Trump administration and the left-leaning state — including challenges to California’s policy of allowing transgender students to participate on female college and high-school sports teams and California’s recent redrawing of its electoral map to benefit Democrats, as well as lawsuits over federal funding cuts at universities that don’t adhere to the president’s political agenda.

The Justice Department says that the California laws that allow immigrants without legal status in-state tuition benefits are preempted by federal law and should be blocked. The department lists California Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, the Regents of the University of California, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges as defendants.

Additionally, the Justice Department is asking for a court order stopping California from enforcing its so-called “California Dream Act,” which affords scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants who don’t have legal authority to live in the country.

The lawsuit is prompted by two of President Donald Trump’s executive orders that seek to ensure such immigrants aren’t obtaining taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment, the Justice Department said.

One of these executive orders that Trump signed Feb. 19, entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,” requires that federal agencies ensure that no taxpayer-funded benefits go to “unqualified aliens.” The other, “Protecting American Communities From Criminal Aliens,” calls for an end to of state and local laws and policies that favor immigrants over U.S. citizens.

“These orders emphasize that federal and state governments must not grant greater benefits to individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States than to American citizens,” the Justice Department said in the complaint. ‘They also reflect Congress’s intent—expressed in multiple provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act — to reduce incentives for illegal immigration by limiting access to certain public benefits.""

Leandro Fossá, the pastor, on a cold late October Sunday afternoon.

The conversations here have changed in recent weeks. Where they once centered on baptisms, quinceañeras and parish parties, they now turn to immigration checks, missing relatives and how to prepare legal papers in case of deportation.

For many in this working-class suburb, the death of Silverio Villegas González marked a turning point. Villegas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant father of two, was fatally shot by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 after a traffic stop that ended with his car pinned under a truck.

For people in Melrose Park's Mexican community, his death made real a fear that had already been spreading quietly.

'If we shut down, then people will have nowhere to go to meet the Lord and to find courage.'

—Scalabrinian Fr. Leandro Fossá

One of the women in the parish office on Oct. 26, who asked not to be named, was Villegas' girlfriend. In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter she said she met Villegas as a child in Michoacán and they found each other again years later in Chicago. ""We built a life together,"" she said. ""He worked; he took care of us. He was a good person.""

Recalling the morning she learned Villegas had been shot, she said: ""He didn't answer my call. I saw the videos on social media and I knew it was him. I still can't believe it.""

Her 13-year-old daughter, who sat beside her, said Villegas treated her as his own daughter. ""He always asked if we were OK, if we needed anything. When I graduate, I'll keep his promises.""

The days following Villegas' death, Our Lady of Mount Carmel parish hosted a novena prayer and a memorial Mass for him; Chicago Auxiliary Bishop José María Garcia-Maldonado presided.

Villegas' girlfriend said she no longer feels safe leaving home.

The women who spoke to NCR asked to remain anonymous to protect their identities and ensure confidentiality.

""I used to go to work or church safely. Now I'm afraid every time I go out,"" the girlfriend said. ""The parish has been helping us with food and prayers.""

Next to her was a parish volunteer, another undocumented woman who helps coordinate outreach and translation. She's been in the U.S. for about 30 years working different jobs and now spends much of her time connecting families to resources.

""This situation took me out of my comfort zone,"" she said. ""Before this, I was doing the things I liked to do and basically just working. This country gave me great opportunities, even if I've been undocumented.""

She helps lead ""Know Your Rights"" workshops, where immigrants learn how to respond if approached by immigration officers. ""I remind people they have the right to remain silent, to ask for a lawyer. Even if you're undocumented, you still have rights,"" she said.

Living in quiet vigilance

Another mother, also undocumented, said she came to the U.S. in 2004, 18, alone and pregnant, hoping for a life that felt steadier than the one she left in Mexico. In the 21 years since, she has worked wherever she could — a printing factory first, then cleaning apartments and houses, later babysitting. Church became her anchor. It was the place, she said, that helped her face the harder parts of her life.

Two years ago, she confronted another kind of fear when she reported that her stepfather's father had abused her daughter. The man was eventually deported.

Today, she said many neighbors no longer attend Mass or send their children to school. Even simple errands feel dangerous.

Her own family lives in a kind of quiet vigilance. Her husband is a legal resident, her daughters are citizens, but she is not. She is in the process of applying for a green card, a step that brings both hope and anxiety.

In late October, that fear became real. Two of her brothers were detained at a Home Depot while buying materials for work. ICE trucks boxed them in, she said, and agents ordered them out of their vehicle. Later, a stranger called her cousin to say he had found the truck still running in the parking lot. He turned it off, hid the keys, and waited until the family could collect it.

Her brothers were transferred to a detention center in Texas, she said. Since then, calls have been brief and uncertain. Their wives cry most days, she said. The children ask when their fathers will come home. She tries to keep her voice steady when she talks about them, but her words tighten.

""They are not criminals, only men who went to work that morning,"" she said, crying.

Her 20-year-old daughter was born in the U.S. and works at a clothing store. After work, she joins the parish's young adult group, a circle of first-generation Americans who gather to pray and talk about the most recent news.

The daughter knows that citizenship doesn't shield her from worry. Her family's future still feels uncertain, and each sighting of an ICE vehicle brings anxiety, she said.

""I haven't encountered ICE directly, but there was one day where on my way to work I saw them two lanes next to me,"" she said. ""My body felt heavy, it was like this weird feeling. Because I thought, if my mom was in my position right now what would've happened?""

""She could've gotten nervous and scared and then next thing you know ICE could get suspicious and pull her over.""

When her uncles were detained in October, she received the call before her shift. She went to work anyway, trying to focus on customers while her thoughts circled back to her family. Prayer became her only refuge, she said.

The only place that feels safe

When Fossá talks about his parish, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, he describes it as a community determined to resist fear. ""We decided from day one not to shut down any ministry, because we do not live in fear — we have faith,"" he told NCR.

""If we shut down, then people will have nowhere to go to meet the Lord and to find courage.""

That conviction has kept his parish alive and full, even as immigration raids and political tensions have reshaped the lives of the overwhelming majority of his parishioners. ""We have more people attending our ministries and we have weekends with even more people in church,"" he said.

""We have created opportunities for people to come to Holy Hour and pray for migrants and refugees, to pray for Donald Trump, to pray for ICE, to pray for reconciliation.""

""Some are coming to church because they feel that this is the only place where they could go and feel safe,"" Fossá said. ""We did not stop it, because they feel that here they could come and participate and they feel that ICE will not take their peace away.""

Beyond the liturgy, the parish's mission has taken on an urgent, concrete form. In recent weeks, the church hall has transformed into a hub of quiet resistance, where folding tables are stacked with legal papers instead of potluck dishes. Fossá said the parish recently assisted more than 300 families, working with lawyers and notaries to ensure their property and guardianship rights are protected.

The goal is vital: If a parent is detained by immigration authorities, their assets remain safe and they have a plan for who will care for their children. In a time when uncertainty shadows even daily routines, the parish has become one of the few places where families can prepare, pray and breathe freely.

This blend of prayer and protection captures the essence of the Scalabrinian mission, said Scalabrinian Fr. Giovanni Bizzotto, who is superior provincial of the order's Province of West North American and Central America.

Bizzotto, who oversees 19 parishes and migrant shelters in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, said that USAID cuts have left humanitarian agencies ""without funds,"" forcing shelters in Central America to struggle as migrants are stranded and homeless. Yet despite what he called ""a pretty dark reality,"" he said that ""it is by doing good and behaving well that we have to overcome this evil situation.""

As the afternoon ended, the women at the parish gathered their belongings. The woman who lost her boyfriend thanked the priests quietly, and she and her daughter hugged both of them tight.

Outside, the bells of Mount Carmel signaled evening Mass. Despite the fear of leaving their homes, more than 2,000 people gradually packed the church and started singing.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/11.20.25%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Mount%20Carmel%20Pic%201.jpg?h=27f45369&itok=YdvEZ8ba,N,,2025-11-20 22:56:49.283659

The governor said the secretary and himself have put together a public safety package of about $200 million.
They spoke about staffing issues, mental health and drug addiction on the streets, and the need to provide mental health resources for officers and deputies who face daily stresses.
However, he is interested in finding a mental health program that can help officers who were at the scene of the shooting.

Stein and law enforcement leaders discussed public safety challenges, including officer pay and retention.

Area police chiefs and sheriffs highlighted the need for more mental health resources for both the public and first responders.

In response to news that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees from the Raleigh area were taken to the New Hanover County jail, Governor Josh Stein criticized the federal government’s handling of the matter.

“People deserve to be safe, and keeping people safe is a top priority, and if there are bad people who are here illegally, they should be identified, held accountable and deported,” Stein said Nov. 20 during a news conference following a roundtable discussion with area law enforcement leaders at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. “But what has happened this past week in North Carolina has not been that. It’s been the folks with Border Patrol just sweeping through cities, picking up random people off of sidewalks, pulling people down from roofs, landscapers from lawns. They’re just going around and picking people up. That does not make our community safer.”

North Carolina has become the target of a federal crackdown on illegal immigration as federal agents recently went to Charlotte, Durham and Raleigh, drawing protests in the process. The Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” USA TODAY reported.

The Democratic governor said, “Folks, Americans are scared to be out in the community for fear of Border Patrol bashing in their windows, which they have done to Americans.”

New Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon confirmed before the roundtable that ICE detainees had been brought to the county, but he could not say how many.

Stein said Border Patrol agents “just end up going where they go. They don’t really tell us where they’re going. But I’ve been in Charlotte a couple of times since they appeared there, and it created just widespread panic and fear and dislocation.”

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff was ""advised"" the nearly week-long operation in Charlotte concluded on Nov. 20, according to the Asheville Citizen Times. Federal agents arrested over 370 people, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Citizen Times on Nov. 20.

Stein, appearing with North Carolina Department of Public Safety Secretary Eddie Buffaloe, hosted a 53-minute roundtable discussion that included seven area law-enforcement representatives as part of a statewide series of such talks.

The governor said the secretary and himself have put together a public safety package of about $200 million.

“A lot of it has to go with paying state law enforcement more,” said Stein during the roundtable talk. “We have among the lowest paid highway patrol in the country. We have among the lowest paid correctional officers in the country, and we need to pay those folks, but we also need to help you all.”

Stein called the work law enforcement does “immensely challenging” and asked how their jobs could be made easier. They spoke about staffing issues, mental health and drug addiction on the streets, and the need to provide mental health resources for officers and deputies who face daily stresses.

Southport Police Chief Todd Coring, whose department dealt with a mass shooting on Sept. 27 that left three people dead and several others injured, said his city is recovering from that trauma. However, he is interested in finding a mental health program that can help officers who were at the scene of the shooting.

Wilmington Police Chief Ryan Zuidema said mental health is a “huge, huge issue,” and more needs to be invested in it. “We need to do a better job of taking care of our first responders,” he said.

Brunswick County Sheriff Brian Chism said most of the problems his office sees in the public on a daily basis are related to mental health issues or addiction.

Stein said mental health and addiction issues are “large and real.” He said, “This is an exceptionally stressful profession, and you have to carry a lot of society’s ills on your back.”

Stein told the media: “These folks work so hard to keep us safe. The most important job we have in government is public safety, and people deserve to be safe. They deserve to feel safe, and we’ve got to do everything we can to help that happen.”","https://www.starnewsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/20/NSTN/87383340007-stein-meeting-photo-1.jpg?crop=4031,2268,x0,y151&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 01:56:37.395106

Michelle Byrd, who spent two decades in the U.S. Air Force and was deployed six times, criticized the deportations of veterans as disrespectful.

“That’s just the ultimate slap in the face, and we should be ashamed of ourselves for letting it happen,” she said. “They defended this country. They raised their hand and they swore to uphold the Constitution, and then they come home and we say, ‘Oh, thanks for your service, get out.’ It’s wrong.”

In an effort to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation promise, immigration enforcement activity has surged, and noncitizen service members, who were previously afforded limited protections from detainment and removal, have been caught in the crosshairs.

The deportation of veterans has been an ongoing issue, though a spotlight on an increase of removals by the Trump administration has prompted vocal criticism. In 2021, Biden issued an executive order that resulted in the creation of the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, which worked to prioritize the return of deported veterans and their families.

Signing up to join the military doesn’t require citizenship, just lawful permanent residency. During Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were directed to take a person’s military record into consideration before arresting them. But under Trump, that guidance was replaced in April with a memo emphasizing that, while it would still be considered, military service alone doesn’t “automatically exempt aliens from the consequences of violating U.S. immigration laws.”

It’s unclear how many foreign-born veterans have been deported since Trump took office. Some estimates project as many as 10,000 were expelled from the country between January and June, according to a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by Democratic members of Congress.

At least two Iraq war veterans have been deported from Arizona. Marlon Parris, who was born in Trinidad but lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, was arrested outside his Laveen home two days after Trump’s inauguration, despite previous assurances from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security that his nonviolent drug charge from 2011 wouldn’t result in his removal. He has since been deported to Mexico. And last week, José Barco, a Purple Heart recipient who was born in Venezuela to Cuban exiles, was deported to Mexico following 10 months in detention.

Advocates argue that immigrants who have served in the military should be exempted from deportation. Mike Olivas, a Vietnam war veteran who drove to the Capitol from Tucson, highlighted the sacrifice of military service as proof that immigrants who sign up for it deserve more.

“They should be at a different level,” he said. “I mean, they fought for their country. They did more than a lot of people did.”

Chris Hill, an organizing fellow with the progressive veterans group Common Defense, added that the government needs to improve its naturalization processes for military members. He noted that the current process puts too much of the burden on military members themselves, and he’s heard about several cases when a person’s citizenship application was waylaid by a deployment order that made them miss critical court appointments.

“We need to codify a practice within the Department of Defense that, if you’re an immigrant and you served your tour of service, that it’s incumbent on the Department of Defense to ensure that you go through that process and you become a citizen while you’re on active duty,” he said. “It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.”

While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship. But the rate of naturalization lags far behind the share of veterans who are immigrants. In 2022, an estimated 16.2 million veterans were born in another country. That same year, only 10,690 military-based naturalizations were approved.

The rate of naturalization is further complicated by the heightened risk of criminal conviction among veterans. To be eligible for naturalization through military service, a person must demonstrate “good moral character” for at least five years before applying. One-third of veterans report being arrested, compared to just one-fifth of non-veterans, due in part to post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injuries or substance abuse. Barco, whose 2006 naturalization application was lost before it could get approved while he was on active duty, was convicted of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of menacing when he fired a handgun into a crowd of teenagers in Colorado two years later, just months after being discharged because of a worsening traumatic brain injury.

Hill argued that a criminal record shouldn’t be the sole determinant of when a foreign-born veteran should be expelled from the country.

“These are soldiers who deployed in very stressful situations, oftentimes were injured, oftentimes have traumatic brain injuries, oftentimes have PTSD and other symptoms,” he said. “To think that they can come back and make mistakes and pay their time, and then get deported? And get deported to a country they don’t know? It’s a tragedy, and it’s not a one-size-fits-all.”

Barcos was sentenced to 52 years in prison when one of the bullets he fired struck 19-year-old Ginny Clemens, who was pregnant. He was ultimately released on Jan. 21 — the day after Trump became president for the second time — after serving 15 years. ICE agents detained him minutes after he walked out.

Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.

“We need to repatriate any veteran who has already been exiled and sent away, because they served this country,” she said. “No matter what their flaws are, or who they are as a human being, they are American because they swore that oath, they defended this country, and whatever happened to them after that service and spending time in war, it’s up to our country to take care of them.”",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/no-veteran-deportations-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 23:56:29.803792

A previous case kept control of the local police department with city leaders after Mr. Trump had tried to use emergency powers to seize command.","A federal judge in Washington temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Thursday from maintaining more than 2,000 members of the National Guard deployed to the city’s streets, finding the city was likely to succeed in arguing the deployment was illegal.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of Federal District Court, a Biden appointee, wrote in a 61-page opinion that the deployment, which began in August, appeared to be illegal for a variety of reasons, including limits on the president’s authority to assert total control over the local D.C. National Guard, as well as concerns over the city’s rights to self-governance.

Those concerns were compounded, she wrote, by the fact that more than 1,000 members of the force deployed to Washington are from other states, and that the Trump administration had taken steps to establish a semi-permanent command structure, with an eye to keeping troops in the city well into next year.

She paused her ruling for three weeks, to allow time for the administration to remove the troops, as well as to appeal her decision.

“At its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself,” Judge Cobb wrote. “Those rights are infringed upon when defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District.”

President Trump announced the deployment in Washington as part of an aggressive drive to ratchet up law enforcement in the city, directing heavily armed National Guardsmen to deploy to the city while integrating federal agents with local police officers to conduct sometimes routine police work. The troops have also played a role as armed backup for sharply stepped-up immigration and deportation operations around the city in what experts have described as a trial run in joint immigration operations.

Since the summer, small groups of armed National Guardsmen have been ubiquitous around the city, patrolling subway stops, tourist areas and nightlife districts. They have also been subject to mockery online after being observed guarding national monuments and relatively vacant areas or doing “beautification” work such as removing trash or sweeping plant debris.

Judge Cobb’s ruling followed several others around the country in which federal judges found that Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops to Chicago, Memphis and Portland, Ore., also most likely violated the law.

The Supreme Court is currently considering whether the president can deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of state and local leaders. Whatever the justices decide in the Illinois case will most likely set the ground rules for Mr. Trump’s efforts to use state-based troops in other American cities as part of his aggressive immigration crackdown.

But it’s not clear if the court’s decision will have a similar impact in Washington, because of the unusual status of the District of Columbia, where federal authorities including the president have expanded powers. Mr. Trump has used that authority to bring in a force of National Guard troops contributed by at least 9 Republican states to serve as a semipermanent patrol in the city, and has announced plans to keep the force in place until at least the end of February.

“There is also the risk that this incursion may become permanent, or at least enduring, given the creation of a D.C.N.G. unit specifically established to conduct law enforcement in the District,” Judge Cobb wrote, referring to the D.C. National Guard.

She noted that under the Home Rule Act, the federal law granting the city limited self-government, Congress delegated considerable control over the city’s law enforcement to its local leaders. She described the president’s actions as “major intrusions into local governance.”

She wrote that the Trump administration “exceeded the bounds of their authority” with the deployment, and “acted contrary to law” by sending in the Guard to carry out “nonmilitary, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city’s civil authorities.”

A White House spokeswoman said in an email that Mr. Trump enjoyed broad power to assume control over and command the members of the D.C. National Guard.

“This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents — to undermine the president’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.,” said the spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson.

While Muriel E. Bowser, the city’s mayor, initially opposed the Trump administration’s efforts to wrest law enforcement control from her office, she has since softened her rhetoric, expressing openness to collaborating with the federal government to decrease crime in the city.

The lawsuit was brought by Brian Schwalb, Washington’s attorney general, who was elected separately from the mayor. He celebrated the ruling as a major breakthrough for the city after months of daily patrols by armed troops spread out across much of the city.

“From the beginning, we made clear that the U.S. military should not be policing American citizens on American soil,” he said in a statement. “Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the president can disregard states’ independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants — with no check on his military power.”

The decision was a second win for Mr. Schwalb’s office.

For the complaint: https://www.eff.org/document/complaint-eff-v-doj-dhs-ice-tracking-apps","SAN FRANCISCO – The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sued the departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) today to uncover information about the federal government demanding that tech companies remove apps that document immigration enforcement activities in communities throughout the country.

Tech platforms took down several such apps (including ICE Block, Red Dot, and DeICER) and webpages (including ICE Sighting-Chicagoland) following communications with federal officials this year, raising important questions about government coercion to restrict protected First Amendment activity.

""We're filing this lawsuit to find out just what the government told tech companies,"" said EFF Staff Attorney F. Mario Trujillo. ""Getting these records will be critical to determining whether federal officials crossed the line into unconstitutional coercion and censorship of protected speech.""

In October, Apple removed ICEBlock, an app that allows users to report Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in their area, from its App Store. Attorney General Pamela Bondi publicly took credit for the takedown, telling reporters, “We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store—and Apple did so.” In the days that followed, Apple removed several similar apps from the App Store. Google and Meta removed similar apps and webpages from platforms they own as well. Bondi vowed to “continue engaging tech companies” on the issue.

People have a protected First Amendment right to document and share information about law enforcement activities performed in public. If government officials coerce third parties into suppressing protected activity, this can be unconstitutional, as the government cannot do indirectly what it is barred from doing directly.

Last month, EFF submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the DOJ, DHS and its component agencies ICE and Customs and Border Protection. The requests sought records and communications about agency demands that technology companies remove apps and pages that document immigration enforcement activities. So far, none of the agencies have provided these records. EFF's FOIA lawsuit demands their release.

“Nothing in Christian teaching requires inflicting psychological harm on young people.","Seidel added that the Court has been “focusing only on the rights of the Christians bringing these cases while ignoring everyone else’s rights—like the kids being harmed.”

Professor John Culhane of Delaware Law School said the ruling could determine how states regulate mental health care nationwide.

“If the Court accepts the argument that this is ‘speech’ rather than professional conduct, it’s hard to see how any regulation of mental health practices carried out through talk could survive,” he said. “That would endanger the constitutionality of the entire practice of psychotherapy.”

Both scholars agree the Court’s reasoning could influence future decisions on other contested areas of youth health care, including gender-affirming treatments.

Jennifer C. Pizer, Senior Director of Strategic Initiatives at Lambda Legal, told Newsweek that Chiles v. Salazar is part of a broader legal campaign attempting to use the First Amendment “as a deregulatory weapon against the basic safeguards that protect patients.”

“Conversion therapy is not health care—it is a long-discredited practice rejected by every major medical association,” Pizer said.

“Framing this as a ‘speech’ case ignores the reality that licensed professionals have ethical duties. The First Amendment has never guaranteed a right to provide harmful or fraudulent treatment under the guise of counseling.”

Pizer added that a ruling for Chiles could “invite medical misinformation into clinical settings” by weakening the ability of states to enforce professional standards.

Reverend Fred Davie, a civil rights advocate, former vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and a leader at Union Theological Seminary, said the case highlights how religious language is increasingly invoked to justify practices that mainstream faith leaders reject.

“For far too long, some have twisted scripture to legitimize harmful practices against LGBTQ+ people, including conversion therapy,” Davie told Newsweek. “Nothing in Christian teaching requires inflicting psychological harm on young people. It is morally urgent that the Court recognize the difference between genuine religious expression and the misuse of religion as a tool to endanger children.”

Davie said faith communities nationwide “overwhelmingly repudiate” the idea that religion can excuse what medical experts deem unsafe.

What People Are Saying

Tara McKay, Director, LGBTQ+ Policy Lab at Vanderbilt said: “There are so many other things tied up into these cases that we kind of overlook because we’re focused very strongly on the topic area, which is conversion therapy and LGBTQ health … which I obviously think is phenomenally important, but the cases themselves are about so much more than this, and have so many more implications.”

Ana Builes, Appellate Counsel, Constitutional Accountability Center said: “Based on the overwhelming scientific and professional consensus that trying to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity can cause them serious harm … The First Amendment does not prohibit states from protecting its residents through this sort of regulation simply because the medical treatment that mental health professionals provide is done through speech.”

Jonathan Scruggs, Senior Counsel & VP of Litigation Strategy, ADF told Newsweek: “We hope the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the side of free speech and allow counselors like Kaley to work with her clients without the government mandating goals it prefers.”

DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.

At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.

Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”

CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.

Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to what happened in Chicago after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.

Bovino and his agents are expected to launch an operation in New Orleans after the Thanksgiving holiday, as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said in a post following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.

“We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.

Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion

In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city, fear and confusion swept through the Charlotte community.

Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”

She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.

More than 30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.

“We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”

When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.

One nonprofit estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have closed at some point during the immigration crackdown.

A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history, closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen.

While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings, warned the community not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.

“CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.

Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare

While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.

Some in Charlotte’s community adopted tactics they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte, some also stood outside the entrance of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.

Both cities quickly mobilized to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.

Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.

The operation also took Charlotte by surprise, as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials hadn’t shared details about the operation or its timing, Trump frequently named Chicago as a target for a federal crime crackdown.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-17t185720z-2132695509-rc2gyhaod9ac-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-charlotte.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-20 20:58:13.631437

Ms Mahmood’s loosening of the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights — or scrapping it, as Reform and the Tories demand — must not be a euphemism for the disregard of basic human rights.","DO ILLEGAL migrants have rights? The question is being raised in both Washington, DC, and Westminster. In the United States, threats to the rights of undocumented migrants have increased sharply with the intensified round-ups, often physically violent, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials (News, 14 November). In the UK, the reforms announced by the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, have been described, even by her supporters, as “draconian” and the most significant tightening of immigration since the Second World War.

In the US, things have come to such a pass that those detained for deportation have even been denied access to the eucharist. Nuns, priests, and even a bishop carrying the Sacrament have been turned away at the door by ICE officials in Chicago, the home town of Pope Leo XIV, who has offered his strongest criticism yet of the Trump administration.

So grave is the crisis that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued its first Special Message for 12 years on the subject. The treatment of immigrants has now replaced abortion at the top of the Bishops’ political agenda. They warn of a “climate of fear and anxiety”, of parents “who fear being detained when taking their children to school”, and of families who have “arbitrarily lost their legal status”. They issued an unprecedented video, in which each prelate reads a punchy line from their prepared message. Even bishops who previously supported Trump have become critical.

In the UK, Ms Mahmood declares that she is on a “moral mission” in announcing that incomers must reapply for refugee status every 30 months, and may be forced to return home once their countries are deemed safe — taking with them children born in Britain. Appeals will be curtailed. The definition of “inhumane and degrading treatment” will be narrowed. And there is much else. If liberals won’t enforce borders, she argues, fascists will, and more harshly.

But is her agenda any more moral than President Trump’s?

Trump defenders in the US persistently confuse human rights and civil rights. Civil rights spring from the “social contract”, which implies that those who pay taxes, follow the law, and share in the democratic community have privileges that outsiders do not. A welfare state cannot serve the world. Strong societies depend on shared norms, and unrestricted access to rights may erode them.

But human rights are different. They are not earned by joining a political community: they belong to everyone made in the image of God. All have the right to life, to freedom of religion and expression, to due process, to freedom from torture or degrading treatment. Citizens can vote for border control, but they cannot justify violating human rights. A state can detain, process, and deport — but it cannot extinguish fundamental rights.

This is the line that the American bishops are now trying to draw, and the line that the UK must take care not to blur. In reform of immigration laws and procedures, as the US bishops say, human dignity and national security must not be put in conflict. Ms Mahmood’s loosening of the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights — or scrapping it, as Reform and the Tories demand — must not be a euphemism for the disregard of basic human rights. That would not be a moral mission, but a moral mistake.","https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/media/5704179/3d64nep.jpg?center=0.38461538461538464,0.50318471337579618&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134081222700000000",N,,2025-11-20 20:57:32.231862

“But [Jones] made a mistake and there is no order of removal,” Xinis interjected.
The Trump administration now contends that Costa Rica is no longer a viable destination, proposing instead a series of African countries.
For now, Abrego remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania and an order Xinis issued earlier in the case blocks his deportation.
“If the government wants to moot it, it sounds like Mr. Abrego is still open to going to Costa Rica.”","In a detailed, 15-page order, Jones considered and credited Abrego’s assertion that he could be targeted in that country based on gang-related threats to his family’s pupusa business. The judge said it was too late for Abrego to get asylum, but granted him protection from being sent back to El Salvador. But Jones never explicitly ordered Abrego deported.

“There is no order of removal in the docket, in the record,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said Thursday near the beginning of the four-hour hearing. “You can’t fake it ‘til you make it. You got to have it. … You have to have the order. It’s got to be an order memorialized somewhere and I don’t have it.”

The formal deportation order is potentially crucial to Abrego’s fate because immigration judges typically specify which country immigrants will be deported to. That is a key point of contention in Abrego’s current predicament. Trump administration officials are seeking to send him to Liberia — a country he has no ties to — and Abrego’s lawyers are urging that he be sent to Costa Rica or allowed to remain in the U.S.

But Jones’ ruling doesn’t say where Abrego was to be sent, or even that he had to leave the U.S.

“It’s critically important,” Abrego lawyer Andrew Rossman told Xinis. “It would be an obvious due process violation to remove someone without a final order of removal. … I think the entire structure the government has built crumbles if there is no final order of removal.”

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign dismissed the missing order as a technicality and said the notion that Abrego was being ordered deported was implicit in Jones’ finding that he could not be sent to El Salvador.

“I think this represents, necessarily, the final order of removal,” Ensign said.

“But [Jones] made a mistake and there is no order of removal,” Xinis interjected.

“I think that is requiring more formality than the law requires,” Ensign replied.

A ruling that Abrego was never formally ordered deported could allow him to make a new asylum claim or take other steps to remain in the U.S. that aren’t open to someone under a deportation order.

The hearing Thursday also focused on where Abrego could be sent if he is deported. After Abrego was returned to the U.S. earlier this year and put in criminal proceedings in Tennessee on charges he drove migrants from Texas to the East Coast as part of an immigrant smuggling ring, Abrego’s lawyers and the government neared an agreement that he would be deported to Costa Rica.

However, that deal fell apart over Abrego’s unwillingness to plead guilty in the criminal case.

The Trump administration now contends that Costa Rica is no longer a viable destination, proposing instead a series of African countries. Immigration officials’ current plan is to send Abrego to Liberia, a nation in West Africa founded in the 1800s by people formerly enslaved in the U.S.

Xinis repeatedly prodded lawyers for the government Thursday to reconsider the possibility of sending Abrego to Costa Rica and made clear she understood why he was resisting the African nations.

“He’s been to CECOT and back,” the judge observed, referring to the notorious anti-terrorism prison Abrego was held in after his deportation from the U.S. She added that Abrego has “no cultural ties, no ties whatsoever” to Liberia. “He will be completely removed from everything and everyone he knows.”

Xinis heard from one witness Thursday about the state of Abrego’s deportation proceedings: John Cantu, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting assistant director for removal operations.

Cantu said a State Department attorney advised him that Costa Rica’s earlier willingness to take Abrego was “non-binding” and sending him there now would require “further negotiation and likely additional commitments by the United States.”

However, Cantu said he was unable to provide additional details about the issues with Costa Rica or the promises by Liberia because the sum total of his knowledge on those matters came from a five-minute video conference where State Department lawyer Carl Anderson read Cantu a prepared statement.

Cantu’s testimony irritated Xinis. She said she had no bone to pick with Cantu, but that his appearance continued a pattern of the administration failing to comply with her orders to produce witnesses knowledgeable about the efforts to find so-called third countries to take Abrego.

“This witness said nothing today,” the judge said later in the hearing. “Mr. Cantu knew nothing about anything. … Today was a zero, in my view.”

At least twice during the hearing, Xinis alluded to the fact that a request remains pending for contempt-of-court sanctions against the government for allegedly defying her orders earlier in the legal wrangling over what the courts concluded was his illegal deportation to El Salvador.

Abrego’s lawyers have argued that the administration’s current insistence on sending their client to Africa is an act of retaliation for embarrassment he caused President Donald Trump and other officials in that fight and his current unwillingness to plead guilty in the criminal case. Xinis didn’t go that far, but said she found it strange the government was unwilling to give her a detailed explanation of why Costa Rica appeared to be off the table.

“It’s so odd to me and that’s really being polite,” she said.

For now, Abrego remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania and an order Xinis issued earlier in the case blocks his deportation. Even if she orders his release, he faces a trial beginning in January in Nashville in the criminal case.

Xinis warned both sides Thursday that it will take a while for her to rule and she made one more pitch to the administration to reach a deal with Abrego.

“It’s not going to be a quick decision,” Xinis warned. “If the government wants to moot it, it sounds like Mr. Abrego is still open to going to Costa Rica.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F69%2Fcb%2F03cc01e2431c899968b731570d73%2Fdeportation-error-abrego-garcia-69617.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:56:29.770134

Under the Trump administration, the human rights issue has been repurposed to fit his priorities in favor of economic dealmaking and an agenda he sees as appealing to his MAGA base. That has included a complete overhaul of the State Department’s human rights apparatus, which had long been the centerpiece of traditional U.S. promotion of democratic values.

A senior State Department official said that new instructions to U.S. officials on the report mandate they include “infringements on human rights in foreign countries,” including on arrests or official investigations over speech as well as the state subsidization of abortions or abortion drugs and the total estimated number of annual abortions.

Officials are also mandated to note the enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion policies that “‘provide preferential treatment’ to workers on the basis of race, sex, or caste.”

“In recent years, new destructive ideologies have given safe harbor to human rights violations. The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked,” State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

The change in guidelines comes after the administration this year scaled back the report, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president.

Instead, it sounded an alarm on the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, with which Washington has clashed on a host of issues.

The Trump administration has moved away from the traditional U.S. promotion of democracy and human rights, seeing it as interference in another country’s affairs, even as it has criticized countries selectively.

One example is Europe, where Trump officials repeatedly weighed in on politics to denounce what they see as suppression of right-wing leaders, including in countries such as Romania, Germany, and France, and accused European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.

Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.

Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.

The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.

This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.

The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.

This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.

The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.

The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.

And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.”

“For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added.

While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.

Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.

“They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.”

‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’

In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.

Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.

But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.

Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.

They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.

Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.

“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.

Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.

In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.

At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.

“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.

Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.

The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.

In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.

Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

In Schott’s case, Babb testified that federal agents “actually watch travel patterns on the highway” through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.”

After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.

The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.

The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.”

‘Patterns of life’ and license plates

Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.

Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.

But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.

In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.

Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.

The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.

Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.

Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.

Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.

Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.

CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.

One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency

The Border Patrol’s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.

Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.

In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.

“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.

In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.

Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol’s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.

In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.

“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”

AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.

In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.

Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don’t realize they’ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.

“I assume for every one person like me, who’s actually standing up, there’s a thousand people who just don’t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don’t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,” Schott said. “I think there’s thousands of people getting treated this way.”

“We have private plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under a state law, and then the municipal entity is challenging that state law as being unconstitutional under the Federal Equal Protection Clause.” This creates a threshold question: can a town challenge state law at all?
“Municipal entities are just creatures of the state,” Moneyhun notes.
Preparing for high-stakes oral argument When Moneyhun and Hatem joined the case, briefing at the Court of Appeals had concluded.
“There was a real synergy between our expertise in election law and their expertise in New York state law,” says Moneyhun.","Students from Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic traveled to Albany in October to see the culmination of months of preparation as their professor argued a case with statewide implications before the New York Court of Appeals. The case, Clarke v. Town of Newburgh, challenged the town’s at-large voting system under the New York Voting Rights Act (NYVRA)—but the constitutional validity of that state law itself hung in the balance.

Levi Moneyhun ’26 and Andy Hatem ’27 entered the case at the appellate stage, after a trial judge struck down the NYVRA as unconstitutional. As part of the Clinic’s representation of minority voters from Newburgh, New York, their preparation for oral argument and attendance at the proceeding offers a glimpse into the Clinic’s high-stakes litigation and nationwide impact.

What’s at stake in Newburgh

Clarke v. Town of Newburgh centers on a town where demographics and political representation tell two very different stories. Despite significant Black and Hispanic populations, the town board has remained uniformly white. The reason, according to the plaintiffs, lies in Newburgh’s at-large voting system.

“Right now, because the town board is elected at-large, you can have a demographic that makes up 25% of the population but will always be the minority in town counsel contests and end up with no representation whatsoever on the town board,” Hatem explains. In at-large elections, every board member is chosen by all voters across the entire town. Where voting patterns fall along racial lines and one group forms the majority, that majority can often end up electing every single representative, leaving minority voters underrepresented.

The consequences are concrete. “This is a town where, to our knowledge, despite a substantial Hispanic population, no Hispanic candidate has ever been elected on the town board,” Hatem says. The town employs few Spanish-speaking staff, creating barriers for Spanish-speaking residents. When the Ku Klux Klan marched nearby, the town’s response was muted. “The town of Newburgh did not take much action in response,” Hatem recounts. “When something like that happens, we certainly could hope to see a more forceful response by the town, because that really does implicate the interests of a lot of people who are residents and constituents, who deserve to have their voices heard and represented.”

The legal architecture of the case involves an uncommon twist. Private citizens sued the town under the New York Voting Rights Act—but instead of defending its voting system, the town attacked the state law itself as unconstitutional.

“This is a particularly interesting case because it really does involve the law of all three levels of government,” Moneyhun explains. “We have private plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under a state law, and then the municipal entity is challenging that state law as being unconstitutional under the Federal Equal Protection Clause.”

This creates a threshold question: can a town challenge state law at all? “Municipal entities are just creatures of the state,” Moneyhun notes. “They’re created by the state, and they can be dissolved by the state.” Under traditional doctrine, municipalities lack such power. The town claims the dilemma exception applies, but only if “complying with the statute would likely force the town to take unconstitutional action,” Moneyhun says.

This leads to the deeper question: will complying with the NYVRA force municipalities to violate the Equal Protection Clause? The trial court said yes, striking down the entire law. “By the logic of that ruling, you could say that any statute that aims to remedy racial discrimination is unconstitutional because it considers race,” Hatem says.

The Clinic’s position, according to Hatem, is that the reasoning is flawed: “We think, on the merits, that’s incorrect. We also think, because the town has not been ordered to implement any remedy, the town cannot challenge the statute.”

If the Court of Appeals agrees on the threshold issue, it could avoid the constitutional debate entirely. If it reaches the merits, its ruling will bind every municipality in New York.

Preparing for high-stakes oral argument

When Moneyhun and Hatem joined the case, briefing at the Court of Appeals had concluded. Their work focused entirely on preparing Professor Nick Stephanopoulos, Director of Strategy at the Clinic, for oral argument. Alongside partner counsel and outside attorneys, they explored every possible angle of the case to run through moot arguments with Stephanopoulos.

“One part of the questioning is getting as many perspectives as possible, so that any question that might come up at oral arguments has been asked already, ideally asked two or three different ways, maybe in a friendly way, maybe in a more skeptical way,” explains Hatem. “We really worked through those answers, so we have every answer prepared and thought through, and not developed on the fly.”

The complexity of the legal issues made this preparation essential, according to Moneyhun. “There are a lot of interlocking doctrines going on here,” he says. “It’s not just finding the answer, but finding a way that you can get to that answer very quickly in a way that will make sense to every judge on the panel.”

The Election Law Clinic worked alongside Abrams Fensterman, a New York law firm that filed the original case. The question of whether municipalities can challenge state laws came primarily from the firm’s local government practice. “There was a real synergy between our expertise in election law and their expertise in New York state law,” says Moneyhun.

Hatem found value in perspectives from practicing attorneys. “When you have co-counsel or partners who litigate these cases in New York every day, they help identify some very practical concerns,” he says. The four moot courts, he adds, “gave us four different looks at the same case, and I definitely learned something new from each one.”

Inside the Court of Appeals

The students sat through multiple oral arguments on the day their case was heard—theirs was the final case of the day, so the students had hours to soak up the experience of being in New York’s highest court.

“The New York Court of Appeals is a beautiful building,” Moneyhun says. “We got to hear oral arguments in several other cases that were being heard that day as well, which was interesting to see. Usually in law school, you’re only thinking about the legal issues that are in national news or that are coming up in your classes, but that represents a pretty small cross section of what’s ultimately going on in the country.”

Hatem notes the particular character of state-level appellate litigation. “At the state level, you have a lot of issues with very concrete impacts on people’s lives.” The challenge, he says, is “ultimately, trying to arrive at a resolution that applies the law correctly, makes sense, and is workable for the state, which needs to enforce all these laws in a practical way.”

Once Stephanopoulos began presenting the plaintiffs’ argument, the judges’ questioning validated the Clinic’s preparation. “It was really cool to see the judges on the New York Court of Appeals asking a lot of the same questions that we had been asking, to see them pressing on the same points that we had identified as the key areas of contention between us and the town of Newburgh,” recalls Moneyhun.

If the NYVRA survives this constitutional challenge, the case would return for trial to determine an appropriate remedy. It would be the first case where a remedy has been granted under the New York Voting Rights Act, “so it’s a bit of uncharted territory to see exactly how courts will decide which remedies to impose,” says Moneyhun.

He suggests potential remedies changing the town’s electoral structures: “Switching from an at-large districting system that systemically disenfranchises minority voters in a given municipality to a geographically districted system, or a proportional ranked choice voting system that allows them to have a say in governance that is proportional to their makeup in the community, would do a lot to advance their substantive interests.”

The lessons of experiential learning

Both students contrast clinical experience with traditional law school pedagogy. “The law school case method will tend to use specific cases as an instrument to get at one particular legal issue,” Moneyhun says. “But the thing about actual litigation is that it invariably raises dozens to hundreds of legal issues, and if you want to win, you need to actually understand every single one of those issues, and you need to explore every possible way you could lose to make sure that you don’t.”

The difference, he suggests, is both breadth and depth. “It requires a much more comprehensive understanding and a much deeper understanding than traditional law school coursework.”

Hatem, too, points to the messiness that precedes judicial resolution. “In these cases, rather than having the issues neatly packaged and summarized, in the way a judge has synthesized them for the ruling they ultimately reached, you see the messiness before the court decides exactly which way it’s going to rule and on what grounds it’s going to rule,” he says.

The goal is finding solutions that work for actual people that go beyond black and white, Hatem says: “People are three dimensional and have a lot of different concerns and interests, and especially once you get beyond a law school casebook, you have to take into account all those concerns and all those interests.”

“Seeing how some of the doctrines we learned play out in the real world helped me appreciate my other courses,” Hatem says, describing how “all these doctrines you learn at a very abstract level in the classroom suddenly becomes very real when you have a couple of parties at the Court of Appeals trying to resolve a matter years in the making.”

The case now awaits a decision, but the litigation may not end there. “Counsel for the town of Newburgh has indicated an intent to appeal an adverse decision up to the Supreme Court of the United States,” Moneyhun says. If that happens, he adds, “the Clinic will be involved in briefing the opposition to that petition for certiorari, and also involved in opposing a stay pending that petition.”

For now, the students have returned to Cambridge to continue a semester of voting rights work in the Clinic, having participated in litigation that could determine not just Newburgh’s electoral future, but the viability of voting rights enforcement across New York State.",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Newburgh-1-768x1024.png,N,,2025-11-21 00:56:43.123924

The lawsuit was filed in a Massachusetts court on behalf of two immigrant women.

In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that people in the country illegally could face “significant financial penalty” if they chose to stay.

Daily fines of $998, designed to encourage immigrants in the U.S. illegally to leave the country, have been imposed on more than 21,500 people who the lawyers said were trying to comply with immigration laws.

The fines are “grossly disproportionate to the gravity,” of any immigration violations, said the suit, calling them unconstitutional.

The lawsuit was filed in a Massachusetts court on behalf of two immigrant women. It seeks class-action status to represent people facing fines that lawyers say have totalled more than $6 billion since President Donald Trump returned to office early this year and launched an immigration crackdown.

“The people we serve are doing exactly what the law requires — pursuing legal relief through immigration courts and immigration agencies,” Hasan Shafiqullah, a supervising attorney with The Legal Aid Society, one of the groups handling the suit, said in a news release. “In return, the government is threatening to seize their wages, cars, even their homes.”

One of the two plaintiffs, a Florida woman identified in the complaint only as Nancy M. to shield her from retribution, had been ordered to leave the U.S., but also had what’s known as an “order of supervision” and was meeting annually with immigration authorities as she tried to become a legal permanent resident.

Instead, earlier this year she received a bill for roughly $1.8 million, a number apparently reached by totalling daily $998 fines for the past five years.

Starting soon after Trump was sworn in, the administration announced a series of efforts to encourage immigrants to leave the U.S.

In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that people in the country illegally could face “significant financial penalty” if they chose to stay.

Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a February statement. “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws -- we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce.”

Those people were arrested without warrants across the Chicago area and five neighboring states.

The lower court judge ruled those arrests violated a 2022 consent decree.

The consent decree required U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents to meet certain criteria when making warrantless arrests, including pre-determining whether there is probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally, and whether they are also a flight risk.

But the Trump Administration argued that the order put the lives of Americans at risk.

The ruling had required the detainees be put on electronic monitoring after paying a bond by Friday.

This order now puts that on hold until a hearing on the matter next month.

Earlier this week, Judge Jeffrey Cummings denied a request by the government to delay the release.

Cummings found thousands of arrests may have violated the consent decree, agreeing with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and American Civil Liberties Union.

As a result of that finding, last week, Cummings ordered hundreds of people -- who do not present a ""high risk to public safety"" -- to be released from custody into electronic monitoring while the court is in the process of determining whether their arrests violated the agreement.

Four hundred forty two people were eligible for release Friday.

Attorneys representing the government have argued that Congress stripped federal courts of their authority to grant parole to large groups of immigrants in ICE custody, which they believe Judge Cummings is doing in this case.

The ACLU and National Immigrant Justice Center told the ABC7 Chicago I-Team while they're disappointed with this decision, the case is not over.
