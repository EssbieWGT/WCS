Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Pritzker, responded by telling Fox News Digital that ""it's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials.""
Among those was Andres Ventura-Uvaldo, a criminal illegal and Mexican national, who the agency said was previously arrested for felony DUI and domestic violence.
This comes as DHS says that ICE officials are facing a more than 1,000 percent increase in assaults as they conduct operations across Illinois.","The Department of Homeland Security is criticizing Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker for failing to assist in responding to a chaotic anti-ICE riot in a Chicago suburb that forced federal authorities to deploy tear gas and other non-lethal measures.

In a Monday statement, the department claimed that police ""under JB Pritzker’s sanctuary jurisdiction refused to answer multiple calls for assistance.""

Fox News Digital reported last Friday that federal officials clashed with a group of protesters who were blocking ICE vehicles from entering and exiting a processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.

DHS labeled the protesters ""rioters"" and said that so far, federal law enforcement has arrested 16 rioters. The agency said that the ""rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property."" DHS said that rioters also assaulted law enforcement officials.

Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Pritzker, responded by telling Fox News Digital that ""it's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials.""

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE THROWN TO GROUND DURING CHAOTIC ANTI-ICE PROTEST

""The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them of the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety,"" said Hill. He added, ""Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest.""

""The media needs to use extreme caution before reporting what the Trump administration is saying given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement,"" said Hill.

The DHS statement said the protest disrupted an operation targeting ""some of the worst of the worst—including criminals convicted of drug trafficking, domestic abuse, drinking and driving, and assault,"" who were being processed at the facility.

The agency highlighted some of the criminal illegals who were being processed when the protest broke out.

Among those was Andres Ventura-Uvaldo, a criminal illegal and Mexican national, who the agency said was previously arrested for felony DUI and domestic violence.

Another, Alberto Algeria Barron, also a Mexican national, was previously removed from the U.S. in 2014 and was convicted for domestic battery twice, according to DHS.

Erwin Jose Roa-Mustafa, an illegal alien from the Dominican Republic, was also being processed at the facility after pleading guilty on federal charges of conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl.

DHS said that ICE was also processing another alleged drug trafficker, Ibis Alberto Testa Nunez, from Mexico, who was previously arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration for cocaine possession and possession with intent to distribute.

Two others, Salvador Alcantar-Alcantar, from Mexico, was previously arrested for DUI, trespassing and assault, and Carlos Eduardo Chavez-Cardenas, from Bolivia, was previously convicted for DUI and possession of drugs, according to DHS.

""These heinous criminals, including domestic abusers, drug traffickers, violent offenders, and drunk drivers are some of the illegal aliens being held in the ICE Broadview Processing Center,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

Rights guaranteed to all by the Constitution are being eroded, such as the right to due process of law, he said.
Chaplain Shane Sims of Athens Al-Huda Islamic Center told the crowd that immigration is “central” to his faith.
“We are all beloved children of God,” said Joel Siebentritt, representing the Athens Friends Meeting (Quakers).
“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev.","Nearly 300 people chanted and sang their way along Prince Avenue to the federal courthouse downtown Sunday afternoon in a protest march and rally against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

Sponsored by two Athens faith-based organizations, the tone of the protest was not so much political as moral and religious, condemning the crackdown as contradicting the spiritual teachings of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim congregations that form the two groups, the Interfaith Clergy Partnership of Greater Athens and the Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition.

Marchers held hand-drawn signs, chanted slongs like “Hey, ho, hey, ho, ICE has got to go,” and sang familiar protest songs such as “We Shall Overcome” as they made their way up the sidewalk, some using canes, some couples with strollers. Often, passing drivers blew their car horns in support.

Organizers warned the marchers after they had gathered across Prince Avenue from the Clarke County School District headquarters that if they encountered counterprotesters, they should meet them with love, but no counterprotesters materialized.

As they quietly gathered at the courthouse, music minister Tom Eggleston played hymns of his own composition on a portable electric organ set up on the building’s portico.

The Rev. Daryl Bloodsaw, one of the faith leaders who spoke after the long line of protestors had arrived at the federal building, quoted from the Bible: “It has been said, ‘We are commanded to love them as we love ourselves.’”

Bloodsaw is pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church West, a church with a long history of civil rights activism. Ebenezer’s sanctuary is a block away from the development going up at the old Milledge Avenue Varsity site, where Black students picketed the segregated restaurant. The church was at the heart of protests during the 1960s and 1970s, when racial barriers finally came down at the University of Georgia and the Clarke County public schools.

He reminded the gathering of how the Christian Bible instructs the faithful to treat strangers—with welcome and kindness.

“I feel like our democracy is being melted,” Bloodsaw said. Rights guaranteed to all by the Constitution are being eroded, such as the right to due process of law, he said.

“We are called here by our moral values,” said another speaker, the Rev. Pippin Whitaker of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. “We are living in a time of spiritual peril,” she said.

Chaplain Shane Sims of Athens Al-Huda Islamic Center told the crowd that immigration is “central” to his faith. “The earliest Muslims were immigrants,” he said.

“We are all beloved children of God,” said Joel Siebentritt, representing the Athens Friends Meeting (Quakers).

“God just made God’s children. It isn’t God’s children and somebody else’s,” said the Rev. Nikki Mathis of St. Gregory the Great Episcopal Church. She encouraged the marchers to “Pray the name, talk the talk and walk the walk.” The abuse of immigrants didn’t just begin in January, but has been going on much longer, she reminded them.

“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev. Tom Buchanan of Covenant Presbyterian Church.

“This is not justice. It is certainly not the will of God,” Buchanan said.",https://flagpole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0528-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 23:57:00.975428

Mr. Trump had fired Ms. Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the F.T.C., in March. The federal agency, which enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws, typically has five commissioners — three from the president’s party and two from the opposing party.

After their firing, the two commissioners had said they planned to challenge their removal in court, relying on a 1935 landmark Supreme Court case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that also involved the firing of an F.T.C. commissioner.

In its brief order Monday, the court said it would consider in December the broader question of whether to overturn the precedent that has prevented presidents from removing independent regulators without cause and solely over policy disagreements.

The decision by the court’s conservative majority to allow Mr. Trump to remove Ms. Slaughter drew a dissent from the three liberal justices.

The facility is a processing center for people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Chicagoans and suburban residents, seeking to resist, have increasingly turned up at the Broadview facility protests.
Friday’s protests saw federal agents attack peaceful protesters, tear gassing them and shooting pepper balls.
“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency.","CHICAGO — Organizers are planning daily protests at the Broadview ICE facility until it shuts down amid the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement activity.

Organizers have long held regular protests on Fridays at the facility, 1930 Beach St. in suburban Broadview; but now, they’re calling on demonstrators to join daily protests at 7-9 a.m. and again at 6 p.m.

“Shut down the Broadview ICE facility,” reads an Instagram post announcing the intent to now stage daily protests.

The facility is a processing center for people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Detainees are taken from the facility to detention centers across the United States.

That’s made it a key area as the federal administration has launched two operations — the ICE-led Midway Blitz and Border Patrol-led At Large — aimed at arresting undocumented people in Chicago and across Illinois.

Chicagoans and suburban residents, seeking to resist, have increasingly turned up at the Broadview facility protests. Friday’s protests saw federal agents attack peaceful protesters, tear gassing them and shooting pepper balls.

Over the weekend, there were reports the facility was “evacuating” people or closing entirely. Those are untrue, a Department of Homeland Security leader said in a statement Sunday.

“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency. “Since Friday, rioters and sanctuary politicians have obstructed and assaulted law enforcement. These rioters have thrown tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.

“Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Federal agents have arrested 16 people connected to the protesters, McLaughlin said.

Last week, four Illinois lawmakers asked top officials at the Department of Homeland Security to disclose how many people have been held at the Broadview Processing Center and describe its conditions, Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia said in a press release last week. Garcia is one of four representatives who ICE denied access to the building after showing up to investigate “inhumane conditions” earlier this summer.

Other Chicago ICE Sightings

Federal agents detained one person in the 2600 block of West 35th Place in Brighton Park, organizers of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council reported on social media.

Early Monday, organizers and neighbors spotted federal agents wearing black vests that read “police” in Gage Park and Chicago Lawn, including at West 63rd Street and South Kedzie Avenue, West 55th and South Kedzie Avenue and West 63d and South Rockwell Streets, according to a social media alert posted by the Southwest Side Rapid Response team.

Northwest Side organizers said two people were detained by federal agents after receiving suspicious calls asking them to report to 5700 N. Harlem Ave., the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team said on social media. One person was detained Friday after receiving a call asking them to pick up a prize at that site, while another was detained when the person showed up to pick up scrap metal, according to the group. The group is “monitoring” the situation, it said.

At least one person was detained by federal agents Friday in Back of the Yards, near West 46th Street and South Damen Avenue, nonprofit Increase the Peace reported.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning ICE agents and most law enforcement from wearing masks to hide their identities. He says it's the country's first. Trump administration officials say they won't obey it because the state lacks that authority. Gerardo Zavala of CapRadio in Sacramento reports.

GERARDO ZAVALA, BYLINE: Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed the new law over the weekend in Los Angeles, the city that has seen an immigration crackdown that he says continues.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GAVIN NEWSOM: Unmarked cars. People in masks. People quite literally disappearing. No due process. No rights. No rights in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights.

ZAVALA: The law bars local and federal law enforcement from wearing masks except for things like riot gear and medical masks or when doing undercover work. Newsom also signed laws requiring officers to display their name or badge number and to restrict ICE access to schools and hospitals without warrants.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NEWSOM: This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.

ZAVALA: ICE officials have said their agents face doxing, targeting and threats - something Newsom says are dealt with by laws protecting police. But Bill Essayli, the acting U.S. attorney for the central district of California, said on social media that the new mask law would have no effect on federal operations. Many California law enforcement groups also oppose the law. And Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, who's running for governor, called it reckless while campaigning Friday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHAD BIANCO: They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks. They didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves. They have a love affair for criminals, and they have an absolute hatred for law enforcement.

ZAVALA: The law could end up in court like other disputes between states and the Trump administration over sanctuary policies and the use of National Guard units. It takes effect next year, and a few other states are considering similar measures.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study published in 2020 found that between 2016 and 2018, ICE detained pregnant women over 4,600 times.
As Congress increased its oversight into the detention of pregnant women, that number dropped to just 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women detained in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024.

SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and 26 other U.S. Senators to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

In a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers urgently requested that ICE stop detaining pregnant women absent exceptional circumstances, and asked the Department to provide information about the number of pregnant women in its custody and the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women who are in ICE detention—as well as answers to a long list of additional oversight questions no later than September 26th.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study published in 2020 found that between 2016 and 2018, ICE detained pregnant women over 4,600 times. As Congress increased its oversight into the detention of pregnant women, that number dropped to just 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women detained in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024. After President Trump took office this year, the Administration stopped providing reports to Congress on the number of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in their custody.

The Senators wrote: “We write to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee site visit and media reports point to the alarming detention of a significant number of pregnant women in ICE custody. We urgently request that ICE cease detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women absent exceptional circumstances and that the agency provide information about the number and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in its custody.”

In their letter, the senators referenced reporting on 911 calls recorded from ICE facilities involving pregnant women in “distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain,” as well as a recent Senate Judiciary Committee staff visit to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, LA that found 14 pregnant women—a shockingly large number—detained at the time of the visit, with many of them receiving little to no medical care.

The Senators continued: “Medical research links ICE detention to high rates of pregnancy complications, with physicians finding serious risks to both fetal and maternal health. These already serious risks are heightened by the deteriorating conditions inside detention facilities, including severe overcrowding, reports of inadequate food and water, and lack of emergency medical care. At this time, we do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing.”

The Senators concluded: “ICE’s own standards are unambiguous on the detention, monitoring, and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in detention. ICE Directive 11032.4, Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant, Postpartum, or Nursing Individuals (2021 Pregnancy Directive), states that ICE should not detain pregnant, postpartum, or nursing individuals except under very limited circumstances. If detention of these individuals is deemed absolutely necessary, the directive provides detailed requirements for ensuring that they are monitored closely, kept in suitable facilities, and given access to both routine and emergency health care… Given the urgent nature of pregnant women’s health and safety needs, we request that you ensure all detention facilities are in full compliance with current law and the 2021 Pregnancy Directive.”

“In defiance of medical evidence counseling against their detention, ICE is horrifically detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in conditions that compromise their physical and mental health. It is clear that ICE is ill-prepared to meet even the minimum healthcare and safety standards for pregnant women in their custody. The National Immigration Law Center calls on Secretary Noem to immediately halt the detention of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women, resume transparent reporting, and ensure full compliance with federal law and agency directives. The health and dignity of these women must no longer be compromised,” said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, Senior Policy Counsel for the National Immigration Law Center.

“U.S. policy makes clear that pregnant, postpartum, and lactating women should not be detained — yet ICE continues to ignore these protections. We continue to hear reports of pregnant women being held in dangerous conditions without adequate food or medical care, putting their health and lives at risk. These harms are occurring in a black box, where we know precious little about immigrant women’s access to healthcare and nutrition. We thank Senators Murray and Blumenthal for demanding that the Department of Homeland Security end this inhumane practice and call for vital transparency around their access to services. Together we must shine a light on detention conditions and ensure these women and their babies are treated with safety, dignity, and humanity,” said Zain Lakhani, Director of Migrant Right and Justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

In addition to Durbin, Murray, and Blumenthal, the following 26 senators also signed onto the letter to Secretary Noem: Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NM), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full text of the letter is available here.

In July, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Florida, providing new incriminating insight into the cruelty of the illegal Trump mass deportation agenda, including overcrowding, inhumane conditions, no access to medical care, and difficulty accessing legal counsel.

In May, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Louisiana and escalated congressional oversight of the Trump Administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration detention, which has created a major financial boon for private prison companies.

Earlier this year, Durbin released a revealing investigative report on inadequate care in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities and pressed for further investigation into deficient medical care in CBP detention facilities after whistleblower reports alleged systemic failures by DHS to ensure proper oversight of its medical care contractor.

Durbin continues to actively investigate care in ICE detention facilities, which he initiated with letters to ICE and GAO. A June 2024 report from the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight found that 95 percent of documented deaths in ICE custody between 2017-2021 were likely preventable.

This oversight work was prompted by the death of Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, an eight-year-old Panamanian girl, at a CBP detention facility in Harlingen, Texas, on May 17, 2023.

Alvarado ICE Detention Center Ambush

What's new:

On Monday, six women were arraigned on charges connected to the ambush-style shooting of an Alvardo police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center on July 4.

They include Savanna Batten, Joy Gibson, Maricela Rueda, Elizabeth Soto, Lynette Sharp, and Rebecca Morgan.

The backstory:

In all, at least 16 people have been charged in the case.

According to the federal complaint, several of the defendants were dressed in black, military-style clothing.

The complaint states that the protestors began shooting fireworks at the detention center. Two people broke off from the main group and began to spray graffiti on vehicles and a guard structure.

Officials believe it was all a ploy to draw ICE detention officers out of the building. Instead, the correctional officers called 911 to report the vandalism.

When the Alvarado police officer arrived, a defendant positioned in the woods shot the officer in the neck. Another assailant across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional officers.

Investigators found AR-style rifles at the scene, two-way radios, and a total of 12 sets of body armor after searching the scene and the defendants' cars.

The complaint said the shooters ran away, but law enforcement officers stopped them.

One attacker had cellphones inside a type of bag that blocks cellphone signals.

The complaint called the attack a conspiracy.

What they're saying:

The six defendants’ supporters strongly dispute the conspiracy claim.

They argue the women were there to attend what they thought would be a peaceful protest.

They did not want to make any official statements after Monday’s arraignment but questioned why the hearings were taking place 11 weeks after the arrests.

The court-appointed attorney for the women also did not want to make any statements yet on what happened.

The attorney said the time was not unusual, given that both state and federal agencies are involved.

His wife Leslie Perlera, an attorney, alleged that Escobar's rights were violated during the operation.
There hasn’t been a time when Hernan felt truly alone because this community has shown up for him,” Popperson told the crowd.
“We've been married for almost a year,” Leslie commented, noting that they will celebrate their first anniversary in October.

His wife Leslie Perlera, an attorney, alleged that Escobar's rights were violated during the operation.

Among the protesters were Margo Lindauer, attorney and law professor; Ashley Popperson, associate minister of Old South Church; Malden City Councilors Carey McDonald and Stephen Windslow; Massachusetts State Rep. Steven Ultrino and Maggie Morgan, managing attorney at Legal Services of Greater Boston. They were joined by family members.

“Here’s what I know. I cannot imagine the terror that he felt. I know that there was not a moment that he was alone. Not really. Although the authorities did all they could to keep him separate from his community, they could not get in the way the love that this community has for one another. They do not have that kind of authority. There hasn’t been a time when Hernan felt truly alone because this community has shown up for him,” Popperson told the crowd.

Shortly after, dressed in black and looking exhausted, Escobar's wife addressed the crowd.

“I want to thank everyone who came here today. I'm trying to memorize everyone who's been here so I can tell him when I talk to him later… he's going to feel as loved, as supported, as wanted as I have felt,” his wife said, getting emotional as she then recounted what her life was like with her “husband and best friend.”

According to Perlera and the legal team at Greater Boston Legal Services, the arrest was violent.

""My husband was still sitting inside the car when I arrived. I had the gun in his face; he didn't want to get out, so they broke the window,” she said.

In response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a statement stating: “Officers took appropriate measures and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation in a manner that ensured the success of the operation and prioritized the safety of the public and our officers.”

An attorney involved in the case asserted that what happened represents a violation of constitutional rights and warned that ICE is detaining many people who, like Escobar, have no criminal record.

“The only thing I asked them was if they had identification. All I wanted to know was who they were and why they stopped him,” Leslie added.

After the arrest, Edgar was taken by ambulance to a hospital for his injuries and later taken to a detention center in Massachusetts.

“We've been married for almost a year,” Leslie commented, noting that they will celebrate their first anniversary in October. She also stated that Edgar is in the process of adjusting his immigration status to obtain residency.

“At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signed unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” DHS said in a statement.

The https://trumpcard.gov/ website went live with new information, outlining three categories of programs:

The Gold Card: Requires a USD $1 million contribution for permanent residency. The website states that the Gold Card is based on the individual’s ability to substantially benefit the United States. Notably there are no tax provisions; applicants would remain subject to worldwide income taxation.

The Platinum Card: Requires a USD $5 million contribution and allows the holder to reside in the United States for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on non-U.S. income. This would replace other temporary visas.

The Trump Corporate Gold Card: Allows a U.S. business to make a USD $2 million contribution to transfer an employee to the United States. This benefit may be transferable to another employee for a fee.

The website states that processing fees and background vetting will occur for all three card types, although no information about the fees or the process has been posted as of the date of this blog. The site also indicates that contributions will be made to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but no information is available about how those funds will be used by the U.S. government. Importantly, this contribution differs from the EB-5 program, where investors may eventually recover their investment funds depending on the success of the business. It also unclear whether the “vetting” will involve a background check, proof of the source of funds ( as required in the EB-5 program), or both. Moreover, there is no mention of dependent applicants or whether family members of the main applicable will receive benefits under the program.

Of particular interest is a statement on the website that a Gold Card will be either an EB-1 or EB-2 preference green card. These categories, and their underlying subcategories of permanent residence, are statutorily authorized by Congress and have specific visa number allocations. It is possible this designation could be challenged in court as outside the authority of the Executive Branch. Additionally, applicants born in Mainland China and India may face significant visa backlogs, as these delays already exist in the EB-1 and EB-2 preference categories.

At this time, it is unknown when the fees or application instructions will be released to the public.

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.","Detainees inside California’s largest immigration detention center are being placed in solitary confinement, experiencing delays in medical care, and facing retaliation from officers for protesting “inhumane” conditions, two detainees told The Fresno Bee.

The detainees are among the 500 or so who’ve been transferred to the newly opened California City Immigration Processing Center, a 2,560-bed U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement detention facility about 70 miles east of Bakersfield.

“The living conditions are inhumane. We have all kinds of health hazards. It’s dirty, they don’t clean up or have any chemicals to clean. It’s unsanitary,” Sokhean Keo, a detainee who was transferred to the facility this month, told a Bee reporter in a phone interview.

Conditions at the 70-acre facility in the Kern County desert have been scrutinized by immigrant rights advocates since Tennessee-based private prison operator CoreCivic began housing undocumented immigrants there in late August.

Kern County-based immigrant rights advocates raised alarm regarding a detainee who was hospitalized this month after he attempted to take his own life. Detainees accuse facility staff of withholding medication.

Last Thursday, more than 100 detained individuals staged sit-ins and refused meals across several housing pods at the sprawling facility in protest over what they describe as widespread poor living conditions, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a Bay Area-based legal aid nonprofit for undocumented immigrants.

One detainee told The Bee that immigrants have been placed on 17-hour lockdowns and pepper-sprayed for participating in the sit-ins.

Attorneys for the nonprofit spoke with California City detainees who alleged officers in riot gear threatened use of force against detainees who participated in a sit-in and placed at least one housing unit on a multi-day lockdown without access to telephones. Immigrants at the facility told the nonprofit that four detainees were handcuffed and placed in solitary confinement, and one person was denied toilet paper by a CoreCivic officer for participating in a hunger strike.

In an email to The Bee, CoreCivic denied the accusations of unsanitary conditions and mistreatment of detainees. The operator said all detainees receive clothing, bedding and toiletries at no cost and have access to medical care and legal resources.

“No detainee has faced prolonged lockdowns of 17 hours or more or have been pepper sprayed for acts of disobedience,” said Brian Todd, a CoreCivic spokesperson.

“CoreCivic takes seriously our obligation to adhere to all applicable federal standards in all our federally contracted facilities, including our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF). All our facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability, including being monitored by federal officials on a daily basis, to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for every individual.”

Detainee says he was threatened with solitary confinement

One of the detainees who spoke with The Bee said he was threatened with solitary confinement the day he was transferred to the California City detention center.

Sokhean Keo was transferred from the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield to the California City facility in early September and has been in ICE detention since January 2023. Keo, an immigrant from Cambodia, said he served time in prison for a “mistake” he made when he was 20 years old and had earned his release in 2023 before ICE agents detained him.

On his first day inside the California City facility, Keo said correctional officers forced him and others to take off their shirts and took pictures of their tattoos. Officers threatened to take Keo to “the hole,” or solitary confinement, unless he admitted to being affiliated with gangs, which he said he is not. Personnel withheld his medication for several days, he said.

“I don’t understand why we’re being threatened for not answering them,” Keo said. “I feel like giving up. There’s no hope for me anymore. Every day I wake up, I’m just sad. It’s horrible.”

The use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has grown exponentially under the second Trump administration, according to a report published Wednesday by the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights.

The sit-ins and meal refusals at California City mirror a broader wave of protests across immigration facilities in California, where an estimated 3,727 undocumented people are under ICE detention, according to a recent analysis of ICE data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. This data does not reflect the current detainee population at California City.

From Adelanto to Mesa Verde and the Golden State Annex, the hunger strikes have been part of a pattern of detainee protests over accusations of inadequate food, facilities and medical care in recent years.

A detainee who identified herself as Loba was detained in January 2024 and held at the Golden State Annex, an ICE facility in McFarland, before her transfer to California City in late August.

Loba said detainees in her dorm have been placed on lockdowns for more than 17 hours, in which they weren’t allowed to leave their sleeping quarters, pepper sprayed and prohibited from participating in Thursday’s sit-ins.

Loba also described severe issues inside the facility, including leaking pipes that flooded cells, food that was water-soaked, and poor food handling and sanitation practices, such as staff not using gloves or hair nets and failing to accommodate people with food allergies.

“It’s already been more than 20 days since I arrived here, and I still haven’t received my psychiatric medication,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing. We’re being locked in for more than a third of the day.”

Todd, the CoreCivic spokesperson, said the facility was impacted by the heavy rains and flash flooding Thursday after remnants of a tropical storm descended on southern California. CoreCivic informed ICE of the situation, and maintenance staff worked to mitigate rising water levels outside the facility and removed any water that seeped into the facility, Todd said.

“No detainees were required to be moved from their assigned living areas during our response,” he said.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment. CoreCivic did not immediately address the allegations of solitary confinement.

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident

Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.

Jeannie Parent, a coordinator with Kern Welcoming and Extending Solidarity to Immigrants, said one of her volunteers spoke with a detainee who said someone tried to take their own life.

The details weren’t immediately clear. CoreCivic confirmed to The Bee that there was an incident of self-harm.

In a Sept. 11 statement, Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said that on the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 9, a staff member called a medical emergency “after finding an individual inside of his living area who was observed trying to harm himself.”

The responding staff called for emergency medical services to respond to the facility, who transported the individual to a local hospital for assessment and possible treatment.

“Our government partners at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were notified immediately of this incident,” Gustin said.

California City mayor says conditions are humane

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins toured the ICE detention facility on Sept. 9 in what he described as an “oversight assessment.”

Detainees had access to dental, medical, psychiatric care, he said. He also said detainees wear either blue or brown uniforms, depending on whether they have a prior criminal conviction.

He said the conditions there appeared to be humane.

Hawkins acknowledged that the facility opened without the proper city permits and that the legal team is looking into levying daily fines.

“We are exploring all options related to CoreCivic not being in compliance with municipal code,” Hawkins said. “As a city, we have to respond to that.”

He also said he spoke with a representative from California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office last week regarding the ICE detention facility “and other matters.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.","Free press advocates and lawyers for metro Atlanta journalist Mario Guevara are fighting to keep him in the United States after the Board of Immigration Appeals last week ordered he be deported to his native El Salvador.

Why it matters: Monday marked roughly 100 days since Guevara, a prominent Spanish-speaking journalist who founded digital media outlet MG News, was arrested while reporting at a protest in DeKalb County.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Georgia said it filed a temporary restraining order to halt the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling Friday that Guevara must be returned to El Salvador.

The ACLU told Axios in a statement that it's concerned Guevara ""could be removed at any time because he remains in detention.""

What they're saying: Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of Digital Justice and Civil Rights at Free Press, an advocacy organization, said a coalition of over 25 human rights and press freedom groups is calling for Guevara's release.

Guevara is believed to be the only journalist who has been detained by ICE in the U.S. in connection with his work.

Benavidez said the government has tried to portray Guevara's activities ""as somehow dangerous, criminal or illegal.""

""It's really a case about this journalist who was … targeted because of his filming of police and ICE,"" Benavidez said. ""And so it feels like it's part of a much broader censorship regime that we're seeing.""

State of play: Guevara wrote in a letter published Monday on MG News' website that his arrest and ongoing detention have crushed his dignity ""because I've been humiliated by both federal and local authorities, and I don't believe I deserve it.""

""Life isn't always fair,"" Guevara wrote. ""If I'm deported, I'll leave with my head held high, because I'm convinced it's for carrying out my journalistic work, not for committing crimes.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.

In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets.
At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment.
“Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.
She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.","Democrats have urged treasury watchdogs to investigate reports that Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent in return for political favours.

In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets. The justice department subsequently shut down a bribery investigation.

On Monday, Congressman Dave Min of California, a member of the House of Representatives oversight committee, wrote to treasury inspector general Russell George and treasury inspector general for tax administration Russell Martin to call for scrutiny of whether Homan reported the payment and whether it was connected to his private consulting firm.

“History suggests that we should follow the money – especially if it went unreported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” wrote Min, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s Fighting Corruption Taskforce. “Under federal law, all income, legal or illegal, must be reported to the IRS, including payments stemming from bribery.

“Knowingly failing to report this income would likely violate federal tax law. Accordingly, I request that your offices investigate whether Mr Homan properly reported this payment on his 2024 federal tax return.”

Homan oversees the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. An unapologetic immigration hardliner, he explained a decision to defy a court order that barred the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members by stating: “I don’t care what the judges think.”

Homan was previously an official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) under Barack Obama and its acting director in Trump’s first term. During Trump’s four years out of power, he ran a consulting business to help companies obtain immigration-related government contracts.

In the recorded sting operation, Homan accepted a $50,000 bribe contained in a bag from the restaurant chain Cava, claiming he would keep the money in a trust until he had completed his service in the Trump administration, a source told the Reuters news agency.

Homan was then investigated for bribery and other crimes but this was shut down after Trump took office, reportedly because he did not hold a government position at the time and because of the difficulty of proving that he had agreed to carry out any specific acts in exchange for the money.

At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment. “Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.

“The White House and the president stand by Tom Homan 100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong,” Leavitt added. She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.

But Carol Leonnig, one of the MSNBC journalists who broke the story, responded on social media: “White House spokesperson says that Homan never took $50,000; we reviewed internal document saying Homan accepted the cash payment from undercover FBI agents in September 2024.”

Political pressure on Homan is mounting. On Sunday Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, posted on the X platform: “The act was caught on camera. The administration must turn over the tapes to Congress. Every decision made by Homan must be scrutinized for possible corruption.”

Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut added on Monday: “$50,000 cash in a bag – clearly Border Czar Tom Homan isn’t afraid to solicit personal payments in exchange for government favors. Trump leaders aren’t serving the country – they’re failing it, putting personal profit first. Another example of rampant corruption in this admin.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9aaf9b2451a8ec78befb78e892d5c295e4df3f/730_0_5706_4565/master/5706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=066d2b8113391f95556a467bf4537b55",N,,2025-09-22 17:56:51.851117

In addition to granting Trump’s request to a stay lower court ruling reinstating FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, the court also said it will hear oral arguments in December on officially overturning Humphrey’s.
The majority did not offer a legal explanation in exempting Trump from standing court precedent.
“The President cannot, as he concededly did here, fire an FTC Commissioner without any reason,” Kagan wrote.
These consequential emergency rulings have often left lower court judges in a bind, not knowing whether they should follow formal court precedent or the majority’s shadow docket orders — which are not binding legal precedent.","The Supreme Court Monday upheld President Donald Trump’s dismissal without cause of the last Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) despite nearly a century of court precedent protecting the official.

The court’s 6-3 decision is the court’s strongest signal yet that it may overturn Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., a 90-year-old ruling that until recently largely protected independent agencies from undue political interference stemming from the White House.

In addition to granting Trump’s request to a stay lower court ruling reinstating FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, the court also said it will hear oral arguments in December on officially overturning Humphrey’s.

The majority did not offer a legal explanation in exempting Trump from standing court precedent.

Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, heavily rebuked the court for granting the stay while Humphrey’s remained precedent.

“The President cannot, as he concededly did here, fire an FTC Commissioner without any reason,” Kagan wrote. “To reach a different result requires reversing the rule stated in Humphrey’s: It entails overriding rather than accepting Congress’s judgment about agency design.”

“The majority may be raring to take that action, as its grant of certiorari before judgment suggests. But until the deed is done, Humphrey controls, and prevents the majority from giving the President the unlimited removal power Congress denied him.”

In her dissent, Kagan also echoed complaints and frustrations that several federal judges have raised about the majority’s use of the court’s emergency — or “shadow” — docket.

Dozens of times now, the court has granted the president broad exemptions from normal legal and legislative procedures and given him extraordinary control over the executive branch — often without detailing their reasoning.

These consequential emergency rulings have often left lower court judges in a bind, not knowing whether they should follow formal court precedent or the majority’s shadow docket orders — which are not binding legal precedent.

“Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” Kagan wrote. “Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”

For 45 years, the U.S. Catholic Church has celebrated National Migration Week, which has traditionally been linked to the Vatican’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees (WDMR), as an opportunity for the Church to reflect on the circumstances confronting migrants and to engage in prayer and action for those who are forced to flee their homes. In solidarity with the Vatican, National Migration Week will use the theme chosen by Pope Leo XIV of “Migrants, missionaries of hope.”

WDMR typically occurs on the last Sunday of September, however, this year it will take place on Oct. 4-5 to coincide with the Jubilee of Migrants that will include meetings and festivities in the presence of the Holy Father. On Oct. 5 at 10:30 a.m. (Rome time), Pope Leo XIV will celebrate Mass for the Jubilee of the Missionary World and the Jubilee of Migrants at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.

“As Pope Leo’s theme of ‘Migrants, missionaries of hope’ reminds us, our migrant brothers and sisters are not strangers; they are family in Christ,” said Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, archbishop of Chicago. “They enrich our Church and serve as a reminder that the gospel knows no borders and that God’s love is for all people.”

National Migration Week culminates locally on Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025, with a 5:15 p.m. Mass at Holy Name Cathedral, 735 N. State St., Chicago. Bishop Lawrence J. Sullivan, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago, will preside over the Mass that will begin with a procession of nations representing 15 countries and feature readings and prayers in nine languages including English, Spanish, Polish, Italian, Swahili, Filipino, Bahasa (a language spoken in Indonesia), Luganda (a language spoken in central Uganda) and Vietnamese. A parishioner of St. Anne Parish in Barrington will offer a testimony of the collaborative immigrant ministry with Holy Family Parish in Inverness.

The Archdiocese of Chicago’s National Pastoral Migratoria (Immigrant Social Ministry) has coordinated a comprehensive effort with other U.S. dioceses which have Pastoral Migratoria to raise awareness about National Migration Week. In the dioceses of New York, Newark , Baltimore, Orange, Calif., Stockton, Calif. and Joliet, Ill., Pastoral Migratoria leaders are coordinating rosaries, legal clinics, health fairs, holy hours, forums, and other events to support the immigrant community. The dioceses of Los Angeles, Newark and Washington, D.C., will hold Masses in observance of National Migration Week.

In his message for the 111th World Day of Migrants and Refugees 2025, Pope Leo XIV said the observance offers us an opportunity to reflect on the connections between hope, migration and mission. The Holy Father said in part, “In a world darkened by war and injustice, even when all seems lost, migrants and refugees stand as messengers of hope. Their courage and tenacity bear heroic testimony to a faith that sees beyond what our eyes can see and gives them the strength to defy death on the various contemporary migration routes.”

He added, “Faced with frightening scenarios and the possibility of global devastation, it is important that there be a growing desire in people’s hearts for a future of peace and of respect for the dignity of all.”

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops encourages Catholic communities to come together as a universal Church to welcome immigrants and refugees in local parishes, dioceses and broader communities to reflect on the circumstances confronting migrants and to pray for and act on the circumstances confronting migrants, including immigrants, refugees, children, and victims and survivors of human trafficking, and to stand in solidarity with them.",https://www.archchicago.org,N,,2025-09-22 16:57:56.211233

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehemently condemns California Governor Gavin Newsom for signing the “No Secret Police Act,” which further demonizes law enforcement and attempts to ban law enforcement from being able to protect their identities to keep them from being targeted by cartels, criminal rings, terrorists, and doxxed online.

This stunt comes as our ICE officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicles being used as weapons towards them, and doxing campaigns targeting federal officers and their families. When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists. Our officers also wear vests marked with ICE/ERO or Homeland Security and are flanked by vehicles marked with the name of the department.

“Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom’s unconstitutional ban.”

Despite these obstacles from Governor Newsom, ICE continues to put the safety of Californians first and remove violent criminal illegal aliens from the streets of California. Below are examples of some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested in California since January 20, 2025, who Governor Newsom’s sanctuary policies protect at the expense of the American people:

In response to the protests, President Donald Trump later deployed approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to the city without the consent of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Later, 700 active-duty Marines were sent to the region. A small number of troops remain stationed in the city.

Trump has defended the deployment, saying he “saved” Los Angeles after the Supreme Court cleared the way for federal agents to continue conducting sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles by lifting a restraining order from a judge who found “roving patrols” were leading to indiscriminate arrests.

A US State Department “concept note” for the event outlines an approach that seems determined to run roughshod over the rights of refugees.

This is happening parallel to an executive order that requires a national-interests review of all conventions and treaties the United States has joined.

Alarmingly, the US State Department’s list of the “core principles” in its concept note fails to include the principle of nonrefoulement, which holds that refugees cannot be returned to places where they would likely be persecuted, the foundation of the global refugee system.

The note asserts that “every nation has the absolute right to control its borders.” While international law is highly deferential to states in controlling their borders, the principle of nonrefoulement maintains that states don’t have unfettered discretion to push people away.

Everyone’s right “to seek and enjoy asylum in other countries from persecution” is the flip side of nonrefoulement. If countries are prohibited from sending someone to a place where they would be tortured or persecuted, they need to afford them a way to secure protection.

The US concept note contends that “asylum is a temporary, not permanent, status, and that asylees should ultimately return home.” But in reality, that depends on the home country situation. If the threats and harm that caused someone to flee their country are unchanged, or get worse, sending them back is not an option.

The note also asserts that “sovereign states, not transnational bodies, make the determination whether conditions in a country of origin permit return.” True, but in making refugee determinations in good faith, states should respect assessments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, whose determinations are guided by its mandate, whereas states often have conflicting interests.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/09/202509afr_libya_coast_guard_interception.jpg?h=53227e21&itok=sw49CGoq,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:10.659203

Founded in 2023, Wasatch Immigration Project said it quickly saw demand for legal assistance exceed the service capacity of its four part-time volunteer attorneys. The project opened its Park City office in June 2024 and, in its first full year of operation, represented 266 clients and filed over 350 applications or other legal forms. The firm ended 2024 with over 150 people on its wait list and said it saw a surge in need in early 2025 due to changes to immigration policy and enforcement.

“It is a scary time for many members of our community who are trying to navigate the immigration system,” said Maggie AbuHaidar, executive director and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. “In order to reach more people, more quickly, we have been working hard to raise the funds needed to grow our legal team.”

With individual donations and grants from the Utah Bar Foundation and Park City Community Foundation, the firm hired its first full-time attorney, Laura Rojas, in March. Although Laura has helped the team put procedures in place to reduce its waitlist, many individuals and families who live and work in the Wasatch Back are still waiting to be seen — and many more call every day asking for help, the firm said.

“With generous support from community members, a special service contract from Park City, and recent grants from the Women’s Giving Fund, the Marriott Daughters Foundation, and the Promontory Foundation, we have now expanded our legal team again with the hire of two new full-time attorneys, Jessica Hamilton and Kaite Hogan,” said AbuHaidar.

Hamilton and Hogan both graduated from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah in May and sat for the Utah Bar exam in July. They both learned that they passed the Bar just last week.

After graduating from the University of Kansas, Hamilton spent two years in Washington, D.C. working for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal services to undocumented minors in detention. For two years during law school, she directed the Pro Bono Initiative Immigration Clinic, a monthly legal clinic staffed by Utah attorneys to provide pro bono legal advice to immigrants. Hamilton was recently profiled by the law school for her work in expanding access to justice.

“As someone deeply committed to immigrant justice,” Hamilton said, “I’m honored to join the (Wasatch Immigration Project) team and stand with families in the Wasatch Back as they navigate the complex immigration system. I look forward to helping (Wasatch Immigration Project) expand its capacity so that even more families can access the legal support and representation they deserve.”

Hailing from Washington state, Hogan graduated from Utah State University before attending law school. She focused her law school studies on immigration law, completing multiple intern placements with renowned local immigration law firms and nonprofits, including Gardner & Taylor, Stowell Crayk, Catholic Community Services, and No Mas. Just prior to graduation, the law school’s alumni honored Hogan with its Outstanding 3L Colleague Award.

When asked why she chose to focus on immigration law, Hogan said, “It is to the detriment of our society to ignore the plight of a minority for the easy routine of the majority.”

Working for Wasatch Immigration Project was the “right fit” for her, she said, because “the organization has chosen to support all members of our community and make the continual effort to uphold basic human rights.”

“Kaite and Jessica are joining WIP with a demonstrated passion for the work we do and the clients we serve, as well as a level of practical experience unusual for recent law school grads,” AbuHaidar explained, adding, “So, they will be able to hit the ground running, which is good, because running is all we have been doing since January.”

In addition to hiring two new Staff Attorneys, WIP hired its first full-time paralegal, Yoselyn Monsalve, in May and added a part-time paralegal, Santiago Carvajal, in August. Both law school graduates in their countries of origin, Monsalve and Carvajal are unable to practice law in the United States, but are “contributing a wealth of knowledge, experience,

perspective, energy, and compassion to WIP’s legal team,” said AbuHaidar.

With these new hires over the last six months, WIP has transitioned from a nearly all volunteer-driven organization to an established non-profit law firm. “Once we understood the need in the community, the transition was necessary to make the organization as sustainable as possible,” said John Sharkey, WIP Board Chair and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. AbuHaidar added, “Frankly, it is hard to imagine how we were functioning before expanding our team. And we could not have done any of this without the overwhelming support of the Park City community.”

“They say this is undermining the work of local law enforcement who, in many cases, have had to work really hard to build trust in their communities,” she said.
In March, the Trump administration cut staff to DHS’s Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Affairs — which investigated civil rights complaints filed by the public related to DHS and ICE enforcement.","Some of the images look like World War II recruiting posters. Uncle Sam asking you to defend the homeland.

Others reference a glorified version of the past. White settlers traveling across the planes toward their Manifest Destiny as Native Americans retreat to the shadows.

These are the words and images the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using to recruit more than 10,000 Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents by the end of the year, which would make it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government. DHS is also offering signing bonuses of $50,000, student loan repayment and starting salaries as high as $80,000.

These posts have millions of views on social media platforms like X. Experts who study extremist groups are flagging them as dangerous.

Pete Simi is a sociologist at Chapman University who has been studying extremist groups and violence for more than 25 years.

“Propaganda is an art,” he said. “It’s a very powerful way of communicating and it typically obscures the truth. When it’s done effectively, it makes it hard to call it out.”

Ambiguity plays a major role in white supremacist messaging because it allows whoever posts hateful rhetoric to hide behind plausible deniability, Simi said.

Coded language

Simi went on to say that someone who isn’t versed in far-right extremist culture will see an image of Uncle Sam and won’t think twice about it. But the posts DHS is using to recruit ICE agents can be interpreted through a white nationalist lens.

For example, the caption on the post showing settlers expanding westward, the words heritage and homeland are capitalized.

“In white supremacist circles, H.H. stands for Heil Hitler,” Simi said.

Also, the caption contains exactly 14 words, which is a symbolically significant number for people who follow that ideology.

White nationalists use messaging with 14 words as a hidden reference to a famous phrase from the 1980s: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”

“It became one of the most central slogans among white supremacists,” Simi said. “They reference it in everything from tattoos, to t-shirts, to emails. It’s just ubiquitous among these folks.”

ICE did not respond to questions from KPBS about the agency’s recruitment efforts and concerns raised by experts like Simi.

Because ambiguity is such a big part of extremist communications, the messages can be interpreted in a variety of ways, Simi said. Whoever posted the image can simply say people are overreacting — it’s just an old painting with a caption that happens to have 14 words.

Which means academics or members of the media cannot say for sure whether something is explicitly supporting extremist ideology.

“Unless you’re able to find the person who created that post and they were to admit that this was intentional, it’s hard to ever definitively say,” Simi said.

Cautionary tale

Historically, the federal government has struggled with rapid expansions to law enforcement agencies.

In the mid-2000s, when Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) workforce grew by 20,000, anti-corruption measures took a back seat to the hiring spree, according to a 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

At the time, agency policy required every employee to undergo an internal affairs review every five years to ensure they were still fit for service.

But CBP employees responsible for those reviews said they conducted ""few periodic reinvestigations during fiscal years 2006 to 2010 because resources were focused on meeting mandated hiring goals,” according to the report.

By 2010, the agency had a backlog of 15,000 investigations, according to the report.

During the hiring binge , criminal organizations like drug cartels tried to infiltrate the agency. The 2012 report also notes that corruption convictions among CBP agents increased during that time.

ICE did not respond to questions asking what measure they have in place to ensure standards do not drop during the current expansion.

A change in standards

ICE’s current expansion comes at a unique time for the agency, according to experts like Allie Preston, who studies law enforcement as a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

“It has turned into a militarized, authoritarian form of policing and I really think it will damage this institution’s ability to continue,” Preston said.

While polling shows there is broad support for arresting and deporting immigrants convicted of violent crime, there is significantly less support for masked agents stopping anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally — even if they have no criminal record.

As part of her research, Preston regularly interviews retired local and federal police officers. Lately, they’ve told her that ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics are eroding trust between communities and law enforcement.

“They say this is undermining the work of local law enforcement who, in many cases, have had to work really hard to build trust in their communities,” she said.

In addition to the deteriorating trust, Preston is also concerned about the fact that ICE has already lowered hiring, training and oversight standards.

The agency waived age restrictions that previously required applicants to be older than 21 and younger than 37 or 40 depending on the role. DHS officials also cut down ICE’s 18-week training course to eight weeks, and waived Spanish-language requirements, vehicle pursuit courses and other training.

In March, the Trump administration cut staff to DHS’s Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Affairs — which investigated civil rights complaints filed by the public related to DHS and ICE enforcement.

“In light of everything that’s happened, it’s really like a perfect storm of different circumstances that are making policing more dangerous for communities and really undermining the roles that they are supposed to be playing,” Preston said.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/6c44b3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+725/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fb3%2Fdca601b94a6fa0fe12809c9a6932%2Funclesam.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:28.159556

UN Member States, the UN itself, civil society around the world and in the United States, and U.S. leaders who understand the essential role of human rights and the rule of law have a critical role to play in standing up for multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties that protect the human rights of people everywhere.

In the wake of an executive order issued in February, the Trump administration has conducted a “review” to determine “which organizations, conventions, and treaties are contrary to the interests of the United States and whether such organizations, conventions, or treaties can be reformed.” That order also stated that the U.S. would not participate in the UN Human Rights Council, would not fund UNRWA, and would review membership in UNESCO, from which it subsequently withdrew. Among the many treaties that the U.S. has ratified or signed are core multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties. While the order called for review within 180 days, the results of the review—if indeed it is finalized—have not been publicly reported.

In August 2025, the United States decided to refuse to participate in its own Universal Periodic Review (UPR) before the UN Human Rights Council, an unprecedented and damaging step to human rights accountability. On September 12, 2025, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is trying to enlist UN Member states in an effort to undo legal norms and agreements that protect refugees from persecution, and plans an event during the UN General Assembly to advance its efforts. The report also indicated that there had been no signs of broad support for the plan. Trump administration nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration testified on September 11 that he would seek to work with other countries to build support for “reform” of international agreements and norms on migration.

True reform does not tear down multilateral international treaties and endanger human lives. Indeed, the Trump administration’s plan for refugees fleeing persecution appears designed to abandon refugees to persecution. Whatever label is slapped on the initiative, the reality is that the Trump administration approach is to cut aid and resettlement that helps other countries host refugees, block people seeking refuge from U.S. asylum, end temporary protections despite ongoing dangers, and subject people seeking U.S. asylum to enforced disappearances, refoulement to torture and persecution, family separations, due process denials, and arbitrary detention in horrible conditions. While banning refugees from resettlement, the administration is ramping up efforts to resettle white Afrikaners. This right-violating approach should not be exported to other countries.

Policies and systems can be strengthened through genuine reforms that adhere to the law and protect lives. By contrast, steps towards undermining or withdrawing from refugee, human rights, and/or humanitarian treaties would threaten the human rights and safety of people around the world and undermine international law, stability, peace, and prosperity.

These pieces of legislation rely on white supremacist tropes that portray immigrant men and men of color as predatory and violent toward white American women.
Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women.","In July, President Trump and Congressional Republicans rammed through a sweeping budget bill that invests over $100 billion in ICE and border enforcement. In recent months, ICE agents — often masked, wearing plain clothes, and without anything to outwardly identify them as agents — have escalated their campaign of terror on immigrant communities at the direction of this administration, worsened after Trump rescinded policies that once restricted immigration enforcement in locations like domestic violence shelters, hospitals, and churches. Predictably, all of this has resulted in chaos and devastating state-inflicted violence — and a chilling rise in civilian violence against women.

A letter from the Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC) addressed to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials, which was shared with HuffPost, alleges that civilian men are impersonating ICE agents to kidnap and sexually assault immigrant women. It wouldn’t be difficult to do as ICE agents increasingly wear plain clothes, conceal their faces to avoid accountability, and are not required to wear paraphernalia to identify themselves as officers. ICE has also directed its agents to detain undocumented people they encounter incidentally, even if the agents don’t have an arrest warrant.

The allegations are horrifying: A North Carolina man has been accused of posing as an ICE agent, threatening to deport an immigrant woman, then kidnapping and raping her; police in New York are searching for a man suspected of posing as an ICE agent, assaulting and trying to rape a woman, before robbing her and fleeing the scene in broad daylight.

“All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles,” the DWC wrote in an August letter to the administration. “We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed. Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks, plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles — tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public.”

Lawmakers in the California legislature and in Congress have introduced legislation to address horrific scenarios like these, by requiring ICE agents to have proper identification and prohibit them from covering their faces. This could be a step in the right direction.

But we can’t bury the deeper, driving forces behind why this is happening. This phenomenon is only possible because of the outsized power that state agents — ICE, police officers, prison staff — have always had to abuse and control women and victims' bodies. Civilians are impersonating state agents to assault vulnerable women and victims because state agents — under every presidential administration — have always been able to do this.

The reason civilians would even think to pose as state agents to get away with sexual violence is that, nationwide, state power in a range of forms is routinely wielded to perpetrate gender-based violence. Unmasking ICE agents is important, but it’s a Band-Aid on a broader, systemic crisis.

Sexual abuse, often inflicted on children, is rampant across the immigrant detainment system. In one survey, 40% of police officers self-reported acting violently toward their spouses or children, and 60% of prison rapes are committed by guards and staff.

Sexual assault is the second-most common form of police misconduct, according to one study. From 2013 to 2014, an Oklahoma City police officer, Daniel Holtzclaw, was accused by 13 Black women of exploiting his state power to sexually abuse them. (Holtzclaw was ultimately convicted of assaulting eight of those women, and sentenced to 263 years in prison.) Over the last decade, cops in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, and other states have similarly been ousted after being accused by local women of stalking or harassment.

It wasn’t until 2022 that Congress passed the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act, ending a practice that previously allowed cops to defend themselves from allegations of sexually abusing people in their custody by claiming the encounter was consensual — which, some legal experts have argued, is impossible due to the massive power disparity between a state agent and a detainee. BuzzFeed reported in 2018 that 35 states have no laws to prohibit supposedly “consensual” sex between police officers and a person in custody.

All too often the government and legal system enact violence on victims while protecting assailants, which amounts to state violence: In one survey, about a quarter of victims who called 911 due to a domestic violence incident reported being arrested or threatened with arrest themselves. It is estimated that just 3% of rapists will ever spend a day in prison, while a 1999 survey of a women's maximum security prison in New York found that 90% of incarcerated women were survivors.

Outside of directly carceral contexts, just look at abortion bans, which grant lawmakers sweeping access to and power over our bodies. In 2020, a whistleblower alleged that a doctor at an immigrant detainment center had nonconsensually sterilized women; ultimately over 40 women claimed that they’d been subjected to invasive medical procedures while in ICE custody.

To be clear, men wouldn’t be posing as ICE agents and assaulting women if ICE didn’t exist. Its very existence — and the vile policing of immigrants in this nation altogether — dehumanizes immigrants and renders them exponentially more vulnerable to a range of violent acts, including gender-based violence.

Laws like the Laken Riley Act — which subject any undocumented immigrant who is merely accused of one of several crimes such as shoplifting to potential, indefinite detainment — are devastating for immigrant domestic violence victims, whose abusers or traffickers can potentially threaten to report them for made-up crimes if they don’t comply, experts have warned.

The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, introduced in January, would similarly render immigrant abuse victims exponentially more vulnerable to detainment, should their abusers wield the common abusive tactic DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim-Offender) to accuse them of abuse.

These pieces of legislation rely on white supremacist tropes that portray immigrant men and men of color as predatory and violent toward white American women. There is no crime statistic that could ever justify this nation’s shameful treatment of immigrants — and, that said, US citizens are substantially more likely to be the perpetrators of violent crime than noncitizens.

Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women. And the Trump administration is shipping immigrant men to horrific, foreign prisons that effectively operate as torture sites — in some cases to face brutal sexual violence — and wielding any imperfection in an immigrant's record to justify it, much like how our patriarchal society treats rape victims who are “imperfect” victims.

Among the most upsetting aspects of this rising crisis of violence against immigrants and women is how predictable it was. Of course men believe that if they pose as the state they can perpetrate the same violence the state often does to terrorize and violate women and victims, especially victims in more precarious positions. But unmasking ICE isn’t enough. The agency must be abolished, and the root causes of state and carceral violence must be addressed.","https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68d16d1fae58da46c3dc9463/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/2233847009",N,,2025-09-22 15:57:00.682068

NEW YORK – Last week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York rejected a discovery request by an individual sanctioned for violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank that would have undermined established protections for civil society groups and threatened their ability to continue their advocacy work without fear of irreparable harm. The court adopted arguments advanced by the organization targeted by the request, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), and an amicus brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), and Human Rights First.

“The court’s decision affirms DAWN’s right to engage in research, reporting, and advocacy without coercive interference by people who disagree with its speech. NGOs should never be forced to comply with this kind of abusive request, and this decision will allow human rights organizations’ work to continue providing accountability for human rights abuses,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

The court found that DAWN did not have to comply with a discovery request filed by Isaac Levi Pilant, dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who was previously sanctioned under the West Bank sanctions program. DAWN had publicly recommended that the U.S. government impose sanctions on him and others for documented violence against Palestinians. After President Trump effectively terminated the program, Pilant filed an application against DAWN and its executive director, Sarah Leah Whitson, pursuant to a U.S. law that provides a mechanism for foreign litigants to obtain discovery from people and entities in the United States. He sought a court order for an extremely wide set of information related to DAWN’s investigation of Pilant and its sanctions advocacy efforts for use in a possible future defamation case in Israel against Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization.

“This ruling confirms that foreign litigants cannot exploit our courts to silence NGOs that report on human rights abuses and advocate for accountability,” said Bobby Hodgson, assistant legal director at the NYCLU. “The Constitution protects organizations like DAWN from being forced to reveal confidential aspects of their work. The discovery process cannot sidestep the First Amendment — and we’re glad the court agrees.”

The court’s decision reflected the arguments put forth in the supporting amicus brief. The court found that various protections, including the reporter’s privilege and statutory provisions, barred it from granting the discovery requested. It further found that Pilant had failed to demonstrate how the requested information was relevant to contemplated litigation against a different organization in Israeli court.

As explained in the ACLU and HRF amicus brief, the U.S. government has established frameworks and processes to encourage nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to share sensitive information that can assist it in more effectively implementing various human rights and corruption sanctions and visa restriction programs. Undermining the protections for NGOs to securely and confidentially share this information would not only impact the ability of the U.S. government to use such tools to hold human rights abusers and corrupt actors accountable, but it would also put NGOs, victims of abuse, and others in civil society in jeopardy by opening them up to retaliation and harassment from people they accuse of human rights violations.

The brief further argued that Pilant’s broad discovery request implicates information protected under the First Amendment and the reporter’s privilege, which provide grounds to reject his request under the relevant discovery statute.

The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.
That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.
Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.
“U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.” Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.","This story was originally reported by The 19th.

Immigrant women were facing high rates of domestic violence, and yet the fear of deportation and lack of trust in police was so pervasive it kept many of them from reporting the crimes to law enforcement. That made it “virtually impossible” to hold many perpetrators accountable, Congress found.

In response, lawmakers from both parties created two new visas: U visas for victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes, and T visas for victims of human trafficking. About 3 in 5 U and T visa applicants are immigrant women.

Twenty-five years later, the programs are bogged down by lengthy wait times, which have grown to over a decade. Now, with President Donald Trump back in office, they’re also facing an existential threat.

At the center are thousands of immigrants who have been trafficked or have been the victim of a violent crime, who reported that crime to law enforcement, and who bear the physical or mental scars of that crime — all requirements to obtain one of these visas. Their lives remain stuck in limbo as they await a decision, now more vulnerable to detention and deportation due to Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s second term and whose architects hold high-ranking roles in his administration, calls for the total elimination of the two visas, concluding that “victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit.”

Until then, the blueprint calls on the president and federal agencies to use their power to “significantly restrict” access to the programs. Data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lawyers working with crime victims and gender-based violence advocates say that work toward that goal is already underway. Similar efforts were undertaken in Trump’s first term, when, for example, a new policy was quietly rolled out that rejected any application with a blank space — even if it was something simple, like a middle name section left blank because the applicant didn’t have one. The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.

Since Trump’s second inauguration, the administration’s close cooperation with local police to help with immigration enforcement, layoffs at the agency that handles visa applications and the stripping away of policies that protected applicants from deportation have all had a chilling effect on new applications and could be exacerbating processing delays for new applications.

“I’m concerned that what we’re seeing is the early days of a multifaceted effort to chip away at these programs — make them less accessible, less desirable, less functional,” said Kursten Phelps, a lawyer with the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that offers legal and social services to immigrant women and girls.

Data from January through March published by the agency that handles these visas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), shows a sharp drop off in U visa applications, which are granted to immigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes who cooperate with police. The data shows that while T visa applications for human trafficking victims remained steady, the agency approved far fewer applications than it had previously, despite a growing backlog.

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement makes it easy for abusers to use the fear of deportation as a tool for coercion. That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.

“I would love a world in which we don't need the T and the U visa. That is the world I am working towards, where we have a fair and honest immigration system that … can’t be used as a weapon against immigrants,” said Bruggeman, the executive director of Freedom Network USA, a nonprofit focused on human trafficking.

Until then, she said, “we at least have to protect the brave victims and survivors who come forward and ask for our help.”

Reporting crimes and applying for a visa is riskier under Trump

Denisse, now 40, immigrated from Mexico in the mid-1990s seeking safety and better work opportunities. She met her future partner while working at a restaurant in New York City. The pair dated and eventually welcomed two daughters. Her first pregnancy, Denisse said, marked the beginning of years of beatings, verbal abuse and rape. Once, Denisse said, her partner threatened to kill her with a screwdriver. On another occasion, she found he had taken photos of her undressed; he threatened to distribute them to friends and family, which left her with a lasting fear of hidden cameras.

After a night of beatings and strangulation in 2015, Denisse decided to call the police. “I just thought, ‘No more. He’s going to kill me.’” The 19th is not publishing Denisse’s last name out of concern for her safety.

She was hesitant to press charges — Denisse had little support or financial stability, was not authorized to live or work in the United States, and was afraid of losing custody of her two daughters. Eventually, she decided to help the authorities prosecute her former partner, and was counseled by social workers about the U visa. She submitted an application in 2018, and by 2023, had received a “bona fide determination” — an acknowledgement that Denisse had met the basic criteria for the visa.

That determination came with a work permit and deferred immigration enforcement while she waits for a final decision on her case. The long wait times have taken a toll.

“I’m living in the in-between,” she said. With Trump’s inauguration, that limbo has become scarier: She fears that she is no longer safe from being detained, deported and separated from her children, especially since her pending application makes her visible to federal immigration officials.

“I’ve heard of people being detained, even having a work permit like me,” she said. “I can feel the fear creeping in.”

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say that the Trump administration’s policies are making it riskier for victims to reach out to law enforcement and submit visa applications, challenging the goals of a program approved by Congress with bipartisan support.

Kinda Velloza, an immigration attorney based in the Atlanta metro area, said reaching out to law enforcement — already a difficult task for many victims — has become a scarier proposition since the Trump administration began working with local police to enforce immigration laws. That’s especially true if immigrants perceive their locality as being hostile to immigrants.

“If they are victims of crime, they're not calling law enforcement — they're not going over there to report anything,” Velloza said. “So, I think we're going to see a decline in new visa filings because nobody's just voluntarily putting themselves in the U.S. immigration system right now.”

A spring 2025 survey of 170 advocates and lawyers for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence and human trafficking, conducted by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, found that more than three-quarters said their clients had concerns about contacting the police. Victims have long been hesitant to contact law enforcement, but Trump’s immigration agenda is challenging advocates’ long-held advice to always seek help.

One advocate in the report said they watched a human trafficking victim with no criminal record be detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The incident has made them question whether it is advisable to tell victims that it’s safe to seek help from law enforcement.

Data from DHS confirm applications for U visas have slowed. In the first three months of the year — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term — applications for U visas fell by almost half from the previous three months. Approvals and denials continued at a similar rate.

The data is an early glimpse into the program under Trump. Advocates for immigrant victims point to two policy changes that could contribute to the chilling effect. First, the Trump administration rolled out new guidance in February telling ICE officers that they don’t have to actively check if someone has a pending U or T visa while carrying out arrests — meaning that they could be more easily detained and deported by ICE.

The administration also reinstated a policy from Trump’s first term that allows ICE to immediately start deportation proceedings against people who are denied a U or T visa. Phelps said the policy is already leading to arrests of U and T visa applicants, and complicates an immigrant’s decision to apply for the program in the first place.

That deportation policy was shown to have a particularly strong impact on human trafficking applicants. A 2022 report out of Boston University based on DHS data and a survey of close to 200 legal experts working with T visa applicants found that while applications under the program had been rising since 2008, they decreased dramatically after the new deportation policy went into effect. Between 2019 and 2021, DHS sent “Notices to Appear” — the letter that triggers deportation proceedings — to nearly 2,000 U and T visa applicants.

Wait times have long plagued the programs

Luz, an immigrant from Ecuador with two children born in the United States, has waited nearly five years for the initial determination in her case and accompanying work permit — just the first step in a long journey to possibly obtaining a U visa.

USCIS estimated last year that the median wait time for a U visa was over six years; for a T visa, it was about 15 months. But lawyers who file these applications say the waits can be much longer. The Domestic Violence Project at the Urban Justice Center, which regularly helps victims file applications, projects that someone who filed in 2020 should expect to get a final decision in 2033, while someone who files this year could be waiting nearly two decades at the current rate.

Luz had been married as a teenager in rural Ecuador and eventually followed her partner to New York City in the mid-1990s. When she arrived, she found poor living conditions, low-paying work and spousal abuse that began almost immediately. She lacked family or community support and spoke little English.

One night, when her partner came home intoxicated and violent, hurting Luz and one of their daughters, Luz called the police.

After the arrest, a law enforcement official encouraged Luz to take her claims to court, instead of dropping the charges, which victims of domestic violence often do. Years later, a mental health counselor urged Luz to apply for a U visa; she filed for it in October 2019. The 19th agreed not to publish Luz’s last name out of concern for her safety.

Luz works at a grocery store under conditions that have exacerbated her asthma — extreme cold and heat, and dust. The pay is also low, which has put strain on her family as food costs rise. She has not received a work authorization, which she said has kept her from pursuing work in health care. She’s interested in working for a pharmacy or a lab, a desire born out of her being a caregiver decades ago for her brother during a battle with liver disease.

“Well, that’s my dream,” Luz said. “And at the same time, I think about how many women like me are sitting, waiting with frustration, wondering if they’ll accept my application or not — if I’ll wind up in the same or a worse situation.”

A 2022 USCIS Inspector General’s report flagged the backlog facing U visas and said it was putting victims at risk. Mismanagement of the program, the report found, was leaving “legitimate victims waiting more than 10 years to receive U visas.”

Some visa applicants are also experiencing longer waits for the immigration agency to even acknowledge their applications. During the Biden administration, that acknowledgement often spared someone from deportation. That’s no longer the case.

The 19th documented the case of a Salvadoran immigrant, Yessenia Ruano, who was forced to self-deport in June after filing a T visa application in February. At the time, the wait for a receipt number was around four weeks. That same month, the Trump administration fired 50 employees from USCIS. By early May, an agent told Ruano that the wait had grown to four months.

By the time Ruano could show the proof of her T visa application in May, ICE agents said it wasn’t enough and told her to leave the country or face detention.

In August, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore and Jimmy Panetta introduced legislation that would protect most U and T visa applicants from immigrant detention and deportation. Moore cited Ruano’s case.

“By subjecting these vulnerable individuals to immigration enforcement, the Trump administration is helping create a two-tiered justice system that empowers criminals and discourages certain victims from coming forward,” Moore said. “Congress created these visas as a tool to make our communities safer and support the flow of critical information during criminal investigations. This legislation creates stronger T and U visa protections, helping victims and law enforcement.”

The Protect Immigrant Witness and Victim Protection Act would also lift the cap on U visas and require USCIS to issue work permits to applicants if their cases are pending for over 180 days.

Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed

Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.

During the first two months of the Trump administration, USCIS denied more T visa applications than it approved, a first in the history of the program.

Between January and March — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term and the first two months of Trump’s second term — USCIS approved 430 applications and denied 497. Taken altogether, the agency decided 927 cases — a number advocates say is strikingly small next to the backlog.

“There is a significant slowing down of adjudications of these applications,” said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, a nonprofit that connects victims of human trafficking with pro-bono legal representation.

“It's troubling to see the numbers dropping. You could understand the lack of approvals without the backlog, but there's no excuse for not adjudicating,” Vanderberg added.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the decline in adjudications of T visa applications.

The Human Trafficking Legal Center and other groups had advocated for more resources to speed up decisions in T visa cases during the Biden administration. In 2023, for the first time in history, the number of T visa applications exceeded Congress’ 5,000 visa cap.

Despite the growing number of applications, USCIS has never reached that cap. Between October 2023 and September 2024, the agency received a record 15,332 T visa applications and approved 3,786. About 600 applications were denied, and the backlog grew from about 9,000 applications the year prior to more than 20,000.

This year, Vanderberg said the organization has no hope that USCIS will meet the cap. “I think we'll be lucky to see 2,000 approvals.”

The role of the visas in maintaining public safety

Last month, the Justice Department said it uncovered a decade-long scheme that resulted in hundreds of fraudulent U visa applications. Three small-town police chiefs in Louisiana took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for false reports of armed robberies.

A federal prosecutor on the case who has worked at the agency for over 20 years said in a news conference that the scheme exposed flagrant abuse of the program — but that the visas are an important law enforcement tool.

“These visas are designed to help law enforcement and prosecutors prosecute crimes where you need the victim or the witness there, ” U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said last month. “U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.”

Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.

“If they don't have to worry about the fear of being deported, they're more likely to report a crime to law enforcement, and that's important to us,” said Captain Jeffrey Bunge, the director of the special victims investigations division at the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland.

In an interview with The 19th, Bunge described U visas as critical to the work of law enforcement — from building trust with immigrant communities to report crimes to mounting strong cases for prosecution that may involve several victims.

Bunge runs the office that issues law enforcement certifications for his police department and described a careful process in which officers work to link the certification request to a crime report and ensure that the agency gets the cooperation of the victim. Not every jurisdiction has a dedicated office like Montgomery County’s.

The U visa program isn’t without criticism. The 2022 USCIS watchdog report found that the program was mismanaged, susceptible to fraud and that better data was needed to understand whether it was meeting the goals that Congress laid out — protecting victims and helping law enforcement.

The report argued that USCIS could do a better job making sure that it wasn’t approving cases using fraudulent law enforcement certifications and that the agency could take a closer look at how it defines whether a victim was helpful to a law enforcement case.

Experts in the visa programs agreed that while improvements could be made, their existence continues to play an important humanitarian and public safety role.

“It does us no good if there are serious crimes that are taking place in the community, and we can’t investigate and charge and arrest those individuals. Particularly for the U visa, [these] are some of the more serious crimes,” Bunge said. “We want to get the bad guy or the bad girl off the street so that overall makes the community safer.”",https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/files/entryimages/112823_lukeville_migrants-2363_1.jpg&fltr[]=wmi|/gfx/shareoverlays/sentinellogo4color_nobackbig.png|BR|77|4|4|0]&w=1200&h=630&zc=C&f=jpg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:06.574793

Some of the Supreme Court's rulings blocking lower court decisions against Trump have been badly flawed and are likely to have harmful effects.","There is a widespread perception - reinforced by a number of high-profile Supreme Court decisions - that the judiciary has been largely ineffective in curbing the second Trump Administration's many illegal actions. In an insightful recent post, Georgetown law Professor Steve Vladeck (one of the nation's leading experts on the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary), explains that courts have actually had more impact than many think:

There is, alas, plenty of Supreme Court-related news…. But I wanted to use this week's ""Long Read"" to tell a slightly different story—about cases that aren't making headlines, for instance, the ongoing litigation challenging President Trump's executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship. That order remains on hold—thanks to a series of rulings by lower courts after the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling on June 27. These lower-court rulings have flown under the radar—at least largely because the government has not sought emergency relief from the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court, nor has it refused to comply with them. For now, it is ""taking the L.""

That's an important story unto itself—not just in the birthright citizenship cases, but more generally. For all of the attention that is (understandably) being paid to the unprecedented number of cases the Trump administration is rushing to the Supreme Court (we're up to 28), and to the Court's (troubling) behavior in those cases, they represent only a small subset of the broader universe of legal challenges to Trump administration behavior. In the majority of cases in which the government is losing in the lower courts, it is (1) not seeking emergency or expedited intervention from above; and (2) otherwise complying with the adverse rulings while the cases move (very slowly) ahead.

Because this reality doesn't make for quite as attractive headlines, it's one to which too many folks are largely oblivious. That's a problem worth fixing—not only because it's important to tell both sides of the litigation story, but because including these cases paints a more complicated (and, in my view, far less nihilistic) picture of the role of the courts—and of the law, more generally—as a check on the Trump administration.

Vladeck goes on to explain that the birthright citizenship order - like a number of other Trump policies - remains blocked by lower courts, and that the administration often chooses not to appeal, or to do so only slowly. He also notes that this record shows that the Court's ruling in Trump v. CASA, Inc., barring most universal injunctions, has so far not had the devastating effect some predicted, because lower courts have found other ways to impose broad injunctions constraining illegal policies:

[F]olks might recall the loud and sharp debate following on the heels of the Supreme Court's ruling in CASA over just how much (or how little) of an impact that decision would have on the ability to challenge lawless (and allegedly lawless) behavior by the Trump administration. As I wrote at the time, the answer was always going to depend upon what happened both on remand in those three cases and elsewhere—and on how viable other means of seeking nationwide relief would be in challenges to Trump administration policies. It's still early, but at least so far, the returns have largely borne out the views of those who did not think that CASA would be a cataclysm. To be clear, that doesn't mean CASA was rightly decided (or even rightly framed, as Professor Jack Goldsmith has explained). And the Court may yet impose tighter limits on (1) nationwide class actions; (2) state standing; (3) what plaintiffs must show to demonstrate that a universal injunction is necessary to obtain ""complete relief""; or (4) nationwide vacatur of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act—any of which will necessarily affect the ability of plaintiffs to bring nationwide challenges to federal policies. But at least for now, CASA's effects have been decidedly modest—and felt most perhaps by lawyers, who have had to reconfigure many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Vladeck opposes the ruling in CASA (as do I). But he's right that its impact will depend on the scope and availability of alternative modes of relief. I made a similar point in my post criticizing CASA at the time it came down.

I think Vladeck's other points here are mostly well-taken, as well. In assessing the impact of the judiciary we should look to the full range of cases, not just those that reach the Supreme Court on the ""shadow"" docket, as the latter are in some ways unrepresentative (Vladeck is a well-known longtime critic of the shadow docket). His analysis undercuts some left-wing narratives about the seeming ineffectiveness of the judiciary. And, as he notes, it also undercuts right-wing narratives to the effect that lower-court rulings against the administration are all indefensible ""Lawfare"" that will surely be overturned by the Supreme Court. If the latter were true, we would expect to see the Administration taking many more of these cases to the Supreme Court, at an accelerated pace.

That said, we should not assume that the judiciary has been completely effective, or even close to it. Some of the Supreme Court's rulings blocking lower court decisions against Trump have been badly flawed and are likely to have harmful effects. The recent ruling on racial profiling in immigration enforcement is a notable example. And some illegal actions are hard to stop completely or swiftly enough through judicial rulings alone.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/Court-4-1.png,N,,2025-09-22 15:58:02.272946

Chellie Pingree says federal officials are prohibiting attorneys from accompanying their clients to routine immigration appointments here in Maine.

Chellie Pingree says federal officials are prohibiting attorneys from accompanying their clients to routine immigration appointments here in Maine.

Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine’s 1st Congressional District, also joined calls from local officials to get a tour of the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement office in Scarborough that opened five years ago amid secrecy.

In a letter Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree said town officials have been denied entry to the office and that such moves risk “deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation — as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” she said. “I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

She further called on federal officials to immediately disclose any written policy that prohibits barring attorneys from its facilities.

Public officials across the country have been showing up at ICE facilities to get eyewitness accounts of the conditions, only to be rebuffed and in some cases arrested. Last Thursday, 11 officials were arrested at an ICE detention facility in New York City. The Trump administration has made aggressive immigration enforcement, detention and deportation a top priority since his inauguration eight months ago.

Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to immigrants, said attorneys in Maine have been rebuffed on “multiple occasions over the past months” when trying to join clients at their routine appointments, including clients with active immigration cases.

“In the current environment, with the federal government flagrantly disregarding due process and attempting to indiscriminately deport as many people as they can, having your attorney by your side during any ICE appointment is beyond critical,” Roche said in a written statement.

The Scarborough facility has been cloaked in secrecy since plans were first made public in 2020. Two years later, ICE remained tight-lipped about its operations, though at the time it was listed as a “check-in location,” rather than being used for “enforcement and removal operations.”

ICE was later forced to produce nearly 2,000 pages of records after being sued, but the additional information did not answer basic questions about operations, how many detainees could be held and for how long.

It’s still unclear what the facility is used for and federal officials did not respond to an interview request for this story.

That uncertainty is unacceptable to residents like Louise Secordel, who was alarmed that Scarborough police officers had called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection earlier this summer after pulling over a van that was subject to statewide alert amid a fatal drowning investigation in Waterford. CBP and ICE are separate agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that perform similar and sometimes overlapping functions.

Scarborough police apparently called border patrol because the men didn’t speak English and needed help with translation. Federal agents ended up arresting 14 men, including the brother of the drowning victim.

“What began as a sad drowning accident became a questionable detention, aided by our local police resources, of individuals working in our community, with no transparency about what has happened to them since,” Secordel said.

Jonathan Anderson, vice chair of the Scarborough Town Council, said he, too, has been trying to get a tour of the Scarborough facility and open up a dialog between town leaders and ICE since the June 14 arrests, which took place along the busy Route 1 corridor.

Anderson said he is seeking more information about the activities so he can address constituent concerns and ensure ICE is following local town ordinances.

He also wants to ensure that “it’s a facility that is treating people humanely.”

“This is something I know many people in our community are worried about,” Anderson said. “And we’re just looking for transparency around what’s happening and getting to know our neighbor a little bit better.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/41174386_20250204_pingree_0004.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 14:58:13.195767

According authorities, there are currently no plans to temporarily close the facility in suburban Broadview.

""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing are FALSE,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said in a statement.

The department accused demonstrators of throwing tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, while also slashing car tires and blocking entrances to the building. Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowd of protesters.

The National Lawyers Guild alleged agents appeared to ""fire projectiles directly at individuals, including at their heads"" and said at least two people were taken to nearby hospitals.

Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowds. Videos and photos captured numerous scuffles between protesters and ICE guards outside the facility.

DHS accused the state of refusing to ""answer multiple calls for assistance,"" blaming its sanctuary city policies, but in his own statement Gov. J.B. Pritzker denied receiving any calls for help.

""It's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials. The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety,"" Pritzker's office said in a statement. ""Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest.""

The governor's office added that the village of Broadview and Cook County have also not requested state help.

According to DHS, at least 16 protesters have been arrested at the facility so far. The National Lawyers Guild reported at least 10 of those arrests were ultimately released.

""Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" McLaughlin's statement read.

“These egregious acts of violence against people exercising their rights to free speech exemplify this administration’s flagrant assault on the First Amendment,"" Brad Thomson, a volunteer attorney with NLG Chicago, said in a statement. ""The violent use of government power to suppress dissent embodies the authoritarian and xenophobic agenda being pursued by federal authorities.”

The heightened demonstrations come as officials conduct what they've called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in the Chicago area. In just two weeks, more than 550 undocumented immigrants have been detained by ICE, the agency told NBC 5 Investigates.

The Broadview facility serves as a processing center for many of those arrested.

Though protests have taken place every Friday for weeks, the clashes on Sept. 19 were some of the most tense so far. That evening, tensions escalated as someone in the crowd launched fireworks outside the heavily armed ICE compound. Federal agents responded to the fireworks with tear gas and dozens of rounds of pepper ball shots.

Activists and some Illinois democrats running for office were seen gagging and struggling to breathe as tear gas filled the air. Some used milk and water to clear their eyes.

Kat Abughazaleh, who is running for Congress in Illinois' 9th District, was thrown to the ground by federal agents at the protest.

""What's really important to mention here, I’m gonna have a bruise on my side, but that doesn’t hold a candle to the people trapped in the facility are dealing with,"" Abughazaleh said.

A photo captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk Friday morning showed a bottle of what appeared to have been sprayed at protestors, marked with the words ""riot control.""

""We just got sprayed with -- I don't know if it was tear gas, or pepper spray -- I know it stung my eyes,"" NBC Chicago reporter Jenn Schanz, who was at the scene, said.

In recognition of the inalienable human dignity of each person, States built a rules-based system to maintain peace and security and to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. Multilateral refugee, humanitarian, and human rights treaties are central to the objectives enshrined in the UN charter, and essential to preventing and deterring conduct that harms people and threatens global stability and peace. Adherence to treaties has saved lives, upheld human dignity, and protected millions of people from persecution, torture and other human rights abuses.

Human rights treaties play a vital role in helping people live safely and protected where they are, reducing the conditions that lead to forced migration. The Refugee Convention, its Protocol and other agreements provide a foundation for states to host refugees and provide critical protection, thereby reducing onward displacement. Indeed, the substantial majority—over two-thirds—of refugees are already hosted in neighboring states and nearly three-fourths are hosted in low- and middle-income states.

Treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses are more necessary than ever. Many of us have witnessed, day in and day out, how international treaties and law save lives and protect people from return to persecution, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Indeed, the Refugee Convention and its Protocol have protected millions of people from persecution. The sad reality is that today’s global crises and mass displacements often stem from, or are exacerbated by, the failure to adhere to international human rights, refugee and humanitarian conventions and law.

We call on States to:

Sign and/or deposit instruments of ratification or accession to human rights, refugee, and humanitarian treaties, and encourage other states to do so – including by welcoming those that do so during the UNGA Treaty Event and by marking the upcoming 75th Anniversary of the Refugee Convention through acceding to the Refugee Convention and Protocol and encouraging other states to do so.

Celebrate and affirm support for such treaties, and explain the ways they benefit people and states.

Share steps taken to fulfill and honor commitments under treaties – such as enactment of implementing legislation, celebrating treaty commitments, measures taken in response to treaty body recommendations or UPR, or creating a national human rights institution. With respect to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, share steps taken to strengthen asylum systems, support rights protection capacities, or increase cooperation through expanded resettlement and/or aid that helps enable other countries to host large numbers of refugees.

Should there be any denunciations, withdrawals, or attempts to reject, “reform,” and/or replace such treaties with frameworks that deny people protection from persecution and human rights abuses, we call on states to express strong disagreement, reiterate support for such treaties, explain their benefits to human lives, peace, and stability, emphasize the negative impacts of actions that undermine such treaties, and urge reversal of such efforts.

Many people now safely living in countries around the world are the children and grandchildren of people who fled persecution and found refuge in other countries. Conversely, before states came together to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights treaties and the Refugee Convention and Protocol, millions were abandoned to suffer horrific fates. Too many continue to suffer due to the failures to uphold human rights and humanitarian norms.

At this critical crossroads, we call on states to work together and with civil society to strengthen—and reject efforts to undermine—the treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses.

Executive Order Related to H-1B Nonimmigrants Issued

Note: This news item was originally posted Sept. 20, 2025; it was updated with additional information and reposted Sept. 22, 2025.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Sept.19, which places a ""restriction on entry"" of certain (H-1B) nonimmigrant workers and a new $100,000 fee. The executive order went into effect at 12:01 a.m., Sept. 21, 2025, and will remain in effect through Sept. 21, 2026, unless extended or changed.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued memoranda clarifying the executive order Sept. 20, and the U.S. State Department posted an H-1B FAQ Sept. 21.

Based on the administrative guidance in the memoranda and FAQ, it does not appear that this new order applies to individuals who are in the United States or those outside the United States who have an approved or pending H-1B petition. There are still a number of questions raised by this order, including whether it will apply to H-1B applications for extension or change of employer/change of status. It does appear to apply to new H-1B applications, although it is unclear whether cap-exempt H-1B employers/employees may be exempt or able to obtain a national interest exemption.

While the order is likely to be challenged in court, due to the uncertainties and potential for impact, the Office of International Education recommends the following:

Individuals in H-1B status who were not in the United States at the time of the order were encouraged to re-enter the United States by 11:59 p.m., Sept. 20, 2025 (before the order took effect Sept. 21), if possible.

Individuals currently in the United States on an H-1B visa are advised to consider travel carefully and potentially postpone international travel in the near future. While the new memoranda seem to minimize travel risks for individuals who currently hold H-1B status, until the implications and applicability of this new executive order are more fully clarified and potential litigation unfolds, travel guidance may continue to evolve.",https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 12:58:52.885068

IRS seeks to rebuild legal staff after mass resignations. Following an exodus of attorneys from the Office of Chief Counsel, the IRS has opened hiring for more than 60 positions in areas such as international tax and litigation support, reports Tax Notes. The office has lost about 13 percent of its workforce this year, part of broader staff reductions across the agency, and had previously rescinded job offers due to a federal hiring freeze. Experts say the agency may need added resources to handle litigation and implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Next Steps for Employers Identify potential future foreign national hires who are abroad and assess the financial and operational implications of the $100,000 payment.","On September 19, 2025, the White House issued a Proclamation, effective September 21st, that restricts the entry into the United States of certain nonimmigrants who seek to be admitted in H-1B status to perform services in a specialty occupation unless their H-1B petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a $100,000 one-time payment per individual or the individual receives a national interest exemption. This payment is new and is in addition to the existing registration and filing fees for H-1B petitions which generally are less than $4,000 for private employers. On September 20th, the White House provided much needed clarification that the payment only applies to new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025 and does not impact current H-1B workers or beneficiaries of pending H-1B petitions.

The immigration shift targets new H-1B petitions for beneficiaries who are currently outside the United States. This affects employers' talent acquisition strategies with overseas hiring plans facing immediate and costly decisions. The intent is to encourage U.S. employers to hire U.S. workers instead.

Future federal court litigation is anticipated and may impact implementation of the Proclamation. Additional governmental guidance is also anticipated to further clarify the scope of the payment and the logistics of payment collection. Unless extended, the Proclamation is set to expire on September 21, 2026.

Who is NOT impacted by the Proclamation?

The White House, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection all separately confirmed all H-1B workers currently in the United States are not subject to the Proclamation with no restriction on international travel. In addition, the Proclamation and $100,000 payment will not apply in the following scenarios:

Beneficiaries with pending or approved H-1B petitions filed prior to September 21, 2025.

Beneficiaries of H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025, seeking extension/amendment of H-1B stay, or change of H-1B employer within the United States.

Family members in H-4 dependent visa status.

Based on the guidance from the Department of State, we anticipate that foreign nationals currently outside the United States with pending or approved H-1B petitions as of September 21, 2025, should be able to secure new H-1B visas at U.S. counsular posts abroad and enter the United States in H-1B status after September 21, 2025.

Who Is Subject to the Proclamation and $100,000 Payment?

Beneficiaries of new H-1B petitions filed after 12:01am EDT on September 21, 2025, currently abroad, who attempt to enter the United States in H-1B status will be subject to the $100,000 payment. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service will not adjudicate H-1B petitions and the Department of State will not issue H-1B visas without evidence of the $100,000 payment for the new H-1B workers outside of the United States.

National Interest Exemptions

The Proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant exemptions of the $100,000 supplemental payment to any individual foreign national, all foreign nationals working for a company, or all foreign nationals working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the hiring of such foreign nationals ""is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States."" We are awaiting further details on the logistics of the national interest exemption process. We anticipate that employers seeking an exemption will be required to provide strong documentation demonstrating the employee's or the organization's strategic importance, economic harm, or public interest impact if the entry payment was enforced.

Prevailing Wage Changes anticipated for H-1B Petitions

The Proclamation directs changes be made to the way prevailing wages are set in the H-1B program and prioritizes higher paid and higher skilled foreign workers. The Secretary of Labor is instructed to initiate rulemaking to revise prevailing wage levels so that they align with the policy goals of the Proclamation. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security is instructed to initiate rulemaking to prioritize the admission of high-skilled, high-paid nonimmigrants.

Employers who sponsor H-1B beneficiaries will need to budget for higher level wages, and specific geographies where prevailing wages are higher or lower under the current rules. Employers may run a risk of Requests for Evidence or denials of their petitions if they routinely only qualify for the lowest of wage level for lower paid, entry-level positions. Department of Homeland Security will develop rules that favor applicants who are both highly skilled and well-compensated setting thresholds for minimum wages, educational or experience as distinguishable factors.

The new wage rules are anticipated to be published followed by a comment period before the next H-1B lottery which is expected to begin in March 2026. In the meantime, the current prevailing wage levels remaining in effect.

Next Steps for Employers

Identify potential future foreign national hires who are abroad and assess the financial and operational implications of the $100,000 payment.

Evaluate whether any positions or business units may qualify for national interest exemptions.

Evaluate and stay informed of recommendations related to rulemaking changes to the prevailing wage levels and prioritization of highly skilled and highly paid nonimmigrants.

The decision comes two and a half months after President Donald Trump signed legislation sharply reducing food aid to the poor. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

The decision to scrap the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Household Food Security Report was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

RELATED STORY | SNAP benefit cuts begin taking effect, changing how many Americans buy food

In a press release Saturday, the USDA said the 2024 report, to be released Oct. 22, would be the last.

""The questions used to collect the data are entirely subjective and do not present an accurate picture of actual food security,'' the USDA said. ""The data is rife with inaccuracies slanted to create a narrative that is not representative of what is actually happening in the countryside as we are currently experiencing lower poverty rates, increasing wages, and job growth under the Trump Administration.''

The Census Bureau reported earlier this month that the U.S. poverty rate dipped from 11% in 2023 to 10.6% last year, before Trump took office.

Critics were quick to accuse the administration of deliberately making it harder to measure hunger and assess the impact of its cuts to food stamps.

""Trump is cancelling an annual government survey that measures hunger in America, rather than allow it to show hunger increasing under his tenure,"" Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said on social media.

Civil society from around the world urgently calls on States Parties to the Rome Statute to do everything in their power to stop the proposed US sanctions against the ICC, an independent judicial institution with a mandate to confront impunity for the gravest crimes known to humanity. Sanctions against the ICC, taken unilaterally by a non-State Party, amount to an all-out assault on a global court backed by 125 States Parties and relied on by the international community to ensure accountability for atrocity crimes. Such sanctions would leave countless victims abandoned by obstructing a last resort to justice, weaponising the global financial system to choke the Court’s work, and entrenching double standards where power and politics dictate which survivors deserve justice.

Sanctioning the ICC would mark a dangerous turning point in the history of international justice, transforming a system designed to hold the most powerful accountable for atrocity crimes into one that instead shields the powerful. It involves retreating from hard-fought progress toward a rules-based order to a world where might triumphs over right. An international justice system built over decades could crumble in the face of external pressure exerted to unduly influence the course of justice. It is a total affront to the rule of law with devastating repercussions for justice everywhere: if the ICC can be manipulated through financial coercion, no court or accountability mechanism is safe in any country or region.

Sanctioning the ICC as an institution could sever the Court’s ability to function, including its access to financing from banks and states, and block essential services needed to keep it operating. US control over the global financial system ensures the impact of mere threats of sanctions reaches far beyond Washington, as non-American banks, insurers, and service providers often over-comply in fear of themselves being sanctioned, blocking even basic transactions. Without funds, the Court risks not being able to keep the lights on, pay staff, protect data, protect witnesses supporting its work, pay legal aid to victims and defendants, let alone deliver reparations to victims. It threatens core functions of the Court, including the detention of suspects. Hard-won gains, such as the recent arrest and surrender of former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and the German arrest of Libyan suspect, Khaled Mohamed Ali El Hishri, could be lost. Ongoing investigations of alleged international crimes in other situations might be stalled or abandoned indefinitely, leaving victims unable to access justice worldwide.

If sanctions render the Court inoperative, there will be no way back and one of the most relevant institutions of the past century will have been lost. The global community cannot let this happen.

The signatories call on ICC States Parties to urgently save the ICC and the Rule of Law by:

– Publicly and firmly rejecting sanctions against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Bilaterally engaging with the US Administration to prevent designations against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Adopting domestic and regional blocking measures including enforcing the European Union’s Blocking Statute (Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96), to demonstrate solidarity and protect individuals and entities from the impact of sanctions and shield businesses within their respective territories so that they can continue to work with the ICC, its staff and officials, and civil society supporting the Court.

– Protecting service providers by guaranteeing that providing services to the ICC and organisations supporting its work is lawful and shielded.

– Developing practical alternatives to the US-dollar banking network of transactions that are cleared through the US financial system, so the Court and its supporters can keep funding their essential work.

– Providing guidance and creating legal safeguards to prevent non-US banks and service providers from over-complying with threats of US sanctions.

– Fulfilling their legal obligations under the Rome Statute, including financial contributions to the Court’s annual budget, strong political backing to the Court’s independence and continued functioning, cooperation with the Court notably on the arrests and surrender of suspects, and resisting any pressure to disengage in response to sanctions.

Paragon Solutions, Israel’s premier mercenary spyware firm, is headquartered on the top five floors of a glass panel skyscraper that sits next to a discount bank branch in central Tel Aviv. When I stopped in for a visit last month, I encountered twenty-somethings with smartwatches gliding through open floor plans, dogs lounging on shag carpets, fridges stacked with glass bottles of sparkling water, and conference rooms angled to gaze out over the hazy Mediterranean. The breezy atmosphere was at odds with the controversies the company has recently faced. But perhaps by then most of the staff knew the tide had changed.

Earlier this month Paragon scored one of its heftiest deals yet when the Trump administration reactivated a $2 million contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), following the firm’s acquisition by Florida-based investment group AE Industrial Partners last December. The company builds surveillance weapons such as Graphite, a zero-click smartphone hack that can access encrypted communications, turn on the camera and microphone, and vacuum up every text, direct message, intimate photograph, and personal file stored on the device—all without the user noticing. The technology gives those who deploy it a power once reserved for the top commanders of the world’s most vaunted spy outfits.

Scandal came for the company earlier this year when Italian authorities reportedly used Paragon’s spyware to surveil prominent journalists and human rights activists. For the Trump administration, it might have been a proof of concept. The news of the DHS deal—quietly announced on a federal procurement form that was circulated by journalist Jack Poulson—reversed a U.S. government freeze on a deal originally minted in 2023. Over the last decade, American law enforcement agencies have tested and even procured spyware offered by companies with spotty human rights records. Yet outrage surrounding the abuse of Pegasus—another zero-click surveillance tool sold by Paragon’s main rival, the NSO Group, itself based just north of Tel Aviv in Herzliya, near Mossad’s headquarters—propelled Biden to sign an executive order clamping down on government use of commercial spyware.

Trump’s reelection has changed all that. Over the last eight months, he has aspired to govern the United States like a strongman. The summer began with federal agents dispatched to round up undocumented migrants at gun point in Los Angeles. It ended with U.S. military forces carrying out a drone strike in the Caribbean, killing eleven Venezuelans in a brazen execution that legal experts say amounts to a war crime. Arming DHS with Paragon’s mercenary spyware spells only further escalation.

Like a reaper drone, mercenary spyware is an expensive weapon usually reserved for elite military operations. The technology became popular with national security agencies in the early 2010s at the height of U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns in the Middle East. Militant organizations were hiding behind state-of-the-art encryption, and superpowers were lacking in the ingenuity needed to hack their phones. The NSO Group was the first to capitalize on the opportunity.

Within a few years’ time, a handful of companies came to dominate the industry. Whether headquartered in Israel or elsewhere, they were often staffed by Israeli veterans of elite intelligence outfits such as Unit 8200. Military-trained developers had spent years honing their surveillance skills in the occupied Palestinian territories and neighboring countries; now they could apply them for eye-watering salaries at the behest of governments eager to shore up their power. Israel’s foray into the private surveillance industry was a natural update to the country’s old brand as the world’s ultimate security state.

The technology was initially marketed as a weapon, for use in military conflicts or intelligence operations. But despots, keen to surveil and terrify their enemies, found it hard to resist a tool that can decipher the secrets stored in anyone’s personal phone, and spyware companies found it hard to resist the prospect of more paying customers. Soon enough, the industry was embroiled in a number of public relations disasters. Governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Latin America became enthusiastic customers. A technology marketed to clamp down on terrorism, drug cartels, and pedophilia was used to monitor, blackmail, and arrest journalists, human rights advocates, and opposition politicians. Among the victims was journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, who in 2018 was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was murdered and dismembered. Pegasus was found on the phones of his wife and at least one other associate.

Though most victims of mercenary spyware evade such cruel fates, they still describe the technology’s effects as debilitating. “Pegasus was (the authorities’) sending me a message that anything they wanted they could have, that nowhere was free from their control,” Salah Hamouri told me when we spoke in Ramallah in 2022. The lawyer was one of six Palestinian activists who found the NSO group’s spyware on their devices in late 2021. Hamouri, also a French citizen, figured something was amiss when he picked up his phone after gym sessions to find he had been active on Instagram during stretches of time he stored the device in a locker. But news of the hack—confirmed by a forensic scan on his iPhone—sent him spiraling. In the aftermath, Hamouri spent months offline, not even speaking to his wife and kids in Paris over encrypted messaging apps. By the time we met he was carrying a pink Motorola flip phone and still limited his communication to just a few people. “The only time I feel secure is when I’m not using any kind of technology, but it’s impossible to live like that,” he said.

Painstaking documentation of similar travails led to international investigations and lawsuits here in the United States. For the Biden administration, which had toyed with buying the technology, the mounting pressure was enough to shift their course: rather than signing deals with the firms, it wound up blacklisting a number of them. Unable to access their biggest market, the industry seemed, for a moment, to be on the wane: the NSO Group and its peer companies teetered on the edge of bankruptcy; in recent years three other Israeli spyware outfits folded.

Then came Trump’s return. He campaigned on a pledge to build up American military power, and even before taking office, he promised Silicon Valley titans hefty contracts to develop surveillance and weapons systems for U.S. security agencies—in August, the surveillance firm Palantir scored a $10 billion contract with the Department of Defense—while casually talking of conquering Greenland. In campaign speeches, Trump offered an alternative to the last few decades of liberalism: belligerent nationalism, hard militarism, and a frontier ethos.

Many tech CEOs were eager to cash in. They parroted conservative talking points, vowing to inject Silicon Valley with a warrior spirit to protect Western civilization. Executives from Meta, OpenAI, Palantir, and Thinking Machines enlisted in a special unit within the newly renamed Department of War. Others signed deals with DHS to make the agency over into what its secretary, Kristi Noem, has called a “vigilant and proactive and innovative” force. And all of this has been helped by the massive entanglement of the U.S. and Israeli military-tech complex—a longstanding economic relationship that Trump has not invented whole cloth. The late twentieth century’s steady supply of tanks and Uzis morphed into a twenty-first-century exchange of predator drones, facial recognition algorithms, and, now, spyware.

Still, DHS’s contract with Paragon marks escalation, coming amid Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s brutal crackdown that critics say is flouting constitutional checks on the agency’s power. In recent months the DHS has sought to ramp up its mass surveillance capacities; ICE has detained valid visa holders based on social media posts at odds with the Trump administration’s position on Palestine. It has offered Palantir a $30 million contract to develop ImmigrationOS, a surveillance database that advocates worry “concentrates enormous power in the hands of AI-driven platforms with minimal public oversight.” And in February, The Intercept reported that it was courting companies to develop a tool—making use of “social and behavioral sciences” and “psychological profiles”—allowing the agency to monitor individuals who criticized it on social media.

The Paragon deal also demonstrates how the U.S.-Israel alliance will endure despite plummeting domestic support for the war in Gaza. Calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments have mounted in recent months, as Israeli officials barrel ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza City. Endless documentation of war crimes, skyrocketing civilian casualties, allegations of famine have fueled calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments. Various EU member states have frozen the import of Israeli manufactured weapons and surveillance systems. Germany and Spain have halted all arms sales to Israel, while many members of the Hague Group, a collective of several countries in the Global South, has banned arms transfers and sales. Though 84 percent of Americans support an immediate ceasefire, the Trump administration has balked at even the most tepid of sanctions.

There are old and strategic interests at play. The United States has long relied on Israel’s military prowess to further its interest in the Middle East, from the CIA, the NSA, and Mossad tag-teaming targeted assassinations in Syria and Iran to Israeli and American security bodies sharing a steady stream of surveillance data extracted from governments, militant networks, and civilians. Despite campaigning on an “America First” campaign platform, Trump is keen to maintain these relations and often praises Israel as a bulwark against Iranian influence in the region.

More than anything else, though, Trump is a power-monger. He finds a compelling model in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strongman rule and the military arsenal that backs it up. Indeed, Netanyahu has managed to cling onto power through brute displays of military force. Exploding pagers in Beirut, suicide drones beelining toward Iranian nuclear scientists’ bedrooms, 2,000 munitions dropped on civilian complexes in Gaza city, bombing Hamas negotiators in Doha: all of these have distracted from charges of corruption, the dismantling of Israeli democratic institution (imperfect as they may have been), and the fact that more Israelis have died under his watch than any government since the 1970s. Last week, as Israeli troops invaded Gaza City and a United Nations inquiry accused Israeli officials of genocide, Netanyahu told a group of American congressmen the he was remaking Israel into a warrior nation. “We’re going to be Athens and Supersparta” he said, “we’ll have to defend ourselves and know how to attack our enemies.”

Trump has copied a few of Netanyahu’s strategies in the months since he assumed the presidency. Since March, U.S. airstrikes in Yemen have killed over 500 combatants and more than 200 civilians, more than all those killed in two decades of U.S. bombings in the country. As of June, Trump had deployed thousands of National Guards into the heart of U.S. cities. Noem requested “drone surveillance support” to turbocharge their efforts to find and arrest undocumented migrants in Los Angeles. ICE has detained a record-breaking number in recent months, though actual deportation numbers are lagging behind the “millions and millions” promised.

For those living under this expanding offensive, the results are catastrophic. Some have been held for months on end in crowded detention centers. Others, including legal residents, have simply been deported without due process. And that’s just within U.S. borders. Abroad, the embrace of aerial targeting and drone strikes with vanishingly few efforts to minimize civilian casualties mark an unrestrained phase of U.S. militarism, one that shirks even the most symbolic adherence to human rights norms and international rule of law. Instead, allegations of war crimes are touted by those in power as proof of a job well done.

Which returns me to the Tel Aviv skyscraper where Israeli developers build out mercenary spyware at the behest of America’s DHS. On the sunny day I stopped in for a visit, a surveillance UAV hummed somewhere just beyond cloud cover. Fighter jets rumbled overhead on their way to launch guided munitions towards Gaza city.

Amnesty International has issued a call for the data analytics companies Palantir and Babel Street to “immediately cease their work with the US administration related to immigration enforcement.” Amnesty’s action is an important reminder that surveillance technology not only raises critical policy issues around just what kind of a society we want to live in, but that when connected to abusive and illegal actions such as those being taken by the Trump Administration, it can also violate internationally recognized human rights standards. And that can apply to other companies besides Palantir and Babel Street.

In its letters to the two companies, the renowned global human rights group points out that companies have a “responsibility to protect human rights,” including the rights of refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants. Amnesty writes,

The scope and meaning of this responsibility have been articulated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles). The UN Guiding Principles require all businesses, from small and medium-sized enterprises to large multinational enterprises, to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own business activities.

The Trump Administration’s systematic abuses of immigrants certainly count as human rights violations. As Amnesty and my ACLU colleagues have been pointing out, the administration has been violating human rights obligations to protect migrants and asylum seekers, violating due process rights, violating the right to free expression, and engaging in arbitrary and prolonged detention and cruel and degrading treatment. For example, as Amnesty explains, while the U.S. government may have

discretion to deny and revoke visas to applicants, they may not do so in ways that violate rights protected by the US Constitution and international human rights law, including rights to free speech and due process.

As ICE, CBP and others carrying out the Trump Administration’s human rights violations increasingly tap into surveillance infrastructures being run by private companies, those companies have an obligation not to facilitate such violations — and as Amnesty points out, also have human rights responsibilities under United Nations principles to be transparent about how they’re addressing activities in contexts where they “pose risks of severe human rights impacts.”

Unfortunately, there are a growing number of companies that are engaging in mass surveillance, including those collecting significant amounts of data through our cellular networks, video surveillance cameras, face recognition and license plate recognition systems, and other technologies that could prove useful to the Trump Administration’s efforts to target undocumented and documented immigrants and other assorted perceived enemies.

Let’s not forget that two large Chinese companies, Dahua and Hikvision, were sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019 for their role in carrying out surveillance that was connected to the current Chinese government’s ongoing oppression of the Uighur minority in the Xinjiang province. These are not small companies; their products were widespread in the U.S. surveillance camera market. The government issued the sanctions against the companies for “enabling” and being “implicated in”

human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the XUAR. [emphasis added]

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree stressed that preventing legal counsel from attending such visits undermines constitutional protections and erodes public confidence in DHS’s commitment to transparency and accountability.

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” Pingree wrote. “If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities.

I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

Pingree also formally requested a tour of the ICE field office in Scarborough, Maine, citing concerns raised by local town officials who have sought to engage with the facility but have been denied entry.

“Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely,” Pingree wrote. “Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

The Congresswoman reiterated that robust constituent services and agency oversight are core congressional responsibilities, and said she will continue to monitor DHS’s responsiveness.

Dear Secretary Noem,

As you know from your time in the U.S. House of Representatives, providing casework and acting as an intermediary to executive agencies is one of the most fundamental services we provide for our constituents, ensuring that the government serves the people it represents. My office frequently assists constituents with immigration petitions pending with your agency—including adjustments of status, naturalization, and non-immigrant visa petitions—that have been delayed or lost. I take immense pride in my ability to serve the thousands of Mainers who have sought assistance from my office.

Moreover, robust casework functions to directly support Congress’s oversight responsibilities. Elevating constituent concerns provides valuable insights into how federal programs are being implemented on the ground. It can also reveal systemic inefficiencies, inequities, and gaps in service that may warrant legislative or administrative attention.

It is within this oversight capacity that I raise alarm about several reports from my district that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities. Further, should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation. I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.

In service of my oversight responsibilities, I request your assistance in scheduling a tour in the coming weeks of the ICE field office within my district in Scarborough, Maine. In accordance with this request, I wish to stress the importance of the Department’s responsibility to engage with and be responsive to the local communities in which ICE facilities operate. It has been brought to my attention that officials from the Town of Scarborough have made efforts to engage with the ICE facility in the Town, but have yet to be allowed entry. Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely. Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.

I respectfully request a written response to this letter no later than 30 days from receipt. Please provide confirmation of whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if so, its legal justification. My office will also follow up on scheduling a visit to the Scarborough, Maine facility as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters. Congress will continue to closely monitor the Department’s responsiveness, and I fully expect your office will take the necessary actions to address these concerns. Please reach out to my office at (202) 225-6116 should you have any questions.

On the evening of Feb. 11, 22-year-old Ward Sakeik sat on a plane from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Miami. She and her husband, Taahir Shaikh, were returning from their honeymoon, but he was sitting a few rows away. She didn’t look back at him — her handlers told her that even smiling at him could be considered a crime.

Sakeik, a wedding photographer who’s lived in Texas since the age of 9, hadn’t slept for two days. She’d spent nearly 36 hours confined to a small intake room at the Cyril E. King Airport in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tired, she kept her eyes on the book she’d brought on board. It was about marriage and relationships.

Behind her, a woman made small talk. “You look like you’re so sleepy,” Sakeik remembered the woman saying before offering her a pillow. “Here, borrow this.”

The woman — along with almost every other passenger on the plane — was unaware that Sakeik and three others were in ICE custody. Sakeik had been on her honeymoon one day and detained the next.

After arriving in Miami, Sakeik and her fellow detainees were ushered to the back of the plane to deboard. Sakeik was searched and handcuffed while her new husband, a U.S. citizen who was not detained, was free to go back to their new home alone.

“I was just so filled with anger, it’s like human trafficking,” Sakeik later told The Barbed Wire. “Everything happened behind the airport, under the airport, on the side of the airport, I felt like I was being trafficked.”

Sakeik spent the next 141 days in ICE detention. Her release in July made national and international headlines as a dragnet of immigration crackdowns has caught immigrants on legal paths to citizenship alongside those with criminal histories who were the supposed targets.

As a Palestinian woman born in Saudi Arabia — a country with no birthright citizenship — she is stateless.

This week, Israel launched ground invasions on Gaza City as a United Nations inquiry found Israel has committed genocide in Palestinian territories. Sakeik has nowhere to be deported to — though that didn’t stop the Trump administration from trying.

In addition to her husband and legal team, Sakeik said a sisterhood she formed while detained with other women helped her to survive the trauma of her experience in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Now, she is using her platform to bring attention to the plight of women in detention, including the case of 32-year-old Palestinian Leqaa Kordia, the second Columbia University protester arrested this spring. Kordia, who did not attend Columbia University as a student but protested on its grounds in solidarity, has since been dubbed “the forgotten prisoner” while sitting in ICE detention for over six months.

The Barbed Wire spent several days with Sakeik. The following is reconstructed from her memory, as well as interviews with her husband, Shaikh, and her lawyers. Sakeik spoke in-depth about her time in detention to shed light on some of ICE’s increasingly scrutinized and legally dubious practices, which she described as stripping her of her humanity.

“Being detained was one of the hardest, most difficult challenges that I’ve had to face in my entire life. Physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually challenging,” Sakeik said. “I wouldn’t wish this upon anybody, not even my worst enemy.”

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said “any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”

The statement continued: “Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Why does the media continue to fall for the sob stories of illegal aliens in detention and villainize ICE law enforcement?”

‘There’s no place else that ward can call home’

The United States once seemed to Sakeik like a break from conservative Saudi Arabia, where she spent the first few years of her life before her family moved to Texas seeking asylum in 2010. Her parents’ asylum request was denied, but the family was granted an order of supervision, which allows noncitizens awaiting deportation or other immigration proceedings to stay in the U.S. without being held in detention. Their order required annual check-ins, among other conditions.

In Garland, Sakeik, who is Muslim, had “the most beautiful, craziest childhood,” with her tight-knit Middle Eastern family. As a middle child, Sakeik said she “wanted to do everything that my older sister did.”

“I wanted to breathe the same air she was breathing.”

Sakeik was a model student. She took an interest in photography in the 9th grade, when a teacher, who she affectionately called Mamma Donna, handed her a camera. She stayed late to use a school laptop to learn Photoshop and attended football practice and games, taking action shots she’d sell to the players and their parents for $1.

Sakeik graduated early from University of Texas at Arlington in 2023, with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and a minor in Arabic, to build her photography business.

All the while, her annual check-ins with ICE had become routine: She went to the same ICE processing center every year for 13 years. ICE officers there remembered her. One even congratulated her on graduating from college.

Sakeik met Shaikh briefly in college. He later hired her to take professional head shots for his job at Fidelity Investments.

“Headshot sessions take me like, max, 25 minutes. This took two hours,” Sakeik said.

They got engaged in September 2024, then wed in Dallas in January in front of more than 300 guests. The happy couple beamed at each other, hands interlocked underneath twinkle lights as their families looked on.

They chose the U.S. Virgin Islands for their honeymoon destination. Sakeik said she picked it because of the gorgeous views. But it also kept her in line with one of the conditions of her order of supervision — she must remain in a U.S. territory.

In a photo taken in St. Thomas, Sakeik smiles, relaxed, on the edge of a pier in a white silk dress. After nine days of watching glorious sunsets over the water, Sakeik and Shaikh packed and headed out from their hotel, back home.

But when they arrived at the St. Thomas airport, Sakeik was flagged by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent who asked if she was a U.S. citizen. Sakeik tried to explain that she had an order of supervision that allowed her to legally stay in the country, and had been in compliance with ICE for years. She said she showed him notice of her next reporting date with ICE as proof. It didn’t seem to matter.

When she asked why she was detained, Sakeik said the agent told her it was because she’s not a U.S. citizen.

Photos of Sakeik’s life — her graduation, wedding, and honeymoon — were soon splashed across news sites the world over, as her husband pleaded for her release.

During her detainment, Sakeik was shuttled between three facilities, each of which she said suffered from overcrowding and hygiene issues. In some, there were cockroaches, ants, grasshoppers, and spiders, which bit the women, Sakeik said after she was released.

Sakeik’s legal team argued that the U.S. government did not have the right to deport her due to protections offered to Palestinians under a deferred enforced departure memorandum enacted by the Biden administration. Because of the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack carried out by Hamas, the Biden administration determined that civilians were in danger in Gaza and deferred the removal of Palestinians in the United States until Aug. 13 of this year.

Yet, the Department of Homeland Security said they had the authority to detain her.

“Ward Sakeik chose to fly over international waters outside the U.S. customs zone and was then flagged by CBP trying to renter (sic) the continental U.S.,” McLaughlin, the assistant secretary, said in a statement.

Sakeik’s lawyers disagreed. Maria Kari, an attorney on Sakeik’s legal team, emphasized that her client had a right to travel to U.S. territory.

“We all have these documents that we take for granted that allow us to get on flights and see the world, but this is something that Sakeik has never had,” Kari added. “There is no country that claims her to be a citizen of that country. There is no place else that Sakeik can call home.”

‘This is just the beginning’

By the time the van reached what seemed to be an old pink adobe hotel, Sakeik was indignant. Only later did she learn she was at the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

The staff, Sakeik said, were disrespectful — “they literally bullied us.” The food was disgusting. “I wouldn’t even feed it to dogs,” she said. And it was freezing cold.

“I started getting extreme depression. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t talk, I felt paralyzed,” Sakeik said. “I would cry the entire time. I started having panic attacks.”

By her third week in Broward, Sakeik said she realized she needed to get into a routine. She started working out with old dance DVDs. And she made friends: She bonded with a woman from Slovakia and two Muslim women in her dorm.

Meanwhile, Sakeik and her legal team filed a green card application, and a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. They argued she was being wrongfully detained, in violation of the Biden administration’s deferred enforcement memo.

As her lawyers continued to work on her case back in Texas, Sakeik began making preparations for Ramadan, a sacred time for Muslims that typically involves fasting, communal prayer, and reflection. She said she got the OK from officers and the art department to hang lanterns and a banner she made that read, “Ramadan Kareem.” Later, she was instructed to take it all down.

“I’m celebrating the holiday that’s supposed to be the closest with families alone in a place that I don’t know, I don’t have family around me, and you took down my decorations,” Sakeik said. “I started crying, but I didn’t let it get to me.”

Instead, she decided to host a dinner. Sakeik used commissary funds for ingredients, and with help from a friend from Taiwan, she made sushi from crushed Doritos, tortillas, and uncooked Maruchan noodles.

That same night, Sakeik said she was told to pack her bags. “Baby, you are going back home! You’re going to Dallas,’” Sakeik remembered an officer telling her. She left her shampoo and conditioner along with her remaining food as a parting gift to her roommates. But as she waited with a handful of other women downstairs, a friend turned to her: “I don’t think we’re going home. We’re being transferred. This is just the beginning.”

‘Just like human trafficking’

Sakeik and her friend spent two days in handcuffs as they were transferred to Texas, first to a facility in Harlingen, then El Valle Detention Center outside of McAllen.

The facility was packed, Sakeik said, and covered in dust. Every day, more women were shuffled in, processed, and then taken away, “literally, just like human trafficking.” By the time she left, Sakeik said there were 100 detained women in each of the three women’s dorms. There was no privacy, even in bathrooms where they showered six at a time.

She faced a greater language barrier at El Valle since many detainees only spoke Spanish.

Still, she managed to make friends. She got close with another Muslim woman. They cooked together, ate together, prayed together.

“It’s very normal to bond off of trauma. So a lot of friendships are being made in there,” Sakeik said. “You have to now make family there, because God knows how long it’s gonna take for you to see your actual family.”

On June 11, Sakeik was told she was being transferred, though not where.

“I didn’t even pack my stuff. I was too busy saying goodbye to all the girls,” she said.

Her newfound friends cried, cheered her on, and helped her gather her things: “It was a beautiful sisterhood.”

She was put in a van and taken to Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, where other women told her they’d already spent four days in an overcrowded intake room. Later, she was shuffled to another room, where Sakeik said she slept on the ground. The next day, Sakeik said ICE agents wrote numbers on their wrists — she was #4 — then boarded them onto a bus to Alliance Airport in Fort Worth.

When Sakeik saw that the Palestinian woman next to her had a #3 on her wrist, she said she knew she was being deported. She had only $45. She turned to the woman and said, “‘Can I please stay with you until my husband comes? Please?’ She’s like, ‘Absolutely. We have enough to buy a shawarma and to make a phone call.’”

However, with no explanation, Sakeik and the Palestinians on the bus were brought back to Prairieland. She later heard that Israel’s airspace may have been closed following their bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Back at Prairieland, Sakeik met 32-year-old Leqaa Kordia.

Like Mahmoud Khalil, Kordia was arrested after protesting at Columbia University over the war in Gaza last year, though prosecutors later dropped the charges against her. Then, after President Donald Trump came into office threatening to deport protesters who are foreign students, Kordia was arrested in March in New Jersey. The Department of Homeland Security said she’d overstayed an expired student visa; her lawyers said she’s been detained for her pro-Palestinian activism.

Just a week earlier, Kordia had been confined to Prairieland while a federal court hearing in her case went on without her.

Both cases had made national news.

“I saw you on TV!” Kordia later said to Ward when the pair first met.

Ward said she could tell that Kordia — wrapped in a sweater — was sick. The fact that she was still so friendly was endearing to Sakeik. The pair became fast friends. They talked about growing up in Middle Eastern households, their favorite dresses, “girl talk, all that good stuff.”

For Sakeik, Prairieland was both the closest to — and furthest from — home. After the failed effort in mid-June, ICE attempted to deport Sakeik again on June 30.

By then, her lawyers had filed an emergency motion to keep her in the country, as well as another habeas petition in federal court for the Northern District of Texas. They asserted that the government had violated Sakeik’s due process by trying to deport her while deferred enforcement for Palestinians was still in effect. A judge in the case granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from being deported.

Sakeik’s husband and lawyers said that, despite the order, they had to argue with Prairieland staff over the phone to stop them from moving her again.

“Two days later, I was released,” Sakeik said. She later found out she had been, once again, only a hair’s breadth away from being deported.

‘They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers’

Sakeik and her lawyers spoke at a press conference from the Wyndham Hotel in Irving on July 3 — fewer than 36 hours after she was finally released. The hotel was familiar; she’d done photoshoots at its wedding venue.

The specifics of Sakeik’s legal status are complex. She had a final order of deportation stemming from her parents’ asylum application years ago — which DHS said was part of the reason she was detained.

However, her lawyer, Maria Kari, said that the final order was issued when she was a child, and that it doesn’t mean immediate deportation. “You won’t be removed if there’s no place that accepts you, and there is no place that accepts Ward and her family,” Kari told The Barbed Wire. “They are stateless.”

Additionally, Kari said Sakeik has never had a credible fear interview — part of the asylum process allowing applicants to explain why they fear persecution or torture were they to be deported. Sakeik said she fears, in part, that no country will take her.

DHS said that “following her American husband and her filing the appropriate legal applications for her to remain in the country and become a legal permanent resident, she was released from ICE custody.”

Kari countered — “we don’t accept that statement, what they did was unlawful” — noting that Sakeik got preliminary approval on her green card application days before DHS tried to deport her for the second time. Still, she should be protected as her green card application process plays out, Kari said.

At the press conference, Sakeik summed up her case a different way: “I was criminalized for being stateless,” she said. “I didn’t choose to be stateless.”

Then she pivoted to her sisters — the women she met in detention, and who she is now focusing her efforts on supporting.

“I want to share with you the honor of those who I left behind,” Sakeik told reporters. “Women who come here for better lives are voiceless and helpless. A lot of these women don’t have the money for lawyers or media outreach. They come here to provide for their families.”

“They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers,” she continued. “They’re superheroes. There are humans, and their lives hold value, and I will continue to fight with them.”

Sakeik’s return home was accomplished through the proper legal channels, but her wellbeing was only ensured by her friendships with the women who kept her company during detention. These women, from backgrounds both similar and wildly different from Sakeik’s, provided her a network of support.

“We bonded over trauma, over this thing we share,” Sakeik said.

When Sakeik was detained, her husband and attorneys started a social media page and a petition to present to their local congresswoman, which grew to more than 4,000 signatures. Shaikh also gathered testimonials from Sakeik’s mosque, professors, friends, teachers — anyone they could think of. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yagqeen Institute for Islamic Research, also shared Sakeik’s story to millions.

Since her release, Sakeik has paid that work forward.

She has become an outspoken critic of Trump’s immigration policies, namely relating to the broad criminalization of immigrants across ethnicities and backgrounds. But she’s also become an outspoken advocate for Leqaa Kordia, whom she calls her best friend, and whose case has been platformed by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project. In May, Kordia’s legal team told reporters that she hadn’t had access to halal meals, which meant she had lost nearly 50 pounds since her arrest in mid-March.

In June, Korida’s attorneys filed a petition to the court citing the “miserable conditions” in the Prairieland detention center, which was so crowded upon her arrival that she slept on the floor and developed “a severe rash,” reported The Dallas Morning News. Kordia’s attorneys have said the lack of hygiene at Prairieland “makes her feel unworthy of God,” the newspaper reported.

That same month, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford issued an opinion recommending that Korida be released from federal custody.

Still, as summer turns to fall, Kordia remains in detention.

In late August, Sakeik held a letter-writing event on Kordia’s behalf, which drew almost 100 supporters to a coffee shop in Irving.

“Inside, you hold onto the smallest things that can give you hope,” Sakeik said in a video posted on Instagram two weeks ago, urging others to send messages of support to Kordia. With no phones inside, letters matter more than ever, Sakeik explained.

“To know that you have voices behind you” can make all the difference in the world, she continued. “People assuring her that they care for her and she’s not alone — and that she will never be alone. There’s people behind her.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/palestinian_woman_ICE.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:44.104986

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security.
“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers.
Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.
“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit.","The American Civil Liberties Union is suing five Wisconsin sheriffs over their practice of holding people in jail at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The group filed a petition with the Wisconsin Supreme Court this week on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigration rights group Voces de La Frontera.

The petition asks the court to take up the case directly. That’s because Wisconsinites need statewide clarity on the issue, said Hannah Schwarz, an attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin.

“There’s this really inconsistent patchwork of enforcement affecting the public rights of individuals,” she said.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone for an additional 48 hours after that person was set to be released, according to the lawsuit.

Most, but not all, Wisconsin sheriffs are choosing to comply with those requests, which are known as detainers.

But the suit specifically names the sheriffs of Walworth, Kenosha, Brown, Marathon and Sauk counties as defendants because those counties have been among those carrying out the highest numbers of detainers in Wisconsin, Schwarz said.

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law

Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security. If detainers are honored, someone could end up staying in jail even after they post their bond or after criminal charges against them are dropped.

The goal of detainers is to give immigration agents more time to pick someone up if that person is suspected of being in the country illegally.

But the ACLU contends those requests do not give jails the legal authority to keep holding someone after that person was supposed to be let out.

“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers. “We do not consider them warrants. Under Wisconsin state law, a warrant is something issued by a court or a judge. That is not happening here.”

The ACLU argues that under Wisconsin law, jailing someone for extra time because of a detainer amounts to a new arrest. According to the ACLU, that arrest needs to be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines that there is probable cause.

Schwarz argues the current practice of granting detainers doesn’t have enough checks and balances, and it can lead to the wrong people being targeted for deportation.

“In ICE detainer cases, there’s no neutral third party, there’s no judge,” Schwarz said. “That has led to a system where people can get wrongfully caught up in this dragnet.”

Marathon County Sheriff Chad Billeb declined to comment on the lawsuit because it’s a pending legal matter. Other sheriffs named as defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.

Even if it clears the Republican-led Senate, that bill is likely be killed by a veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

Republican backers have argued the proposal would protect public safety by compelling local authorities to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

Opponents, however, have said such requirements would take away local decision-making. And they’ve said it’s a mistake to treat local cops as an extension of immigration enforcement.

“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit. “(It) has a chilling effect on victims and the vulnerable who might otherwise seek help from the police.",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/08/new-gavel.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:00:23.553664

When including the removal of wildlife habitat protections—on public and private lands—the total impact of the rollbacks stretch across more than 175 million acres of U.S. land, an area larger than California, Florida, and Georgia combined.

Earlier this summer, public opposition forced Congress to remove language from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would have sold millions of acres of public lands. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s actions will directly affect far more states and regions of the country than Congress’ proposed sell-off, with more than 70 percent of U.S. states feeling the impact of these rollbacks.

At the same time, the Trump administration is also increasing sales that will hand corporations primary control of public lands, including those lands stripped of their conservation protections.

“Even after Americans loudly rejected attempts to sell off public lands, the Trump administration is rolling forward with actions to transfer control of massive amounts of public lands for corporate profits,” said Drew McConville, senior fellow for Conservation Policy at CAP and co-author of the report. “These efforts to unprotect and sell out public lands are wildly out of step with what the public wants.”

Trump administration actions to eliminate or weaken protections for public lands include:

Removing protections for some of the most intact national forest lands

Opening sensitive Arctic wildlife habitat for drilling

Eliminating restrictions on mining for ecologically sensitive lands and waters

Erasing conservation requirements and habitat protections

The new analysis represents a conservative estimate of affected lands and does not quantify the impacts from public lands attacks on the horizon—such as potential erasure of national monuments—or the widespread impacts of rewriting regulations and policy to favor oil and gas, mining, and timber extraction across publicly managed lands.

Since late December, J. Dale Shoemaker, a reporter for the Investigative Post, a nonprofit newsroom based in Buffalo, has filed seventeen Freedom of Information Act requests with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection to guide his deep dives into federal law enforcement activity, deportation actions, and ICE detention centers in upstate New York. In return, he says, he has gotten only documents that were redacted beyond comprehension, or nothing at all. “I have not received a satisfactory response to a single one of them,” Shoemaker said.

Ryanne Mena, of the Los Angeles Daily News, sent ICE a FOIA request on January 24 for all grievance forms filed by detainees at facilities in Adelanto, California, between 2016 and early 2025. Nearly eight months later, she said, she’s received nothing: ICE “has failed to provide me with an estimated date of production despite repeated requests.”

Monica Eng, a reporter for Axios, filed a FOIA request with ICE in February, seeking data she hoped would inform stories about where and why agents were apprehending people in Illinois. At first, she said, ICE officials appeared willing to cooperate. But by March, ICE had denied Eng’s request in full, citing “ongoing law enforcement investigations.” Axios filed an administrative appeal with ICE, but hasn’t received a response. “I have filed a lot of FOIAs, and my requests to the Trump Department of Homeland Security have been some of the least successful and least transparent,” Eng said.

ICE and CBP have become centerpieces of President Donald Trump’s quest to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from US soil through aggressive law enforcement tactics and billions of dollars in new federal funding. But CJR spoke to nearly two dozen reporters, editors, and other people at news organizations and open-records watchdog groups across the country who have filed FOIA requests with the agencies, and who say that ICE and CBP officials routinely deny or ignore those requests. The agencies have never been particularly open with the press, but many reporters believe that their experience is part of an enhanced effort by the Trump administration to conceal immigration agency operations, even in possible violation of federal law. Some also described the agencies’ press offices as functionally useless, with media officials providing few, if any, answers to even their most basic of inquiries.

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit organization that advocates for public access to government records, said ICE and Border Protection have an “abysmal” track record of transparency. Of 137 requests her group has filed with ICE and CBP over the course of 2025, there has been a “substantive response” to just one—“and that took almost seven months,” Chukwu said. “ICE and CBP remain among the slowest and least transparent agencies we deal with, routinely flouting FOIA’s requirements and denying the public timely access to information about their operations.”

This stonewalling comes at a time when ICE—and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security—has repeatedly cracked down on journalism about its operations. The department has described the video recording of ICE agents as “violence,” with a department spokesperson promising to prosecute those who “illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.” Multiple reporters have been arrested or injured while covering protests or anti-ICE rallies, including Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevaram, who was detained while covering a rally in Georgia in June, and Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi, who was shot in the leg with a rubber bullet as she reported on an anti-ICE protest in Los Angeles. In early September, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering DHS to stop using “nonlethal” weapons against journalists. “Under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protesters, legal observers, and journalists—as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” the judge wrote. “The First Amendment demands better.”

Some news outlets told CJR they believe that, in ICE’s and CBP’s handling of their FOIA requests, the agencies are themselves violating federal law by ignoring statutory deadlines or failing to respond altogether. By law, government agencies must determine within twenty business days whether to fulfill or deny a FOIA request and “immediately notify” the requester of their decision. Agencies may also extend this deadline because of “unusual circumstances.” If fulfilling a FOIA request requires significant time, agencies are required by law to offer requesters an “opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.” Requesters have the right to appeal agencies’ FOIA determinations, and if all else fails, they may sue the government in federal court.

Several media organizations have done just that this year, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and The Guardian. “Suing is the process at this point because they literally don’t respond any other way,” said Mick Dumke, investigative editor for Block Club Chicago, a nonprofit news organization that sued ICE in May to obtain federal records about immigration enforcement actions in the Chicago area during Trump’s first ten days in office. In Block Club’s case, legal action worked, at least in part: ICE released a list of area detentions and bookings but redacted key information such as detainees’ names, times of arrest, and the locations where they were being held. Block Club Chicago’s lawsuit is ongoing.

“ICE has long had an official policy to not comply with FOIA, and we have had to file lawsuits to obtain access,” said Susan Long, a cofounder of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which has itself filed numerous immigration-related FOIA requests this year. “The issue with the Border Patrol is primarily a problem with inadequate staffing,” she added. Asked about her organization’s success rate in obtaining responsive documents in a reasonable period of time, Long said, “Close to zero.”

In response to a series of written questions, ICE spokesperson Miguel Alvarez said in early September that his agency was working to “have some information to you shortly.” As of publication, ICE had not provided any information. CBP officials did not respond to repeated phone and email inquiries.

The two agencies do post some of what they call “essential records and information” in online FOIA reading rooms, as well as “accountability and transparency” or “library” webpages. In recent days, for example, ICE has released detention facility contract documents and spreadsheets listing details about arrests and deportations. But the spreadsheets lack key information about the people involved, such as their names, birth dates, and case numbers—data that would typically be available in police reports generated by local or state agencies. In CBP’s online library, a section for “body-worn camera video releases” contains only two such videos from 2025.

At the nonprofit newsroom CalMatters, reporters Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos did obtain a spreadsheet of the criminal histories—or, in many cases, the lack thereof—of CBP detainees in Kern County, California. “I basically annoyed them into giving us the spreadsheet,” Fry said. After their story came out, the government went cold: Fry says she hasn’t been able to reach FOIA officials by phone since late April, despite many attempts across multiple other FOIA requests. Reporters Doug Livingston of the Marshall Project, Evan Goodenow of the Loudoun Times-Mirror in Virginia, and Nancy Guan at WUSF-FM in Tampa described similar radio silence in respect to their FOIA requests.

Some reporters say that in the wake of limited government responses, they’re doubling down on shoe-leather reporting and community engagement to tell immigration stories. Bloomberg News reporter Mike McDonald filed a FOIA request early this year with ICE, seeking records about charter flights used to remove migrants from the United States. The agency denied his request for expedited processing, “and I never heard back after that,” he said. The story he ultimately wrote—“Airline at Center of Brazil Fiasco Key to Trump’s Deportations”—relied on the airline’s public financial filings, rather than documents obtained by FOIA.

Jenna McMurtry, of Jackson Hole Community Radio, took another approach: stifled by a “frustrating” lack of communication from ICE about a local enforcement operation, including no response to a FOIA request, she wrote an article and broadcast a report in March about that very obfuscation. “It was greatly appreciated by our audience,” McMurtry said. “We want to be able to understand who ICE wants when they come to town.” (In mid-September, ICE finally produced records responsive to McMurtry’s FOIA request, but they’re “mostly redacted,” she said. Her newsroom is still considering next steps.)

But for many, the grind of daily newswork or limited resources makes protracted FOIA fights impractical. “I haven’t followed up. Way too busy with other stuff,” said Denver Post reporter John Aguilar, when asked about his February FOIA request seeking information about ICE detainees arrested by the agency’s Denver field office. Mark Keierleber, an investigative reporter for The 74, an education-focused digital news site, said, “For a small, nonprofit outlet like The 74, filing FOIA lawsuits really isn’t in the cards. Sometimes I wish it was.”

Luke Harold, a reporter for the San Diego Union-Tribune, said he had a “productive conversation” with one of ICE’s FOIA officials in February about amending a request seeking records about tunnels below the US-Mexico border. But, Harold said, he hasn’t heard anything since. He filed the same request with Border Protection, which he said hasn’t communicated at all save for an automated email receipt of his request. “The only aspect of FOIA that has been efficient, for me, is rejection,” Harold said.",https://www.cjr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-black-box-bw.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:00:00.887312

Trump has threatened to declare a new national emergency in Washington, D.C., after city leaders confirmed that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) would stop cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The warning comes after Trump invoked emergency powers under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in August, federalizing the MPD and deploying thousands of National Guard troops to combat what he described as a wave of crime.

The order expired Sep 10., when congressional Republicans failed to extend it, returning control of the department to Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration.

Mayor Bowser announced the shift in approach during a press conference addressing the city.

“The federal government [was informed] that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating illegal aliens,” Bowser said.

She added that if federal oversight continued, the city would be unable to maintain the decreased crime in the long term.

“Crime would eventually come roaring back,” Bowser said.

Trump responded on Truth Social by blasting Bowser’s decision and pledging to reassert federal authority.

“To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!” he wrote.

The dispute highlights a long-running tension in the capital over local autonomy. Under the Home Rule Act, Congress and the President maintain broad authority to override D.C. laws and policing, a power Mayor Bowser has repeatedly criticized.

“D.C. residents deserve to govern their own city without interference from Congress or the President. Our local leaders know what is best for our communities, and federal micromanagement undermines that,” Bowser said.

Civil liberties groups argue that Trump’s framing of immigration enforcement as crime prevention is misleading.

Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of D.C., does not believe local police should cooperate with ICE.

“Immigration enforcement is not the role of local police — and when law enforcement aligns itself with ICE, it fosters fear among D.C. residents, regardless of citizenship status,” Hopkins said.

Advocates also warned that federal crackdowns often destabilize immigrant communities.

Casey Carter Swegman of the Tahirih Justice Center said the increased federal presence will not make people feel safer.

“This situation is tearing families apart and increasing fear and mistrust between communities,” Swegman said.

Some grassroots organizations argue the policy disproportionately targets vulnerable groups.

Eduardo Zelaya, organizing director at CASA, said he is concerned that the administration’s crackdown does not focus on legal status or criminal activity, but rather seems to specifically target minority communities in Washington, D.C.

“This is really alarming … This is not about you having a legal status or you being a criminal; this is completely targeting minorities in Washington, D.C.,” Zelaya said.

Trump and his republican allies in congress point to the results of the August surge as proof of success.

The decline in crime during the federal crackdown aligns with a broader downward trend that began before the intervention. Data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that violent crime in Washington, D.C., has steadily decreased over the past several years, suggesting that the recent drop is part of a longer-term pattern rather than solely the result of increased federal enforcement.

President Trump’s administration reported more than 2,300 arrests, though an Associated Press review found over 40 percent were related to immigration enforcement rather than violent crime.

Some officials from outside the District supported the Aug. 11 emergency declaration to federalize D.C. enforcement.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine agreed to keep 150 Ohio National Guard members stationed in D.C. through November 2025, citing ongoing security needs.

As the debate continues, the standoff underscores the fragile balance between federal oversight and D.C.’s push for greater self-governance.

“Our North Star is protecting Home Rule and D.C.’s autonomy. D.C. residents, we are going to continue to make the right decisions — the tough decisions — and we are going to get to the other side of this,” Bowser said.

With Congress now considering a series of bills that could further limit home rule, the U.S. capital remains caught between two visions of public safety — one driven by federal immigration priorities and another shaped by local demands for autonomy.

Keeping immigrants with no criminal record behind bars has led to significant overcrowding, deaths, illness, and hunger.
The effects of large-scale immigration detention on immigrants, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy will take months or years to measure.
Indiscriminate immigration detention is also expensive.","The Trump administration is building a multi-billion dollar deportation industrial complex to meet its reported goal of arresting 3,000 immigrants a day—more than one million immigrants a year. Despite the administration’s claims that it is targeting “the worst of the worst,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data show the great majority of immigrants in detention—more than 70 percent in early September—have no criminal record. In its haste to hit the historically high target, ICE is even arresting and locking up U.S. citizens.

If not criminals, who exactly is the administration arresting and detaining?

According to the Cato Institute’s analysis of ICE data, between Oct.1, 2024 and June 16, 2025, ICE arrested approximately 204,000 people. Around 65 percent, or 133,000 individuals, had no criminal record at all but were being held in detention because the government claimed they do not have a lawful reason to stay in the United States. Compared to the first year of the first Trump administration, arrests of noncriminals have increased 500 percent.

Many immigrants with no criminal background entered the United States lawfully or were protected from deportation at the time of their arrest, but the government now seeks to end their status. They may have been allowed to enter the country under a process called “parole,” which permits individuals to stay in the country temporarily at the government’s discretion, typically for humanitarian reasons. They could have been granted temporary protected status, which applies to certain individuals who face unsafe conditions in their home country; or they could have come to a port of entry and requested protection from persecution or torture. Others could have entered unlawfully—an act that under the law is confusingly both a criminal act and permissible if the person enters to apply for asylum; or overstayed a visa—an act that qualifies them for deportation under civil law but is not a criminal offense.

ICE does not publish data about the percentage of people in each category, but the Pew Research Center estimates that as of 2023, 5.6 million immigrants—approximately 40 percent of the 14 million immigrants in the country without permanent status and thus categorized by DHS as “without documentation”—had some form of limited status or protection from removal, such as a temporary protected status, parole, or a pending asylum application.

In fact, it is possible that far more than 40 percent of those arrested and detained have some legal protection from deportation. To meet its aggressive target, the government is likely pursuing immigrants who are the easiest to locate—such as those who already gave the government their address when they applied for some form of protection. And we know that the administration is targeting people who are going through normal, lawful activities like taking their kids to school, attending church, going to work, renewing a visa, going to an ICE office for a required check in with an immigration officer, or appearing in immigration court. Indeed, the sharpest growth in ICE arrests is those without a criminal record.

Cato concluded that ICE classifies 35 percent of the individuals it arrested as having a criminal offense on their records, with only 7 percent convicted of a violent offense. The upshot is that at least 65 percent of the people ICE is keeping behind bars are being detained without a public safety rationale. Instead of focusing detention resources on people who could pose a significant public safety risk, the administration is largely locking up immigrants who pose little to no risk, separating them from their families, employers, and communities.

In its zeal to arrest as many people as fast as possible, ICE has also unlawfully detained U.S. citizens, despite having no authority to do so. Northwestern University Professor Jacqueline Stevens, a scholar of deportation, analyzed cases in two detention centers from 2006 to 2008 and found that one percent of people in immigration detention were citizens. Assuming that percentage has held steady, that would mean over 2,000 American citizens locked up by ICE this fiscal year alone. The actual number may be even higher; Stevens only counted detainees who were later confirmed by a judge to be a citizen, excluding many released before reaching court.

Keeping immigrants with no criminal record behind bars has led to significant overcrowding, deaths, illness, and hunger. Immigrants in a New York facility sued the government, claiming they were not given enough food, were denied access to medical services and their attorneys, were not given soap, toothbrushes or menstrual supplies, and were required to sleep on the floor in overcrowded rooms. The court granted plaintiffs’ injunction and attributed the conditions to the administration’s ongoing policy of detaining immigrants to the maximum extent possible: “the heat remains on, and the temperature is likely to rise.”

With ICE rushing to open new offices nationwide, the deportation machine is expanding its reach and capacity, further accelerating arrests and detentions. The effects of large-scale immigration detention on immigrants, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy will take months or years to measure.

Indiscriminate immigration detention is also expensive. American taxpayers pay approximately $152 dollars a day per person to keep immigrants detained, thus keeping tens of thousands of immigrants who pose little to no public safety threat in detention for millions of dollars a day. Less intrusive alternatives to detention, such as the assignment of a case manager, cost as little as $4 a day. Assigning a case manager to the 65 percent of immigrants without a criminal record would save taxpayers nearly $5.5 billion each year, and case management programs have resulted in nearly perfect compliance. Under one program, 99 percent of immigrants showed up for a required appointment with an ICE officer and 100 percent appeared for court hearings.

Detaining citizens and immigrants without a public safety rationale is inconsistent with American values of liberty or fairness. It is also a waste of taxpayer money.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-22335615181.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 10:57:22.484678

Homeland Security touted information obtained through drones in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 10.
Five Democrats on the House Oversight Committee called the deployment a “gross abuse of authority” and asked Homeland Security to explain what had occurred.
“My bill to ban military surveillance drones over our cities puts Trump and his administration in check,” said Gomez.
“Los Angeles will not stand by while the federal government turns weapons of war against our residents,” said Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who introduced the resolution.","When MQ-9 Predator drones flew over anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles this summer, it was the first time they had been dispatched to monitor demonstrations on U.S. soil since 2020, and their use reflects a change in how the government is choosing to deploy the aircraft once reserved for surveilling the border and war zones.

Previous news reports said the drones sent by the Department of Homeland Security conducted surveillance on the weekend of June 7 over thousands of protesters demonstrating against raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Predators flew over Los Angeles for at least four more days, according to tracking experts who identified the flights through air traffic control tower communications and images of a Predator in flight.

Those amateur sleuths, who monitor flight traffic and identified the first flight, which was confirmed by Customs and Border Protection, shared their findings on social media.

Defenders of using drones to monitor protests say the aircraft, with their high-tech capabilities, can provide authorities useful and detailed information in real time. Human rights advocates fear the new policy will impinge on civil rights.

The drones, which fly at around 20,000 feet to conduct surveillance, can beam a live video feed to various government agencies — ICE, the military and more . The MQ designation refers to the drone’s abilities and function. In military parlance, M means multi-use and Q indicates it’s an unmanned aerial vehicle.

When asked about the additional days of flights over Los Angeles, Homeland Security did not directly address the questions but said the flights were meant to protect police and military.

“CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) has provided both Manned and Unmanned aerial support to federal law enforcement partners conducting operations in the Greater Los Angeles area,” the department said in a statement.

“Both platforms provide an unparalleled ability with Electro-optical/infrared sensors and video downlink capabilities that provide situational awareness and communications support that enhance officer safety,” the statement added.

Homeland Security touted information obtained through drones in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 10. The post included footage of vehicles on fire and protesters squaring off with law enforcement personnel, apparently to show why it was necessary for the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles.

“WATCH: DHS drone footage of LA rioters,” the post read. “This is not calm. This is not peaceful. California politicians must call off their rioting mob.”

The post was dated June 10, but it was not clear if the video was from a Predator drone.

Supporters of civil liberties are asking why this equipment, which has been used to drop laser-guided bombs on targets in countries like Afghanistan, is being used for domestic issues.

The deployment of Predators over protesters is a significant departure from the U.S. government’s policy not to fly the drones over demonstrations, to avoid the perception they are spying on 1st Amendment rights activity, U.S. officials said.

The last time Homeland Security sent a Predator to fly over protesters, according to U.S. government officials, was in Minneapolis during the 2020 protests against the killing of George Floyd by a police officer later convicted of his murder.

Five Democrats on the House Oversight Committee called the deployment a “gross abuse of authority” and asked Homeland Security to explain what had occurred.

At times the drones are requested by law enforcement or other authorities to fly over a region, say, to help monitor forest fires, or to provide surveillance for the Super Bowl, officials said.

The Predators come equipped with cutting-edge infrared heat sensors and high-definition video cameras, and can track scores of individuals within a 15-nautical-mile radius.

The drone uses an artificial intelligence program, called Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VaDER, to detect small objects — a human being, a rabbit, even a bird in flight. The infrared sensors can identify heat signatures even inside some buildings.

In response to the drone flights over Los Angeles, Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill in July that would restrict Predator drones and other unmanned aircraft from being deployed by the U.S. government over demonstrators.

“My bill to ban military surveillance drones over our cities puts Trump and his administration in check,” said Gomez. “This is not just about Los Angeles, this affects the entire country. I refuse to allow Trump to use these weapons of war, capable of carrying bombs, as tools for law enforcement against civilians.”

On Sept. 16, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing Gomez’s Ban Military Drones Spying on Civilians Act.

“Los Angeles will not stand by while the federal government turns weapons of war against our residents,” said Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who introduced the resolution. “Spying on people engaged in peaceful protest is unconstitutional, dangerous and a direct attack on democracy.”

The drones were first brought to the U.S. southern border in 2005 and retrofitted for surveillance operations. Homeland Security deployed the drones to fly the length of the 2,000-mile, U.S.-Mexico border, searching for drug traffickers and groups of undocumented migrants.

Just an hour south of Tucson lies Ft. Huachuca, one of four MQ-9 drone bases from which the drones deploy along the southern border and into the interior of the U.S.

As with the MQ-9, military-grade technology often finds its way into the interior of the country, experts say.

“It is tested in war zones, the border, tested in cities along the border and tested in the interior of the country,” said Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights organization. “That tends to be the trajectory we see.”

With a drop in migrant crossings into the United States, experts anticipate drones will be deployed more often over demonstrations in the coming years.

“If somebody in the Trump administration decides there’s a need to use drones in the interior over U.S. citizens, resources won’t be an issue,” said Adam Isaacson, who covers national security for the Washington Office of Latin America, a human rights research group. “Because there’s just not that much to monitor at the border.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a29d403/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+160/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2F4d%2F5d5d97e149efb3a8b27a778cf5ec%2Fdrone-policy.JPEG,N,,2025-09-22 09:57:18.888924

The United Nations also has overseen effective responses to countless humanitarian crises, sparing countless lives.
The administration shares the mistaken, though dominant, view in conservative and MAGA circles that the United Nations is intrinsically biased against the United States.
Whether it is privacy protections from AI systems, conditions in the workplace, or averting another pandemic, the American people have a direct interest in the United Nations.
Just as at home, the Trump administration is selling out Americans, their values, and interests at the United Nations.","Much has been said about the demise of the so-called rules-based international order since President Trump took office for the second time. Even before the second Trump administration began, the United Nation’s uneven responses in Ukraine and Gaza were generating questions about the integrity of this order. To be clear, descriptions of the post-World War II international system were often more aspirational than real. International law has been inconsistently applied, and many countries—particularly the great powers—have freely trespassed on these norms when it has been expedient. There have been extended periods in which veto-wielding U.N. Security Council members, the permanent five, have gridlocked the body. If the General Assembly has been more active, that is in part because it lacks any material enforcement power.

Yet, it would be unfair to consider the United Nations a failure analogous to the League of Nations. In addition to fears of mutually assured destruction; the comparative stability of bipolarity as opposed to multipolarity; and an era of American hegemony, the United Nations deserves at least some credit for the absence of great-power war—the Korean War being the only potential exception—in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. The United Nations also has overseen effective responses to countless humanitarian crises, sparing countless lives. And, perhaps most importantly, the alphabet soup of technical “specialized agencies” that most Americans do not even know exist have made life safer, healthier, and more prosperous for people on every continent, including Americans.

Tragically, if predictably, none of this seems to matter to the Trump administration. The administration shares the mistaken, though dominant, view in conservative and MAGA circles that the United Nations is intrinsically biased against the United States. The conspiratorially minded subscribe to the fever dream that the United Nations is a world government in waiting, primed to dispossess Americans of their constitutional rights. More sober voices in the administration are fixated on the limitations of the United Nations and the amount the United States expends on annual dues and voluntary contributions, personifying Oscar Wilde’s definition of a “cynic” as “a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.”

While a complete withdrawal from the U.N. system does not appear to be on the Trump administration’s agenda, it is pursuing a series of initiatives to radically scale back U.S. involvement in ways that will harm both America and Americans. First, the administration launched a comprehensive review of the U.S. role in all international organizations, which was scheduled to be completed last month. Though we do not yet know the outcome, the expectation is that the administration will decide to exit at least some international bodies it deems to be less relevant to U.S. interests—perhaps the Food and Agriculture Organization or even the U.N. Development Programme. This a la carte approach to membership in U.N. bodies may seem like sensible cost cutting, but it ignores the reality that a country’s actions (or inactions) in one organization can reverberate positively or negatively in another. In one recent example, the Trump administration failed to prevent a Chinese bid to host a meeting of the International Telecommunications Union, the organization responsible for regulating access to digital connectivity (something that impacts Americans on a daily basis), breaking a streak of U.S. victories in the organization.

Second, President Trump has already withdrawn from several U.N. bodies, preempting the conclusion of his administration’s review and undermining U.S. influence over important policies. This includes the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the U.N. Human Rights Council. UNESCO is responsible for, among other issues, setting global artificial intelligence standards and rules, funding Holocaust education, and promoting scientific cooperation on shared global threats. While the WHO’s performance during the COVID pandemic left much to be desired, it would be preposterous to suggest that Americans would be better protected from communicable diseases in the absence of an established coordination mechanism.

Third, the Trump administration has, so far, cut $1 billion in financial contributions to the United Nations through a congressional rescission and is seeking to claw back another $1 billion appropriated by Congress. Even worse, President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request would withhold the annual mandatory contribution to the U.N. regular budget; zero out peacekeeping funding from more than $1 billion; and slash voluntary U.N. contributions by $1.2 billion. Together, these cuts would amount to more than $4 billion—and that does not include planned cuts for refugee and migration funding that are often implemented by the United Nations. Critically, the administration’s financial wrecking ball would not only affect the bodies from which the administration has withdrawn but also organizations in which the United States remains a member. The International Labor Organization (ILO) is just one of the more inexplicable examples. President Trump should explain to American workers how ceasing funding for a body dedicated to promoting labor standards around the world—averting a race to the bottom in employment conditions—helps those negatively affected by globalization.

As has been reported, the major U.S. rival in great power competition, China, has eagerly stepped into the breach created by the Trump administration’s international retrenchment. Beijing has succeeded in placing at least 39 Chinese nationals in U.N. positions, increasing its influence across a wide array of issues and bodies. China also made a $500 million contribution to the WHO after the administration’s withdrawal from that organization. As President Trump is seeking to exit peacekeeping missions, China has contributed more than 1,800 uniformed personnel to missions, while Chinese financial contribution now account for nearly a quarter of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. In many ways, Beijing’s response has created the worst of both worlds for Washington. China is supplanting the American role on the “cheap,” doing enough to overtake the United States, but not enough to ensure the same level of public goods and services to the international community.

Amid the deployment of the National Guard in American cities, brazen assaults on the First Amendment, and the denial of due process, Americans can be forgiven for being skeptical of the United Nation’s relevance to their lives. The reality, however, is not subject to interpretation: Every single American is affected by what happens outside U.S. borders and in global institutions. Whether it is privacy protections from AI systems, conditions in the workplace, or averting another pandemic, the American people have a direct interest in the United Nations. Just as at home, the Trump administration is selling out Americans, their values, and interests at the United Nations. Under this form of “leadership,” Americans will always come last—not first.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/cap_social_share.png,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:25.410980

According to the Guardian, at least two refugee NGOs that support asylum seekers who received notices from the Home Office that they will be removed to France under a ‘one in, one out’ scheme have closed their offices after receiving ‘credible’ threats to their safety.

A statement from several organisations, such as Liberty, Care4Calais, Bail for Immigration Detainees, and lawyers, said organisations supporting migrants, refugees and asylum seekers had been the target of increased media reporting and social media attacks in the last few days.

These attacks are not just words on a page - they have consequences.

Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year.
Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year.
But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%.
“But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know what’s best for our local communities.","ICE arrests in Wisconsin from January to the end of July this year increased 22% compared to the same time period last year and most of that increase has come from federal authorities arresting people who have been charged with but not yet convicted of a crime, according to federal data compiled by the Deportation Data Project.

Advocacy groups say the increase in arrests has sown fear and confusion among the state’s immigrant communities, and the intensity of ICE’s tactics have drawn attention and controversy across the country. But Wisconsin has thus far avoided the full brunt of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown compared to the state’s four midwestern neighbors.

Iowa, which of the five states had the lowest number of ICE arrests last year under President Joe Biden, has seen arrests increase 293% this year under Trump.

Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year.

Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year.

Last year, Michigan and Wisconsin had nearly equal amounts of ICE arrests. But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%.

Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for Voces de la Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the administration’s tactics have caused fear to spread through immigrant communities across the state — even if the total number of arrests hasn’t increased as much as in other places. And while the numbers haven’t increased substantially, local law enforcement across the state has shown an increased willingness to devote resources to the federal immigration crackdown. The number of county sheriff’s offices participating in a federal collaboration program with ICE has jumped from nine to 14 this year.

“In many ways it is like a psychological warfare that this administration has launched,” Velasquez said.

Tim Muth, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, said the data can’t be used to predict future ICE activity in the state, but in the first eight months of the Trump administration, ICE is working with local law enforcement in ways that have terrified immigrants.

“We don’t want to speculate on individual statistics or on what the future plans of the Trump regime may be, but we can say that increased collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE is instilling a sense of fear and instability in Wisconsin’s immigrant communities,” Muth said in an email. “We know they are ramping up their deportation agenda, and they are relying on local authorities to make it happen.”

Trump was elected after running on a platform of “mass deportations” and taking advantage of a backlash against a spike in the number of people making claims for asylum at the U.S./Mexico border under President Joe Biden. But Velasquez said it feels like ICE’s increased role is doing nothing to address the real challenges of immigration policy.

“There isn’t this thoughtful, strategic conversation, to really solve these issues,” he said. “It has been very radical, the way that it’s been enforced. So on the ground people have lost that kind of sense of let’s talk about solutions. It feels very reactive. People are not shopping, with school started again, there’s fear about ICE going into schools. It’s charged with anxiety and fear. It’s unnecessary suffering that is being caused statewide.”

He points to instances in which people living in the country without legal authorization have been arrested after showing up for court dates or been accused of bizarre crimes by the federal government.

“What people are sensing in one way is this is a system that doesn’t make sense. It’s not working for us,” he said. “And then, on the other hand there’s people who are saying, ‘Well, I can be accused of any crime, and then I could just be detained.’”

The Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security officials have regularly claimed ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” rooting out violent criminals and gang members. But NBC5, a Chicago TV station, reported this week it could find no criminal record for people the department arrested on immigration charges, claiming they were violent offenders.

Across the Midwest the increase in ICE arrests has been driven by targeting people who have been charged but not convicted of crimes — a tactic that experts say violates due process and makes communities less safe.

In Wisconsin, under Biden, 56% of those arrested by ICE were convicted of a crime and 9% had pending criminal charges. This year under Trump, 60% of those arrested have been convicted of a crime and 24% have pending criminal charges.

That data includes cases such as Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the Mexican immigrant who had appeared for a court date in Milwaukee County in a misdemeanor battery case when federal agents from ICE, the FBI and DEA arrived at the courthouse to arrest him. That arrest led to federal authorities charging Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan with a felony for allegedly obstructing the arrest.

Nationally, 70.8% of people in ICE custody have no criminal convictions, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

“ICE will continue to prioritize the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes, ensuring our children are protected and justice is served,” the agency, which did not respond to a request for comment, said in a news release on Wednesday about its arrests of six individuals without legal documentation convicted of sex crimes in six different states.

While the administration emphasizes justice when it says it is targeting dangerous criminals, Muth said arrests of people not yet convicted damages the criminal justice system.

“Picking up persons on ICE detainers while charges are still pending subverts the criminal justice system and deprives persons of their right to trial,” he said. “We also remain deeply concerned about the ongoing erosion of due process, as immigrants across the country have been abruptly rounded up by masked agents, detained and arrested without explanation, all while their families are kept in the dark about what’s happening to them. These horrifying scenes point to the federal government’s willingness to ignore the rights of immigrants and betray fundamental principles of our immigration system.”

Luca Fagundes, a Green Bay-area immigration attorney, says ICE operating in courthouses is the “easy road” for rounding up immigrants because people have little choice to avoid a court date — even if the crime is as simple as driving without a license, which immigrants without legal authorization to live in the country are unable to obtain in Wisconsin.

“People are showing up to traffic court, and when their case is called their identity is confirmed, which makes it very easy for an ICE officer to detain them after leaving the courtroom,” Fagundes said in an email. “That person, who showed up for court (again, for perhaps something as simple as driving without a license) is now being arrested and detained by ICE. They will then be transferred to an ICE facility where they wait weeks or months for a bond hearing with an immigration judge. While in ICE custody waiting to see the immigration judge, they typically then miss the next court appearance they may have on their traffic court matter, and that results in a warrant for their arrest on that simple traffic matter.”

“It’s a domino effect of catastrophe for that individual,” she added, “and, if applicable, their family.”

Velasquez said the modest increase in arrests here in Wisconsin has triggered fear. But he said successful organizing efforts to protect migrant farm workers and prevent more law enforcement from signing agreements with ICE may have helped stave off raids on farms and, for now, helped keep Wisconsin’s immigrant workforce safer than workers in other states.

“There’s people who are being detained, so people are feeling it, regardless of the data,” he said. “But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know what’s best for our local communities. We’re not going to be seduced by money, by this administration. … We know our local communities better, and we don’t want our workers to suffer.”

“I think that there are powerful alliances that are being built across Wisconsin,” he continued. “That may be the reason why we haven’t gotten hit. But who knows — that could dramatically change tomorrow, right? So we do recognize the small victories, and this is good news, right? But at the same time, I think we need more dialogue. We need more common sense policies. We need more conversations of what we agree on.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 09:57:26.612906

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:

There is, alas, plenty of Supreme Court-related news, including the (now five) pending emergency applications from the Trump administration, all of which I’ll briefly cover below. But I wanted to use this week’s “Long Read” to tell a slightly different story—about cases that aren’t making headlines, for instance, the ongoing litigation challenging President Trump’s executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship. That order remains on hold—thanks to a series of rulings by lower courts after the Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling on June 27. These lower-court rulings have flown under the radar—at least largely because the government has not sought emergency relief from the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court, nor has it refused to comply with them. For now, it is “taking the L.”

That’s an important story unto itself—not just in the birthright citizenship cases, but more generally. For all of the attention that is (understandably) being paid to the unprecedented number of cases the Trump administration is rushing to the Supreme Court (we’re up to 28), and to the Court’s (troubling) behavior in those cases, they represent only a small subset of the broader universe of legal challenges to Trump administration behavior. In the majority of cases in which the government is losing in the lower courts, it is (1) not seeking emergency or expedited intervention from above; and (2) otherwise complying with the adverse rulings while the cases move (very slowly) ahead.

Because this reality doesn’t make for quite as attractive headlines, it’s one to which too many folks are largely oblivious. That’s a problem worth fixing—not only because it’s important to tell both sides of the litigation story, but because including these cases paints a more complicated (and, in my view, far less nihilistic) picture of the role of the courts—and of the law, more generally—as a check on the Trump administration. Hence, today’s post.

But first, the (more conventional) news.

On the Docket

There were only two orders out of the full Court last week, and neither came in a Trump-related case. On Tuesday, over no public dissents, the Court denied a stay of execution to Florida death-row inmate David Pittman, who was executed Wednesday evening. And on Friday, the full Court granted a stay of the impending state-court trial in the New Jersey Transit case—in which the Court has already granted certiorari to decide whether New Jersey Transit has sovereign immunity. The unsigned order came with at least a bit of an explanation—with the justices emphasizing that

the pending damages trial before the Supreme Court of the State of New York would be barred if New Jersey Transit Corporation were entitled to sovereign immunity from suit. Respondents, on the other hand, identify no tangible irreparable harm they would face if the trial were delayed until after this Court decides the pending case.

The extent to which the justices continue to publicly rest upon traditional equities balancing in non-Trump-related applications is quite revealing—all the more so in light of the apparent disappearance of comparable analysis from the Trump cases.

The only other news out of the Court last week was the release of an amended argument calendar for the November session—to accommodate the late-added argument in the tariffs cases, which is now set for Wednesday, November 5. Hamm v. Smith, an important Alabama death penalty case in which the state is the petitioner, got bumped—presumably to December.

To my mind, the real news out of the Court last week was the continuing accretion of emergency applications from the Trump administration—which filed three new applications, on top of the two that are already pending (I wrote about the administrative stays entered by Chief Justice Roberts in those first two cases for last Thursday’s bonus issue). Even by the unprecedented standards of the last eight months, having five applications from the government pending at the same time is, for lack of a better word, insane.

Just to briefly summarize all five, and their current posture:

Trump v. Slaughter (filed September 4; administrative stay entered by Chief Justice Roberts on September 8): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from removing without cause the last Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.

Trump v. Global Health Council (filed September 8; administrative stay entered by Chief Justice Roberts on September 10): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from engaging in “pocket rescissions” of significant sums of mandatory foreign aid appropriations.

Trump v. Cook (filed September 18; response due Thursday by 4 p.m. ET): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from removing a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors based upon untested (and seemingly pretextual) claims of mortgage fraud. As I noted on Bluesky on Friday, the fact that Chief Justice Roberts ordered a response without issuing the “administrative” stay the government was also seeking (and that he did issue in the Slaughter case) seems to suggest that such relief is not forthcoming.

Trump v. Orr (filed September 19; no response requested yet): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had blocked a State Department policy that would require all new U.S. passports to identify the holder by their biological sex at birth. (No, I don’t understand what the “emergency” is either.)

Noem v. NationalTPS Alliance (filed September 19; no response requested yet): The latest application in the case about “temporary protected status” for approximately 300,000 Venezuelan migrants—seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had granted summary judgment on one of the challenges to Secretary Noem’s abrupt revocation of TPS earlier this year (the district court rested on a different ground than the one that had formed the basis for the preliminary injunction that the Supreme Court stayed, without explanation, back in May.)

It seems likely that we’ll get rulings in Slaughter and Global Health Council this week. I suspect that we won’t hear anything about the other three (besides requests for responses in the last two) until next week at the earliest. And keep in mind that next Monday is the justices’ “Long Conference”—their first meeting in person since they rose for their summer recess, when they have plenty of other business to conduct. Needless to say, it will be yet another busy and chaotic week at the Court—even if no other late-breaking applications make an appearance. And given how things are going, that seems … unlikely.

The One First “Long Read”: What if Adverse Lower-Court Rulings Fall in the Forest and No One Sees?

One of the hardest things about trying to pay attention to all of the relevant legal developments these days is just how many of them there are. Whether or not it’s possible for any outlet to comprehensively cover the litigation against the Trump administration, it stands to reason that the headlines are going to gravitate toward (1) adverse rulings that the administration makes a lot of noise about appealing and seeking to freeze pending appeal; and/or (2) rulings with which the administration at least appears to not be complying.

The problem is that those cases are in the distinct minority. Even with its preposterous pace of emergency applications in the Supreme Court (28 in less than eight months), the Trump administration is not seeking emergency relief in a substantial majority of the cases in which it is losing in the lower courts. And although there are certainly some high-profile examples of apparent non-compliance (and other shady litigation behavior), those, too, are the exceptions that prove the rule.

A good (series of) cases in point are the birthright citizenship cases. Recall that, back on June 27, the Supreme Court partially stayed three different “universal” injunctions against President Trump’s executive order purporting to limit the classes of children who would be entitled to citizenship by dint of being born in the United States. The Supreme Court’s ruling left the injunctions against the order in place for the plaintiffs in those three cases—but nobody else. And so the question quickly became whether the order would ever go into effect against the rest of those who would be affected.

At least thus far, the short answer is “no.” Here’s a quick summary of what’s happened since in each of the three cases that were consolidated in the Court’s June 27 ruling—and a fourth case that was not part of the CASA ruling:

CASA, Inc. v. Trump (D. Md. / Fourth Circuit): After the Fourth Circuit returned the case to the district court, on August 7, Judge Boardman granted the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class action on behalf of any child whose citizenship would be affected by the executive order and entered a preliminary injunction on behalf of that class. Although such an order could have been subject to an immediate interlocutory appeal to the Fourth Circuit (an appeal during which the government could also have sought a stay), the government has not appealed either the preliminary injunction or the class certification decision. Instead, it is (slowly) moving forward in the district court; its answer to the plaintiffs’ original complaint is due, as it turns out, today.

Washington v. Trump (W.D. Wash. / Ninth Circuit): On July 23, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the universal injunction entered by the district court against the birthright citizenship executive order—holding that, consistent with Justice Barrett’s majority opinion in CASA, a universal (that is, non-plaintiff-specific) injunction was necessary to provide “complete relief” to the state plaintiffs. Judge Bumatay dissented on the ground that he did not believe the state plaintiffs had standing. The government did not seek rehearing en banc from the full Ninth Circuit (the time for doing so has expired); nor has it otherwise sought a stay of the ruling, the mandate from which issued on September 15. The time within which to either file a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court or to seek an extension of time for doing so is still running (it will expire on October 21). But even if the government does eventually seek Supreme Court review (something Solicitor General Sauer verbally committed to during the CASA oral argument), it will not have done so with any alacrity.

New Jersey v. Trump (D. Mass. / First Circuit): Two days after the Ninth Circuit ruled in the Washington case, the district court in the New Jersey case (filed in Boston) reached the same conclusion—i.e., that a “universal” injunction was necessary to provide the plaintiffs with “complete” relief. It therefore reaffirmed its nationwide preliminary injunction against the executive order on July 25. As in the Maryland case, the government has neither appealed Judge Sorokin’s order nor has it sought a stay. Instead, it is also now (slowly) defending against the lawsuit on the merits—with its answer currently due one month from today (October 22).

Barbara v. Trump (D.N.H. / First Circuit): At least some of the government’s behavior in the three cases that went to the Supreme Court might be explained by the posture of a fourth case—one filed in the District of New Hampshire. On July 10 (so, before any of the post-Supreme Court rulings on remand in the other three cases), the district court in Barbara v. Trump certified a “provisional” nationwide class of everyone to whom the birthright citizenship executive order would apply and granted preliminary injunctive relief to the “provisional” class. Perhaps expecting the government to challenge both rulings, Judge Laplante stayed his order for seven days to allow the government time to appeal (and, presumably, to seek a stay pending appeal). But the government did not appeal right away or seek a stay. Instead, it waited until September 5—three days before the 60-day deadline for appealing would have expired—to appeal Judge Laplante’s rulings to the First Circuit. And it has yet to file anything in the First Circuit seeking either (1) a stay of Judge Laplante’s rulings; or (2) even expedited review thereof. It’s appealing, but begrudgingly, at best.

In other words, there are now four different injunctions in place blocking the birthright citizenship executive order from going into effect—two universal injunctions (emanating from the Western District of Washington and the District of Massachusetts); and two injunctions on behalf of nationwide classes of everyone who would potentially be affected by the order (emanating from the District of New Hampshire and the District of Maryland). The only one of those cases in which an appeal is actively proceeding is the New Hampshire case, in which it is proceeding … slowly.

I realize that that’s a lot of litigation procedure to swallow, but it seems to me that there are four takeaways worth emphasizing:

First, these cases are not outliers. The obvious explanation for the government’s tortoise-like behavior is that it believes it is going to lose these cases (which is almost certainly true), but that’s also true in lots of other challenges to other Trump administration behavior. To take just one visible set of examples, consider the district court rulings blocking four of President Trump’s executive orders targeting specific law firms. Several of those rulings are now being appealed, but at a similar pace to the appeal in Barbara—the government filed close to the deadline; it didn’t seek any kind of stay of the district court ruling; and it hasn’t sought any expedition in the court of appeals. Especially given how successful the government has been at obtaining emergency relief from the Supreme Court, and at obtaining at least expedited review from courts of appeals (and the Supreme Court), its decision to seek neither should be read for exactly what it suggests—the government is going through the motions, but is otherwise accepting the inevitability of losing these cases. Were it more confident on the merits, there’d be much more of a reason to move with more dispatch.

Second, we’re not paying enough attention to these cases. I don’t know how many of those reading this piece were aware of the machinations in each of the four birthright citizenship cases discussed above, but I’ll confess that even I had to look up where things stood in two of them—and I suspect I’m at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to paying attention to these developments. Yes, appeals on the 57th day of a 60-day period without a request for a stay aren’t as newsworthy as a lot of what’s going on in the world (even in the litigation world). But that doesn’t mean it’s unimportant that the government is behaving this way. To the contrary, it underscores that the narratives we’re seeing in the media and elsewhere are skewed by the squeaky wheels. That may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean we should condone it. Instead, even if we’re not following every jot and tittle in the cases in which the government isn’t acting like its hair is on fire, we should appreciate that (1) those cases exist; and (2) there are a lot of them. That matters for calibrating narratives about how effective the courts have been as a check on the Trump administration (very, even accounting for the Supreme Court’s one-sided behavior to the contrary); for pushing back against hysterical claims from the right about allegedly widespread misbehavior by lower-court judges (Make Denominators Great Again); and, more broadly, for thinking about what “law” is in 2025.

Third, folks might recall the loud and sharp debate following on the heels of the Supreme Court’s ruling in CASA over just how much (or how little) of an impact that decision would have on the ability to challenge lawless (and allegedly lawless) behavior by the Trump administration. As I wrote at the time, the answer was always going to depend upon what happened both on remand in those three cases and elsewhere—and on how viable other means of seeking nationwide relief would be in challenges to Trump administration policies. It’s still early, but at least so far, the returns have largely borne out the views of those who did not think that CASA would be a cataclysm. To be clear, that doesn’t mean CASA was rightly decided (or even rightly framed, as Professor Jack Goldsmith has explained). And the Court may yet impose tighter limits on (1) nationwide class actions; (2) state standing; (3) what plaintiffs must show to demonstrate that a universal injunction is necessary to obtain “complete relief”; or (4) nationwide vacatur of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act—any of which will necessarily affect the ability of plaintiffs to bring nationwide challenges to federal policies. But at least for now, CASA’s effects have been decidedly modest—and felt most perhaps by lawyers, who have had to reconfigure many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Fourth, and related, the events of the past three months (and, indeed, the past week) drive home one last point that ought to be obvious, but that seems worth saying out loud anyway: The ruling in CASA did absolutely nothing to take pressure off of the Supreme Court’s “emergency” docket. Since the June 27 ruling, the Trump administration has continued to file applications for emergency relief at just about the same clip as it was filing before that ruling; if anything, the average has gone up. If part of the Supreme Court’s goal in CASA was to reduce the volume of district court rulings that would produce effects justifying immediate consideration of emergency applications, well, it failed.

More broadly, this last point suggests, as I’ve been arguing for quite some time, that efforts to defend the proliferation of Supreme Court interventions on the emergency docket as a response to the rise of universal injunctions in the lower courts are confusing causation with correlation. The Supreme Court is intervening in these cases because it can, and because it wants to—regardless of the scope of the relief the district court entered (the removal-without-cause cases—where the dispute is over whether a single person can serve in a single position—are good examples). Were there a more direct relationship between universal injunctions and the growth of the emergency side of the shadow docket, CASA should’ve had a much more dramatic effect.

SCOTUS Trivia:

Stays Directed to Federal Courts vs. State Courts

I’ve written before about the revealing difference in verbiage when the Supreme Court remands a case to a lower federal court versus a state court—how federal courts are instructed to conduct “further proceedings consistent with this opinion,” and how state courts are instructed to conduct “further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”

As my friend and appellate lawyer Sean Marotta flagged on Bluesky, that difference also showed up in the stay the Court issued in the New Jersey Transit case last week—a rare grant of emergency relief against state court proceedings. The Court’s brief order specified that the stay would persist “pending the issuance of the mandate of this Court.” That’s in contrast to stays of rulings in lower federal courts, which are usually left in place “pending the sending down of the judgment of this Court.”

This distinction reflects a very nerdy but potentially significant distinction in how the Court returns cases to lower courts. For cases coming from the lower federal courts, the Court does not usually issue a mandate; under Rule 45 of the Court’s rules, it merely sends its judgment (and, where applicable, opinion respecting the judgment) “down” to the court of appeals and/or district court. But for cases coming from state courts, the Court does formally issue a mandate—reflecting the (fascinating and, every so often, significant) reality that, although the Supreme Court has general supervisory authority over the lower federal courts, its powers over state courts are both narrower and more specific.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Portugal yesterday announced they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood. The series of statements came on the eve of the annual U.N. General Assembly this week, during which France has pledged to vote for recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel and the United States will boycott the U.N. summit, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the leaders who recognize a Palestinian state are “giving a huge reward to terrorism” and the international community “will hear from us on this matter in the following days.” Mark Landler reports for the New York Times; Dana Karni and Oren Liebermann report for CNN; John Irish and Michelle Nichols report for Reuters.

The U.N. General Assembly on Friday voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the Assembly using a video link, after the United States said it would not grant him a visa to attend the gathering in New York. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The Trump administration is seeking Congressional approval for a sale of weapons to Israel worth nearly £6 billion, sources say. According to the sources and documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the arms would be paid for by the U.S.-provided foreign military financing, and would likely not be delivered for two to three years. Jared Malsin and Robbie Gramer report.

President Trump plans to meet a group of Arab and Muslim leaders tomorrow on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting to discuss ending the war in Gaza, according to two Arab officials. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Netanyahu has asked the Trump administration to put pressure on Egypt for Cairo to scale down a recent military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula, according to a U.S. official and two Israeli officials. Netanyahu claimed Egypt was carrying out activities that amounted to substantial violations of its 1979 peace agreement with Israel, for which the United States serves as guarantor. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli forces yesterday blew up more residential buildings in Gaza City, killing at least 40 Palestinians and prompting many others to flee, according to Gaza’s health officials. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters; Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

Israel yesterday kept the main border route for Palestinians to cross from the occupied West Bank into Jordan closed, days after a Jordanian truck driver killed two Israeli soldiers. It is not clear when the Israeli Airports Authority, which oversees the country’s crossings, plans to reopen the route. Fatima AbdulKarim reports for the New York Times.

Qatar wants an apology from Israel for its strike on Doha before it resumes its mediation on a Gaza peace deal, sources say. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

NATO intercepted three Russian jets over Estonia’s airspace on Friday, which had entered without permission and remained there for 12 minutes. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised the alliance’s response as “quick and decisive.” Russia’s defense ministry denied that its jets had entered Estonian airspace and instead claimed that they flew over “the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.” The Estonian Prime Minister announced that he has requested NATO Article 4 consultation following the incursion. Sophie Tanno reports for CNN; Jaroslav Lukiv and Joe Inwood report for BBC News.

Germany’s air force yesterday sent two jets to track a Russian aircraft that had entered neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea. “Our quick reaction alert force […] was tasked by NATO with investigating an unidentified aircraft without a flight plan or radio contact in international airspace” Germany’s air force said. Reuters reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced a fresh package of Russian sanctions on Friday, saying “it is time to turn off the tap.” The package includes a plan to phase out purchases of Russian natural gas by the beginning of 2027, a year sooner than planned. The plan needs to be approved by EU members states. Jeanna Smialek reports for the New York Times.

The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting today on Russian incursions into Estonian airspace, U.N. and Estonian officials say. Nina Subkhanberdina reports for CNN.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Russia plans to intervene in Moldovan elections and disrupt the Moldovan government’s plan for EU membership, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The documents show that Russia intended to employ Moldovans abroad to vote, stage disruptive protests, and begin a widespread disinformation campaign on social media. The strategy was agreed in spring and coordinated directly by the Kremlin in order to undermine President Maia Sandu’s Party of Action and Solidarity chances of winning on 28 September. Bloomberg has been unable to confirm whether Russia is implementing these plans ahead of the election next Sunday. Alberto Nardelli reports.

Nepal’s new Prime Minister Suhsila Karki established a three-member judicial commission on Sunday to investigate the killings of more than 70 people by the Nepalese armed forces during the student protests that began earlier this month, as well as arson and the looting of properties carried out by protestors. Bhadra Sharma reports for the New York Times.

A drone strike on a mosque last Friday has killed more than 70 people in El-Fashr, Sudan, a senior medical source told BBC News. The source said 78 people had died and about 20 others were injured, but the process of extracting bodies from the building was ongoing. No entity claimed responsibility for the attack. Barabara Plett-Usher and Peter Mwai report.

The International Court of Justice said on Friday that Mali’s application to file a case against Algeria over the shooting down of a Malian military drone by Algerian forces can only proceed if Algeria accepts the ICJ’s jurisdiction. Stephanie van den Berg reports for Reuters.

An Israeli strike on southern Lebanon yesterday has killed five people, including three children. Lebanon’s Speaker of the Parliament, Nabih Berri, claimed in a statement yesterday that four U.S. citizens were killed in the strike, while a State Department spokesperson said “while the situation is fluid, so far, indications are that the five killed were not U.S. citizens.” The IDF posted that it had “struck and eliminated” a Hezbollah operator and acknowledged that “several uninvolved civilians” were also killed. Mohammed Tawfeeq and Charbel Mallo report for CNN.

The U.N. Security Council decided on Friday to implement “snapback” sanctions on Iran, with the sanctions coming into effect on September 27, 2025. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

The EU’s cybersecurity agency said today that airport disruptions that affected automated check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace over the last few days were caused by a ransomware attack. Without saying where the attack came from, the ENISA agency said in a statement that “law enforcement is involved to investigate” the malicious software that locks up data until the victim pays to have access restored. Reuters reports.

The High Seas Treaty was ratified by Morocco on Friday, the 60th nation to do so, crossing the threshold for U.N. treaties to go into effect. It is the first legal framework aimed at protecting biodiversity in international waters, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the ocean. The United States has yet to ratify the instrument. Max Bearak reports for the New York Times; Annika Hammerschlag reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Washington-Beijing Tiktok deal will ensure that U.S. companies control the algorithm in the U.S. version of the app, the White House announced on Saturday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the tech giant Oracle will be responsible for the app’s data and security, and U.S. companies will control six of the seven board seats. Aamer Madhani reports for AP News.

Trump said in an interview on Sunday that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the chief executive of Fox Corporation, may be among the investors involved in bringing TikTok under U.S. ownership. A source confirmed that the potential investment would be made by the Fox Corporation. Lauren Hirsch and Emmett Lindner report for the New York Times.

Nvidia and Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) have launched a joint lab in the UAE that will focus on developing next-generation AI models and robotics, the TII announced today. This will be the first Nvidia AI technology centre in the Middle East. Frederico Maccioni reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — COUNTERNARCOTICS POLICY

The U.S. military has conducted a third strike on a vessel in the Caribbean, Trump said on Friday, asserting that U.S. intelligence had “confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics” to the United States and that three people were killed. The real goal of the military buildup in the Caribbean is to remove Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power, according to several current and former military officials, diplomats, and intelligence officers. Andrew Jeong reports for the Washington Post; Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

Drug Enforcement Administration officials earlier this year advocated for a series of military strikes in Mexico targeting cartel leadership and infrastructure there, sources say. The DEA proposals, supported by DEA’s then-acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz, drew pushback from the White House and Pentagon, the sources add. Dan Lamothe and Ellen Nakashima report for the Washington Post.

Maduro wrote to Trump days after the first U.S. strike on an alleged drug boat in early September, offering to engage in direct talks with U.S. Special Envoy Richard Grenell, according to a letter shared on Telegram by Venezuela’s Vice President Delcy Rodriguez. Trump yesterday declined to confirm he had received Maduro’s letter. Stefano Pozzebon reports for CNN.

Dominican Republic authorities yesterday said that they have recovered 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat that was destroyed recently by the U.S. Navy. The officials from the Dominican Republic’s National Directorate for Drug Control said they worked in collaboration with U.S. authorities to locate the vessel. Manuel Rueda reports for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump administration officials are in talks with the Taliban about re-establishing a small U.S. military presence at Afghanistan’s Bagram Air Base as a “launch point” for counterterrorism operations, sources say. According to a U.S. official, the talks include a potential prisoner exchange, economic deal, and a security component. Lara Seligman and Michael R. Gordon report for the Wall Street Journal.

The Senate on Friday confirmed Michael Waltz, a former national security adviser, to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Trump removed Walz from the post of security adviser amid the fallout from the revelation that Walz inadvertently invited a journalist to a Signal group chat in which he, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other top officials discussed the details of a military operation in Yemen. Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States, Alexander Yui, this month privately met with the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, a group that officials say has emerged as a key White House power node. A White House official downplayed the encounter, describing it as an informal conversation. Gram Slattery and Trevor Hunnicutt report for Reuters.

South Korea would agree to a deal between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in which Pyongyang would agree to freeze production of its nuclear weapons, rather than get rid of them, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told BBC News. Jean Mackenzie reports.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on Friday that Budapest will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization “following the American example.” Christian Edwards reports for CNN.

European leaders are privately furious about U.S. interventions in their domestic affairs, and increasingly believe that Trump’s aides are pressing for regime change in Europe, aiming to replace governments of the center-left and center-right with coalitions of the far right, the New York Times reports. Steven Erlanger reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump on Saturday demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi move to prosecute several of his political opponents, urging the prosecutions of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), former FBI director James B. Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed all three were “guilty as hell” and “impeached [him] twice and indicted [him] 5 times, over nothing.” Trump also claimed he had fired U.S. Attorney for Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who on Friday resigned after being pressured to launch an investigation into James. Bondi appointed Mary “Maggie” Cleary, an assistant U.S. attorney who once claimed she was “framed” for being at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to lead the office on an interim basis. Jeremy Roebuck, Perry Stein, and Salvador Rizzo report for the Washington Post; Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

Trump said that he would nominate senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to replace Siebert. Halligan served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the early days of the FBI’s investigation into Trump’s retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Alanna Durkin Richer and Meg Kinnard report for AP News.

The Trump administration has shut down a bribery investigation into Tom Homan accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents last year, according to sources. Homan apparently took the money and agreed to help the agents, posing as businessmen, to secure future government contracts related to border security. FBI Director Kash Patel ordered the investigation to end over the summer, a source said, while a different source said that Emil Bove, a former senior DOJ official who is now a federal appeals court judge, said the case was an example of a “deep state operation” when he was briefed on the it in February. Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that DOJ prosecutors and FBI agents “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing” while investigating. Devlin Barrett, Glenn Thrush. Alan Feuer, Maggie Haberman, and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times; Sarah N. Lynch reports for Reuters.

The Defense Department on Friday said it would require journalists to pledge that they will not gather any information, including unclassified information, that has not been expressly “authorized” for release. Under the new policy, the DOD will revoke the press credentials of the reporters who possess confidential or unauthorized information. The announcement drew widespread condemnation from members of the press. Scott Nover reports for the Washington Post; David Cohen reports for POLITICO.

The Agriculture Department on Saturday announced it is cancelling the government’s annual report measuring household food insecurity, the federal government’s main gauge of U.S. residents’ ability to access adequate meals. Announcing the move, the Agriculture Department said the report had become “overly politicized, and … unnecessary to carry out the work of the department.” Dan Frosch, Patrick Thomas, and Andrea Petersen report for the Wall Street Journal.

The Securities and Exchange Commission last week dropped civil enforcement cases against Devon Archer, Trevor Milton, and Carlos Watson, three men convicted of large-scale white-collar fraud whose sentences Trump pardoned or commuted. The SEC decision to drop the cases means they will not have to pay any additional civil penalties to the government or face restrictions on work in securities-related positions. Kenneth P.

The Treasury Department has ordered the Taxpayer Advisory Panel, a federal advisory committee for the IRS, to suspend public meetings while the White House vets its membership, according to an email seen by POLITICO. A panel member said that at least two members of the panel are stepping down because of the White House vetting directive. Danny Nguyen reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Trump signed an executive order on Friday to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas beginning yesterday. Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft and others warned existing H-1B holders not to leave the country and urged overseas employees to return to avoid difficulty re-entering, according to notes seen by the Wall Street Journal. The White House announced on Saturday that the change only applies to new visas. Alejandra Jaramillo and Adam Cancryn report for CNN; Chip Cutter, Amrith Ramkumar and Ray A. Smith report for the Wall Street Journal; Myah Ward and Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration announced on Friday that it would terminate protections for around six thousand Syrians living in the United States under the Temporary Protected Status program. The Homeland Security Department said that Syrian nationals will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the United States, after which they will be subject to arrest and deportation, and that “conditions in Syria no longer prevent their nationals from returning home.” Washington Post

At least 1,700 of those involved the 287(g) program, according to data on ICE’s website.
Florida and Texas lead the nation with roughly half of all 287(g) agreements, driven in part by state laws requiring ICE 287(g) cooperation.
According to ICE, after a law enforcement agency joins the 287(g) program, ICE will train officers in immigration law, multicultural communication and avoiding racial profiling.
“287(g) agreements undermine safety in our communities, for all of us, regardless of what model it is,” she said.","Since President Donald Trump began his second term, agreements allowing local law enforcement agencies to perform federal immigration duties have surged from 135 in January 2025 to more than 1,000 in September.

The program, known as 287(g), lets officers from state and local agencies collaborate with ICE under three models. Responsibilities range from questioning immigration status in jails under the jail enforcement model and serving ICE warrants under the warrant service model to making immigration-related arrests under the task force model.

Local agencies pay the costs of participating in exchange for ICE training, limited enforcement powers and, soon, financial incentives from the federal government. A law enforcement agency can sign up under multiple models, depending on what resources they have, such as a jail.

As of Sept. 18, there were 34 agreements across Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, a sharp increase from just three in January. At least three other agreements are pending in the region, according to ICE’s public database.

“Most of our neighbors are doing it. Generally, any of those cooperative agreements only help us,” said Sheriff Chad McCumbers of Sioux County in western Nebraska. He joined ICE’s efforts under the task force model in September, and his deputies will soon have the authority to question immigration status and make arrests in the county.

ICE says expansion of the 287(g) program “keeps our communities safer,” a sentiment many participating sheriffs and local law enforcement officers agreed with in interviews with The Midwest Newsroom.

Interviews with participating agencies in the four states show more than 70 local officers have been authorized under the task force model, which acts as a “force multiplier,” that increases all parties’ collective capacity to carry out enforcement, according to ICE.

The Department of Homeland Security recently announced financial incentives for working under this model, and eligible task force officers could soon receive quarterly monetary performance awards up to $1,000, based on the successful location of undocumented immigrants targeted by ICE and overall assistance in furthering ICE’s mission.

“This bonus, which is essentially a bounty, has bad impacts at the local level, including for law enforcement leaders, who’d rather their police forces be focusing on actual public safety threats versus violations of civil immigration law,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council.

Revived and rapid

In late August, DHS reported that ICE deported nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second administration. At least 1,700 of those involved the 287(g) program, according to data on ICE’s website.

A DHS announcement in September said the rapid expansion of the 287(g) task force model since January has bolstered ICE’s personnel with 8,501 additional local and state law enforcement officers. At least 2,000 more are in training.

The model enables trained officers, under ICE supervision, to question people about their immigration status, make certain warrantless arrests, issue detainers and hold or transport individuals to ICE detention centers. They can also serve warrants, collect evidence and prepare documents for ICE.

The Obama administration retired the model in 2012 amid civil rights concerns. Trump revived it in his second term, and it now accounts for more than half of all agreements nationwide. In the Midwest, Illinois is the only state that explicitly bans the agreements.

The task force model is expanding ICE’s reach without directly hiring new personnel, which has been apparent in recent months.

Task force model partners have been part of multiple large-scale ICE operations since January, including traffic-stop operations in Nashville, according to ProPublica, and a week-long operation in Florida that led to over 1,120 arrests. Florida and Texas lead the nation with roughly half of all 287(g) agreements, driven in part by state laws requiring ICE 287(g) cooperation.

“It has been wonderful to see people jump in and be a part of it to make sure that we have not just the authorities that we need to go out there and to work, but also to have the local knowledge and the people in the community that really want to be a part of the solution,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to ProPublica in June.

In Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, 287(g) participation is voluntary, and decisions to join these agreements have been made without formal public input. As of September, all four states have one state-level agency participating in the task force model and there are at least 74 authorized officers across the region.

The Midwest Newsroom confirmed 53 Missouri Highway Patrol troopers have been trained under the program, along with three state troopers in Iowa and three agents at the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Six state troopers in Nebraska are in the training process.

At the county and municipal level, The Midwest Newsroom confirmed nine deputies in Pulaski County, Missouri, and six deputies in Shawnee County, Kansas, have completed training to participate in the task force model. At least nine others are in training.

Interviews with state and local law enforcement officers show efficiency and alignment with the Trump administration’s immigration efforts, concern about being labeled a “sanctuary” and encouragement from state leaders are among the factors leading to local agreements in these states.

“We got listed as a sanctuary county at one time, and we are not,” said Banner County Sheriff Zane Hopkins in Nebraska, referring to a now-deleted list on the Department of Homeland Security website last year. Hopkins said he, along with one other deputy, are starting their task force training this month in their county of less than 700 people.

For Sheriff Stacy L. Ball in Pulaski County, Missouri, it was a safety decision, he said.

“I have the I-44 corridor that runs from Chicago to Texas. So that’s a major corridor for trafficking, and whether it’s people or drugs,” he said.

Ball has signed all three 287(g) models, becoming one of at least 23 agencies across the country with triple participation in the program.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said this kind of expansion is strategic for ICE.

“They’re recognizing that ICE alone does not have enough personnel to be attempting to carry out Trump’s mass deportations campaign,” Bush-Joseph said.

The Trump administration has stated goals of 3,000 deportations a day and 1 million a year. Bush-Joseph said the new funding incentive will likely accelerate local partnerships.

Salaries, overtime and new cars

The One Big Beautiful Bill, which Trump signed into law in July, includes $75 billion for ICE over four years, making the agency the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in U.S. history.

The unprecedented allocation has trickled into salary reimbursements for eligible 287(g) officers and agency bonuses for identifying undocumented immigrants.

According to a Sept. 2 news release, starting Oct. 1, 2025, participating law enforcement agencies can be fully reimbursed for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary. A bonus structure offers up to $1,000 per officer per quarter for locating undocumented immigrants and assisting ICE.

Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of the Nebraska ACLU, called the incentive perverse.

“It’s going to encourage some law enforcement departments to put immigration enforcement over the real public-safety needs of that particular community,” Rush Chimpan said. “It’s just taking a model that was already harmful to communities and amplifying it.”

Sheriff Ball in Missouri disagreed with that sentiment. “This doesn’t give us permission to go out there and actively hunt. We follow the law, we follow the Constitution, and if it comes across us, then we deal with it,” he said.

Money has long been a barrier for agencies considering 287(g) participation. Local law enforcement agencies have historically taken on the salary, overtime and other associated costs of the program.

Prince William County in Virginia spent $25.9 million over five years in the program. Alamance County, North Carolina, spent $4.8 million for just one year of its 287(g) program, and Harris County, Texas, chose to end its program in February 2017 because it ended up costing an extra $675,000 per year.

It is unclear how much the program is costing counties or states in the central Midwest.

On Sept. 2, Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest law enforcement organization in the U.S., issued a statement celebrating the announcement of the cash infusion from ICE.

“The new reimbursement models reflect DHS’s commitment to equipping our TFM (task force model) programs with the tools and resources needed to meet all challenges,” Yoes wrote.

Yoes said that every trained and credentialed officer will receive up to $7,500 for essential equipment, including a laptop and mobile phone with cellular service upon becoming operational and qualified law enforcement agencies may receive up to $100,000 for the purposes of purchasing new vehicles.

Yoes and the Fraternal Order of Police did not respond to requests for comment. ICE and DHS did not respond to requests for comment about the new reimbursement opportunities. Two local agencies in the region confirmed they have received communications from ICE about the funding.

Most law enforcement agencies contacted for this story said the new funding announcement does not immediately change their procedures, but for McCumbers, in Sioux County, Nebraska, it means the possibility of hiring more staff in his county of about 1,100 residents.

“We’re very busy as it is, but it might change priorities a little bit if we have a monetary incentive,” McCumbers said.

‘Ripe for abuse’

When Brown County, Nebraska, received an outreach email about the 287(g) program this year, the sheriff signed up for all three models.

A Brown County official said the county did not want to be seen as not cooperating with ICE, thinking the counties around them would also sign up.

The county soon found itself in agreements it could not fulfill with a small, rural department. In January, ICE suspended its advisory board to process agreements in a “timely manner,” leaving no designated oversight group to vet applications from local agencies.

A Brown County official said she was left to figure the program out herself, and leaders quickly decided to withdraw from all three memoranda of understanding with ICE.

“We’ve decided to withdraw from the 287(g) MOU on all models,” Brown County said in an emailed statement to The Midwest Newsroom. “It is our opinion that this program is better suited for Law Enforcement at NSP [Nebraska State Patrol] or large cities such as Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island or counties with I-80 running through them.”

ICE did not respond to emails asking about Brown County’s approval. The county also declined to share its emails with ICE, citing privacy reasons. As of Sept. 18, it is still listed as a participating agency on ICE’s public list.

Immigration advocates said Brown County’s short-lived involvement with ICE again raises the question of oversight in the program. In 2018, ICE’s own internal watchdog released a report stating that ICE had not prepared adequately for 287(g) program growth and might not be training or monitoring law enforcement officers efficiently.

In 2021, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, released a separate report outlining how ICE had expanded the program rapidly without measuring whether it improved public safety or ensured that civil rights safeguards were being followed.

“With that proliferation of these agreements and very little oversight, no one checking to ensure that they are adhering to laws, the Constitution, you know, it is ripe for abuse,” said Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog currently suing ICE for withholding public records related to 287(g).

As of September 2025, the Government Accountability Office is still monitoring two open recommendations on its website that have yet to be addressed. They include establishing performance measures and goals to manage the program and to assess its partners to optimize program resources. ICE did not respond to emails asking about its 287(g) oversight mechanisms.

Three sheriffs participating in the program told The Midwest Newsroom that oversight has been sufficient and they do not have civil rights concerns.

Training fast-tracked

Training has been a main concern for immigration advocates critical of the 287(g) program. According to ICE, after a law enforcement agency joins the 287(g) program, ICE will train officers in immigration law, multicultural communication and avoiding racial profiling.

In a June complaint, American Oversight asked for instruction and guidance materials as well as emails about the training, but is still waiting for the requested documents.

“We’re asking for materials that should have already been created, training materials,” Chukwu said. “It is unreasonable for them to take as long as they’ve taken to produce information.”

In Florida, training has been streamlined in recent months according to a news report from WUSF. Previously, the jail enforcement model required four weeks of training, and is now only five days. The warrant service officer model training went from eight to four hours. The task force model training reportedly requires 40 hours of training.

“One week of training is certainly not enough to meaningfully educate somebody on what enforcement should look like and what violations of immigration law matter,” said Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy organization.

“We understand from talking to sheriffs around the country that they are decreasing the training requirements and sometimes just talking about training and not following up meaningfully in practice and using PowerPoints that exclude training on the Fourth Amendment and protections against racial discrimination,” Gupta said.

In Missouri, Pulaski County Sheriff Stacy L. Ball said the training is online and in-depth.

“There’s a lot to go through, and at the end, you take a test of your knowledge for each module,” Ball said. “We don’t know every law. We got to look in our books, just like everything, and that’s what this is. This gives us a foundation.”

No chance for public comment

According to ICE guidance, a participating agency must hold a public steering committee meeting, consisting of local law enforcement leadership and ICE officials, in the first six months of a 287(g) agreement, with 30 days’ notice before the meeting.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation did not hold a public meeting. In an email to The Midwest Newsroom, a KBI representative said this requirement was not an explicit part of its 287(g) agreement. The agency referred all reporter questions to ICE, which did not respond. The Iowa Department of Public Safety is past the 30-day advanced notice mark and also has not scheduled a public meeting, even in the face of public calls to end its 287(g) agreement.

“We won’t stop until the Iowa ICE Task Force is disbanded and civil rights are respected,” Iowa resident Ninoska Campos told KCRG. Campos was one of seven people asked about their immigration status during an April traffic stop in Dubuque, Iowa.

The Iowa Department of Public Safety told The Midwest Newsroom that the officer involved was not a 287(g) task force officer, and he did not contact one during the stop.

“287(g) agreements have already led to that kind of racial profiling because local police, of course, cannot tell if a person is undocumented or in violation of immigration law, because nobody wears that as a sign on their head, and so local police often go into communities where they’re more likely to find immigrants,” Gupta said.

Gupta also said the agreements undermine public safety by making immigrant communities afraid to report crime, and they divert local policing resources away from public safety challenges.

Rush Chipman, the ACLU of Nebraska executive director, said she saw this firsthand in Dakota County, Nebraska, in 2018, when it signed the first 287(g) agreement in the state. At the time, she was a practicing immigration lawyer, and said her clients were worried about reporting crime out of fear they could be questioned themselves.

“287(g) agreements undermine safety in our communities, for all of us, regardless of what model it is,” she said.

METHODS

To report this story, journalist Naomi Delkamiller interviewed five law enforcement officers in active 287(g) agreements in the central Midwest to learn why they decided to participate, if they had civil rights concerns and if newly announced financial incentives would affect their policing. She had email correspondence with four additional law enforcement agencies in the region and reviewed dozens of 287(g) MOAs covering all three models. She reached out to policy analysts, experts and immigrant-rights advocates to understand the existence and effects of these partnerships and reviewed multiple investigations related to the oversight and transparency of the program. Delkamiller also looked at current litigation involving the program and local and state laws that encourage or ban participation across the country.

These changes, along with other recent policy shifts, will make the path to U.S. citizenship more challenging for many applicants.

What is changing?

The new civics test will require applicants to answer 20 questions, instead of the current 10 questions. Additionally, the number of possible questions is increasing from 100 to 128. While most questions are the same, the new test adds more ""why"" questions (e.g., ""Why is the Electoral College important?"" ""Supreme Court justices serve for life. Why?"" ""Why is it important to pay federal taxes?"" ""Why were the Federalist Papers important?"" ""Why did the United States enter World War I?""). The new test asks many more questions on American history since the 20th century, and it eliminates all geography questions. It also adds more questions on federalism and increases the number of examples that must be given to answer certain questions (e.g., ""There were 13 original states. Name five [rather than three]."")

When will the changes be implemented?

Applicants filing on or after October 18, 2025 (30 days after the Federal Register notice) will have to take the new test. Applicants who are at least 65 years old who have resided in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents for at least 20 years will continue to have a more abbreviated test: They will continue to have to answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly, and the possible questions will be specifically marked on the new test.

Why is this happening?

USCIS says these updates are meant to ensure applicants fully understand and embrace American values. However, the changes are also part of a broader push to tighten naturalization requirements. For example, last month USCIS made changes to what is required for an immigrant to have ""good moral character,"" another requirement of U.S. naturalization. Until recently, good moral character was identified primarily by a lack of disqualifying acts and has included detailed background checks. Moving forward, USCIS will now take a ""holistic approach"" and look for positive contributions to American society, including receipt of good character statements from employers and neighbors.

A recently issued USCIS Policy Memo states that officers may also undertake neighborhood investigations to this end—something that has not been seen in decades—ensuring that naturalization applicants show character commensurate with the standards of average citizens in their community. Even actions ""while technically lawful, [] inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community"" may be disqualifying.

What are the possible risks associated with this approach?

While one hopes that these new requirements will be administered consistently and evenly, the changes could lead to discrepancies in adjudication, with officers potentially relying on statements of neighbors who may not know the applicant and who may be framing their knowledge through their own bias or stereotypes.

What should you do now?

If you have an upcoming naturalization test, make sure you understand the policy changes and study the correct questions. To navigate a rapidly-changing immigration law landscape, consider contacting our office to speak to an attorney.

“AI tools have been around for more than a decade.","The Trump administration is sharply expanding its use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement, using technology not just to track migrants but also to help determine who gets targeted for deportation.

To power immigration enforcement — a top policy priority for President Donald Trump — the administration is deploying artificial intelligence algorithms to sift through a vast array of records. Officials say the tools can flag potential violations, prioritize leads and direct officers on next steps, accelerating processes that once relied on slower, manual reviews.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons has described a vision of squads of trucks sweeping up immigrants with the efficiency of Amazon delivery routes: “Like Prime, but with human beings,” he said in April during the Border Security Expo in Phoenix.

Driving that vision is ImmigrationOS, a new platform that consolidates these tools into a single interface. The system, which DHS will start using Thursday, includes workflows that allow agents to approve raids, book arrests, generate legal documents and route individuals to deportation flights or detention — all in one place.

“It doesn’t just collect data — it structures what agents do with it,” a senior DHS official said.

While some of the technology has been previously used piecemeal for immigration efforts, the scale of this project is unprecedented. The system also draws from traditionally non-immigration data sources, including Suspicious Activity Reports and financial transactions flagged under the Bank Secrecy Act. Those tools — more commonly deployed in counterterrorism or anti-money laundering cases — are now being repurposed to identify potential immigration enforcement targets, from people suspected of identity fraud to those working without authorization.

Some experts warn the growing reliance on opaque algorithms raises serious concerns. Bias, overreach and reduced human oversight are all possible, particularly as the Department of Homeland Security ramps up deportations and executive orders pushing AI adoption while dismantling so-called woke or regulated systems.

“What we’re seeing in these upcoming contracts is a shift,” said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration nonprofit. “In the past, AI tools were primarily used to support efficiency — flagging a case for review or assisting with facial recognition. But the new systems described appear to be more prescriptive, guiding agents on what actions to take rather than simply supporting their decision-making.”

Under the Biden administration, DHS began publishing AI “inventories” to disclose how agencies use artificial intelligence. These reports reveal that AI tools are already embedded in identity verification, fraud detection, check-ins for alternatives to detention, and even chatbots for internal use.

Now that effort is ramping up, with the help of Palantir, a major government contractor also used by the Department of Defense.

Earlier this year, ICE awarded the company nearly $30 million to develop ImmigrationOS. The system is being designed not just to collect information but also to shape enforcement decisions — a move critics say outsources judgment to software and raises concerns about oversight and accountability.

CNN has reached out to DHS and Palantir for comment.

Palantir has said that it believes AI should be used to “enhance human execution and decision-making rather than replacing it” and that “it’s essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data.”

A former DHS official who worked in the current Trump administration told CNN that ImmigrationOS marks a fundamental shift in enforcement infrastructure. “They’re combining data sets from Treasury and other agencies into an observability platform,” the official said.

The former official added that the new platform will also use Internal Revenue Service and census data. It includes built-in workflows that allow agents to approve raids, book arrests, generate legal documents, and route individuals to deportation flights or detention — all from a single interface.

“You can go in and, you know, raid and arrest, get your approval to do that in the system,” the official said. “Then it’ll route them through to detention or removal. That entire lifecycle is built into the software.”

The former official also raised alarms about ICE’s growing dependence on Palantir. “One of the things that we’ve been concerned about is relying so heavily on a primary vendor … it means that you’re locked into their ecosystem,” they said. “Substantial portions of the IT infrastructure now require Palantir’s tools to function.”

Beyond vendor lock-in, the system also marks a decentralization of authority. Under new Trump-era directives, ImmigrationOS will be accessible directly to officers on the ground — not just at headquarters. “The idea is to push AI down to the operators,” the official said. “Let the officers on the ground use it how they see fit, instead of managing it centrally.”

Hubbard cautions that while the focus is often on facial recognition or surveillance, the real impact may lie deeper — in the quiet, automated decisions that affect who gets targeted, detained or deported. “If AI becomes the basis for enforcement action,” he said, “oversight isn’t optional — it’s urgent.”

Former acting ICE Director John Sandweg, who served during the Obama administration, says the debate isn’t about whether AI can be useful, but how it’s deployed. “These tools can be used for good or bad,” Sandweg said. “This administration has made clear it wants to ramp up arrests — they’ve said it themselves.”

Sandweg noted that ICE’s embrace of technology is not new. “AI tools have been around for more than a decade. They can play a critical role in identifying threats and terrorists. ICE has always embraced technology — in the past, it was to focus on terrorism threats.”

But he questioned the need for AI in certain day-to-day enforcement operations. “You don’t need AI to go to Home Depot and arrest people,” he said.

Additionally, a former top DHS official, speaking at an immigration compliance panel under Chatham House rules, said ICE “now has a new AI tool to do the work of I-9 auditors more quickly and effectively.” Such auditors are responsible for reviewing employment eligibility forms (known as I-9s) to verify that workers are legally authorized to work in the US.

The plaintiff alleged that the company's cash advance product violated the Military Lending Act (MLA) and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).

The servicemember alleged that the company promoted its advances as fee-free and interest-free while requiring a monthly subscription and imposing expedited transfer fees. The complaint further claimed that these charges resulted in triple-digit APRs similar to payday loans and that repayment practices, including automatic debits and repeated withdrawal attempts, worsened financial strain for users.

In its motion, the EWA provider argued that its ""non-recourse advances"" do not count as credit. The court disagreed stating that, among other reasons, the EWA provider mandates that consumers authorize the company to automatically debit their bank accounts for repayment, a clear indication that they expect to be repaid. The company also moved to arbitrate the suit, arguing its users agreed to arbitrate any disputes when they signed up with its services. The court rejected arbitration, ruling that the MLA applies to the case and accordingly precludes arbitration against covered servicemembers.

Putting It Into Practice: Courts across the country are increasingly allowing TILA claims against earned wage access providers to proceed, raising the possibility that these products may ultimately be classified as credit (previously discussed here).

Thanks to an outpouring of opposition from across the political spectrum, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) was forced to withdraw language from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that would have sold millions of acres of public lands to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.1 Nonetheless, a flurry of orders and proposals from the Trump administration—some supercharged by lesser-known provisions in the OBBBA—are still in motion to open up vast amounts of public land for extractive development, allowing it to be leased and claimed by drilling, mining, and logging companies.

The Trump administration has made little secret of its plan to let private companies drill, mine, and log America’s public lands. In fact, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum—who is charged with overseeing the majority of U.S. public lands—recently told those extractive corporations that he views them as “the customer” for his department.2

Compared with Congress’ failed attempt to sell public lands, these Trump administration actions have garnered substantially less public and media attention. But collectively, they will remove protections from approximately 88 million acres of public lands and directly affect more regions of the country than Congress’ proposed OBBBA sell-off.3 The administration’s actions include removing protections for some of the most intact national forest lands, opening sensitive Arctic wildlife habitat for drilling, eliminating restrictions on mining for ecologically sensitive lands and waters, and erasing conservation requirements and habitat protections.

Simultaneously, the administration is hitting the gas on sales that will hand corporations primary control of public lands, including those lands recently stripped of their protections. Together, these actions amount to a massive transfer of control over public lands and a dramatic reversal in the long tradition of American land conservation.

8 Ways Special Interests Are Asking President-Elect Trump To Sell Out U.S. Public Lands

Drew McConville, Jenny Rowland-Shea

The lands targeted for eliminated or weakened protections

Collectively, the Trump administration has already initiated actions that could eliminate or weaken protections from more than 175 million acres of U.S. lands—larger than the states of California, Florida, and Georgia combined4—according to new analysis by the Center for American Progress. This accounts for removing protections from 88 million acres of public lands and weakening species protections across more than 87 million acres of wildlife habitat.

TABLE 1

The reach of these Trump administration actions extends beyond the states targeted by the Senate’s rejected sell-off proposal. That plan would have sold national public lands from 11 eligible states, including Alaska and most Western states5—minus Montana, which was exempted.6 The Trump administration’s sell-out actions will reach far beyond, touching public lands in more than 70 percent of U.S. states.7 Counting the erasure of long-standing protections for the habitat of threatened or endangered species, the impacts to America’s natural lands and waters extend even farther.

FIGURE 1

The acreage totals detailed in this report include most of the protected land already targeted by publicly announced Trump administration actions, as well as wildlife habitat particularly threatened by certain Endangered Species Act rollbacks. However, these totals still underestimate the extent of lands at risk. In particular, they do not capture the impacts of redirecting how public lands will be managed more broadly—for example, by eliminating the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Public Lands Rule. They also understate the scope of wildlife habitat likely to be affected by gutting endangered species requirements and do not account for public lands actions on the horizon, such as potential erasure of national monuments. Moreover, they do not account for other public lands that could be affected by the Trump administration’s reckless push to sell access for oil and gas drilling, timber harvests, and mining, which could sacrifice additional areas valuable for recreation, wildlife, or cultural and historic resources that lack formal protective status or could not be easily estimated in this analysis.

Major actions in motion

The summaries below highlight the most consequential actions currently in motion to unprotect and sell out public lands to the highest bidder. Many of these actions stem directly from orders signed by President Donald Trump that redirected America’s public land managers to prioritize and expand drilling, logging, and mining, 8 while others were initiated or announced by his Cabinet leadership.9

Unprotecting public lands and wildlife habitat for corporate gains

A set of actions proposed or anticipated from the Trump administration is poised to erase protections for uniquely sensitive and valuable lands, opening these places up for drilling, mining, logging, and other extractive development. Collectively, these actions threaten approximately 88 million acres of public lands.

“Roadless area” protections for national forests

First announced on June 23, 2025, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is eliminating protections for nearly 40 million acres of national forests conserved as “roadless areas,” opening some of the most ecologically intact forests in the country to industrial development.10

Ending these forest protections, first established by the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, would open the public lands to potential logging, oil and gas drilling, and, in the case of Eastern forests, new mining.11 The direct impacts would be widespread, with national forests in 36 states and Puerto Rico losing protection.12 This includes the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,13 a national treasure harboring some of the last remaining old-growth coastal rainforest in the world.14

An estimated 48 million people source their drinking water from watersheds that currently enjoy roadless area protections, with major cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City reliant on drinking water sourced from now-threatened forests.

Erasing conservation protections for these forested lands would affect the drinking water supply for millions, unparalleled recreational opportunities, commercial fisheries, wildlife habitat, and much more. An estimated 48 million people source their drinking water from watersheds that currently enjoy roadless area protections,15 with major cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City reliant on drinking water sourced from now-threatened forests.16 Meanwhile, outdoor user groups estimate that roadless national forests under threat protect more than 25,000 miles of trails, more than 8,600 climbing and bouldering routes, and more than 760 miles of whitewater paddling runs.17 Finally, roadless areas provide habitat for more than half of the at-risk wildlife species in the continental United States18 and filter clean water that supports high-quality commercial and recreational fisheries.19

Although Secretary Rollins attempted to justify this action, in part, as a solution for wildfire risk, it followed President Trump’s executive order mandating a dramatic expansion of timber production on public lands and removal of “undue burdens” for timber.20 Additionally, recent analysis of more than 30 years of fire data found that roads substantially increase the risk of fire ignition in national forests.21 U.S. Forest Service findings published during the first Trump administration found that national forest lands with and without roads burned at similar rates in total, while also finding no evidence that roadless requirements were limiting fuel reduction activities nationwide.22

America’s arctic and other Alaskan lands

President Trump wasted no time in aggressively dismantling conservation measures across national public lands in Alaska, issuing a specific executive order on Alaskan resource exploitation on January 20, 2025.23 In addition to mandating the reversal of the protections described below, the order also targets protections for the Tongass rainforest in Southeast Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as described elsewhere in this report:

FIGURE 2

Western Arctic: On June 2, Trump’s Department of the Interior announced a proposal to eliminate safeguards conserving 13 million acres of “special areas” in the Western Arctic24 and subsequently unveiled a plan to open even more lands to drilling.25 The Western Arctic, also known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, is the largest stretch of intact public lands in the United States,26 and special areas are intended to conserve the most ecologically and culturally important lands, which are home for migrating wildlife and are relied on for subsistence by more than 40 Alaskan Native communities.27 The Trump administration’s proposals directly threaten one of North America’s largest caribou herds;28 polar bear, beluga whales, and other at-risk species;29 and breeding grounds of birds that migrate all across America and to every continent across the globe.30

28 million acres of D-1 public lands: President Trump’s executive order directed Secretary Burgum to eliminate long-standing protections for 28 million acres of public lands in Alaska. This reversal would open lands and waters across the state, collectively the size of about 37 Yosemite national parks, to destructive industrial development.31 Known as “D-1” lands and overseen by the BLM, these public lands are home to uniquely intact habitats that support vital fish and wildlife populations. About 75 percent of the targeted lands are designated as places where rural communities have priority to hunt and fish for subsistence.32 Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland reaffirmed protections for these areas in 2024 following extensive public input, Tribal consultation, and scientific evaluation.33 In fact, more than half of the federally recognized Tribes in Alaska proactively called for retaining the protections the Trump administration is now dismantling.34

Brooks Range and Ambler Road: President Trump and Secretary Burgum ordered steps to approve the Ambler Access Project across the iconic Brooks Range and Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.35 Rejected by the Department of the Interior in 2024,36 this destructive project—a 211-mile private road to benefit a foreign mining company37—would cut through 11 major rivers and 3,000 streams and disrupt migration routes for more than 164,000 caribou.38

Lands protected from mining and drilling

Consistent with President Trump’s directives to prioritize mining and drilling across public lands,39 his administration is now targeting public lands that were explicitly protected from mineral leasing and mining claims. Existing or proposed “mineral withdrawals” protect specific lands from extractive development—often due to their unique ecological, cultural, and/or recreational resources—and typically respond to requests from citizens to conserve treasured places at risk of destructive development:40

Boundary Waters (Minnesota): The interconnecting lakes and streams that comprise the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota are beloved by countless Americans for clear and clean waters, abundant fish and wildlife, star-filled dark skies, and seemingly endless opportunities for wilderness adventures.41 But actions by the Trump administration put this legacy directly at risk. With a social media post on June 11, 2025,42 Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that she and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum would eliminate the mineral withdrawal for the watershed that feeds the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, opening more than 225,000 acres of national forest to destructive copper sulfide mining opposed by the vast majority of Minnesotans.43 One month later, the Department of the Interior took action to reinstate canceled leases for the Twin Metals mine,44 a massive project at the doorstep of the Boundary Waters wilderness proposed by a Chilean-owned mining company with a track record of toxic spills.45

Greater Chaco region (New Mexico): In the Greater Chaco region of New Mexico, the Trump administration is quietly taking aim at protections prohibiting new oil and gas leasing on public lands surrounding Chaco Canyon and the Chaco Culture National Historical Park.46 Final protections were adopted for this 336,000-acre area in 2023 to conserve extensive cultural and historic resources, including more than 4,700 known archaeological sites, following decades of Tribal and indigenous advocacy and extensive Tribal consultation and public input.47 In addition to preserving sacred lands and a cultural legacy dating back more than a millennium, these protections encompass more than 60,000 acres of New Mexico’s highest-value ecological resources, providing vital desert habitat and connectivity for wildlife.48

Upper Pecos River (New Mexico): Without warning or opportunity for public input, the Trump administration canceled protections for the Upper Pecos watershed on April 4, 2025. Trump officials buried the notice about two canceled mineral withdrawals at the bottom of an unrelated press release, leaving reporters to later confirm which places were affected.49 These public lands enjoyed temporary protections as land managers evaluated a longer-term mineral withdrawal—and Congress considered permanent protections—to prohibit mining and associated impacts in the Pecos River watershed.50 Recognized by the state of New Mexico for its valuable waters and culturally significant to the Jemez and Tesuque Pueblo, this special area provides vital habitat for imperiled Rio Grande cutthroat trout and other wildlife, as well as various recreation opportunities.51 This watershed is threatened by proposed mining for gold and other metals, even as cleanup continues from a catastrophic 1991 mining spill of toxic sludge from a legacy mine located in this same area.52

Ruby Mountains (Nevada): At the same time protections were stripped from the Upper Pecos, the Trump administration lifted drilling restrictions for the Ruby Mountains of Nevada.53 Known as the “Nevada’s Swiss Alps,” the Ruby Mountains are a renowned destination for fishing, hunting, and other recreation and provide refuge to the state’s largest mule deer herd, at-risk Lahontan cutthroat trout, and other iconic wildlife.54 Responding to calls from Tribes, hunters, anglers, conservationists, and other community members, the area was put off-limits to new oil, gas, and geothermal drilling in 2024 while a process was initiated to establish longer-term protections.55 The Trump administration’s action leaves these special public lands immediately vulnerable to leasing by oil and gas interests.

Other Western public lands

Additionally, the Trump administration has taken steps to rewrite the rules that apply across public lands and redraw management plans to favor oil, gas, coal, and other extractive development at the expense of landscape health and future generations:

Public Lands Rule: On top of targeting protected lands, the Trump administration is gutting conservation requirements that apply broadly across 245 million acres of public lands.56 By moving to rescind the BLM Public Lands Rule,57 also known as the “Conservation and Landscape Health Rule,” the administration is targeting the fundamental requirement that natural resource conservation should be treated on par with drilling, mining, and other extractive uses of public lands.58 Eliminating this rule would undercut requirements aimed at balancing land use decisions, conserving the most ecologically significant lands, and considering community proposals to conserve highly important lands.59 Ultimately, the impacts of this rollback are hard to quantify in advance, but they will be seen over time as land use decisions skew in favor of extractive development and away from long-term stewardship of public lands.

Land use plans in Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming: Complementing the effort to rig the system by eliminating the Public Lands Rule, the Trump administration is targeting completed public land management plans for a hasty rewrite. In particular, the Trump administration has indicated that it will revise at least five recently finalized plans that govern management of public lands in parts of Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming.60 Mandated by orders aimed at “unleashing” energy and other resource production61—and mirroring legislation from congressional Republicans to revoke or block these same plans62—the effort appears particularly aimed at reversing limitations on oil, gas, and coal development. In total, such a reversal would eliminate or weaken protections for an estimated 6.4 million acres of public lands,63 directly threatening wildlife migration corridors, Alaska Native subsistence resources, outdoor recreation opportunities, and more.64

Endangered species habitat

One of the most far-reaching and harmful actions being advanced by the Trump administration is a proposal that would gut key habitat protection provisions of the Endangered Species Act. This landmark law prohibits harm to endangered species, which, for a half-century, has included injuring or killing wildlife by modifying or destroying their habitat.65 As a result, clear-cutting or strip-mining the lands relied on by endangered wildlife is generally prohibited if it results in injury or death of the wildlife. This is not an all-out ban on habitat-related harm; the law allows some activities to proceed with assurances that harm is appropriately minimized and mitigated—offset by other beneficial activities, for example.66

In recent years, the evidence of a global extinction crisis has become more and more glaring. In October 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that 21 U.S. species were being simultaneously removed from the endangered list due to their extinction,67 and scientists estimate that 40 percent of animals and 34 percent of plant species in the United States are now at risk of extinction.68 A top driver of this alarming extinction trend is habitat loss and degradation.69

But earlier this year, the Trump administration issued a formal proposal to completely eliminate this definition of species “harm” and green-light habitat destruction for imperiled wildlife.70 This action would weaken protection for habitat that currently stretches across tens of millions of acres of natural lands and waters in all parts of the United States. Available data suggest that this action could weaken protections across more than 87 million acres of vital wildlife habitat.71 Corporate interests, which have fought these habitat protections for decades,72 celebrated the proposal.73

A threat to protected lands on the horizon: National monuments

The Trump administration is also threatening to wipe national monuments off the map, targeting special lands or waters protected by past presidents under the Antiquities Act. Buried in the fine print of an order from Secretary Burgum on February 3, 2025—without openly using the words “national monument”—was a directive to review existing national monuments for potential changes in the name of “unleashing” American energy and minerals.74 Already, President Trump has acted to erase protections for vast ocean areas within the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument;75 various news reports suggest other national monuments may be next.76 At risk are up to 13.5 million acres of public lands,77 from coast to coast, that protect outstanding recreation opportunities, scenic beauty, wildlife populations, scientific treasures, cultural heritage, and more.

Fire sales on oil and gas leases, mine approvals, and timber

While the Trump administration removes protections for special lands and waters, it is also moving rapidly to sell control of available public lands to the highest bidder. That push was just dramatically supercharged by new mandates and loopholes tucked into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which hand even more control to industry to claim public lands while slashing the royalties and fees paid to drill those lands.

Oil, gas, and coal leasing

President Trump and Secretary Burgum have issued numerous orders aimed at making it easier for the oil and gas industry to lock up national public lands for oil and gas development.78 In addition to broad directives to expand leasing, approve drilling proposals, and eliminate requirements that slow development, Secretary Burgum has implemented “emergency” permitting procedures to bypass endangered species protections and compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act,79 while also shrinking the time for public input and environmental review.80 Moreover, Trump and Burgum mandated the expansion of new oil and gas leasing in the Western Arctic and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge—making the entire 1.56-million-acre coastal plain available for drilling and related development.81 With the help of the courts, President Trump also reinstated the oil leases held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Administration from the 2021 lease sale in the Arctic Refuge,82 which had previously been canceled.83

At the same time, the Forest Service is in the process of finalizing a rule that would fast-track oil and gas leasing in national forests,84 affecting nearly 190 million acres across the United States.85 As proposed by the Trump administration in 2020, the rule would take substantial authority away from the Forest Service to determine where oil and gas leasing happens on national forests, while also short-circuiting environmental review and public input.86

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will supercharge efforts by the Trump administration to give oil and gas companies free rein over more than 200 million acres of public lands.

Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will supercharge efforts by the Trump administration to give oil and gas companies free rein over more than 200 million acres of public lands.87 Most notably, the new law mandates formal lease sales every three months in nine Western states and mandates nine sales across millions of acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Western Arctic over the next decade.88 It also gives the oil and gas industry unprecedented control over what lands it can lease, stripping the ability of federal land managers to deny leases on land with clear wildlife, recreation, archaeological, or other conflicts.89 Essentially, the oil industry can choose to drill in a popular fishing or camping spot, or next to a national park or hospital, and the BLM can do nothing to stop them.

The OBBBA also cuts oil companies a major price break—cutting royalty rates on oil and gas from nearly 17 percent to just 12.5 percent and eliminating the modest $5 per-acre lease nomination fee—while reinstating the practice of “noncompetitive leasing” to allow companies to quietly scoop up leases on public lands at rock-bottom prices after a public auction ends.90 Royalties for coal from public lands, meanwhile, are cut from 12.5 percent down to just 7 percent, and the OBBBA mandates that an additional 4 million acres of public lands be made available for coal leasing within 90 days.91

Timber sales

Consistent with this pattern, President Trump is pushing reckless policies to sell out America’s public forests for timber profits as well. Through a March 2025 executive order, Trump directed public land managers to tap into emergency authorities under the Endangered Species Act to facilitate timber production and explore ways to avoid required environmental review.92 A month later, Secretary Rollins abruptly declared nearly 60 percent of national forest lands to be in a state of emergency due to wildfire risk and forest health, claiming that the situation warranted the use of emergency legal authorities to facilitate commercial timber harvesting, among other qualifying activities.93 As discussed above, Rollins has also taken steps to remove conservation protections for special national forest lands, which would open some of the most recreationally and ecologically valuable public forests for commercial logging.

Subsequently, Congress passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act,94 which dramatically accelerates logging on public lands. To help offset the bill’s expensive tax cuts—which predominantly benefit the wealthiest Americans95—the final legislation mandated massive increases in timber sold from public lands.96 In fact, the law ultimately requires more than a 75 percent increase in timber sales across both national forests and BLM public lands.97 It also mandates that public land managers enter into new 20-year timber sale contracts.98

Mining prioritized everywhere

On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that aims to make mining the No. 1 priority across all public lands, trumping all other uses of those lands where legally allowable.99 Specifically, the order mandates that the secretary of the interior make mineral production and mining activities the “primary land uses” of any federal lands with mineral deposits or reserves. That means, by direction of the president, mining would take precedence over outdoor recreation, wildlife conservation, preserving archaeological or cultural sites, and any other use.

While a president cannot unilaterally allow mining in areas deemed off-limits by Congress—national parks, for example—Trump’s order is already precipitating the reversal of protections for special areas, threatening the Boundary Waters and other treasured places. With Trump’s mining order also mandating the review and revision of public land management plans and with a proposed rule aimed at speeding mine approvals in national forests currently under review by the White House, more rollbacks of protections are likely on the horizon.100

In addition, Trump’s order requires land managers to fast-track approvals for mines on federal lands, while also directing relevant government agencies to find ways to subsidize the corporations developing these mines. Notably, Trump’s executive order applies to more than just “critical” or strategic minerals and explicitly includes minerals such as gold, copper, and uranium. Under a legal framework dating back to 1872, companies can generally stake claims and mine for valuable minerals on Western public lands without paying royalties for the minerals they extract.101 Trump’s order is poised to dramatically expand that giveaway of public resources while throwing in additional taxpayer money for selected corporations.

Inside Trump’s Plan to Sell Out America’s Public Lands to Mining

Sam Zeno, Jenny Rowland-Shea

Locking in private rights to public lands

While oil leases and mining claims do not transfer ownership of the land itself, the legal rights to drill and mine can be—and often are—extended again and again. Additionally, drilling, mining, and other extractive development can have long-lasting impacts on land health, clean water, and wildlife populations.102

Federal oil and gas leases are issued for a 10-year period, and they can be easily extended for a producing well or if the company simply demonstrates that drilling operations are in progress at the end of those 10 years.103 These extendable eases can be acquired “competitively” for as little as $10 per acre, plus administrative fees and a rental fee starting at $3 per acre each year.104

The oil and gas industry is already sitting on 35 million acres of leased federal lands, an area about the size of Florida, and it produces on less than half of those acres.105 Even while they are not actively producing, companies can benefit from stockpiled leases that pad their balance sheets.106 Larger and more frequent lease sales pushed by President Trump, particularly combined with reduced fees and the return of noncompetitive leasing thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are likely to result in even more extensive speculation and stockpiling.

Additionally, hardrock mining claims can be staked across the vast majority of Western public lands for just $49 per claim and may also be extended indefinitely even if the claim is not actively developed—generally by paying an annual fee of $200.107 Companies can then develop and sell the valuable minerals without paying royalties,108 often extracting substantial profits from public resources with no public compensation.

Once acquired, oil and gas leases and mining claims are treated as preexisting development rights that outweigh future conservation action long into the future. In fact, more than 3,700 mining claims exist today within the boundaries of what are now national parks or national monuments,109 and legal battles to cancel antiquated leases to conserve high-value public lands can extend for many years.110

Conclusion

Just as it was nearly impossible for the public to track the many harmful provisions buried in the 850-plus page One Big Beautiful Bill Act,111 following the maelstrom of anti-conservation actions from the Trump administration can be a daunting proposition. But with more than 175 million acres of land protections already slated for elimination and weakening, the collective impacts are on track to be massive. Ongoing efforts by President Trump’s Cabinet to further weaken environmental protections mean the total impact will only grow from here.

With more than 175 million acres of land protections already slated for elimination and weakening, the collective impacts are on track to be massive.

Meanwhile, parallel actions to sell or give control of available public lands to corporate interests for drilling, mining, and logging could spell long-term losses for the American public. At rock-bottom prices, extractive corporations can scoop up long-term leases or mining claims that encumber public lands for many decades. That includes formerly protected lands and waters treasured today for their outdoor adventure opportunities, wildlife, and history.

Ultimately, the Trump administration’s efforts to un-protect and sell out public lands are wildly out of step with what the public wants.112 Widespread outrage sparked by Congress’ attempt to sell off public lands was a powerful reminder that Americans expect their public lands to be kept in public hands. It remains to be seen whether the steady onslaught from the Trump administration will catch as much public attention and, critically, whether elected officials in positions of power will take steps to stop it before it is too late.

“Close your eyes in the summer and you’ll hear children laughing at the park, dogs barking and the familiar bells of the paleteros,” said Chuy Reyes, a Chicago-based photographer who documents the lives of street vendors.
Data on street vendors remains limited as their transient nature makes them difficult to track.
Chicago legalized street vending in 2015, and that same year, a study by the Illinois Policy Institute counted roughly 2,000 street vendors in the city.
In a way, street vendors stepped into an untapped market and are often overlooked as essential contributors to society.","A gentle breeze carried the scent of sweet fruit and earthy vegetables from Rodolfo Espinoza’s produce stand on an early Tuesday morning on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

Espinoza and his wife carefully arranged their produce under a blue tarp: bananas nestled among the tomatoes, serrano peppers between the strawberries, avocados stacked next to mangos. The tarp serves as a makeshift shelter that shields their products from the hot sun in the summer and biting wind during winter.

“¡Buenos días, pásele, pásele!” Espinoza cheerfully called out to passersby, inviting them to browse his offerings. “Good morning, come in, come in.”

A señora, wrapped in a rebozo and wearing an apron, stopped to buy peppers. Most of Espinoza’s customers, he said, are familiar faces from the neighborhood.

After his first sale of the day, Espinoza made the sign of the cross. Lately, sales have been slow.

“People don’t really go out anymore. They’re scared of ICE. We’re scared too, but we have no other choice,” Espinoza said. “With God’s grace, nothing will happen to us.”

In the three weeks since President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” its latest immigration enforcement surge in the Chicago region, street vendors and their customers have vanished from familiar corners across the city. The crowds no longer gathered around the elotero after church, paleteros outside of schools.

Their quiet disappearance marks not just a loss of income, it’s also the erosion of a culture cherished by many in the city. Street vendors have long been a vital thread in Chicago’s societal and economic fabric, their work revolving around traditional dishes and products that often can’t be found anywhere else in the city. They serve fellow immigrants craving a taste of home.

“Close your eyes in the summer and you’ll hear children laughing at the park, dogs barking and the familiar bells of the paleteros,” said Chuy Reyes, a Chicago-based photographer who documents the lives of street vendors. “They bring joy and flavor to our city and some of the most beautiful people I’ve met; that’s why I share their stories — so they can be seen and heard. What they do is a dying art, born of love.”

Now, their livelihoods, many of them older immigrants who have been in the country for decades, are under even greater threat with the immigration enforcement surge. They’ve historically been among the city’s most vulnerable workers, often facing financial uncertainty, a lack of benefits and danger because of precarious work conditions, such as targets of crime.

A few remain, relying on faith to keep going, such as Espinoza and his wife. But for most, the uncertainty has only deepened after legal protections were rolled back by the Supreme Court earlier this month, allowing federal immigration agents to target individuals based on race, language, or the type of work they do.

Street vendors are especially at risk “because historically most, if not all in Chicago, are Latino immigrants — Mexican to be exact — and speak Spanish,” said Dolores Castañeda, a community organizer and researcher.

Data on street vendors remains limited as their transient nature makes them difficult to track. Chicago legalized street vending in 2015, and that same year, a study by the Illinois Policy Institute counted roughly 2,000 street vendors in the city. Today, the Street Vendors Association of Chicago puts the estimate closer to 3,000, said Martin Unzueta, director of Chicago Community and Worker’s Rights, who works closely with the association.

For many, becoming a street vendor is pure necessity, and sometimes a sacrifice. They are often without legal documents, have age limitations or face other life circumstances that prevent them from working elsewhere.

But as they tread along, they serve fellow immigrants nostalgic, familiar flavors such as pan artesanal, camotes, gorditas or tepache.

For Rodolfo Alvarez, that taste is tamales.

Alvarez, owner of Alvarez Hardware on 18th Street in Pilsen, has lived in the area for 62 years. Recently, a friend stopped by Alvarez’s shop with tamales that he planned to sell at his nearby cafe. They were good, Alvarez said, but “too Americanized.”

He feels the same way about the tamales sold at popular Mexican restaurants, who tend to cater to customers who might not be as “spice-tolerant,” Alvarez said with a laugh.

“They just aren’t spicy enough, they have too little salt or too much — but I love it hot; even my grandkids like spicy,” Alvarez said. But the homemade tamales, usually tamales rojos from a nearby street vendor, never fail to satisfy his craving.

“Those are the ones that remind me of home,” he said.

Throughout the decades, Alvarez has witnessed changes to the local landscape in Pilsen, the ebb and flow of new development, shifting demographics and cultural conservation.

But nothing has been as drastic as the too-quiet streets on Mexican Independence Day. He’s hopeful it’s only temporary.

“The street vendors used to always go through the streets shouting what they have … candies or ice cream or popsicles or corn — all the kids will come out, and even grown-ups too,” Alvarez said. “Maybe they missed a flavor from their (youth) … that’s what we had here, and I think we will keep up with the traditions again.”

Street vending gained popularity in Chicago during the 1970s, according to Lilia Fernandez, a history professor at the University of Illinois Chicago. Migration from Mexico continued but as jobs declined at industrial warehouses across the steel mills, railroads, packing houses and stockyards, many Latino communities turned to the informal economy to survive.

In a way, street vendors stepped into an untapped market and are often overlooked as essential contributors to society.

“Immigrant vendors and small business owners often provide goods that aren’t readily available in the mainstream market,” Fernandez said.

Still, the work is not easy.

Take Espinoza. After taking some hard hits in his life, the 60-year-old said there’s not much else he can do to make a living. The sidewalk produce stand has sustained him and his wife for six years. He turned to vending after losing his job and falling ill during the pandemic.

“We survived then, and we worked mostly every day out here,” Espinoza said smiling. Today, he intends to resist the odds yet again.

But advocates worry that vendors, especially those on the Southwest Side, are being targeted by immigration agents, racially profiling them to meet their quotas.

On Sept. 7, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained a flower peddler with no known criminal record. Concerned bystanders recorded his arrest and the video went viral. He was deported a few days later.

Five days later, images of federal immigration agents arresting two palateros selling popsicles in Mount Prospect circulated on Facebook, garnering hundreds of comments. Many of them said they had bought a popsicle from the vendors a day ago, or that buying from those paleteros had been a long-standing tradition for families in that neighborhood.

“This is very detrimental to Latino people — Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans — everyone is just trying to make a living, to pay rent and buy clothes and food for their children by selling small things,” said Obdulia Delgado, a well-known community member who shared the images on Facebook.

Delgado said the street vendor presence in Mount Prospect and nearby Palatine is dissipating. There were always fewer vendors in the suburbs compared to the city, she said, now they are even more vulnerable.

A recent study by the University of Illinois Chicago, funded by the Center for Healthy Work, focused on the experiences and health impacts of vendors in South Lawndale to showcase their struggles and find ways to support them.

The research, led by Castañeda, found that informal work offers limited social protections, advancement opportunities, and leaves workers vulnerable to discrimination and exploitation. Many face unsafe working conditions, irregular income and the constant fear of deportation, all contributing to stress.

“It’s cruel to step on someone already vulnerable knowing well that they’re not criminals — these are honest people working, contributing to the economy — just because they want to reach deportation numbers, just because they look Mexican,” Castañeda said. “They’re forgetting the richness that they have brought to our city, to our country.”

Castañeda and others have been working to educate vendors about their rights, urging them to prepare in case of an arrest and to identify safe spaces if federal immigration agents are spotted in the area while they’re working.

Ciria, who asked that her last name be withheld for safety reasons, said she keeps her elote cart close to home, with her door left open at all times.

“Si la migra viene, corro para la casa,” Ciria said. “If ICE comes I’ll run home to hide.”

The Mexican grandmother has been in the country for nearly three decades, but like most longtime immigrants, has not been able to legalize her status because of complex policies. She said she would be required to leave the country for10 years or more before starting the legalization process.

“People think it’s easy to fix your papers. ‘Get in line,’ they said. That’s foolish, there’s no line,” Ciria said.

Faustina Vargas, 51, who sells homemade bread early each morning, shares a similar story. By 10 a.m. on a recent Tuesday, she had sold only one bag for $6.

Vargas has lived in Chicago for 28 years and managed to buy a home with her husband.

“It was a dream come true and something we worked so hard for,” Vargas said, who refused to stay home even after the news that ICE would be patrolling the area where she sells her bread. “But right now, even if we’ve paid our taxes every year, even if we pay our mortgage, it doesn’t feel like it’s ours.”

Still, she holds on to hope.

“I pray every day,” she said. “When I start getting anxious or nervous, I pray again. I pray for us, immigrants and for them, so that God softens their hearts.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTC-L-vendors-deportation01.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-22 03:57:00.200366

We produced this episode earlier this year in May, and we thought it was a good time to run it again because it's about the way the US is treating immigrants. It's about an immigrant to the United States who is very badly treated by the US government.

A lot has changed since May, and at the end of the episode, we're gonna give you an update, so please stay tuned for that.

ROGER: Tio - Como esta todo? Feliz Cumpleano. Que le pasa un fine excelente. Que Dio le Bendiga sempre.

HOST: Roger Eduardo Molina Acevedo: 29 years old, Venezuelan. Millennial. From the state of Aragua. That was a message of him calling to wish his Uncle Noel a happy birthday.

MUSIC

Roger is not married, but has a common-law relationship with his partner Daniela Nuñez. No kids. They just landed at the airport. Together. Their first time on U.S. soil. She’s standing beside him. They make their way from the plane towards border control and customs.

Roger graduated from high school. Back in Venezuela, he worked at his family hardware stores. Loves soccer. Has a tattoo of a soccer ball, a pine forest, a REAL madrid Crown, and nd an infinity sign with the word family.

He and Daniela both have been invited into the country - pre-approved for refugee status.

Roger’s uncle, Noel, told him, “If you’re gonna go to the United States — do it the legal way.”

NOEL: Irregular, no usted busca la manera, pero de irse de manera regular, okey,

Host: Two nights ago, January 7, 2025, he and Daniela stayed in a hotel paid for by the International Organization for Migration, the entity that helped them both get refugee status. Roger sends his uncle a 34 second video giving him a little tour of the space.

ROGER’S HOTEL TAPE (just sounds, we hear a couple “este”’s

That’s what you’re hearing now.

But now they’re at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport. And they’ve just made it through the Visitors line, the line for non-citizens, to Border Control.

Juan: Cuándo fue la primera vez que que supiste que algo podría estar mal con tu sobrino que le podría haber pasado algo?

Host: That’s Juan Papier translating, he's deputy Director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch. And he’s translating between me and Uncle Noel. Noel is Venezuelan too, but lives in the Dominican Republic. My question to Uncle Noel: When was the first moment you realized that something was wrong with your nephew?

NOEL: Ya me había llamado para decirme que que todo había salir mal.

Juan: he called me that everything went badly.

Host: The agent at the border control station asks Daniela: “Are you afraid to return to your country?” She says no. That same day, they put her on a plane and deport her back to Venezuela.

Now to Roger:

Noel: Los funcionarios de migración que lo atendieron le dieron un tatuaje que tiene en el brazo derecho y empezaron a hacer los preguntas por el respecto a ese tatuaje.

JUAN: They stopped him, eh and they about one of the tattoos. He has eh and they asked him questions about the tattoo what does this tattoo min they said that the tattoo was Associated with some of the criminal groups that operate en en Venezuela.

[MUSIC]

Host: For what it’s worth, there is no evidence that tattoos of a pine tree forest, a soccer ball, REAL Madrid or an infinity sign with the world “family” on it are associated with Venezuelan gangs.

Juan: He got very nervous, eh? He thought that they would do something to him, eh? The officers threatened to call the FBI and to get him arrested he called me he was very scared, eh? Think thinking that something bad could happen to him.

HOST: On today’s episode, forced disappearances at the U.S. border - the deportation of the Venezuelans.

This is Rights & Wrongs, a podcast from Human Rights Watch. I'm Ngofen Mputubwele. I am a writer, a lawyer, and a radio producer. Human Rights Watch asked me to look at human rights hotspots around the world through the eyes and ears of people on the front lines of history.

This week, The Loaded Gun

NOEL: Roger es mi sobrino, pero vamos a decir tú, eh, yo lo siento como muy claro. Y él se apoyaba muchísimo en, es más, se apoyaba much demente en su propio papá. Sí, todo este proceso que él ha vivido siempre me llamaba todos los días, eh? Me decía cómo se sentía que, pues obviamente me siento muy mal por lo que lo está viviendo. Y más aún, porque en este memento no puedo hacer nada.

Host: Roger is my nephew. He relied on me as a support even more than his own father. This whole situation that he has endured, he has called every day, telling how he feels. And I feel ill knowing what he’s undergoing. And what’s worse, there’s nothing I can do.

——

Host: Before we continue with Roger, let’s hop over to Washington, D.C. for a moment. One of the big conversations being had in the U.S. Congress right now surrounds a law called the Alien Enemies Act.

ARCHIVAL-PBS NEWS HOUR: The supreme court ruled late yesterday that the Trump administration can continue to use a rare 18th century law war authority to deport… (fade down)

NGOFEEN: What is the law that is like in question here? What is, what is this law?

AKSHAYA: The Alien Enemies Act of 1798. / [it] allows the president to take really, uh, broad actions against people who aren't citizens of this country. / it enables the president to direct people who work for him, to detain people, to deport them, to also restrict how they live their lives.

Host: This is AKSHAYA Director of Crisis Advocacy, Human Rights Watch.

NGOFEEN: And so the law has only been used, uh, four times now, this fourth time is this year by President Trump?

NGOFEEN: four?

AKSHAYA: Yeah, four.

NGOFEEN: Oh, okay.

AKSHAYA: You can count them.

Ngofeen:Oh, wow.

Akshaya: … On your hand. So I said, this thing's only been used four times. The other three times we're in wars. Like wars that we study in history, books we know about them. World War II, World War I, the War of 1812. The reason that our current president has deployed this act is he says that, uh, this country is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang.

Host: Back to Roger. And just a reminder here, both Roger and his partner were legally approved to come to the United States. This was not an illegal crossing.

NOEL: Me llamó todavía estando en en el aeropuerto. Sí. Detenido.

Host: The next day Roger is still at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in Texas. Still detained. Uncle Noel happens to have Venezuelan friends in Texas. They put him in touch with an immigration attorney. Uncle Noel calls the immigration attorney, who says,

NOEL: Eh? Él me dijo mira, // tiene dos opciones

Host: Look, your nephew has two options. Either:

Noel: o él va a la corte para hacer la solicitud asilo

Host: Roger goes to court to request asylum

Noel: o él va a ser deportado.

Host: Or Roger will be deported.

Noel: Sonos sonos dos opciones. Eh a él lo llevaron desde el aeropuerto a un primer centro de de atención que se llama Montgomery.

Host: From the airport, Roger is taken to a detention facility called the Montgomery Processing center. Also in Texas. Uncle Noel stays in touch, obviously. After consulting with the lawyer, the lawyer says, Llook, given the look of things in the U.S., your nephew is better off requesting to self-deport to Venezuela.

Host: Uncle Noel relays this info to his nephew.

Noel: El el abogado nos hizo una recomendación que nosotros la rendimos. El abogado nos dijo, eh, ya se acerca la toma de posición del preside de Donald Trump. Yo le recomiendo no quedarse esperando la corte para para pelear por el asi, sino por el contrario, pedir la solicitud de de retiro de asi civil que pronunciaba a la posibilidad de solicitar a la civil. Yo se documenté a él. Y él me dijo absolutamente que sí, porque ya él no quería estar en estados unidos.

Host: Nephew Roger says, Uncle Noel, I want to get the hell home. To Venezuela.

Noel: Me digo, tío que me quiero oír. No quiero estar un minu más acá.

Host: I don’t want to be here one minute longer. Reminder, in case you forgot —his partner, Daniela, is gone.

Noel: No le he contado algo que que que digamos que importante. Es que los entrevistaron a los dos a Roger y a Daniela a, eh, pero a Daniela sí, la deportaron a manos.

Host: Roger enters the ICE detention system.

JUAN: We made many requests twice, asking about his condición, eh, telling them constantly. He was not a criminal that he had no committed any crime, eh and they told us there was. No he didn't have any criminal record in the United states and they said that they didn't know way he was being held we as multiple times for him to be eh deported but they didn’t answer.

Noel: Y la situación se tornó especialmente complicada cuando lo trasladaron a un centro de atención que se llama Joe el College de pretención center

Host: Roger is transferred to Joe Coley Detention Center, and that’s when things get bad.

NOEL: cuando llegó ese centro, detención me llamó llorando muy muy nervioso. Porque me dijo que le habían cambiado su atuendo y lo habían. Le habían colocado un at acuerdo de criminal.

Host: When he arrived at the center, Uncle Noel tells. he called me crying and very very nervous. He told me that they changed his detention outfit to one that was for criminals. I.e. for someone who had committed a serious crime, a red jumpsuit.

NOEL: a lo lo hicieron de robo, necesidad.

Host: A jumpsuit that’s red.

Noel: él me llamó muy asustado diciéndome que por qué le estaban haciendo esto? Que qué hago?

Host: He called me asking, why are they doing this? What do I do?

Noel: Entonces yo le pregunté que si era solamente a él que lo habían vestido de esa manera. Y me dijo no a todos los venezolanos nos colocaron de ese color.

Host: So I asked… are they doing this to you or to everyone? And he said…. To everyone who is Venezuelan, they are making us wear this color.

Noel: De robo. Entonces yo tratando de de calmarlo poco, yo le digo, bueno, pero si son todos los venezolanos, eh? Tranquilízate. Porque cuando tú llegues a Venezuela, tú no has cometido delito, por lo cual no va a pasar nada.

Juan: so i was trying to calm him down and i told him, eh? If that's happening to all Venezuela don't worry when you are sent back to Venezuela you will be okay, because you have never com a crime and nothing wrong to happen to you

NOEL: Yo siento que ya estaba todo organizado para mover a los venezolanos bajo la ley de enemigos de extranjero.

Host: But I feel that all of this was organized so as to move the Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act.

Host: A month passes. Roger in Joe Colley. Uncle Noel stressed. The two talking by phone a much as possible. And then finally, good news. He’s gonna be deported.

NOEL: El día 13 de marzo en donde me llamó muy contento, pu que les habían dicho que iban a ser reportado.

Host: March 13. Phone call. Roger.

Juan: on the thirteenth of march. He called me he was very happy because finally. He was told he was going to be deported.

Host: He says hey uncle, tío …

Noel: muy tío. Se acabó la pesadilla. Me van a deportar que mañana nos vamos.

Juan: He told me that the nightmare was over And this is something I like to emphasize because they were like to they were all told that they were going to be sent back to Venezuela.

Noel: Les dieron porque todos estaban contentos porque les dijeron que la deportación sería Pablo. Venezuela, okey,

Host: ICE has a documentation system, a registry, where you can check on the status of someone who’s been detained. Whenever Roger is shifted from detention center to detention center, it's always documented on this searchable online list on ICE / the Department of State's website. Then. Next thing Uncle Noel knows, Roger suddenly disappears from the immigration registry.

[MUSIC]

NOEL: en lunes … llamé a primera hora.

Host: Monday morning, Noel tells me, as soon as they open, I call the detention center.

Noel: Y me dijeron en el centro de atención y hidalgo que él ya no estaba allí. Roer ya no está aquí. Dónde está? No le podemos dar información.

Host: Roger isn't here. Where is he? We can't give you any other information. Call this other detention center. Which one? And they give me the number.

Noel: Llame a otro centro de atención a cuál? Y me daba mi número. Llamaba a ese número, me decía lo mismo, no está, llame a otro y me daban otro número.

Host: I call this number, they told me the same thing, call another detention center, and they gave me another number,

Noel: Yo pasé literalmente toda la mañana llamando centro de detención en Texas. Llamé a más de 10 y en ninguno me daban información, eh?

Host: I spent literally the whole morning calling immigration detention centers in Texas. I called at least 10 and no one gave me any information.

Noel: Al final de la tarde de ese día, desde el l 17 octubre, conseguir el número de la sede central de ice en en Houston,

Host: At the end of that afternoon, around 5pm, I got the number for the central office of ICE in Houston.

Noel: llamé a ese número literalmente llorando que quería información de mi sobrino mismo.

Host: And I called this number, literally, crying. That I wanted information about my nephew.

NOEL: Y una señora cuando no toca, estaba llorando. Me dijo lo único que te puedo decir es que tu sobrino fue extraído de los estados unidos. Manda

Host: And a woman on the phone when she noticed I was crying she said, the only thing I can tell you is that your nephew was removed from the United States.

Then crickets. Nothing.

Then, later that week:

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: The pictures are striking. More than 200 Venezuelans flown on government planes out of Arlington, Texas, last week.

In the news, the images of planes at an airport in El Salvador. A maximum security prison in El Salvador.

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: One of the world’s most notorious prisons. Heads shaven. Arms shackled.

El Salvador. Not Venezuela. For Uncle Noel, still no word of where his son is. Until

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: Today, CBS news has obtained a list of 100s of people deported. Hundreds of alleged gang members sent this past week to El Salvador

There’s a leak. A list of people deported on that plane is leaked to CBS:

NOEL: Eh, cuando se filó la la lfa de las personas que habían sido el día hacia allá que pudimos percatarnos porque su nombre aparecía en la l.

JUAN: So we suspecting that he might el salvador we the images, eh that were posted online about the way they treated the Venezuela people who were sent fortunately we didn't see him in the videos because it would have been tragic for his mother to see him treated that way. It wasn’t until Wed list Salvador we confirm got so.

---

NGOFEEN: because there's such a fire hose of things happening at once, I think I'm like. Yeah, many of us overwhelmed a bit with like, not even emotionally, I just mean like tracking which thing is which thing. This is the, this is the situation that we've been hearing about in the news with like, … turn the plane back …Like, no, don't ship them off. Bring the plane back. And then the federal government being like, no, we're not bringing them back. That that's this. Is that right?

AKSHAYA: Yeah.

NGOFEEN: Okay. That's, that's what this is?

AKSHAYA: Yeah. So there and uh, there were a bunch of people on those planes, like 200, uh, almost 240 people, 137 of those men, the government says, um, they removed under the Alien Enemy Act. We are a month and a half out. Since that happened, they still have not said the names of the 137 people. Yeah. Imagine. Yeah. If that was your family member, they haven't even acknowledged the actual names. So the only thing we've got the government to say is 137 of those people were removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The other hundred some were removed under other legal authorities.

--

NGOFEEN: Have you spoken to him since he’s been there?

JUAN: Has podido hablar con él desde que lo enviaron al salvador.

NOEL: No hemos hablado ni una palabra con nada.

JUAN: We have been able to communicate a single word to him.

NOEL: Ellos están siendo víctima de un delito del esa humanidad que se llama desaparición forzosa. Lamentablemente, eh, ejecutada por un país al cual le tengo mucho cariño y mucho como tengo en estados unidos, pero lamentablemente entraron en una onda terrible de hacer desapariciones de los migrantes.

Host: Noel says, they are victims of a crime called forced disappearance. Done by a country that I respect deeply, i.e. the United States, but they have become part of a wave for disappearances of migrants.

AKSHAYA: this isn't even their home country. They were just sent to a third country to be kept in a jail. Um, and we don't know the details of that agreement. Not only has the government not made public, the names of the people who they put in this jail, they haven't told the Congress, they haven't told the public like, what are the terms, what are the El Salvador, uh, what, sorry, what does the El Salvador government say it's gonna do? Are we paying them for this? How are the people gonna be treated? Yeah. Is it at the same standards as a prison in the United States or not? Um, and a lot of it is just completely unknown.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm. And

Akshaya: … It's the kind of thing that… we typically document in, uh, some of the other crisis situations mm-hmm.

That I work on. Right. And forced disappearances, people being detained in the context of, um. A repressive government that doesn't let them talk to their lawyers or their families. Uh, and they don't know how long they're gonna be in jail or when they'll get out, or even what charges they're being held under. Mm-hmm. Like that's the, the situation that these people are facing and it's at the hands of the US government… is using.

Host: If you watch the videos of the Venezuelans landed in El Salvador, it’s disturbing. People heads shorn like sheep. Their heads held down. By loads of armed officers.

AKSHAYA: in partnership with, uh, Kristo Al, who's this El Salvador based human rights organization mm-hmm. Um, people have done autopsies on people who passed away while they were in these prisons. Uh, and they have come to really worrying conclusions about, uh, the treatment that led to people's deaths, to prisoner deaths. and so what we found is evidence that people are being tortured./ And then there are, there smaller things like they, they use particular kinds of handcuffs that link your hands and your legs together that can kind of force you to stoop./ And people might have noticed that in this video that is played, um. Or that was posted by El Salvador's government and then by members of the US government as well that showed the men being brought off the plane. And you notice they're stooping and that's because they're handcuffed their hands to their legs. And the UN expert on torture, um, an ill treatment, she did a specific report on devices that are used for torture. And those kinds of handcuffs are one of them.

Host: Reminder: Roger, 29, millennial, has no criminal record. None. And there’s something else he doesn’t have now -- due process.

AKSHAYA: So one of the things that came out in the litigation

Ngofeen: mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: Um, and also has now been publicly released through this records act. So we, you know, we know this is what they were using

Ngofeen: mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: Is this validation guide that the government put together and they gave people points to decide are you a member of this gang or not. So, um, it was a point system and, um, you need to get eight points according to the government to be deemed a gang member.

You could get up to four of those points for just having tattoos. Like if you have four tattoos, four points. Um, and then the other factors that were included, there were things like, um, wearing smart urban streetwear. Uh, yeah. Uh, they mentioned in their guidance when they, what they mean by that, that, you know, um, any jerseys with players from Venezuela or if you have the Jordan Jumpman, uh, those I guess are indicia according to whoever.

Made this list for the government.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm. Um,

AKSHAYA: Meanwhile, actual experts on this gang have been interviewed, … experts on this particular group, UA have said, yeah.

There's no, nothing like that. Tattoos don't even mean anything, uh, in the Venezuelan context. It's just, you know, like common culture among young people. Yeah. And, uh, the clothes, like Yeah. People tend to be proud when someone from their country makes it big in a professional sports team. Yeah. Um, that can't be a reason to think that Yeah.

You're in a gang.

Host: Now, that we're here. My lawyer brain wants to understand how we got here, legally. Because, like it or not, the U.S. government is claiming that it is acting legally. So how is it making that argument? That’s after the break…

ACT II

--

Ngofeen: Can you tell me about the history of the law a nit?

AKSHAYA: Yeah, so the act came about, uh, back in the 1790s. The newly formed American government, this was the second president, uh, John Adams was worried about, uh, French citizens who were.

On US territory and, uh, French influence over this young American government. And so he, uh, helped pass a set of four laws that are called the Alien And Sedition Acts. And The Alien Enemies Act was one of those, um, these laws were basically, uh, so broad and problematic that they were almost immediately criticized // Thomas Jefferson, who ended up being this country's third president, launched a huge campaign against them, said this is, um, a recipe for presidential.

Dictatorship almost that it's, uh, something that gives far too much power to the executive branch because it limited what could be published through the Sedition acts, and then it put all of these restrictions on people who weren't nationals of this country.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: … because of that blowback … Adams was kind of pushed out of power mm-hmm. And Jefferson took over, uh, and he campaigned on how. Problematic, these acts were. Three of the acts were basically repealed or replaced almost immediately, as soon as Jefferson got into power. Okay. Um, this one was never used then. That's why I called the loaded gun.

It was the fourth act and they never had cause to use it because there actually didn't end up being a war with France

Ngofeen: Uhhuh.

Akshaya: He didn't end up using this act but the act, uh, stayed on the books and then it was picked up again three times. One during the war of 1812. Uh, when the US was fighting the British. And then two times in World War I and World War II.

[ MUSIC.]

Host: Here’s a story about when this was used in World War I. When the U.S. was, reminder, fighting Germany.

AKSHAYA: Among the people who were detained and these people like detained for over a year, almost two years, um, was a German born conductor, uh, of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and pretty much the whole symphony.

And they put them all in this detention camp in Georgia. Uh, and some of the reasons why they rounded them up were they talk in German at the rehearsals. Uh, they didn't play the stars strangled banner when someone requested it once. And, um, the guy, the, you know, the, the German conductor, Carl Muck was his name.

He actually had Swiss citizenship, but they still rounded him up because of his place of birth. Uh, and that. Example to me. Um, it just, uh, it paints such a vivid picture. 'cause um, there was this whole group, they were kept in a camp in Georgia, and they protested what was being done to them because they, you know, had, it was hot.

It was sticky. Yeah. And they weren't able to get out. And they, um, decided to play Mozart, uh, which is a German, um, famous classical music composer.

Host: Technically Austrian, but German in the broad sense.

Akshaya: They decided to play Mozart in the nude in the prison camp. And this has been documented as their protest act. Uh, and they still were kept there. You know, it, it got some public attention, but it took many, many months for them to get out.

Uh, and he was just, you know, this was just one example.

Host: Here’s the text the Alien Enemies Act:

Whenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.

As AKSHAYA says -- the law has always been used in instances of war.

AKSHAYA: President Trump is using this act for the first time that any president has ever used it outside of the context of a war declared by Congress.

Akshaya: They're making it clear that their motivation is less about any kind of real national security concern vis-a-vis this, uh, ostensible gang. And much more about a mass deportation agenda, which the president announced in his rallies when he was campaigning back in, uh, you know, September, October, November of last year.

Which they have reiterated since they've come into office. And which, uh, vice President Vance, uh, has been tweeting about very openly. They're saying, we are concerned if we have to give every person who, um, this administration would like to deport you process that would take too long.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm.

Akshaya: And so things like this act, uh, which allow.

Or at least purport to allow the government to take shortcuts suddenly are very attractive. Like, why would someone look back into the history books and dust off this law from 1798 that hadn't been used in years? There has to be a motivation. Uh, and it's not because we're in a declared war. There is no war declared against Venezuela.

There's no war declared against tr de Laua, which is the gang that, uh, this declaration says is invading this country. Uh, president Trump can issue a proclamation making those claims, but that doesn't make it true.

Host: But while one may not agree with it, one has to assume the government will argue something different. LIke, the text grants the President powers in the case of declared war OR invasions / predatory incursions. So I asked AKSHAYA the painful question? Isn’t the government’s argument that: we’re being invaded? I.e.

NGOFEEN: we, we, we sort of like at the start of the term, said that we're being, we're being invaded. Um, and we've specifically said as to the, you know, we perceive the Venezuelan gang as an invasion. // that is what, um, meets the sort of threshold in, uh. Uh, in the law of like, there being, you know, the, like the war isn't required in the law textually, and so we're doing something that like Yeah. It, there is a war. That's why we said there's an invasion. Like what's sort of your response to that?

Akshaya: Yeah. So I, I have two ways to think about this. Yeah. One is, that's actually the whole reason why we wrote this report because the law in and of itself is a problem.

Host: Human Rights Watch has published a report on the situation unfolding under the Alien Enemies Act.

AKSHAYA: And Congress should have, even before President Trump came into office, have gotten rid of it. Struck it off the books, repealed it, and then we wouldn't be in the situation of reading between the lines or allowing it to be instrumentalized for patently absurd claims. Yeah. Right. So a simple solution is get rid of this law.

Ngofeen: Yeah.

AKSHAYA: Um, the other part of it is that. It is true that the law says that the president can invoke it in context where the country is facing an invasion or a predatory incursion.

AKSHAYA: Uh, but those claims have to be borne out by facts. And it's, I mean, it's really not about you and me deciding, but I would hope that judges are given the opportunity to scrutinize that. Uh, and I think something that's really concerning about the way the Trump administration has been using this law these past couple weeks is they're saying not only can we unilaterally make this declaration, um, we can then say that individuals are part of this gang based on extremely, um, flimsy indicia things like, oh, they have tattoos, or they're wearing Jordan sneakers, or they, um. You know, maybe talked to someone who was a gang member, we think. like very flimsy assertions. Uh, so, and we shouldn't be questioned about these things and judges shouldn't even question us about if there's, uh, an invasion or not. It's our decision, Uhhuh, and that's where I think the whole idea of separation of powers comes into play. Uhhuh. And I feel like that's what we should talk more about. Yeah. This country, the way democracy has been so resilient in this country over many decades and generations is because the executive branch is when it's tempted to overreach checked by either Congress or the judiciary. That's the Supreme Court.

NGOFEEN: Yeah.

AKSHAYA:The scary thing that we're seeing right now, and it's playing out with this case with the Alien Enemies Act, is when judges are attempting to check that executive power. The executive branch is kind of saying, nah. We're gonna do it anyway. and that's why I'm watching this really closely.

// I think one of the most ridiculous things, um, that I've seen when researching this is as a part of this whole debate., The president of El Salvador, who's, uh, big on social media //

HOST: This is President Nayib Bukele.

AKSHAYA:Wrote Oopsie, uh, when commenting about the judge's orders Uhhuh. So it's like they openly know what they were supposed to do.

NGOFEEN: Yeah.

AKSHAYA: And they're rubbing it in the faces of the judges that they're not listening.

[MUSIC]

NGOFEEN (to Noel): You know at the beginning the of the year lot of people do new year resolutions right where you're like thinking of the year ahead if you could go back and talk to yourself on January first and sort of prepare yourself for the year to come. what would you tell yourself?

Noel: Vale, ojalá yo pudiera volver para el para el tener o porque haría todo lo posible para que él no realice ese viaje. Sí, este o por lo menos, no sé. Le daría recomendaciones vue. Voy a repetir esto. Yo admiraba no pude ser lo mismo la última vez que viaj eh? Viaje. Y eso hace poco la ah, bueno, me le dije de mar y con miedo por primera vez, luego de más de 15 años, dejando todos los años por primera vez, sentí miedo de tanto.

Eh, sentí miedo de de ser señalado, deter encarcelado. Definitivamente. Sí. Ah, que ha sido un año muy difícil. Quisiera que esta pesadilla se terminara. Ya lo digo, vivo en todos los medios. Yo literalmente, yo no, no, no, duermo fácil. Duermo muy poco. Me despierto en las madrugadas y le digo a Dios cuando me despierte, que si él me despierta a mi par, no me pueda dormir como usted, porque sé que debe estar una situación difícil que no se la molestó con la actual

JUAN: i wish i gogo back to January first and i will do everything en my power to stop from going to the United states or to give him advice i used to admire the United states but i can say the same right now i I've been going to the United states for the last fifteen years and this year for the first time i felt i felt fear i feel fear of being in prison of being accused it's been a very difficult year so far i ask god every day for this nightmare to end i don't sleep well and every time i wake up in the middle of the night i tell god that if he's waking me Nephew can sleep, i am fine with that because im sure he's having a very difficult situation that es incredibly unfair.

Host: I have to say. This is the point of these policies. To frighten people. That doesn’t make them legal.

NGOFEEN: What would you say to your nephew if you could?

JUAN: Y la última pregunta es qué le dirías a tu sobrino si pudieras hablar con él?

NOEL: Un abrazo enorme. Hay un abrazo enorme. Yo obviado para Venezuela mañana y estoy rogándole a Dios, eh, que él, que él lo deporten mientras que que allá, porque sé que él también me quiere abrazar.

JUAN: Give a big hug en fact am traveling to Venezuela tomorrow and i pray to god that he vice tu Venezuela and weekend meet and sea each again and hug each other again

Noel: Te que que sería maravilloso esa oportunidad de reencuentro, eh?

Fíjate algo, eh? Como una semana antes de de que lo deportan, él me dijo que se quería suar que ella no quería vivir esa situación. Si eso me lo digo estando en estados unidos donde hablábamos todos los días, no me quiero imaginar qué está pasando esa.

Juan: en fact when he was in the United states. He he called me one day suicide the states i imagine how he feeling en el salvador.

Juan: Sentimos mucho, noél.

Ngofeen: So that was the episode we produced last May, and as I said, there've been a lot of changes. Here's just one. On July 18th as part of a prisoner exchange, 252 Venezuelans the US sent to CECOT in El Salvador were released.

Roger was one of them. He's back in Venezuela and he joins me now on Zoom, along with Human Rights Watch’s Juan Pappier, who's gonna translate and also answer a few questions I have for him. Roger, first question is just, uh, a hard one, I guess, but how are you?

Roger/Spanish: In spite of what happened, I’m fine.

Ngofeen: Now you're back in Venezuela. have you, like, have you been able to start your life back together? And in particular we were curious if you've been able to see Daniela, your partner.

Roger/English/Translation: His partner came from Colombia. She was in Colombia. She came back to Venezuela in September, and they were able to meet, to hug, to kiss each other. It was very emotional and here they are trying to restart their lives and, yeah, trying to, to, to start again.

Ngofeen: When you talk to people, what do you say about what it was like inside of CECOT?

Roger/English: From the moment I, we arrived, I said, my God, what is gonna happen to us? Then I realized we were in CECOT because I had seen the prison in some videos. They beat us since the moment we arrived. If you spoke out loud, they hit you. If you didn't go to bed, they hit you. For moments, I thought we were in hell because when they were not hitting me, they were hitting my cell mates, and the worst part was not knowing anything.

We didn't know what was going to happen with us. We didn't know anything about the situation.

Ngofeen: Juan, you and others at Human Rights Watch have been investigating what happened in CECOT, and you'll issue a report soon. Can you tell me some of what you learned so far?

Roger/English: So far we have interviewed 40 people who like Roger were detained in CECOT and more than a hundred of their family members. We are documenting the torture that these people endured.

They were beaten during daily searches. They were beaten when they allegedly disobeyed prison rules. They were beaten as they were transferred to CECOT. They were beaten when the US Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, visited. They were constantly and repeatedly beaten and tortured in prison.

These cases of torture occurred both in the hallways of the prison and also in what guards called “the island”, an isolation cell, very small, of only a couple of meters, that was dark, that had very limited natural light and natural air where people were held in complete isolation as punishment for supposedly disobeying prison rules such as speaking with other detainees or showering at the wrong time.

Ngofeen: Thank you, Juan. And actually, I just have one last question for Roger. What do you want people outside of Venezuela, people like me in the states or in other parts of the world? What do you want them to know about your experience?

Roger/English: I've been waiting for people to ask me this question because I really want to send a message to the world. Some people say that we are lying. That it is not true that we were beaten. Some say that this is a show that the Venezuelan government is trying to put out to accuse the US government. That's not true.

But if you don't believe me, if you don't believe my 252 cellmates, then ask President Naib Bukele of El Salvador, ask President Donald Trump, ask the director of the CECOT prison, to release the videos because they were recording us all the time. And in those recordings you could see how we were beaten, how we were forced to kneel, how we were humiliated. And I'm sure they will not release those recordings because if they do, all the lies that Bukele is putting out will end.

Ngofeen: Roger, thank you so much for talking to us. I know briefly, and I know you've talked to so many people, uh, but thank you. I really appreciate it.

Roger: Vale, gracias, que estén bien.

Ngofeen:In a few weeks, Human Rights Watch will release a report about what went on with the Venezuelan immigrants in CECOT. So keep an eye out for that. You've been listening to Rights and Wrongs from Human Rights Watch.

This episode was produced by me and Curtis Fox. Sophie Soloway is the associate producer, Ifé Fatunase and Stacy Sullivan are the executive producers. Thanks also to Anthony Gale.

The controversy has highlighted tensions between U.S. immigration enforcement priorities and international humanitarian obligations, with receiving countries caught between diplomatic pressures and human rights concerns.
ARRA warned that accepting such deportation arrangements creates dangerous precedents allowing powerful nations to outsource migration responsibilities without accountability, potentially undermining regional solidarity on migration governance.
The statement emphasized broader implications beyond migration policy, arguing that national sovereignty should not be compromised through unequal international arrangements that treat vulnerable populations as disposable burdens rather than rights-holders.
The organization’s intervention demonstrates how regional advocacy groups are increasingly challenging international migration arrangements they view as violating sovereignty and human rights through coordinated legal and diplomatic pressure campaigns.","The Asylum and Refugee Rights Advocates (ARRA) has issued a scathing critique of the United States government’s escalating practice of deporting migrants to countries other than their own, warning that such policies undermine international human rights standards and threaten the sovereignty of recipient nations.

In a statement released September 21, ARRA Founder and Executive Director Dr. Okey James Ezugwu highlighted the controversial deportation of 14 non-Ghanaians to Accra earlier this month, describing it as part of a disturbing global trend that violates fundamental refugee protection principles.

The deportation flight included 13 Nigerians and one Gambian, none of whom were originally from Ghana, according to lawyers representing some of the deportees who challenged the removals in federal court.

Dr. Ezugwu, a legal practitioner and retired Assistant Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, emphasized that Ghana has confirmed the 14 West Africans were subsequently sent to their home countries, where lawyers say some face risks of persecution or torture.

The ARRA statement documented similar third-country deportations to South Sudan, Eswatini, Uganda, Rwanda, Djibouti, Panama, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, demonstrating what the organization describes as a systematic approach to circumventing traditional deportation procedures.

The rights advocacy group challenged the legal foundation of such removals, arguing they violate the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention, which prohibits returning individuals to places where they risk persecution or harm without proper asylum screening.

Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, making Ghana the latest country to accept these third-country deportations under arrangements that ARRA characterizes as politically and economically coercive.

The organization expressed particular concern about reports of abusive treatment during transport, inadequate legal safeguards before removal, and the burden placed on receiving states that lack resources to integrate deportees properly.

Dr. Ezugwu has established ARRA as a prominent voice in West African migration advocacy, previously addressing xenophobic attacks against Nigerian immigrants in Ghana and discrimination against Ghanaian descendants in The Gambia.

His background as a retired senior immigration official lends credibility to ARRA’s technical critique of deportation procedures, particularly regarding violations of international refugee law and bilateral agreements.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan declined to intervene in the deportations, clearing the way for the 14 West Africans to be sent to their home countries from Ghana, despite legal challenges arguing they faced persecution risks.

The controversy has highlighted tensions between U.S. immigration enforcement priorities and international humanitarian obligations, with receiving countries caught between diplomatic pressures and human rights concerns.

ARRA warned that accepting such deportation arrangements creates dangerous precedents allowing powerful nations to outsource migration responsibilities without accountability, potentially undermining regional solidarity on migration governance.

The organization called on the United Nations, African Union, and regional blocs to develop frameworks ensuring deportee safety and dignity while balancing member states’ security needs through rigorous human rights scrutiny of third-country arrangements.

The statement emphasized broader implications beyond migration policy, arguing that national sovereignty should not be compromised through unequal international arrangements that treat vulnerable populations as disposable burdens rather than rights-holders.

Dr. Ezugwu’s critique reflects growing African concerns about asymmetrical migration partnerships that place disproportionate responsibilities on developing nations while limiting their agency in determining acceptance criteria and integration support.

The ARRA position represents broader civil society pushback against what advocates characterize as expedient solutions that prioritize political convenience over humanitarian principles and sustainable migration management approaches.

Conflicting accounts emerged about whether all deportees had actually been returned to their home countries, with lawyers for four men saying they remained detained in Ghana, highlighting ongoing legal and practical complications.

Going back even further, since World War II the out party has gained an average of more than two dozen House seats.
In Trump’s last midterm election, in 2018, Democrats won 40 House seats — including seven in California — to seize control.
There are 435 House seats on the ballot next year.
Over the past three decades, every time the president’s net job approval was negative a year from the midterm election, his party lost House seats.","A handful of seats are all that keep Republicans in control of the House, giving President Trump untrammeled sway over, well, pretty much everything, from the economy to the jokes on late-night TV to the design of the Cracker Barrel logo.

It’s a number that’s both tantalizing and fraught, depending on your political perspective.

For Democrats, that eyelash-thin margin means they’re thisclose to regaining power and a political toehold in next year’s midterm election. All they need is a gain of three House seats. For Trump and fellow Republicans, it means their hegemony over Washington and life as we know it dangles by a perilously thin thread.

That tension explains the redistricting wars now blazing throughout our great land.

It started in Texas, where Trump pressured Republicans to redraw congressional lines in hopes of handing the GOP as many as five additional seats. That led California Democrats to ask voters, in a Nov. 4 special election, to approve an eye-for-an-eye gerrymander that could yield their party five new lawmakers.

Several other states have waded into the fight, assuming control of the House might be decided next year by just a few seats, one way or the other.

Which could happen.

Or not.

Anyone claiming to know for sure is either lying, trying to frighten you into giving money, or both.

“History is on Democrats’ side, but it’s too early to know what the national political environment is going to be like,” said Nathan Gonzales, one of the country’s top political handicappers and publisher of the nonpartisan campaign guide Inside Elections. “We don’t know the overall mood of the electorate, how satisfied voters [will be] with Republicans in power in Washington or how open to change they’ll be a year from now.”

A look back offers some clues, though it should be said no two election cycles are alike and the past is only illuminating insofar as it casts light on certain patterns.

(Take that as a caveat, weasel words or whatever you care to call it.)

In the last half century, there have been 13 midterm elections. The out party — that is, the one that doesn’t hold the presidency — has won 13 or more House seats in eight of those elections. Going back even further, since World War II the out party has gained an average of more than two dozen House seats.

In Trump’s last midterm election, in 2018, Democrats won 40 House seats — including seven in California — to seize control. (That was 17 more than they needed.) A Democratic gain of that magnitude seems unlikely next year, barring a complete and utter GOP collapse. That’s because there are fewer Republicans sitting in districts that Democrats carried in the most recent presidential election, which left them highly vulnerable.

In 2018, 25 Republicans represented districts won by Hillary Clinton. In 2026, there are just three Republicans in districts Kamala Harris carried. (Thirteen Democrats represent districts that Trump won.)

Let’s pause before diving into more numbers.

OK. Ready?

There are 435 House seats on the ballot next year. Most are a lock for one party or the other.

Based on the current congressional map, Inside Elections rates 64 House seats nationwide as being at least somewhat competitive, with a dozen considered toss-ups. The Cook Political Report, another gold-plated handicapper, rates 72 seats competitive or having the potential to be so, with 18 toss-ups.

Both agree that two of those coin-flip races are in California, where Democrats Adam Gray and Derek Tran are fighting to hang onto seats they narrowly won in, respectively, the Central Valley and Orange County. (The Democratic gerrymander seeks to shore up those incumbents.)

You really can’t assess the 2026 odds without knowing how the redistricting fight comes out.

Republicans could pick up as many as 16 seats through partisan map-making, Inside Elections forecasts, a number that would be reduced if California voters approve Proposition 50. Erin Covey, who analyzes House races for the Cook Report, puts GOP gains as high as 13, again depending on the November outcome in California.

Obviously, that would boost the GOP’s chances of hanging onto the House, which is precisely why Trump pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade redistricting.

But there are many other factors at play.

One huge element is Trump’s approval rating. Simply put, the less popular a president, the more his party tends to suffer at the polls.

Right now Trump’s approval rating is a dismal 43%, according to the Cook Report’s PollTracker. That could change, but it’s a danger sign for Republicans. Over the past three decades, every time the president’s net job approval was negative a year from the midterm election, his party lost House seats.

Another thing Democats have going for them is the passion of their voters, who’ve been flocking to the polls in off-year and special elections. The Downballot, which tracks races nationwide, finds Democratic candidates have far surpassed Kamala Harris’ 2024 performance, a potential harbinger of strong turnout in 2026.

Those advantages are somewhat offset by a GOP edge in two other measures. Republicans have significantly outraised Democrats and have limited the number of House members retiring. Generally speaking, it’s tougher for a party to defend a seat when it comes open.

In short, for all the partisan passions, the redistricting wars aren’t likely to decide control of the House.

“Opinions of the economy and Trump’s handling of it, the popularity (or lack thereof) of Republicans’ signature legislation” — the tax-cutting, Medicaid-slashing bill passed in July — as well as “partisan enthusiasm to vote are going to be more determinative to the 2026 outcome than redistricting alone,” Amy Walter, the Cook Report’s editor-in-chief, wrote in a recent analysis.

In other words, control of the House will most likely rest in the hands of voters, not scheming politicians.

He believed his cousin was inside.

Aguirre knocked on the boarded-up windows and handed off the provisions: clothes, personal items, toiletries.

“Not scared, not nervous, but I feel a deep sense of injustice,” Aguirre said in Spanish through a translator.

Aguirre came to the ICE facility as protests against the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” and ramped-up immigration arrests stretch into their second week. Speculation brewed among protesters as HuffPost reported that ICE would be vacating the Broadview facility due to protests and some questioned whether the detainees believed to be on the buses were being transported elsewhere. HuffPost’s story was updated Sunday night to say DHS decided to keep the facility open and operational despite an initial plan to temporarily close it.

Aguirre’s cousin was detained with two of his coworkers, and Aguirre believed they were all set to be deported — two to Mexico and one to Venezuela.

Not long after Aguirre arrived, two buses left the gated parking lot of the ICE facility. Aguirre and other protesters believed they were carrying detainees.

As the buses drove by, the insults, shouts and chants that the small crowd had hurled for much of the day subsided. Aguirre gave a thumbs up and peace signs toward the tinted bus windows, hoping his cousin and friends could see him saying goodbye from outside.

Aguirre’s cousin is married and has two children ages 7 and 2, he said. He had spent more than $15,000 to move to the U.S., Aguirre said.

After waving toward the bus, Aguirre shook hands with some of the protesters outside the facility before leaving.

“Lo siento mucho,” one woman called after him — Spanish for “I’m so sorry.”

The woman, who declined to give her name but said she came to observe ICE operations and help people looking for their family members who had been detained, shed quiet tears after she watched Aguirre waving at the bus.

“He said he had a family,” she said. “There needs to be immigration reform. But is this really it?”

The woman, whose parents immigrated from Mexico before she was born, said she witnessed an ICE arrest last week in Belmont Cragin.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson told the Sun-Times on Sunday that she hadn’t been informed of any relocation plans for the ICE facility.

In a statement to the Sun-Times on Sunday afternoon, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Broadview facility wouldn’t be closing, but she didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether operations there would be changing in response to the protests.

McLaughlin also confirmed 16 protesters in total had been arrested at the Broadview facility this month. A state official told the Sun-Times that Broadview police and Cook County sheriff’s haven’t asked the Illinois State Police for help despite DHS claims to the contrary. Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker denied the state has received multiple calls for assistance and said the Trump administration shouldn’t be trusted “given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement.”

One protester was arrested outside the facility Sunday.

Immigration enforcement officials have arrested almost 550 people in the Chicago operation that launched about two weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

Jessica Bustos, a 36-year-old South Side resident who works with undocumented families, arrived early with her parents and daughter in tow. They came together because “Sundays are slower,” referring to lower tensions at the center.

They played Mexican music, leading nearly a dozen protesters at the scene about 11 a.m. to break into dance on the sidewalk crossing the facility’s driveway. Bustos’ parents gained citizenship over the course of 13 years, at a cost of nearly $25,000. They spent 13 of their 37 years of marriage apart because of the slow-moving immigration process.

“I’m trying to teach my daughter we need to protect our communities and to be proud of who we are,” Bustos told the Sun-Times. “I feel their pain. … It’s really sad we have to protect ourselves from this.”

But the celebration was halted abruptly as ICE agents streamed out of the gate to fire pepper balls at protesters attempting to block a car from leaving. An agent pushed demonstrator Levi Rolls to the ground after they shot him with non-lethal rounds.

Minutes later, Rolls was arrested while attempting to again block a vehicle.

Rolls said he was given a fine of $580 and a citation for disturbance and disorderly conduct on federal property.

Several vehicles, including a bus and a U-Haul van, were seen coming and going from the facility throughout the day Sunday. Agents, many in masks, hats and sunglasses, also came and went, to shouts of “traitors!” from the crowd. At least one agent was seen on the roof of the building firing pepper balls at protesters periodically.

No one was arrested by Broadview police.

A protester who was detained Saturday night was released after being held for five hours and came back to the detention center on Sunday afternoon to continue demonstrating. They were accused of “assault on officers” and were interrogated about two vehicles that had slashed tires days ago.

“The way they’re treating people, it’s showing people that when you’re in a uniform, you can do whatever you want,” they told the Sun-Times. “The more we let people run over us, the more it’s going to get worse,” they said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5956891/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1953x1115+0+94/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F21%2F4b%2F0dfcccd7407993b45102ac8eb9a2%2Fbroadviewice-092125-8.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:57:48.106713

As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people.","PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) — It was 3:30 a.m. when 10 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers gathered in a parking lot in the Chicago suburbs for a briefing about a suspect they were hoping to arrest. They went over a description of the person, made sure their radios were on the same channel and discussed where the closest hospital was in case something went wrong.

“Let’s plan on not being there,” said one of the officers, before they climbed into their vehicles and headed out.

Across the city and surrounding suburbs, other teams were fanning out in support of “Operation Midway Blitz.” It has unleashed President Donald Trump’s mass deportations agenda on a city and state that has had some of the strongest laws preventing local officials from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

ICE launched the operation on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by the Republican president. They say there has been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents, although a military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize.

The Associated Press went on a ride-along with ICE in a Chicago suburb — much of the recent focus — to see how that operation is unfolding.

A predawn wait, then two arrests

A voice came over the radio: “He got into the car. I’m not sure if that’s the target.”

Someone matching the description of the man that ICE was searching for walked out of the house, got into a car and drove away from the tree-lined street. Unsure whether this was their target, the officers followed. A few minutes later, with the car approaching the freeway, the voice over the radio said: “He’s got the physical description. We just can’t see the face good.”

“Do it,” said Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Agents in multiple vehicles soon overtook the car and boxed it in. After talking to the man, they realized he was not the person being sought for but that he was in the United States illegally, so they took him into custody.

Eventually, a little after dawn broke on the one- and two-story brick houses, the man they were looking for came out of the house and got into a car. ICE officers closed in. The man got out of the car and was arrested. ICE said both men were in the country illegally and had criminal records.

Charles called it a “successful operation.”

“There was no safety issues on the part of our officers, nor the individuals that we arrested. And it went smoothly,” he said.

‘ICE does not belong here’

Activists and critics of ICE say that’s increasingly not the norm in immigration operations.

They point to videos showing ICE agents smashing windows to apprehend suspects, a chaotic showdown outside a popular Italian restaurant in San Diego, and arrests like that of a Tufts University student in March by masked agents outside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, as neighbors watched.

Charles said ICE is using an “appropriate” amount of force and that agents are responding to suspects who increasingly are not following commands.

There has been “an uptick in people that are not compliant,” he said, blaming inflammatory rhetoric from activists who, he said, are encouraging people to resist.

Alderman Andre Vasquez, who chairs the Chicago City Council’s committee on immigrant and refugee rights, strenuously objected to that description, faulting ICE for any escalation.

“We’re not here to cause chaos. The president is,” Vasquez said. He accused immigration enforcement agents of trying to provoke activists into overreacting in order to justify calling in a greater use of force such as National Guard troops. “ICE does not belong here.”

Shooting death of immigrant by ICE officer heightens tensions

Chicago was already on edge when a shooting Sept. 12 heightened tensions even more.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant who tried to evade arrest in a Chicago suburb by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them. The department said the officer felt his life was threatened and had opened fire, killing the man.

Charles said he could not comment because there is an open investigation. But he said he met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate.

The officer was not wearing a body camera, Charles said.

Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., has demanded “a full, factual accounting” of the shooting. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the death and said Mexico is demanding a thorough investigation.

“These tactics have led to the loss of life of one of our community members,” said Democratic state Rep. Norma Hernandez.

In another use of force incident under “Midway Blitz” that has drawn criticism, a U.S. citizen was detained by immigration agents alongside his father and hit by a stun gun three times Tuesday in suburban Des Plaines, the man’s lawyer said.

Local advocates have also condemned ICE agents for wearing masks, failing to identify themselves, and not using body cameras — actions that starkly contrast with Chicago Police Department policy.

‘It was time to hit Chicago’

Charles said there is no timeline for the ICE-led operation in the Chicago area to end. As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people. Charles said 50% to 60% of those are targeted arrests, meaning they are people whom immigration enforcers are specifically trying to find.

He pushed back on criticism that ICE randomly targets people, saying agents weren’t “going out to Home Depot parking lots” to make indiscriminate arrests.

Charles said ICE has brought in more than 200 officers from around the country for the operation.

He said that for too long, cities such as Chicago that limited cooperation with ICE had allowed immigrants, especially those with criminal records, to remain in the country illegally. It was time to act, he said.

“It was time to hit Chicago.”

Some in attendance on Wilmslow Road were reportedly recognised as far-right social media influencers.
And in other instances, British-born, non-white members of the counter protest were incorrectly described as “legal immigrants”.
There is a vacuous absence of moral leadership on immigration and the pro-migrant ‘silent majority’ is not represented.
But on Wilmslow Road, the majority was anything but silent.","Throughout August and September 2025, anti-immigration protesters gathered outside Best Western hotel on Wilmslow Road every Sunday, draped in British flags and ready for hours of antagonisation between their group and the equally persistent counter demonstration. These protests form part of a national movement, claiming to “protect our girls”, after Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, was charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old in July.

Many asylum protests have been organised online by far-right agitators affiliated with Homeland party, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organisation Patriotic Alternative. Helped by the rise of social media movement Operation Raise the Colours, fascist agitators are discretely acting online to cultivate a new, broader-based following. But does everyone at asylum protests subscribe to their fascist ideologies? And is the anti-immigrant sentiment really as popular as Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) would like you to believe?

The Fallowfield protest, attended by The Mancunion, took place five days after Farage’s press conference on August 25, at which he revealed ill-costed plans for mass deportation and pledged to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (EHRC), claiming that “as far as the people of this country are concerned, frankly these measures can’t come soon enough”. Farage describes channel crossings as an “invasion” of the country by “fighting-age men” which could lead to “major civil disorder”. He claims to represent the will of the British people.

However, research suggests this is not the case; anti-fascist organisation ‘HOPE not hate’ argue that a ‘silent majority’ opposes Farage and his policies, and the media “exaggerates the popularity of extreme and fringe far-right views while simultaneously normalising them”. According to YouGov, it is factually incorrect that a majority of Britons support leaving the EHRC, with just 27% saying Britain should withdraw. And Ipsos revealed that 71% agreed that Britain should take refugees fleeing war and persecution.

But a percentage is wholly inadequate in describing the countless, complex and ever-changing factors representing public opinion. In a modern political landscape shaped by online political actors, divisive lies and identity politics, what can an asylum protest on Wilmslow Road tell us about how the views of real people are represented?

Outside the Best Western, the anti-immigration protesters were outnumbered convincingly, with counter demonstrators taking to Wilmslow Road in their hundreds. The counter demonstration was advertised online by various grassroots organisations such as Young Struggle, Manchester Feminist Coalition, and South Asian Liberation Movement. A further group, from Stand Up to Racism, arrived at 15:30 to cheers from an already large majority. Chants of “there are many, many more of us than you” could be heard until the anti-immigration protest dispersed.

The prevailing message from counter demonstrators was clear; chants of “refugees are welcome here” and “fascist scum, off our streets” were loudest, and the message seemed to get through. Residents of the hotel were seen waving to counter demonstrators on the street from their windows and multiple counter demonstrators reported that an asylum seeker had come outside to thank them.

Despite the success of the counter protest, one organiser for Stand Up to Racism, who was at the protest in Oldham the day before, where the counter demonstration was outnumbered, expressed concerns about the aging demographic of the organisation and advocated for young people to find efficient ways to organise and take to the streets in greater numbers. This echoes the concerns that there is a ‘silent majority’ of pro-refugee Britons who are not represented, as loud minorities showing up outside hotels are given disproportionate media coverage.

Regardless, the counter demonstration benefitted from large numbers of both local young people and the area’s student demographic. The presence of the latter prompted the anti-migrant protesters to frame their opposition as outsiders, meeting chants of “this is what Manchester looks like” with “you aren’t even from here”. Feelings of identity and belonging have been core to the success of nationalist movements such as Operation Raise the Colours and the asylum protests, which imagine their opposition as a “liberal elite”.

However, the anti-immigration group seemed divided itself and at times their messages were contradictory. Protesters, including children who had been brought to the rally and given megaphones met chants of “refugees are welcome here” with “refugees aren’t welcome here”. Yet, when asked whether the UK should be proud of providing asylum for refugees, one woman agreed that it should, stating that she only dislikes “the illegal ones”.

Another woman, draped in the Union Jack, was interviewed by information group NOVO, who were present at the protest. When challenged on her immigration concerns, she stated that she has “no issue if [refugees] are coming from war torn countries”, or with immigration in general but thought the government was “doing it in the … wrong way”. She also expressed support for safe and legal asylum routes in the interview, which has since been posted to the group’s Instagram account (@novo_org).

NOVO’s presenter told us that he believes the far-right in the UK has entered a “post-organisational” era, where political agitation is done via social media using non-entity movements, such as Operation Raise the Colours, to attract a larger demographic, which includes people who are not necessarily committed to hard-right ideals or affiliated with any particular fascist organisations.

That is not to say that social media does not also attract significant hard-line fascist factions. A protester on Wilmslow Road flew the flag of the ‘Knights Templar’, a Catholic military order from the 12th century, which has been adopted by far-right groups online. Notably, Anders Breivik, neo-Nazi terrorist and mass-murderer responsible for the 2011 Norway attack, claimed membership to the Templar and cited it in his manifesto. Breivik’s online activity is thought to have played a key role in his violent radicalisation.

Some in attendance on Wilmslow Road were reportedly recognised as far-right social media influencers. Many used phones and handheld pocket cameras to film opposing protesters and record taunts, with one man bringing the camera close to pro-refugee protesters and telling supposed viewers to “look at the faces” of what he called “traitors to this country” and “leftist scum”. There are global concerns about the cultivation of particularly violent and aggressive strains of extremism online. In fact, US congress has recently called on the CEOs of Twitch, Discord and Reddit to testify on radicalisation.

Domestically, concerns have been raised about the consequences of online mis-information since last summer’s Southport stabbing. Mobs attacked mosques and asylum centres after false claims that Axel Rudakubana (the Southport stabber) was a Muslim immigrant, gained 6.7 million views.

The effect does not seem to have worn off. On Wilmslow Road, a woman wrapped in an England flag brandished a picture of Radukubana, who is British and comes from a Christian family, along with a selection of printed mugshots, exclusively featuring people of colour. Protesters adamantly claimed to not be racist, yet the racialised selection of mugshots, was not questioned. And in other instances, British-born, non-white members of the counter protest were incorrectly described as “legal immigrants”.

It was hard to discern a coherent message. There was clear evidence of outright racism and fascism, some seemed less motivated by hate and more by misguided concerns about immigration and asylum. There were protesters who engaged willingly in conversation, while others resorted to personal insults and angry monologues, with one prominent member repeatedly shouting and signalling at counter demonstrators that they were being mind-controlled by the covid-19 vaccination. Even within the small group that turned up to protest outside the Best Western, an array of conflicting ideas was on display, with no coherent or unanimous condemnation of asylum.

Neither Farage nor Yaxley-Lennon acknowledge the dissonance amongst their followers. Without their newer and less fascist supporters, they very much remain fringe political figures. They attempt to unify their followers under a racialised view of Britishness, but the illusion that their dogmatic politics represents the British people (or even their own followers) is a reductive one. One which a message of unity could well shatter. In this spirit, counter demonstrators held up signs outside the Best Western bearing words to the effect of “the enemy travels by private yacht, not by dinghy”, a sentiment abandoned by the current leadership of the Labour party in preference to Trump-like deportation videos. There is a vacuous absence of moral leadership on immigration and the pro-migrant ‘silent majority’ is not represented.

But on Wilmslow Road, the majority was anything but silent. Two messages were loud and clear. To the Farages and Yaxley-Lennons of the world: “there are many, many more of us than you”. And to asylum seekers: unlike fascism, you are welcome in Fallowfield.",https://mancunion.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/BW1.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:57:44.548087

Usually, politicians will bloviate during campaigns about all the wonderful, transformative things they’ll do if voted into office. Most fall far short of their promises; others use smoke-and-mirrors or sleight-of-hand to distract the public from their shortcomings.

But in Donald Trump’s case, in the early days of his second term, he has used a raft of executive orders, staffing shifts, and slashed budgets to disassemble parts of the federal government, including entire agencies. He has concentrated on significantly reducing the federal workforce and deleting regulatory agencies.

He has been making good on his vow to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Even before he assumed office, Trump and a coterie of far-right billionaires, bigots, kooks, and shadowy entities began building the framework to make this nightmare real.

Gov. Ron DeSantis built one concentration camp deep in the Florida Everglades and just opened another at the closed Baker Correctional Institution. It now holds 117 people but has the capacity to hold 1,500, according to DeSantis administration officials. The site is about 45 miles west of Jacksonville near the Osceola National Forest.

CNN says DeSantis is “doubling down” on his plans to build a third detention site in Florida’s Panhandle, which he has dubbed “Panhandle Pokey,” along with another facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.

Other states are jumping on the bandwagon with other proposed immigration facilities, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer” and Louisiana’s “Camp 57,” located at Angola Prison farm, an 18,000-acre plantation sitting an hour north of Baton Rouge.

Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have successfully linked immigration with crime and we are watching dragnets in Florida cities and across the country with untold numbers of undocumented and legal immigrants being swept up.

But Trump couldn’t do this alone. Much like Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or Leopold II of Belgium, a whole bunch of people need to sign onto your vision and they must be willing to build the legal, ideological, and logistical infrastructure needed to pull this off.

That’s where Ron DeSantis comes in. On this issue, DeSantis is an eager underling, working since June in concert with the Trump administration. He, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others have embarked on an unprincipled, sadistic crusade of indiscriminately disappearing, imprisoning, and deporting Latino, Black, and Brown immigrants.

The Trump and DeSantis administrations lacked legal authority to do what they’ve been doing, but they have bent laws and ignored precedent and norms to trample on immigrants’ rights.

Domination

It becomes clearer by the day that the imposition of white domination, power, and control of the state and the country animates everything DeSantis and Trump are doing.

DeSantis has fervently signed on to the MAGA Republican white nationalist project of dragging the United States back to a time when European Americans ruled the roost using brute force; murder; laws, customs and norms; and terrorism and fear to intimidate and control African Americans.

Florida has served as the petri dish for DeSantis and his enablers to roll out the far-right agenda and gauge the public response or acceptance of these policies. Whether it’s banning books, laws seeking to curb or erase gay and trans individuals, anti-Black and anti-DEI bias, whitewashing facts, rewriting history, and attacking African Americans and other marginalized groups.

We are witnessing American apartheid, with the use of a range of mechanisms to more fully marginalize those who DeSantis and Trump deem “the other.” As the ACLU reminds us, DeSantis has joined Trump in amplifying already strained racial tensions in the United States. Both have been brazen in their overt quest to weaponize anger, resentment, and racial grievance.

Political content producer Danielle Moodie notes that Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, and a white nationalist Supreme Court are dismantling democracy, civil rights, and America’s economy.

“Isn’t it remarkable how the Supreme Court can rule in one breath that race cannot be considered in college admissions — stripping away affirmative action — and in the next, empower ICE to racially profile, detain, and harass Latinos simply for speaking Spanish in Los Angeles?” Moodie asks. “This hypocrisy reveals a troubling truth: The Court claims to be color-blind when protecting opportunity, yet suddenly sees race when it comes to criminalization, detention, and fear.”

Moodie added: “This contradiction is not just a legal nuance. It is a reflection of how deeply embedded white supremacy remains within our institutions. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, aided by his handpicked justices, the Supreme Court has become less an arbiter of justice and more an enabler of authoritarianism.”

The immediate result: Immigrants — documented and undocumented — are being disappeared by ICE agents without reasonable suspicion. The far-right faction is allowing federal and state law enforcement agents to confront and detain anyone who looks Latino, speaks little or no English, and gathers in certain places where Latinos congregate.

This blessing granted by the high court of racial profiling allows gangs of ICE, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, ATF, and others to hunt down immigrants, the vast majority of whom have committed no crime.

Moodie notes that the Supreme Court, its credibility at an all-time low, stripped away affirmative action in higher education; handed presidential immunity to Donald Trump while he faced multiple indictments; and enabled a wave of anti-immigrant policies that echo the darkest chapters of American history.

“Chief Justice John Roberts will likely be remembered not as a guardian of the Constitution, but as the leader who rolled back a century of progress on civil rights,” she said.

Theatrics

Critics including James Greenberg, emeritus professor of anthropology at The University of Arizona, have been warning about the authoritarian path that DeSantis and MAGA Republicans elsewhere are laying out. They mean to stoke fear and compel compliance.

“These theatrics work like rituals. Military vehicles rumble through desert towns, children in cages, recruitment ads with warriors silhouetted against flags — all ceremonies of fear,” Greenberg said. “They draw sharp lines of belonging and exclusion, marking who belongs and who is cast out. Raids at dawn, walls built for cameras, soldiers posing for photo ops are repeated gestures that turn cruelty into liturgy, weaving it into civic life until it looks ordinary.”

“Power has left marks on the land and surveillance has become a terrain of expansion,” Greenberg added.

“Tools once built to track foreign terrorists now target immigrants, activists, journalists, even civil servants. Private tech firms fused with federal agencies, creating databases that sweep up social media posts, license plate scans, phone metadata, and travel patterns,” he said. “These systems persist without oversight. Algorithms flag ‘suspicious behavior’ that often means nothing more than speaking out, worshiping differently, or crossing paths with the wrong people.”

Those who resist are surveilled by drones, have their phones and laptops searched at airports and border crossings.

“The effect is not only to collect data but to intimidate, to show people they are always visible. Surveillance has become a system of control, a constant warning that belonging can be questioned at any time,” said Greenberg.

“Detention has followed the same logic. Private prison companies, once in retreat, under Trump found new life. Contracts multiplied, decommissioned facilities reopened, tent cities sprouted in remote deserts. These sites were deliberately hard to reach, far from lawyers and reporters. Images of overcrowded cells and children behind fences remain etched in memory as proof of how cruelty is normalized.”

In total, detention “has always been as much spectacle as policy, a ritual of exclusion designed to instill fear before it processes anyone,” he continued.

“Inside, migrants are fingerprinted, DNA-tested, and placed in systems that reduce human beings to biometric codes. What looks like confinement is both political theater and an extraction of data and profits,” Greenberg said.

“Family separation reveals the cruelty in its starkest form. Parents deported without their children. By severing the most basic bonds of belonging, the state redefined what it means to be part of the nation. Citizenship papers could not shield children from being rendered effectively stateless if their parents were removed. Belonging is treated as a privilege that can be revoked at will.”

The deeper truth, Greenberg warns, is that repression relies on infrastructure.

“Prisons, surveillance grids, militarized zones — once built, rarely vanish. They remain in place for whoever comes next,” he said. “Like irrigation canals dug centuries ago, they channel flows of power long after their builders are gone. Trump accelerated this process, turning the latent into the active, the possible into the real.”

Depending on who you ask, there are those who believe that it’s already too late to reverse what DeSantis, Trump, the orchestrators of Project 2025, and MAGA Republicans are doing, while others believe America still has time.

Despite the complaints of its critics, the humanitarian protection system created through the Refugee Convention is a remarkable accomplishment. In the seven decades since its ratification, the Convention has saved millions of lives, enshrined in national legal systems and state practice the core principle that people seeking protection cannot be returned to harm (nonrefoulement), and advanced the cause of democratic freedom—providing safety from persecution to refugees escaping Communist Eastern Europe, Christians fleeing theocracy in Iran, and Sudanese pushed out by civil war and ethnic persecution.

But this legal instrument on the cusp of its 75th year is also creaking under the weight of today’s realities. Mass displacement driven by economic collapse, conflict, gang violence, and climate change has taxed humanitarian systems, a situation worsened by the recent cratering of international aid. Meanwhile, asylum systems have become an outlet for the mobility pressures created by demographic change and economic inequality—making it hard to distinguish the deserving from the chancers. And potential asylum seekers often journey through multiple countries on their way to a final destination, raising concerns about the right venue to seek asylum. As a result, national governments have struggled to reconcile their protection responsibilities under the Convention with their domestic responsibilities to maintain security and order, particularly at borders.

It has long been taboo to suggest that the Convention should be reformed, for fear of what would be lost. But calls from states, particularly donor and destination-country ones, to address gaps left by the original text have become more difficult to ignore, particularly as some governments have chosen to openly flout Convention obligations in lieu of advancing reforms. Ignoring questions about the future of the Convention now seems naive at best, harmful at worst. While reform will not be straightforward—international law moves slowly at the best of times—there is a mounting case for debating whether to clarify some elements of the Convention and fill its gaps through the adoption of a new Protocol.

At a fundamental level, the core principles of the Convention—which even some nonsignatory states have come to respect—remain not just relevant to today’s present world but are an indispensable tool for responding to conflict, instability, and gross violations of human dignity and rights. The recognition that individuals and communities could come under threat in their home states due to their political beliefs, race and ethnicity, religion, nationality, or group membership—and that their neighbors have a duty, to the extent consistent with national sovereignty, to provide a place of refuge—cannot be replaced. This remains so even if the framework through which these principles are interpreted and implemented requires updating.

Reforming the international protection system should thus be done with a scalpel, not a chain saw. The best vehicle to accomplish a targeted effort to fix what is not working and reinvigorate the core principles for 21st century challenges is likely to be a second Protocol to the original 1951 Convention. A Protocol could allow for targeted reforms and sidestep the need for (likely lengthy and complex) debate on the core Convention text. Rather, a Protocol would focus on addressing the specific gaps in the system that have clearly emerged over the last nearly 75 years:

Establishing a set of rules around onward movement from first safe countries of asylum.

Agreeing to a mechanism for quickly meeting needs and sharing responsibility in situations of mass displacement.

Improving financial burden-sharing to compensate major hosting states and enable refugee self-sufficiency.

Making these changes is the right thing to do to reduce harm and increase the ability of those genuinely in need to access safety. They also make sense for reducing disorderly onward movements and shrinking the space in which organized crime operates, which has become a major security issue across much of the world, and will boost destination countries’ diplomatic clout.

Why Reform Is on the Agenda

The Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol left several notable gaps. First, the Convention is silent on access to territory or the right to seek asylum. This means the only way for an asylum seeker to trigger protection is to physically reach a state’s territory or jurisdiction. With few legal routes available, many must turn to smugglers, who profit from their desperation. The Convention is also largely silent on how countries should determine whether an individual is a refugee or what should happen when individuals who are not in need of protection seek asylum.

Finally, and perhaps most critically, while the Convention recognizes that displacement is inherently a transnational issue and that international cooperation to address it is needed, it stops short of stipulating how this should be done or providing a mechanism for doing so. Without a mechanism for responsibility-sharing, most of the world’s displaced people have sought refuge in a small number of low- and middle-income countries, which thus shoulder a disproportionate share of responsibility. Some of these states have struggled (or declined) to provide basic rights for refugees, including legal status and the ability to work or receive an education. While the Global Compact on Refugees sought to address some of these issues, it was nonbinding and has not fully lived up to its own ambitions.

The omission of responsibility-sharing from the Convention also has consequences for high-income destination countries. Some displaced individuals will choose to move on from their first country of arrival, whether because basic food and shelter are lacking (as for Sudanese in Chad), because they lack the right to work legally (as in Iran), or because they wish to reunify with family or pursue better opportunities elsewhere (as for skilled Syrians in Turkey). For states outside the immediate neighborhood of a displacement crisis, this raises thorny legal and political questions about the circumstances under which refugees may leave a first country of safety and seek protection in a second or third country.

There is widespread agreement across the political spectrum in many places that the system could, and should, work better. A well-functioning protection system should prevent dangerous journeys and reduce the space for smugglers to operate, including by offering safe and orderly routes. It should avoid misuse of asylum systems by economic migrants, who instead should join the queue for labor visas or be better connected with livelihoods in their regions of origin. It should reduce irregular onward movement, where people (both with genuine protection claims and without) choose a particular destination instead of staying put in the first safe place they come to. And it should ensure that more of the world’s refugees can access not just safety but also the means to support themselves and their families, so they do not feel driven to move on.

The Case for Legal Changes

Many of these changes could come without revisions to international law. Destination states can already offer more safe pathways or pre-entry asylum processing, which replace chaotic spontaneous arrivals with predictability and control. Hosting states can give refugees more rights. And donor countries can provide more funding. There is space in the existing legal architecture for governments to negotiate regional or bilateral safe third-country agreements that require refugees to seek protection in the first safe state. And nothing is stopping states, technically, from streamlining their domestic asylum procedures and bolstering return systems.

Still, there are three key reasons to consider updating the legal framework:

First, in areas where the Convention is silent or ambiguous, such as the safe third-country concept, clear rules could regulate how states implement changes, ensure those reforms are sound and beneficial, and help shield against legal challenge. Some governments have expressed concern about the vulnerability of asylum policies to litigation, leading some to call for ignoring the courts or existing norms altogether—a clear threat to the rule of law. Legal frameworks that cannot bend will break, and it may ultimately be better to find ways to amend the framework while preserving its core, rather than seeing states walk away from the Convention entirely.

Second, while states could do many changes on their own, they lack the incentives, and the Convention does not include any enforcement mechanisms. While there is quite obviously limited political space at present for new treaty enforcement mechanisms, there may be ways to create trade-offs and incentives that make it in states’ best interests to follow the letter and spirit of the law—whether around obligations to take back their own nationals, providing legal status and work rights to refugees, or stepping up financial responsibility-sharing.

Finally, it is worth acknowledging that many of the challenges to the Convention are political. Publics, particularly in the high-income world, have become skeptical of the added value of international law to address the needs and threats they see around them. Reforming the legal basis for the humanitarian protection system could be a moment to signal that these concerns have been heard, and that governments are working to prioritize fairness and integrity and restore public trust.

The Elements of a Better System

Rather than a whole-scale reform of the Convention itself, the most prudent—and rapid—course would be to introduce a targeted set of changes through an additional Protocol, similar to the procedure used in 1967. This would allow states to focus on a narrow set of issues, rather than renegotiating the entire basis of the system, which would almost certainly be a complex, time-consuming, and risky endeavor. The challenges faced by states—and crucially, refugees themselves—also require a quicker response, and a Protocol process would be likely to move faster than a complete renegotiation.

Ultimately, delicate interstate negotiations would determine the ultimate scope of a Protocol, and states will have their own interests regarding what to bring forward. But three areas are likely ripe for inclusion (among many potential others):

Limiting asylum to situations of immediate harm. Asylum is essential, but it needs to be used in a more limited way, as an escape valve for people at immediate risk of harm and refoulement, who cannot reasonably find safety in their own country, rather than as a tool for selecting a new home. A Protocol could set out the principles and minimum standards under which safe third-country agreements could be established and returns carried out, or make clear that refugees should seek asylum in the first safe country under certain conditions. This then would lay the groundwork for a network of binding regional and bilateral safe third-country agreements that would discourage irregular secondary movements (trading financial support, safe pathways, and operational cooperation for accepting asylum seekers). As part of regional agreements, signatories would then commit to offering other channels, such as humanitarian visas, pre-entry asylum processing, and the use of complementary work or study pathways to share responsibility and to provide a credible alternative to irregular movement—including of refugees seeking to reunite with family and friends in destination countries. Other elements could also be included here, such as greater clarity around conditions for cessation of refugee status for those who no longer have protection needs.

Providing a blueprint for responding to situations of mass displacement. Many displacement situations present unique challenges. They are often driven by a wider set of circumstances, such as generalized violence and state collapse, that are not reflected in the 1951 Convention; they are ill-suited to the use of individual asylum determination; and they have the potential to quickly overwhelm the capacity of neighboring states. A Protocol could set out new rules regarding states’ obligations and the rights of displaced persons in these circumstances (possibly including a new form of temporary status, such as that used by some states in response to displacement from Syria, Venezuela, and Ukraine). It could also establish an emergency coordination mechanism that facilitates the offer of emergency resettlement pathways for onward movement for individuals with serious humanitarian needs or willing sponsors in countries further from the front lines.

Responsibility-sharing through increased financial support, with a focus on results-based conditions that promote refugee self-sufficiency. A Protocol could seek to address the responsibility-sharing gap by creating targets or incentives for non-affected states to step up and provide more financial support to frontline countries (e.g. trading off financial contributions for the implementation of safe third-country arrangements). This has a self-interested dimension for high-income countries: it is much cheaper for donor countries to support refugees closer to where they are displaced. But increased funding also could be tied to specific conditions, namely that host countries provide access to safe legal status, legal identity and documentation, rights to work, and freedom of movement. There could also be space for frontline countries to negotiate on other points in their interest, such as access to pathways for their own nationals, in exchange for more funding or expanding rights they grant refugees.

The Mechanics of Getting There

To date, the loudest calls for reforming the Refugee Convention have come from high-income destination states, including European countries and the United States. But binding international agreements are of little use if only a handful of the affected parties sign up. If these states are serious about reforming the system in workable ways, they will need to listen to and incorporate the concerns of the rest of the world. These are likely to differ considerably from the priorities of high-income destination countries. Coming to an agreement will thus require navigating trade-offs and a good deal of grown-up diplomacy.

A first step would be to conduct consultations with a geographically diverse set of states on whether a new Protocol should be negotiated and, if so, what its scope should be. In the leadup to the 1967 Protocol, this process was launched with an expert report tabled for discussion at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) executive committee (ExCom). UNHCR then conducted bilateral consultations with states around receptivity to certain provisions and potential political and technical sensitivities. This resulted in a targeted proposal that had broad endorsement and was adopted just 21 months after the process began. It may not be possible to fully replicate this process—not the least because of how divisive this set of issues is. But there would be clear value in scoping a core set of ideas before launching a formal negotiation and ensuring the process itself is well steered. Such an undertaking could be a huge win for the new High Commissioner, as yet unselected but due to take office in January 2026.

This is not to say that such a process would be easy. Multilateralism is notably floundering, and international cooperation has become increasingly transactional—admittedly not a conducive environment for difficult negotiations. And with international organizations under pressure from dramatic budget cuts, the place where the value of legal frameworks stands or falls—implementation—could be tricky. Yet attempting to push under the rug the political and practical challenges facing the humanitarian regime, including the different challenges and interests of refugee-hosting countries in various economic brackets—has also not played out well.

A Protocol is not a silver bullet, but it could help bridge the gap between a creaky-though-still-essential 20th century framework and pressing 21st century realities. It could provide the careful adjustments needed to preserve what works, repair what does not, and restore public trust in a system that has saved millions of lives. It would also be an important win for cooperation between high-, middle-, and lower-income countries that could give the humanitarian regime a fresh start.

Tensions remained high at the ICE Processing Center in Broadview Sunday night as families of detainees received word that their loved ones may be moved to another location.

One woman, who did not want to be identified, said she received a call from the facility about her father who was detained earlier this week.

""They called us at 6 p.m. and told us to bring him something, because they're all leaving, and they're either getting sent to Wisconsin or Michigan or Texas,"" she said. ""They're telling him he has to wait two months for court... two months in Texas and then he'll get deported... instead of self-deporting because, he just wants to self deport, but they're not letting him.""

That comes as speculation is growing about how long operations may continue at the facility after protests escalated there earlier this week.

DHS issued the following full statement:

""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE. Since Friday, rioters and sanctuary politicians have obstructed and assaulted law enforcement. These rioters have thrown tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.

The ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests.
It makes exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks such as N95 respirators or tactical gear, and it does not apply to state police.
Proponents of the California law said it is especially needed after the Supreme Court ruled this month that the Trump administration can resume its sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles.
The law aims to boost public trust in law enforcement and stop people from impersonating officers to commit crimes, supporters said.","California became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business under a bill that was signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom and swiftly denounced by Trump administration officials.

The ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests. The raids prompted days of protest and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the area.

Newsom said at a news conference in Los Angeles, where he signed the bill flanked by state lawmakers, education leaders and immigrant community members, that California is unique in that 27% of its residents are foreign born.

“We celebrate that diversity. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. It is under assault,” he said.

The Democratic governor said the state is pushing back against the practice of masked agents without identification or badge numbers detaining people on the streets.

“The impact of these policies all across this city, our state and nation are terrifying,” Newsom said. “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. No due process, no rights, no right in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today.”

But it’s unclear how — or whether — the state can enforce the ban on federal agents.

Trump administration officials have defended use of masks, saying immigration agents face strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they carry out enforcement in service of Trump’s drive toward mass deportation. Obscuring their identities is necessary for the safety of the agents and their families, officials contend.

Bill Essayli, acting US attorney for Southern California, said on the social platform X that the state does not have jurisdiction over the federal government and he has told agencies the mask ban has no effect on their operations. “Our agents will continue to protect their identities,” he said.

Essayli also criticized Newsom’s comment on X saying Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was “going to have a bad day today,” adding that there is zero tolerance for “direct or implicit threats against government officials.” He referred the matter to the Secret Service, which said in a statement, also on X, that it could not comment on the specific case but must investigate any potential threat.

DHS official criticizes California law

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, called it “despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers.”

“While our federal law enforcement officers are being assaulted by rioters and having rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown at them, a sanctuary politician is trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” she said via email.

The men and women of federal immigration agencies put their lives on the line to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens, she said, and rhetoric like Newsom’s has contributed to a surge in assaults.

Newsom countered that concerns about doxing agents, or publishing their personal information online, are unfounded and unproven.

“There’s an assertion that somehow there is an exponential increase in assaults on officers, but they will not provide the data,” he said. “All they have provided is misinformation and misdirection.”

Ban applies to various face coverings, includes some exceptions

The new law prohibits neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers, including immigration enforcement agents, while they conduct official business. It makes exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks such as N95 respirators or tactical gear, and it does not apply to state police.

Democrats in Congress and lawmakers in several states, including Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, have introduced similar proposals calling for mask bans.

Proponents of the California law said it is especially needed after the Supreme Court ruled this month that the Trump administration can resume its sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles. The law aims to boost public trust in law enforcement and stop people from impersonating officers to commit crimes, supporters said.

Constitutional law expert Erwin Chemerinsky at the University of California, Berkeley, also defended the legislation. Federal employees still have to follow general state rules “unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties. For example, while on the job, federal employees must stop at red lights,” he wrote in an opinion piece for the Sacramento Bee.

Another new law covers schools and health care facilities

Newsom also signed legislation Saturday preventing immigration agents from entering schools and health care facilities without a valid warrant or judicial order and requiring schools to notify parents and teachers when agents are on campus.

Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance, said “students cannot learn if they live in fear of being deported.

The Save America Movement is described as “a rapid-response and civic empowerment initiative to ensure the American people have a clear understanding of the actions and impact of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in our communities while providing support to impacted communities.”

Organizers plan to have trained camera crews and volunteers help capture ICE operations as they’re happening. The group unveiled three specially outfitted vans Saturday, dubbed Liberty Van One, Two, and Three, which will be staffed by trained volunteers, including lawyers, clergy, veterans and videographers.

“Los Angeles will always stand with families under threat,” Mayor Karen Bass said. “Angelenos are showing the country that when our communities are targeted, we respond with solidarity, with resources, and with an unbreakable commitment to justice.”

In the coming weeks, organizers will be recruiting and training volunteers to staff the vehicles, to be deployed in early October.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, in a letter to the acting director of ICE, demanded a “full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between these agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement.”

Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the arrest. Separately, Mayor Mark Dion, once a sheriff, expressed his concerns (“Why are federal agents able to escape that basic responsibility that democratic policing expects?”).

The chair of the school board, Sarah Lentz, said in a statement that the board’s role was “to provide free, appropriate education to every student, regardless of the identities that they hold, and this interrupted that and created substantial harm within our community. And it is not welcome.”

This is all well and good. It’s also not nearly enough.

If Maine wishes to send a clear message, to move the needle at all, it needs to assume a united front against the cavalier maneuvers of ICE. Since Donald Trump took office, immigration arrests have more than doubled in Maine and 37 other states.

So far, the collective response has been incoherent.

Consider that the aggrieved city council that issued a formal statement raising concerns about dignity, public trust and community safety is the same city council that, just weeks prior, signed a federal grant agreement for upgrades at Portland International Jetport that mandates cooperation with ICE. Assessing the contract and the national legal picture, lawyers for the city said they don’t expect Portland will be required to work with the agency.

The obvious difficulty with this expectation is that, given the secrecy that shrouds the work of an emboldened and lavishly financed ICE, we may never be able to establish exactly where cooperation with its crackdown begins and ends. Dion had to take extra steps to reassure concerned residents because the decision to sign the contract was made in executive session, behind closed doors.

At a naturalization ceremony in Portland last Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills declined to comment on the public school detention. The tension of this time, however, cannot be lost on her. A reporter noted the governor appeared to be fighting back tears as she observed: “It always a very emotional and inspiring ceremony.”

Mills is well able to swim against the tide and the governor should be doing so, wherever possible, on the subject of ICE and its practices. Pushing for the governor to sign into law LD 1971 (a bill passed by the House and the Senate in June), the terms of which Mills ultimately found too broad, an August letter writer expressed his impatience.

“This is a strategy that aims to inspire fear in immigrants and in the American population at large. It’s putting boots on the ground in every state, in an unprecedented show of force that belies the stated purpose of getting immigration under control,” read the letter. “Where is the governor’s ‘I’ll see you in court’ resolve that Mainers need and deserve in these fraught times?”

Writing in May on the subject of local police departments’ contracts with ICE — popular nationally but, so far, unpopular here in Maine — this editorial board commended the towns of Wells, Winthrop and Monmouth for withdrawing or pausing their departments’ undertakings to accept work that ICE delegates.

“The upside for ICE, here, is crystal clear,” we wrote. “The potential benefit to our local authorities is murky, at best, and best avoided as a result.”

We see now that there may be “upsides” in the absence of a clear and firm approach to ICE that insists on transparency and other run-of-the-mill terms and conditions.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.
“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said.
“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said.
“We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem.","TORONTO — Canadians in several major cities demonstrated Saturday against elements of the Liberal government’s agenda, including Prime Minister Mark Carney’s support for new fossil fuel projects and expected public service cuts.

Hundreds who took part in “Draw the Line” protests in Toronto marched from downtown to the provincial legislature building, carrying signs that included messages advocating full immigration status for all, ending trade with Israel, Indigenous rights and a revolution against billionaires.

Some signs featured images of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan in December.

Speakers prior to the march included environmentalist David Suzuki, Grassy Narrows First Nation member Chrissy Isaacs, and others.

Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, accused Carney’s government of “enriching billionaires” while Canada is on “the brink of a climate collapse.”

“We are here to say that whether it is climate, or economic justice, whether it’s Palestine or right here at home, we are facing a joint agenda and we will push back against it,” Hussan told the crowd.

Speaking to reporters, Suzuki criticized Carney’s focus on creating jobs over addressing the climate crisis.

“He’s putting the economy above the atmosphere that gives us air to breathe, that gives us weather, climate, and the seasons. That’s crazy,” Suzuki said.

“Indigenous people tell us all the time the Earth is our mother. She gives birth to us. She nurtures us. She has got to be our highest priority,” Suzuki said, adding that climate change should be a larger priority than creating jobs.

The protests, which occurred ahead of the federal government tabling its budget on Nov. 4, also included marches in Ottawa, Edmonton and Montreal.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but Carney has repealed the consumer carbon price and paused the Liberals’ electric vehicle mandate.

Currently, Canada’s emissions are about only 8.5 per cent below what they were in 2005, and Carney and his ministers have refused in recent weeks to say whether Canada is still committed to its 2030 and 2035 targets, though the government says it is still focused on hitting net-zero by 2050.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.

George Westel, who was at the Toronto protest and represented a group called Stop 413 East End Toronto, said everyone in Ontario is at risk of being hurt by the climate crisis.

“Climate change is affecting migrant workers, it’s affecting Indigenous people,” he said after the group reached Queen’s Park. “This province is called a place to grow, and we are losing that place to growth.”

Hundreds of activists gathered on Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill in Ottawa to create a giant mural with washable paint. The 65 metre-long mural read “People peace planet not profit” and featured symbols of a moose, fish, a person holding a feather, butterflies and watermelon, representing the issues the activists stand for.

“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said. “We are refusing to let the government continue down a path of climate destruction, militarism, and scapegoating of migrants. The people demand peace, justice, and a livable future.”

Meanwhile other activists took part in a march from the Hill to the U.S. Embassy and ending at the Human Rights Monument on Elgin Street.

Ottawa Police said two people were arrested for mischief and had Wellington Road closed for the majority of the afternoon for the clean up of paint.

“Despite clashes with police and two activists being detained, spirits remained high, and a human barrier formed to allow the painting to continue,” organizers said in a statement.

The road reopened shortly after 5 p.m.

In Vancouver, hundreds of protesters listened to speeches outside a downtown library before marching several blocks.

Mark Hancock, national president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told the crowd that many people feel a sense of urgency on issues including skyrocketing housing and food costs.

“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said. “We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem. They’re not taking away our housing. They’re not jacking up the cost of living in this country. They’re just trying to make it like you and I and everybody else in this country.”

Carney said earlier this month that the government plans to return immigration rates to “sustainable levels,” which includes reducing the number of non-permanent residents to less than five per cent of the total population.

He said that adjusting the temporary foreign worker program to target specific sectors and needs in specific regions, as well as improving immigration policies, was tied to easing the strain on housing, public infrastructure and social services.

Many protesters in B.C. objected to the federal government fast-tracking liquefied natural gas expansion projects in B.C., which Vancouver resident Robert Hornsey said would result in the depletion of groundwater.

“The LNG is a boondoggle. What you need to do is invest in renewable energy, wind, air, solar, tidal and thermal,” Hornsey said. “B.C. has a massive geothermal reservoir that it has not used or exploited.”

Another event attendee, Ann Grant, was holding her handmade big pink balloon printed with Carney’s face that read “killing the planet.”

In some cases, refugees are being deported to countries where they’ve never lived, they say.

It’s not immediately clear how many members from Fresno’s Southeast Asian community have been detained at ICE check-ins and deported since President Donald Trump launched what he says will be the largest deportation campaign in history. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to request for comment on this story.

Many of these individuals are refugees with minor criminal records from years ago that could subject them to deportation, advocates say. But they weren’t deported earlier because, as refugees, the countries they were born in don’t recognize their citizenship. Some were born in refugee camps and are considered stateless. Or, the U.S. didn’t have an agreement in place to deport them to their home countries. In lieu of deportation, they were required to have regular check-ins with ICE.

While these check-ins were a longstanding practice, now, some are of these people are being detained and forced to return to countries they and their families were forced to flee due to political persecution, war and genocide.

Fresno has a large Southeast Asian community, from countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It’s also home to the second largest concentrations of Hmong people nationwide, many descendants of U.S. allies during the Vietnam War.

“A lot of them are refugees or children of these veterans (and) have committed a senseless crime when they were teenagers,” said Pao Yang, president and CEO of The Fresno Center. “And then now you’re sending these children of these veterans that fought with the U.S. back to a country that they were fighting against with you.”

During the first Trump administration, the government tried to put pressure on Southeast Asian countries to receive people with deportation orders to those countries. Those efforts have ramped up this year during Trump’s second term, said Tilman Jacobs, an immigrants rights supervising attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, the nation’s oldest Asian American civil rights advocacy group.

“These communities are being impacted in a way that we haven’t seen before,” Jacobs said. Individuals have been deported from ICE check-ins in Fresno, he said, though he didn’t have an estimate on how many had been detained.

Yang, the Fresno Center CEO, said he also knows of “many” Fresno clients that have been detained and transferred to the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in McFarland, where they are held as they await next steps in their immigration cases.

As of late August, Christine Barker, executive director of the refugee-serving nonprofit, Fresno Immigrant and Refugee Ministries, knew of at least five individuals of Laotian or Cambodian descent being detained at their ICE check-ins in Fresno.

“I also know from some of their family members, when they got to [the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in] McFarland, they were like, ‘there’s a lot of Asian people here,” she said.

While California’s Southeast Asian communities have experienced more sporadic immigration enforcement, other states such as Michigan and Minnesota have seen more high-profile enforcement activity. More than 150 Southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to an Aug. 18 report in the Minnesota Reformer.

Jacobs said the practice of detaining people at ICE check-ins was more common during the first five or six months of the administration, but he hasn’t seen as much of it recently in California.

“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to continue happening,” he said. “It’s definitely a real risk. But I also don’t want to overstate it.”

Hmong people are an ethnic group originating from China and that have their own language and culture. Because of decades of persecution by the Chinese government over their cultural and spiritual practices, the Hmong have constantly migrated to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. In the early 1960s, the CIA recruited Hmong people to help fight against North Vietnam and the communist party in Laos, known as the Pathet Lao. The operation, also known as The Secret War, lasted from 1962 to 1975. When the Pathet Lao took over Laos’s governance, thousands of Hmong and Laotian people sought refuge in the United States in 1975.

Barker said what’s happening to these refugees is a violation of human rights.

“When you’re a refugee, the world is supposed to protect you from ever having to return to the country you fled,” she said. “These are uncles, these are grandpas, these are old, old convictions from the 80s and the 90s.”

Deported to Laos, Cambodia

Families, lawyers and nonprofits are scrambling to support individuals that have been deported to countries such as Laos and Cambodia.

Thao Ha, runs Collective Freedom, an organization that supports “justice-impacted” individuals from Southeast Asian communities. In recent months, her organization has had to pivot to provide support on the ground in Laos and is helping families track down their deported loved ones.

“We didn’t think they were going to go this hard, this fast, or at all,” she said. The community had assumptions that people couldn’t get deported to Laos, or that only a few here and there would be deported, Ha said.

Laos doesn’t have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S., according to the Asian Law Caucus. But the Trump administration has pressured Laos to accept deportees — including people who were not born in the country and whose parents fled the country — by threatening to withhold business and tourist visas to Lao citizens.

When people are deported to Laos, they are detained upon entry in Laos for multiple weeks, advocates say. Those with a local sponsor are released more quickly. Those who don’t have a sponsor will be detained longer until the government can process them.

Ha said there’s no official repatriation process in Laos, meaning there’s little infrastructure to help people with housing, work, or cultural adjustment.

“There’s not an agency, so to speak,” Ha said. “We’re just trying to rapid response and mutual aid at this point.” Several groups have “popped up” to try to fill the gaps, but none are formal non-governmental organizations.

The “number one challenge” for people with their loved ones being deported to Laos is that they don’t have family there, Ha said. “If they don’t have family and don’t have a sponsor, where do they go? What do they do? Are they just roaming the streets?”

For some deported to Laos, especially those born in refugee camps, they have no relationship to the country, language skills or community knowledge. “For Hmong folks who grew up in the U.S., they may never learn Lao,” Barker said.

Barker also said there used to be programs to help people from the Khmer Indigenous ethnic group acculturate in Cambodia.

“Those programs disappeared when USAID was gutted,” she said.

Fleeing war, genocide, persecution

Jacobs of the Asian Law Caucus said his organization works with Southeast Asian refugees who are facing pending deportation, oftentimes from very old convictions.

“Many of the people that we work with have consistently followed all of those terms with their release and continue to do so,” Jacobs said. “And I know that there is a lot of anxiety right now around these check-ins.”

Many of the organization’s clients were fleeing civil war, genocide and persecution and carry memories of trauma associated with the unfamiliar country, he said.

“In many cases, there are countries that don’t really want to receive people who left so long ago, and what a lot of them are facing in real terms, is statelessness where they’re not recognized as citizens of those countries,” he said.

For example, he said, Hmong people in Laos are given some kind of residency status, but they are not citizens. And this sense of not belonging can have lingering legal, emotional and psychological impact.

Yang said many in the Southeast Asian immigrant community are quiet and scared because many come from a country where the government targets people. Earlier this year, there was a rush of people seeking legal services, but now, especially after the start of the June immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, he’s noticed a “huge drop” in people seeking assistance.

“We have a lot of folks, even legal resident aliens, that are in hiding, that are afraid,” he said.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/b5fn6g/picture312166297/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_IMG_JRW_HMONG_NEW_YE_2_1_MQCJB0FL_L347915631,N,,2025-09-21 15:56:53.537061

In framing the Hyundai ICE raid as a blow to economic diplomacy and foreign policy, opponents of ICE detentions disregard the humanity of those suffering these vile, horrific acts.
The Hyundai plant atrocity should infuriate the Emory community, not just as fellow residents of Georgia, but as fellow humans.
Reports of the Hyundai ICE raid have centered around the U.S. regaining its foothold in diplomatic relations with South Korea.","On Sept. 18, Hyundai announced that it would funnel $2.7 billion into the Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution manufacturing plant in Ellabel, Ga. Just two weeks earlier U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided that same factory. The raid comes in the aftermath of the United States and South Korea summit where both parties negotiated a nearly $150 billion industry trade deal.

During the raid at the Hyundai factory, United States immigration authorities detained 475 people at the plant due to allegations of ""unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes."" Back in February, The Emory Wheel Editorial Board wrote about the threat of ICE to our nation’s diversity, as part of the Trump administration’s overarching agenda to turn the United States into a monolith of national identity. Since then, the situation has only worsened — violations of rights are so commonplace that people have become desensitized to their severity.

In the days following, ICE deported over 300 South Korean nationals whom the agency detained in the raid. U.S. President Donald Trump justified the deportations, citing that the Koreans were “illegal aliens and ICE was just doing its job.” Despite some of the group holding legal status, this did not stop ICE from holding several Korean nationals at gunpoint, detaining them in overcrowded rooms with little-to-no sunlight, and forcing them to drink water from the floor, according to the workers themselves. South Korean news outlets have been quick to point out the sadistic treatment of the South Korean workers, with one saying the U.S. treated the workers as “prisoners of war.” As of Sept. 12, the South Korean workers arrived home to reunions with loved ones and protests for justice in their names.

Through the Trump administration’s brash commitment to the fear-based corralling of immigrants, the United States not only faces forced isolationism but also becomes increasingly inhumane. In mainstream media, initial coverage of the Hyundai plant raid was predominantly focused on the potential economic fallout of this event. In framing the Hyundai ICE raid as a blow to economic diplomacy and foreign policy, opponents of ICE detentions disregard the humanity of those suffering these vile, horrific acts.

In the wake of the raid, reports highlighted how rising tensions between South Korea and the United States have hindered economic and diplomatic relations. Despite South Korea and Hyundai’s investment plans to the Ellabel plant and other U.S. industries, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that the ICE raid could have a “considerable impact” on future investments from his country. Georgia lawmakers have stepped into action, but these efforts have been focused on preventing further disruptions to local industries, not on reducing brutal detainments.

While these monetary concerns are valid, centering discourse on the investment impacts of the raid obscures the dystopian reality for immigrants. We are focusing too much on economic implications and sidestepping moral ones. Advocates of immigration reform often highlight how immigrant workers fill labor gaps — especially in manufacturing and construction — and call them the “backbone” of manual labor in this country. However, behind every data point is a life. Detainees face prolonged isolation in remote facilities with limited access to legal counsel and often lack due process. Reports show ICE agents throughout the country using excessive force and denying medical care to detainees, painting a disturbing picture of cruelty and inhumanity.

Focusing on investments, tariffs or labor shortages suggests that detainees only deserve respect if they bolster a bottom line. Our state’s commitment to justice should not hinge on how many cars or naval vessels a worker helps build. This was the largest single-site immigration raid in U.S. history, and it happened 200 miles from Emory. Based on the other massive ICE sweeps in Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago among other cities, this event is not an anomaly — these operations are becoming the norm, with no sign of slowing.

Worse, in a recent shadow docket decision, the Supreme Court quietly lifted two lower courts’ ban on ICE’s “roving patrols.” With no written explanation, the decision essentially allows ICE agents to question and detain people based on markers of “reasonable suspicion,” including their appearance, language, neighborhood or workplace. Race, identity, origin and visa status have become the measure of someone's worth, and anyone who does not appear white is susceptible to being confronted and asked to present their papers.

The Hyundai raid makes it abundantly clear that these events do not merely concern news happening in other states. As residents of metro Atlanta, we are interlaced with the people, culture and industry of rural Georgia — together, we all contribute to the lifeblood of the state. The Hyundai plant atrocity should infuriate the Emory community, not just as fellow residents of Georgia, but as fellow humans.

As citizens, we must not look the other way when such gross misconduct happens under our nose, especially when many members of our community come from immigrant families, including several of us on the Editorial Board. We implore you to look deeper than the headline. Reports of the Hyundai ICE raid have centered around the U.S. regaining its foothold in diplomatic relations with South Korea. However, when our coverage shifts to rectifying national friendships for the purpose of economic gain, we set aside our common humanity. News broadcasts of this detainment have been ultimately facile and have compartmentalized the real issue — human suffering is not an implication.

Organizations like Migrant Equity Southeast work to center the narratives and experiences of communities that the unencumbered cruelty of ICE raids has ripped apart. Standing in support of immigrants during protests, such as the Buford Highway protest highlighted in our previous article, demonstrates to the administration that we will not tolerate violations of our Constitutional rights. We must educate ourselves and our communities on our Fourth Amendment rights and how to respond during ICE encounters to ensure the safety of immigrants — especially as they grow more and more at risk.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/whl/40404a2f-a128-4c36-8c16-16021ab9b449.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-21 19:56:49.747064

""Masked secret police are not making anyone safer; instead they're creating an environment of lawlessness and fear that puts federal agents, local law enforcement, and civilians in danger.""","SACRAMENTO - California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed five bills Saturday attempting to thwart President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda, including a ban on local and federal officers wearing masks to conceal their identities.

The bills mark the latest chapter in what's become a tense fight over immigration enforcement in California, a state home to more than 10 million immigrants as well as industries and communities that depend on them.

""Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said Saturday afternoon at a Los Angeles signing ceremony in which he condemned secrecy by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ""ICE unmasked. What are you afraid of? You're going to go out and do an enforcement? Provide an ID.""

In the nine months since Trump took office, his administration has targeted California's sanctuary protections that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts, sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles to quell immigration protests, and carried out aggressive raids in immigrant-heavy communities. An immigrant farmworker died in one of those raids as he tried to escape the chaos.

Two federal judges have imposed limits on federal immigration agents' tactics and ability to profile Latino residents, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned one of those orders, clearing the way for ICE officers to target people in Southern California who look Latino or are speaking Spanish. Trump's crackdown has also ensnared U.S. citizens, some of whom have seen their property destroyed during immigration stops or been detained in immigration facilities when officers did not believe they were citizens or were unable to immediately prove their citizenship. In many cases the federal agents have worn face coverings that conceal their identity.

Newsom also signed new laws that seek to limit immigration enforcement work in hospitals and schools. In a statement announcing the new laws, Newsom excoriated Trump's immigration tactics, calling out the president and his top aide on immigration policy, Stephen Miller.

""Public safety depends on trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve - but Trump and Miller have shattered that trust and spread fear across America,"" Newsom wrote. ""California is putting an end to it and making sure schools and hospitals remain what they should be: places of care, not chaos.""

The bills approved Saturday include two measures that require federal and local officials, including immigration agents, to identify themselves. One measure, Senate Bill 627, prevents police from covering their faces on the job, with some exceptions. It applies to local law enforcement officers, out-of-state police officers and federal law enforcement officers - but not state police.

The Department of Homeland Security urged Newsom to veto SB627, arguing its officers need masks to protect them from ""being doxed."" The term ""doxed"" typically refers to people's sensitive personal information being released online, but DHS appeared to use it to mean when immigration officers' identities are made public, something that is routine for government employees.

Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, released a scathing response denouncing the idea that federal agents cannot effectively police without concealing their identities.

""Law enforcement can do their jobs without wearing ski masks, and if you think you need to wear a ski mask while patrolling and making arrests, you may want to consider a different line of work,"" wrote Wiener, the author of the new law. ""Masked secret police are not making anyone safer; instead they're creating an environment of lawlessness and fear that puts federal agents, local law enforcement, and civilians in danger.""

Much of the criticism of the bill focused not on whether wearing masks was good for policing, but whether the state has the ability to create rules guiding how federal officers perform their work within the state.

""States do not have the authority to second-guess the efficacy of federal policies, including masking,"" David Mastagni, an attorney representing the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella group of police unions, told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill.

The mask ban will take effect Jan. 1.

The other bill, SB805 by Sen. Sasha Pérez, D-Alhambra (Los Angeles County), requires law enforcement officers working in California to display identification with their name or badge number, with exceptions for undercover work and protective gear. It also limits when bounty hunters can help with immigration enforcement. SB805 takes effect immediately.

Newsom also signed these new laws, which take effect immediately:

• Senate Bill 98, by Pérez, which requires schools to tell parents and guardians when immigration officers are present on campus.

• Assembly Bill 49, by Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi, D-Rolling Hills Estates (Los Angeles County), which requires school officials to deny access to federal immigration authorities unless they have valid identification and a judicial warrant or court order. It takes effect immediately.

• Senate Bill 81, by Sen. Jesse Arreguín, D-Berkeley, which classifies immigration status and place of birth as ""private information"" that health care providers can't share with immigration enforcement. The bill also prohibits any person from accessing nonpublic areas of hospitals and doctors' offices for the purposes of immigration enforcement - except when required by federal or state law.

""Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today. You're welcome, America,"" Newsom's press office posted Saturday on X in reference to the homeland security secretary. The post prompted acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli to respond: ""We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials. I've referred this matter to @SecretService and requested a full threat assessment.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nl6_39E2mz4TkBj_xo98Mw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/san_francisco_chronicle_hearst_178/a09ca24e3c2cabd682af6d64feccd1e0,N,,2025-09-21 13:57:07.998003

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.","A new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas goes into effect Sunday, but it will not be applied to existing holders of valid visas re-entering the country, a White House official tells Axios.

Why it matters: President Trump's executive order, as written, gave some lawyers the impression the fee would kick in immediately for existing holders — prompting panicked advice to clients to get back to the U.S. Saturday, or else.

Catch up quick: Friday night, Trump signed an order requiring an H-1B holder, or their corporate sponsor, to pay an annual $100,000 fee for their visa.

For the biggest H-1B employers — tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and outsourcing companies like Cognizant — that could potentially mean a new fee burden in excess of $1 billion a year.

The intrigue: The rules kick in at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday, but as written, some lawyers argued it appeared the fee would apply to anyone with an H-1B, even those whose visa was already approved, but who happen to be outside of the United States for some reason.

Some tech companies reportedly told their H-1B employees to get back to the U.S. by Saturday and not leave thereafter.

""I hate to say this, but if you are an H-1B worker outside the U.S. who already has an H-1B visa, the safest approach is re-entering before Sunday,"" immigration lawyer Douglas Russo said in a widely commented post on LinkedIn late Friday.

Yes, but: That is not the case, the White House official tells Axios.

The fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing holders or renewals, the official said.

It will first apply in the upcoming lottery cycle for new applicants, the official added.

Of note: Saturday afternoon, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow issued a memo confirming the fee order only applies to petitions not yet filed.

""The proclamation does not apply to aliens who: are the beneficiaries of petitions that were filed prior to the effective date of the proclamation, are the beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, or are in possession of validly issued H-1B non-immigrant visas,"" the memo says.

The big picture: While Trump's crackdown on border crossings has gotten the lion's share of attention, the fight over H-1B visas for highly skilled workers has been in many ways an equally contentious part of his immigration policy.

Traditional MAGA allies like Steve Bannon say U.S. employers are using H-1Bs to bring in tech workers to take American jobs at a fraction of the cost.

Newer Trump allies from Silicon Valley, on the other hand, say H-1Bs are crucial for bringing the world's best talent to America.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages. It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.

Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom.
Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation.
For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers.","Trump officials will face lawsuits over a proclamation that uses selective economic claims to justify a travel ban on H-1B visa holders. The presidential proclamation, issued on September 19, 2025, will impose a likely prohibitive $100,000 fee on the entry of individuals with new H-1B visas. An administration clarification, or “walk-back” after criticism, provided more details on who can enter the United States without paying the fee. If the $100,000 fee survives court challenges, it will change how many companies access talent, since an H-1B visa is often the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work long term in America. After surveying the impact and examining what is coming from the administration on immigration policy, many employers are expected to respond by increasing offshoring and hiring more people outside the United States, the opposite of what the proclamation aims to accomplish.

The presidential proclamation bans the entry of individuals on H-1B visas “except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000.” The proclamation contains no information on how an employer can obtain a “national interest” waiver to sidestep paying the $100,000 fee. The restriction lasts for 12 months but will likely endure throughout the Trump administration.

According to Customs and Border Protection, “The Proclamation applies prospectively to petitions that have not been filed. It does not impact aliens who are beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, any petitions filed prior to 12:01 AM ET on September 21, 2025, or aliens in possession of validly issued H-1B nonimmigrants visas.” (USCIS issued a memo with similar language.)

“The clarifications mean that foreign nationals who currently have a pending or approved H-1B petition or a valid H-1B visa should not be subject to the newly-announced H-1B entry restrictions,” according to Fragomen. “They should be able to enter the United States from abroad on or after September 21, 2025, provided that they possess a valid, approved H-1B petition and H-1B visa (if required).” The law firm notes that “those with a pending H-1B petition should not be impacted by the proclamation.” However, foreign nationals with an H-1B petition filed on or after September 21, 2025, “are subject to the new entry restrictions.” The firm notes, “Guidance on petitions subject to the restrictions, on payment of the new H-1B fee, and on applying for a national interest exception to the restrictions are anticipated in the coming days.”

An employer who petitions for an individual, such as an F-1 student, who changes to H-1B status without leaving the United States should not have to pay the $100,000 fee. However, the two agency memos released over the weekend are not crystal clear on this. The CBP memo says the fee only applies to people outside the US, but the USCIS memo does not say that, and USCIS adjudicates H-1B petitions, notes Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel. The weekend memos clarify that current H-1B employees who did not pay the fee can still travel. But since this is an evolving situation, employers should seek legal advice and watch for agency guidance before individuals travel.

If the H-1B travel ban remains in place, cap-exempt organizations, such as universities, would have to pay the $100,000 fee to hire new professors or researchers if they are outside the country and a petition has not already been filed for them. The $100,000 fee, on top of other government fees, attorney costs and salary requirements, will act as a prohibition on hiring individuals outside the country in H-1B status for nearly all employers.

Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation

After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom. Attorneys believe they have a strong case but may have to contend with a Supreme Court that has often deferred to the president on immigration policy.

Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation. “I want to say it’s nuts that the proclamation cites 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) as authority, when that provision only gives the president authority to prevent entry, and gives the president no authority with respect to petition approval or visa issuance,” said Morrison. “This is fresh on my mind as I won an injunction on this issue just a month ago.” The case was Thein v. Trump, which focused on whether Trump’s travel ban can prevent the State Department from issuing visas to Diversity Visa lottery winners.

“8 U.S.C.1185(a) doesn’t make this proclamation lawful either,” said Morrison, “because it only gives the president authority to prescribe reasonable rules for foreigners to depart or enter the U.S. It’s clear from this proclamation they’re making rules about how petitions are approved and how visas are issued. Also, I don’t think this proclamation can survive a nondelegation challenge.” Nondelegation refers to the constitutional issue whereby Congress cannot give away its legislative authority.

Immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta is less confident a lawsuit will succeed. “While the proclamation is so blatantly unlawful that it rewrites parts of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act), I am not as sanguine of a successful challenge to the proclamation after the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s travel ban under INA 221(f) in Trump v. Hawaii,” he said in an interview. “The H-1B proclamation has also been issued pursuant to INA 221(f).”

“The proclamation rehashes many of the objections to the H-1B visa category that have become outdated and seem to cast IT firms of Indian heritage in an unfavorable light,” said Mehta. “H-1B workers are no longer cheap labor and provide great value to U.S. companies, which in turn create more jobs for U.S. workers. H-1B workers are mostly paid six figure salaries. The rules also ensure that H-1B workers are paid the higher of the prevailing or actual wage.”

Mehta said a court may not challenge the president’s rationale behind the proclamation, but a court could evaluate whether imposing the $100,000 fee rewrites H-1B law or only supplants it. “To me, it is a complete rewrite of the law, and so a court should be able to distinguish this proclamation from Trump v. Hawaii,” he said. “The president cannot wholesale re-write laws enacted by Congress, and decide the sort of immigrant he prefers over another based on personal whim and prejudice.”

On October 1, 2020, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s June 2020 proclamation that suspended the entry of foreign nationals on H-1B, L-1, H-2B and most J-1 temporary visas. Judge White ruled the president does not possess a monarch’s power to cast aside immigration laws passed by Congress. The order in NAM v. DHS prevented the State Department and Department of Homeland Security from “engaging in any action that results in the non-processing or non-issuance of applications or petitions for visas in the H, J, and L categories which, but for Proclamation 10052, would be eligible for processing and issuance.”

At a September 11, 2020, hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Paul Hughes of McDermott Will & Schulte, counsel for the plaintiffs, framed the issues: If Congress delegated unlimited authority to the president under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)), the law is unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of authority by Congress. If the authority is not unlimited, then there are limits to the president’s authority based on rational standards and court precedents.

Judge White cited an amicus curiae brief from law professors that all past presidents “had issued such Proclamations with the basic understanding that ‘exercises of authority under § 1182(f) must connect to the United States’ relations with foreign powers.’ As the Court examines this Proclamation in the immigration context aimed to address purely domestic considerations, the amicus suggest that ‘[g]iven this lack of pedigree on past practice, this Court should scale back deference that it affords the current proclamation.’”

“There must be some measure of constraint on Presidential authority in the domestic sphere in order not to render the executive an entirely monarchical power in the immigration context, an area within clear legislative prerogative,” according to Judge White. In a footnote, Judge White expressed skepticism that the ban on the entry of visa holders banned under the proclamation would end. The ban ended after Joe Biden took office.

Proclamation Makes Selective Immigration Claims To Justify H-1B Travel Ban

The H-1B proclamation makes only a limited attempt to justify the extraordinary action of banning the entry of an entire visa category of highly skilled individuals. “The Trump administration makes highly selective claims that ignore a large body of economic research on the benefits of admitting H-1B visa holders to justify its presidential proclamation imposing a travel ban on H-1B visa holders whose employers do not pay a prohibitive $100,000 penalty,” concluded a National Foundation for American Policy analysis.

“The presidential proclamation’s omissions, cherry picking and obfuscation of data indicate the administration decided on the policy details in the proclamation and later attempted to find material to support the policy rather than engage in a legitimate analysis that culminated in banning the entry of H-1B visa holders, absent a $100,000 fee,” according to the NFAP report.

The proclamation argues that an increasing unemployment rate in technology fields justifies the H-1B travel ban, despite the unemployment rate declining in these fields. “The unemployment rate for computer and mathematical occupations dropped from 3.4% to 3.0% between August 2024 and August 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,” notes the NFAP analysis. “The unemployment rate for architecture and engineering occupations fell from 1.7% to 1.4% between August 2024 and August 2025. Those numbers represent a decline in the unemployment rate in percentage terms of 11.8% for individuals in computer and mathematical occupations and a drop of 17.6% for professionals in architecture and engineering.”

The proclamation ignores the overall unemployment rate in these fields over the past 12 months but cites data on the unemployment rates among college graduates aged 22 to 27 from 2023—without noting the data were from 2023. The fourth table in a group of tables released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York divides the population of college graduates aged 22 to 27 in a survey into 72 college majors, resulting in much smaller sample sizes, which creates volatility and less reliability in the results. For example, although the proclamation cites a 7.5% unemployment rate for recent college graduates in computer engineering, it does not note the figure is from 2023 or that in 2022 the survey showed the unemployment rate in computer engineering was only 2.5%. Other fields, such as agricultural economics, also showed wild fluctuations from year to year. The NFAP analysis notes that it is unlikely the numbers in the survey are a strong indicator of career prospects in particular fields.

The proclamation ignores the significant job creation that has benefited U.S. workers in technology fields over the past few decades. “The number of U.S.-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024,” according to an NFAP analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The proclamation implies that U.S. college students would be better off majoring in art history than in computer fields due to H-1B visa holders. There is no evidence to support such a conclusion.

A 2021 NFAP study by Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida and a former research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, found, “Median earnings of college graduates with a computer-related major are 35% higher than other STEM majors and fully 83% higher than non-STEM majors, according to data on U.S.-born college graduates from the American Community Survey for the period 2009 to 2019.”

The proclamation ignores almost entirely the vast number of studies produced on H-1B visa holders. The NFAP analysis cites more than a dozen to illustrate the point.

For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates.”

A study by economists Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber and Angie Marek Zeitlin found that denying entry to H-1B visa holders due to the H-1B annual limits inhibited job growth for U.S.-born professionals. “The number of jobs for U.S.-born workers in computer-related industries would have grown at least 55% faster between 2005-2006 and 2009-2010, if not for the denial of so many applications in the recent H-1B visa lotteries,” concluded the economists.

In a study particularly relevant to the new H-1B proclamation, research by Britta Glennon, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that new restrictions on H-1B visas are likely to push jobs out of the United States: “[A]ny policies that are motivated by concerns about the loss of native jobs should consider that policies aimed at reducing immigration have the unintended consequence of encouraging firms to offshore jobs abroad.”

More Immigration And H-1B Visa Restrictions On The Horizon

Trump officials appear unlikely to slow their pace after issuing the travel ban on H-1B visas. The proclamation calls for reviving the Trump administration’s efforts in 2020 to publish a Department of Labor rule to inflate the required salary for H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants. The 2020 measure mandated minimum salaries so far above the market wage for a foreign national’s experience level that analysts concluded Trump officials intended to price H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants out of the U.S. labor market. Unlike the proclamation, such a rule would apply to individuals inside the United States, not just those seeking entry.

Trump officials are likely to continue their efforts to dismantle the current immigrant talent pipeline by, among other things, making it more difficult for international students to obtain H-1B status. The effort will include finalizing the recently proposed rule to require fixed periods of admission for students, rulemaking to curtail or eliminate, in practice, Optional Practical Training and STEM OPT, a new H-1B selection process expected to disadvantage international students and an H-1B rule that will likely introduce new restrictions for companies.

If employers did not have enough to worry about, the Department of Labor announced a new immigration effort on September 19, 2025. “The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the launch of Project Firewall, an H-1B enforcement initiative that will safeguard the rights, wages, and job opportunities of highly skilled American workers by ensuring employers prioritize qualified Americans when hiring workers and holding employers accountable if they abuse the H-1B visa process,” according to a news release.

The Secretary of Labor promises to “personally certify the initiation of investigations for the first time” in the Labor Department’s history. The DOL release on the new immigration action notes, “As authorized by federal law, the department will conduct investigations of employers through Project Firewall to maximize H-1B program compliance.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68cfa474a8f75b8570b1fd1f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1688,950,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-09-21 12:56:38.048856

The use of solitary confinement in U.S. detention facilities has been on the rise since Trump’s second presidential term.

According to a report published by the NGO Physicians for Human Rights, thousands of migrants have been placed in solitary confinement since the Biden administration took office in 2021, and in recent months this practice has multiplied despite risks to detainees’ mental health.

The report also found that during the first three months of 2025, vulnerable people were held in isolation for periods more than twice as long as when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) first began publishing statistics — that is, 38 consecutive days in early 2025 compared with 14 days in late 2021.

The agency defines vulnerable people as pregnant, breastfeeding, or elderly individuals; those suffering from serious mental disorders or illnesses; people at risk of harm because of their identity; or victims of rape or sexual abuse.

Solitary confinement is defined as placing a person in a small cell for 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact. ICE claims it does not use “solitary confinement” in its detention centers. The agency avoids the term “solitary confinement” and instead uses terms such as segregation, separate housing, or Special Management Units. The study says migrants held in such cells were placed in administrative segregation.

According to the report, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention centers across the United States over a 14-month period from April 2024 to May 2025. Similarly, in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was more than six times higher than at the end of the previous U.S. administration.

The report also cites a study showing that solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate and an unprecedented number of migrants are being kept in isolation. It warns that, due to a recent increase in congressional funding approved to expand migrant detention centers, widespread and prolonged use of solitary confinement is likely to worsen.

The United Nations considers solitary confinement of 15 days or more to be torture. Katherine Piller, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement that agency records from late in the Biden administration — amid increasing attacks by the Trump administration on migrants — show that ICE has exposed people to these torturous conditions, causing devastating physical and psychological harm.

Experts say prolonged isolation can cause paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression — all of which can lead to suicide.",https://www.mizanonline.ir/files/en/news/2025/9/21/12478_250.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:56:47.062982

And there have been at least five ICE missions to Africa on military jets, though if the last two are any indication, they are getting increasingly harder to spot.","Two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa this month on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft.

One of the jets was later identified in a lawsuit in U.S. federal court as carrying 14 Nigerian and Gambian nationals to a prison camp in Ghana. They have since been returned to their countries of origin, Ghana said, despite all having credible fears of persecution or torture. The other jet secretly landed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali, according to communications from the flight deck obtained by Rolling Stone. Representatives for the governments of these countries did not respond to emails asking if this jet also included third-country nationals.

The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by President Donald Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

“The administration is using military secrecy to cover for what is basically a law enforcement/immigration enforcement function,” an activist flight tracker who goes by JJ in DC told Rolling Stone. “If this is being done in our interest, we have a right to know where these deportation flights are going.”

While it is legal for military aircraft to turn off their transponders, this is generally reserved for combat and surveillance missions, JJ in DC, who is a military veteran, said. Military flights also cost much more to operate than charter carriers, as much as $28,500 an hour, according to Reuters.

The Air Force and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide a statement prior to publication. This story will be updated if any of them do.

Both secret trips were on Air Force C-17 Globemasters. The first one left McChord Field near Tacoma, Wash., on the evening of Sept. 4, stopping at the ICE-detention hub city of Alexandria, La., and the U.S. military outpost at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — which Trump has converted into an ICE facility holding what he has baselessly claimed are “the worst of the worst” deportees. The flight landed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a likely fuel stop, the next afternoon.

Editor’s picks

These flights were conducted without the standard transponder signal, called Automatic Dependent Signal-Broadcast, or ADS-B, which transmits constant information about a flight, including registration, location, speed, and altitude, to any receiver within range. The C-17 used an alternative signal transmitting its registration but no location or other flight data — though flight-tracking websites could still approximate its location through a kind of triangulation.

It is unclear when exactly the C-17 left St. Croix, because by then it was using another type of signal even harder to detect, in which an aircraft transmits its location via data link only when requested by a specific partner, like an air base. Different flight-tracking websites were able to capture different fragments of the C-17’s trajectory — a single blip over the Atlantic Ocean on the night of Sept. 5 and part of a descent toward Accra, Ghana’s capital, the next morning.

Hours later, a brief signal showed it landing in Cape Verde, probably for crew rest, before returning home. Its ADS-B transponder began transmitting again on Sept 10. Two days later, a lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court alleged the flight held 14 men — 13 from Nigeria and one from The Gambia — who had all been granted protections from removal to their countries of origin for fear of persecution or torture. They were loaded onto the cargo jet in the middle of the night with no advance warning, they alleged, and were only told where they were going when the plane was in the air. One Nigerian man said that after he asked to speak to his lawyers, he was “straitjacketed for several hours” — seeming to refer to the WRAP device ICE uses on immigrants who resist transport, which has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years alleging use of the device has caused permanent injury and even death by asphyxiation.

Once in Ghana, the men said they were sent to an “abysmal” open-air prison camp and told they would be returned to their countries of origin — something the U.S. government had been barred from doing. Though Judge Tanya Chutkan called the Trump administration’s actions “disingenuous,” she ultimately ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to stop it. On Tuesday, Ghana said all of the men had been returned to their home countries, though attorneys told the Associated Press four were still in the Ghana prison.

Human rights groups say this amounts to chain refoulement — the forcible expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they are vulnerable to return to countries where they face persecution — and violates both domestic and international law.

“What is alarming today is the emerging pattern of shadowy deportations of people who have not had access to a court or any meaningful form of due process — removals that bear the hallmarks of forced disappearances under international law,” says Rebecca Sharpless, a University of Miami law professor who studies ICE flights.

Accepting third-country nationals “should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration,” Ghanaian foreign minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said Monday. “Our decision is grounded purely on humanitarian principle and Pan-African empathy.”

The second C-17 trip began like the first one — Alexandria, Gitmo, St. Croix, no ADS-B transponder but still trackable — before becoming even harder to detect when it left St. Croix. One flight-tracking website captured a few blips as it headed toward the western coast of Africa in the small hours of Sept. 10, and two blips over Senegal later that evening. The other flight-tracking website didn’t capture anything at all, which one activist described as “very weird.”

Two of the flight deck transmissions Rolling Stone obtained, which are not available on flight-tracking websites, show the pilots planning to land at Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, Liberia, and Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone that morning, with a third transmission showing an intended stop in Mali’s capital of Bamako in the early afternoon. The final stop in Senegal was likely for crew rest.

Two other military aircraft are known to have done ICE missions without broadcasting transponder signals: the jets that carried third-country nationals from a U.S. base in Djibouti to South Sudan and Eswatini in July.

That same month, Trump held a bizarre “Africa summit” at the White House, gathering five of the continent’s 50-plus leaders around a conference table, where he extolled their “very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people” and fished for compliments from his fellow heads of state. (“A tremendous golfer.” “Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.”) And, Trump said, they were making progress on third-country agreements.

Since then, ICE flights to Africa are surging. A new ICE charter, Paradigm Jet Management, has entered the picture, running at least eight deportation trips to and from the continent in the last six weeks. ICE also sent seven third-country nationals to Rwanda on two Gulfstream jets, and now the Trump administration is threatening to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria (or Syria). Omni Air International carried Russian dissidents to Egypt, where they were forced onto a plane to Moscow, and last week flew an eight-stop deportation mega-route from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where passengers on the last stop likely spent more than 50 hours shackled in handcuffs and leg irons attached to chains around their waists.

The ban, which comes into effect on 1 January 2026, is part of a series of bills that aims to protect residents from what Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has called ""secret police"" roaming the streets.

US Attorney Bill Essayli, a Trump appointee, said California ""has no jurisdiction over the federal government"", adding the law has ""no effect on our operations"" and agents ""will continue to protect their identities"".

The ban is in response to federal agents wearing masks during Los Angeles immigration raids.

The law makes exceptions for undercover agents, masks used to protect against disease or wildfires, and tactical gear.

President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement as a priority in his second term.

In June, a series of federal immigration raids in LA sparked violent protests against the Trump administration and ICE.

Trump deployed 700 US Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to the country's second-largest city in reaction to the unrest.

California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, wrote the bill in response.

""No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,"" he said. ""California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.""

The legislation comes after the Supreme Court ruled that immigration enforcement stops in LA could continue for the time being without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the US legally.

That ruling allows officers to question and detain people based solely on their race, language or job while a legal challenge to recent immigration raids works its way through the courts.

As well as the ban on face coverings, a new bill also requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number.

Other bills signed by Newsom on Saturday prohibit school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.

Families will also need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools.

Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.

Non-public areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are also off-limits to officers who do not have judicial warrants or court orders.

""Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said.

In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called California's new legislation ""despicable"" and a ""flagrant attempt to endanger our officers"".

She said the officers at ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies ""put their lives on the line every day"" to do their jobs.

""Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization.""

New Americans, a division of Samaritas, is one of Michigan's largest refugee resettlement services with offices in Grand Rapids and Battle Creek. The organization supports individuals and families from arrival through long-term integration. Director Chris Cavanaugh has collaborated with refugees wanting to come to Michigan for more than 20 years, and he has heard that some former refugees who have settled in the area are concerned about their status based on changing immigration policies instituted by President Donald Trump's administration.

“The refugee system has traditionally worked to help (immigrants) who face persecution,” Cavanaugh said. “I’ve heard from some (employees) that they’ve had clients express concerns about their status.”

Cavanaugh added that he hasn’t heard of any refugees his agency has worked with skip work or school because of deportation concerns. But Michigan Immigration Rights Center Director Susan Reed has gone out of her way to assure clients that they still have rights, especially if they are naturalized citizens. Reed oversees the nonprofit legal resource center that supports immigration communities. Michigan Immigration Right Center has five locations in the state, including Battle Creek.

“There are so many people who contact us each week who think the (federal government) can to whatever they want to them,” Reed said.

Among the administration policies enacted this year is an increase in Temporary Protected Status (TPS) terminations, Reed said. TPS is a humanitarian program created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990 that grants immigrants temporary status to work in the U.S., usually for a period of six to 18 months.

With TPS and other protections reduced or eliminated, local immigrants are concerned about enrolling their children in community programs or visiting federally qualified health centers for medical care because of the implied threat of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents being onsite.

Reed has been in the immigration law field for more than 20 years. She said there have been 451 changes to immigration policy since Jan. 20, and that the pace and number of changes have been overwhelming to her.

“Just think how hard that is for (clients),” Reed said. “It’s very frightening. Every time there is significant ICE (enforcement) activity in a neighborhood, everyone hears about it.”

The Battle Creek area and other west Michigan communities have experienced a growth in refugees and immigrants from such countries as Burma and the Demmocractic Republic of Congo in recent years as people native to those countries have come to the U.S. to escape political and socioeconomic persecution.

“We’re hoping to see the flow of immigrants increase,” Cavanaugh said. “There are a lot of (refugees and immigrants) who are trying to reunite with their families in U.S.

Refugees are people who cannot return to their home country because of persecution or a realistic fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Refugees are admitted into the country through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program after screening by U.S. agencies. The U.S. Department of State manages that program.

Being a refugee is a protected status under humanitarian law. Refugees must apply for a green card, which signifies the approval of permanent residents, one year after entering the U.S. according to the USCIS website.

Family- and employment-based immigrants enter as permanent residents, but many immigrants have no automatic path to U.S. residency.

“There should not be status issues for refugees unless they have committed a crime,” Cavanaugh said.

Other refugees and immigrants have come to the Battle Creek area from countries like Cuba, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia.

One challenge Cavanaugh has experienced is that the country’s humanitarian parole program has been impacted by status changes coming from federal agencies. Nationally, this has resulted in some immigrants losing their employment authorization and protected status.

Humanitarian parole is an immigration tool used to allow immigrants who don’t otherwise qualify for a visa to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or because their entry provides a significant public benefit. Rather than a residency step, it’s an emergency permission granted for a limited time, according to the USCIS website.

Actions like changing the status of the humanitarian parole program is one reason why Cavanaugh believes local refugees and immigrants may be concerned for their status.

“Many of these people came here just so they could work in the U.S.,” he said. “If they aren’t eligible, that’s a big challenge.”","https://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/PDEM/86078840007-20200302-t-000000-z-777382664-rc-2-dbf-9-yg-1-kt-rtrmadp-3-usaimmigration.JPG?crop=3034,1708,x0,y157&width=3034&height=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-21 11:59:13.744846

Birmingham immigration attorney Brett Pouncey told statewide news outlet AL.com that numerous communities are also working with ICE to set up license-checking ""roadblocks"" – citing reports from his own clients.

Russellville community organizer Evelyn Servin told the outlet that police should not be working with the feds, and claimed people in her area may be racially profiled and detained.

Throughout the summer, ICE also made two dozen arrests in Baldwin County, home of the famed white-sand ""Redneck Riviera"" beach towns.

Arrests were made at sites in Loxley – along Interstate 10 north of Orange Beach – and Spanish Fort, which lies on the other end of the George Wallace Tunnel from Mobile.

The operations led one immigration advocate in that region to suggest immigrants write phone numbers on their bodies to be able to contact family in case they are detained by ICE, according to AL.com.

As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people.","PARK RIDGE, Ill. -- It was 3:30 a.m. when 10 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers gathered in a parking lot in the Chicago suburbs for a briefing about a suspect they were hoping to arrest. They went over a description of the person, made sure their radios were on the same channel and discussed where the closest hospital was in case something went wrong.

“Let's plan on not being there,” said one of the officers, before they climbed into their vehicles and headed out.

Across the city and surrounding suburbs, other teams were fanning out in support of “ Operation Midway Blitz.” It has unleashed President Donald Trump's mass deportations agenda on a city and state that has had some of the strongest laws preventing local officials from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

ICE launched the operation on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by the Republican president. They say there has been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents, although a military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize.

The Associated Press went on a ride-along with ICE in a Chicago suburb — much of the recent focus — to see how that operation is unfolding.

A voice came over the radio: “He got into the car. I'm not sure if that's the target.”

Someone matching the description of the man that ICE was searching for walked out of the house, got into a car and drove away from the tree-lined street. Unsure whether this was their target, the officers followed. A few minutes later, with the car approaching the freeway, the voice over the radio said: “He's got the physical description. We just can't see the face good.”

“Do it,” said Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Agents in multiple vehicles soon overtook the car and boxed it in. After talking to the man, they realized he was not the person being sought for but that he was in the United States illegally, so they took him into custody.

Eventually, a little after dawn broke on the one- and two-story brick houses, the man they were looking for came out of the house and got into a car. ICE officers closed in. The man got out of the car and was arrested. ICE said both men were in the country illegally and had criminal records.

Charles called it a “successful operation.”

“There was no safety issues on the part of our officers, nor the individuals that we arrested. And it went smoothly,” he said.

Activists and critics of ICE say that's increasingly not the norm in immigration operations.

They point to videos showing ICE agents smashing windows to apprehend suspects, a chaotic showdown outside a popular Italian restaurant in San Diego, and arrests like that of a Tufts University student in March by masked agents outside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, as neighbors watched.

Charles said ICE is using an “appropriate” amount of force and that agents are responding to suspects who increasingly are not following commands.

There has been “an uptick in people that are not compliant,” he said, blaming inflammatory rhetoric from activists who, he said, are encouraging people to resist.

Alderman Andre Vasquez, who chairs the Chicago City Council's committee on immigrant and refugee rights, strenuously objected to that description, faulting ICE for any escalation.

“We’re not here to cause chaos. The president is,” Vasquez. He accused immigration enforcement agents of trying to provoke activists into overreacting in order to justify calling in a greater use of force such as National Guard troops. “ICE does not belong here.”

Chicago was already on edge when a shooting Sept. 12 heightened tensions even more.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant who tried to evade arrest in a Chicago suburb by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them. The department said the officer felt his life was threatened and had opened fire, killing the man.

Charles said he could not comment because there is an open investigation. But he said he met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate.

The officer was not wearing a body camera, Charles said.

Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., has demanded “a full, factual accounting” of the shooting. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the death and said Mexico is demanding a thorough investigation.

“These tactics have led to the loss of life of one of our community members,” said Democratic state Rep. Norma Hernandez.

In another use of force incident under “Midway Blitz” that has drawn criticism, a U.S. citizen was detained by immigration agents alongside his father and hit by a stun gun three times Tuesday in suburban Des Plaines, the man’s lawyer said.

Local advocates have also condemned ICE agents for wearing masks, failing to identify themselves, and not using body cameras — actions that starkly contrast with Chicago Police Department policy.

Charles said there is no timeline for the ICE-led operation in the Chicago area to end. As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people. Charles said 50% to 60% of those are targeted arrests, meaning they are people whom immigration enforcers are specifically trying to find.

He pushed back on criticism that ICE randomly targets people, saying agents weren't “going out to Home Depot parking lots” to make indiscriminate arrests.

Charles said ICE has brought in more than 200 officers from around the country for the operation.

He said that for too long, cities such as Chicago that limited cooperation with ICE had allowed immigrants, especially those with criminal records, to remain in the country illegally. It was time to act, he said.

“It was time to hit Chicago.”

Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, respectively, who were freed on Friday, were pictured smiling and looking to be in good health as they arrived at Heathrow Airport.

The couple walked out of the arrivals area accompanied by their daughter and British special representative to Afghanistan Richard Lindsay.

The couple had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and ran an education and training organization in the country’s central province of Bamiyan, choosing to remain in the country after the Taliban seized power.

They had been held for nearly eight months following their arrest as they traveled to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan, in February. They had been held in a maximum security prison, and faced long periods of separation.

Their plight underlined the concerns of the West over the actions of the Taliban since they overthrew the country’s US-backed government in a 2021 lightning offensive.

Analysts say the move by the Taliban, which was facilitated by Qatar, could be part of a broader effort to gain international recognition.

Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalize relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist.

It remains unclear what, if anything, the Taliban had been promised for the Reynolds’ release. However, Afghanistan’s list of needs is long.

The Western aid money that flowed into it after the 2001 US-led invasion has been severely cut as needs continue to mount, particularly after a magnitude 6 quake on Aug. 31. Its economy remains on shaky ground.

But Western nations remain hesitant to provide money to the Taliban government, citing their restrictions on women and personal freedoms.

‘Bewildered’ with arrest

After their return, Peter Reynolds told The Times that the and his wife had “begun to think that we would never be released, or that we were even being held until we were executed.”

“We are bewildered as to why any of this happened and are very happy that this ordeal is over,” he said.

Barbie said the toughest thing about the affair was “seeing my 80-year-old husband struggling to get into the back of a police truck with his hands and ankles chained.”

Their family has spoken of their “immense joy” on hearing that the Reynolds were released, and there were emotional scenes when they arrived in Doha on a flight from Kabul to be met by their daughter.

“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy and international cooperation,” their four children said in a joint statement on Friday.

“While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”

Qatar played a key role in helping to free the couple after mounting fears about their health.

During their arrest last February, the couple were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, UN experts have said.

The couple married in Kabul in 1970 and have spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programs for women and children. They also became Afghan citizens.

The Taliban authorities have not explained why the pair were detained.

‘We are Afghan citizens’

Speaking at Kabul airport on Friday before they left, Barbie Reynolds said the couple had been treated well.

“We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,” she added.

Their son, Jonathan, echoed to the BBC that his parents were hoping to return to the country they love.

“They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they’ve been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact,” he said.

In July, independent UN human rights experts called on the Taliban government to free the couple, warning that they risked “irreparable harm or even death” as their health deteriorated.

Their family had made repeated pleas for their release, citing their failing health.

Taliban foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on Friday the couple “had violated the laws of Afghanistan” and were released from custody “following the judicial process.”

Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the “long-awaited news will come as a huge relief” to the family.

The British government advises against traveling to Afghanistan, warning that its ability to offer consular assistance is “extremely limited.”

Russia is the only country to have officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed a strict version of Islamic law and been accused of sweeping rights violations.

Dozens of foreign nationals have been arrested since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US-led NATO forces.

WASHINGTON: At one of his final rallies before the 2024 election, then-candidate Donald Trump warned that Black Americans were losing their jobs in droves and that things would get even worse if he did not return to the White House.

“You should demand that they give you the numbers of how many Black people are going to lose their job,” Trump said. “The African American population, they’re getting fired at numbers that we have never seen before.”

But with Trump back in office since January, an already fragile financial situation for Black Americans has worsened. Upset by inflation and affordability issues, Black voters had shifted modestly toward the Republican last year on the promise that he could boost the economy by stopping border crossings and challenging foreign factories with tariffs. Yet a recent spate of economic data instead shows a widening racial wealth gap.

Black unemployment has climbed from 6.2 percent to 7.5 percent so far in 2025, the highest level since October 2021. Black homeownership has fallen to the lowest level since 2021, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. Earlier this month, the Census Bureau said the median Black household income fell 3.3 percent last year to $56,020, which is roughly $36,000 less than what a white household earns and evidence of a bad situation becoming worse.

That creates a major political risk for the president as well as an economic danger for the nation because job losses for Black Americans have historically foreshadowed a wider set of layoffs across other groups.

“Black Americans are often the canary in the coal mine,” said Angela Hanks, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Labor Department who is now at The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank.

The Trump White House stressed that some of these downward trends, such as a relative decline in Black wealth, began under Democratic President Joe Biden. It emphasized that the “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies pushed by Democrats failed to deliver economic gains.

“Despite his lunatic obsession with DEI, Joe Biden’s disastrous economic agenda reduced the Black share of household wealth by nearly 25 percent,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “His inflationary policies caused interest rate hikes that froze Americans out of homeownership, and his open borders policies flooded the country with tens of millions of illegals who drove down wages.”

Some Black voters see Trump’s policies as doing more to hurt than help

Some Black voters who stayed on the sidelines in 2024 feel they need to be more engaged politically.

Josh Garrett, a 30-year-old salesperson in Florida, said he could not find a candidate last year with whom he agreed. He is frustrated by Trump’s layoffs of federal workers and sees a government more geared toward billionaires than the middle class.

“I don’t understand how you could be for the American people and have Americans lose their jobs when they have families, have bills,” Garrett said.

While the financial outlook for Black Americans is deteriorating, the net worth of white households is largely holding steady or increasing, largely due to stock market performance.

Hanks notes that the “chaotic effects” of Trump’s tariffs and spending cuts are hitting more vulnerable populations right now but that the damage could soon spread beyond.

Black leaders see Trump’s policies as discriminatory based on race

The federal layoffs appear to have disproportionately hit Black Americans because they make up a meaningful share of the government workforce. The administration maintains that its income tax cuts, tariffs and deportations of immigrants who are in the United States illegally will help Black Americans, but there is little evidence so far in the data of that.

At the same time, Trump has said that he would like to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New Orleans, Baltimore and Memphis, Tennessee — cities led by Black mayors. The president has called for redrawing congressional districts to favor Republicans, which could dilute the ability of Black voters to shape elections. He has sought to diminish the legacy of slavery and segregation from the Smithsonian museums.

“The message that they are sending is very clear: In these places, these people are incapable of governing themselves,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said. “They are incapable of helping to solve their own issues. And make no mistake about it, it’s partly due to how we look.”

The Democrat warned that the mounting economic challenges could contribute to crime in the future, reversing progress that cities have made in recent years to lower homicide rates.

Trump might not be able to afford alienating Black voters

Black Americans are the dominant core of the Democratic base, though Trump has improved his standing with them. In 2024, Trump won 16 percent of Black voters, doubling his 2020 share, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate. One of the key differences appeared to be frustration over inflation and affordability.

Roughly one-third of Black voters (36 percent) in the 2024 presidential election said the economy and jobs was the most important issue facing the country, up from 11 percent in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic was the top issue.

In a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about half of Black adults (52 percent) said the amount of money they get paid was a “major” source of stress in their life right now, slightly higher than for US adults overall (43 percent) and significantly higher than for white adults (37 percent).

When it comes to incomes, some associated with the conservative movement suggest that Black households are more vulnerable because fewer of them are in married families, which generally tend to have higher incomes.

Delano Squires, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the “connection between family structure and financial stability is one that is fairly consistent across time.”

The immediate political reality is that Trump had a mandate to improve the economy for the middle class, including Black voters. But many of those voters now see an administration more focused on deporting immigrants and expanding its own grip on power, possibly threatening Republicans’ chances of holding onto the House and key Senate seats in next year’s elections.

“We’re in a new era,” said Alexsis Rodgers, political director at the Black to the Future Action Fund. “There are people who obviously believed his promises, that Trump was going to do something about the cost of eggs, the cost of housing. They’ve seen the focus instead is on ICE raids and downsizing the government.”

WASHINGTON: A month after an Alaskan summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump still seems surprised that his gambit did not pay off with peace in Ukraine.

“He’s let me down,” Trump said this week. “He really let me down.”

There has been no more progress in the Middle East, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is beginning a new offensive in Gaza City and lashing out across the region.

“They have to be very, very careful,” Trump said after Israel targeted Hamas inside Qatar, a US ally that has been hosting diplomatic negotiations.

Trump’s disappointment and frustration is much different from the confidence and dominance he tries to project on the international stage, especially as he trumpets his diplomatic efforts and campaigns for the Nobel Peace Prize. Asked about his goals for the upcoming UN General Assembly, the president said “world peace.” But the most high-profile conflicts appear to be escalating instead of winding down.

“This whole last nine months of peace efforts was just a merry-go-round,” said Max Bergmann, a State Department official under Democratic President Barack Obama who now works at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Bold gestures, but reaching peace deals is hard

Although Trump prizes bold gestures — a stealth bomber strike in Iran, a sweeping tariff announcement — solving a global jigsaw puzzle is a far bigger struggle.

The fundamental truth, Bergmann said, is “trying to reach peace agreements is very hard,” and that Trump has not surrounded himself with experienced diplomats and foreign policy experts.

“It’s like if you were to tell me, ‘Go do a hotel deal,’” Bergmann said. “It would be a terrible deal. I would lose a lot of money.”

In Trump’s defense, the White House has pointed to comments from European leaders who have praised his efforts working to forge peace agreements. Trump often notes that he hires “only the best people.”

Matt Kroenig, a senior policy adviser at the Pentagon during Trump’s first term, said the president’s brashness can get results, such as when he demanded increased defense spending from European allies.

Trump, however, can end up spinning his wheels on more challenging issues and eventually give up, such as when he tried to persuade Kim Jong Un to end North Korea’s nuclear program.

When it comes to making peace in Ukraine and Gaza, Kroenig wondered, “At what point does he say, ‘This is too hard, let’s move on to other issues.’”

Foreign policy is usually a team sport for presidential administrations, requiring extensive coordination among agencies through the National Security Council. But Trump has dramatically slashed the council’s staff, and Marco Rubio serves as both secretary of state and national security adviser.

“It’s one person setting the strategy and everyone else is waiting to see,” Kroenig said.

Mideast is increasingly in turmoil

In the Middle East, Trump is getting caught in the middle of an increasingly combustible situation. He has visited Arab nations, including Qatar, this year to strengthen ties, and he has backed Israel’s military operations in Gaza and Iran.

But now Israel, emboldened by its battlefield success, is striking more widely throughout the region, including the recent attack targeting Hamas officials in Qatar. That jeopardized negotiations that the United States has been trying to push along and rattled Arab leaders’ faith in Trump’s ability to influence, let alone rein in, Netanyahu.

Some of them now view Israel, not Iran, as their primary security threat, according to three Arab diplomats familiar with conversations at the last summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Doha. It’s a noticeable shift after Israel and Arab nations grew closer during Trump’s first term, when the Republican president championed the Abraham Accords. The diplomats were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

US officials have tried to assuage doubts by pointing to Trump’s expressions of displeasure with Netanyahu’s latest moves, to recent meetings held with Qatar’s prime minister and to discussions of enhanced security arrangements.

During next week’s annual high-level gathering at the General Assembly, Rubio and Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff can expect to hear a chorus of criticism, with Arab nations seeking a more fundamental shift in how the US approaches the region.

For example, the US has tried to ensure that Israel has a military edge over its Arab neighbors. But now that Israel has attacked Qatar with US-supplied weapons — a strike that Qatar was unable to counter with its own US-supplied defenses — Arab diplomats are considering demanding stronger support.

Such a move would likely be politically untenable, at least for now, with support for Israel strong among Republicans who control Congress.

Trump’s equivocal approach to Putin

In Europe, Trump has frustrated his critics with his equivocal approach to Putin, sometimes suggesting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is just as responsible for the war that Moscow started with its 2022 invasion.

Trump recently insisted that his meeting with Putin “accomplished a lot,” but “it takes two to tango.”

“You know those are two people, Zelensky and Putin, that hate each other,” he said.

Fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over have been heightened by recent Russian military incursions into the airspace of NATO members Poland and Estonia. After three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian airspace on Friday, Trump said it could signal “big trouble.”

During a news conference in the United Kingdom on his state visit, Trump said he was dedicated to stopping the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Then he turned philosophical.

“You never know in war. You know, war is a different thing,” he said. “Things happen that are very opposite of what you thought.”

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump calls him a “communist.” His critics say he wants to defund the police. Zohran Mamdani insists he’s just a guy trying to make New York City more affordable.

Mamdani ‘s meteoritic rise to become the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor has put his past and present policy positions under close scrutiny. If elected, he would be the city’s first Muslim and Indian American mayor. He’d be the city’s most liberal mayor in generations.

But as he tries to broaden his support ahead of the November election, the state lawmaker has shifted more to the center on certain issues — while distancing himself from other potentially damaging political stances.

Mamdani’s opponents — two Democrats, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, and a Republican, Curtis Sliwa — have cast themselves as moderate alternatives to the 33-year-old.

Some top New York Democrats, including US Sen. Chuck Schumer, have been slow to endorse Mamdani. A few, including the state Democratic Party chair and some suburban members of Congress, have said they won’t back him. But more notable names have thrown their weight behind him in recent days, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s top two legislative leaders.

Here’s where he actually stands:

He’s a democratic socialist, not a communist

While Trump and other opponents keep calling Mamdani a communist, he identifies as something different: a democratic socialist. He believes government should play a role in reducing economic disparity, but he doesn’t advocate for a communist system where property is collectively owned.

Mamdani does favor raising taxes on the wealthy to fund proposals he argues would make the city more affordable. That includes free bus service, universal child care, and his signature issue: a freeze on rent increases for the city’s 1 million rent-regulated apartments. Opponents say a rent freeze would harm landlords, who have also been hit hard by inflation.

Perhaps nowhere has the “communist” label come up more than in relation to Mamdani’s proposal to set up a pilot program for city-run grocery stores. Billionaire John Catsimatidis, who owns grocery chains Gristedes and D’Agostino Supermarkets, said the program would “drag us down a path toward the bread lines of the old Soviet Union.”

In an interview with The Bulwark, Mamdani framed his proposal for five stores that would sell products at wholesale prices as a modest experiment. He said if it doesn’t work, “C’est la vie, then the idea was wrong.”

He has also faced criticism over comments he made on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” in which he said that in an economically just world, “I don’t think that we should have billionaires.” But Mamdani said that as mayor, he would be happy to work with billionaires to solve the city’s problems.

He no longer supports defunding the police

After the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in 2020, Mamdani was among a number of New York Democrats who advocated slashing the police department’s budget, and who frequently railed against police brutality.

In one social media post, Mamdani called the department “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” In another, Mamdani wrote, “Defund this rogue agency” on a post sharing video of NYPD pummeling a man who had argued with a police officer.

During his mayoral campaign, Mamdani has distanced himself from these prior calls to reduce department funding, saying they don’t represent his current agenda. Mamdani said he would maintain the NYPD’s staffing levels but also create a new “Department of Community Safety” that would deploy mental health care teams, rather than armed officers, to handle certain emergency calls involving people in psychiatric crisis.

And he has softened his overall rhetoric around law enforcement. In a recent New York Times interview, he answered “yes” when asked if he owed officers an apology for calling the department racist, saying his 2020 comments were made “at the height of frustration.”

Mamdani’s opponents have been skeptical of his shift. Adams, a former police captain, says Mamdani changed his position on law enforcement because voters wouldn’t support defunding the department. Cuomo has said Mamdani is flip-flopping and hasn’t given voters a clear picture of who he really is.

He’s criticized Israel and defended Palestinian civil rights

Mamdani is a vocal defender of Palestinian civil rights and has accused the Israeli government of committing a genocide in Gaza.

He supports an economic boycott of Israel and has promised that if Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited New York City he would honor a warrant from the International Criminal Court and have Netanyahu arrested for war crimes. The US is not a member of the court and Israel denies it is engaging in genocide or war crimes.

Mamdani has repeatedly condemned the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, calling the militant group’s slaughter of 1,200 “deplorable.” He has also said he believes Israel has a right to exist, though without a hierarchy that favors Jewish citizens over others.

That hasn’t assuaged critics who characterize such condemnations of Israeli policy as antisemitic.

Before the primary, Mamdani was asked whether he would disavow the phrase “globalize the intifada,” a slogan some see as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. At the time, Mamdani described it as reflecting “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.”

But Mamdani — who has not employed the phrase during his campaign — now says he would discourage others from using the slogan.

Is he connected to DSA

Mamdani is a member of the New York City and national chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, an activist group that advocates for a universal health care system, immigrants’ rights, tuition-free higher education, nationwide rent regulation, a 32-hour workweek, and getting rid of mandatory jail time for some types of crimes, among other issues.

Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa have all heaped scorn on Mamdani for his association with the group. Mamdani says he is running on his own, distinct platform — not DSA’s — and that being part of a group doesn’t mean you agree with all of its goals.

Asked by reporters about his previous support for decriminalizing prostitution, Mamdani didn’t give a direct answer but said: “What I want to do is look at the ways in which the previous administration addressed this issue,” referring to former Mayor Bill de Blasio, under whom arrests for related charges decreased.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/09/20/4641600-155659464.jpg?itok=ucgzMLXI,N,,2025-09-21 12:00:00.253205

Immigration specialists say Indian nationals, who represent the largest share of H1B visa holders, would be most severely affected.
“Section 212(f) of INA allows suspending entry, but it does not authorise a $100,000 charge or rewriting USCIS and DOS fee schedules by executive proclamation alone.
This fee is unlawful on its face and appears... calibrated to deliver a chilling effect on employers, and campuses,” Sharma stated.
The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) also condemned the executive order, calling it a dangerous overreach.","Legal experts are predicting a tsunami of urgent lawsuits seeking to block the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee from coming into effect. Central to the legal debate will be whether the US president has the authority under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which permits the suspension of entry for non-citizens, to impose such a significant financial condition.

The fee hike, introduced via an executive order by President Trump on 20 September and slated to come into effect 21 September, raises the H1B visa cost from around $1,000 to $100,000, a hundredfold — a move that has sparked alarm across the technology sector.

Immigration specialists say Indian nationals, who represent the largest share of H1B visa holders, would be most severely affected.

“The President relies on INA 212(f), which allows suspending entry of noncitizens. In Trump v. Hawaii (2018), the Supreme Court upheld a broad travel ban. But that was an outright ban, not a financial condition,” said Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney and founder of Protego Law Group, while speaking to the Economic Times.

“Conditioning entry on a six-figure payment looks more like taxation, which only Congress can impose. Further, Congress has already set the H1B fee structure. A presidential proclamation cannot override that with a new payment scheme,” the lawyer added.

Tripathi explained that although the executive proclamation itself may not fall under the scope of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the government agencies responsible for its enforcement do.

“Section 212(f) of INA allows suspending entry, but it does not authorise a $100,000 charge or rewriting USCIS and DOS fee schedules by executive proclamation alone. This fee is unlawful on its face and appears... calibrated to deliver a chilling effect on employers, and campuses,” Sharma stated.

‘Political posturing’

Meanwhile, Doug Rand, a former official at the department of homeland security, dismissed the move as political posturing.

“This isn’t real policy — it’s fan service for immigration restrictionists. Trump gets his headlines and inflicts a jolt of panic, and doesn’t care whether this survives first contact with the courts,” Rand said.

Brad Thomson, a spokesperson for the National Lawyers Guild, confirmed that 10 protesters were arrested, but he could not say whether any of them had been charged.

Protesters were arrested during Friday’s demonstration after they clashed with federal immigration agents who fired pepper balls and launched tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

“Our legal observers witnessed federal agents using indiscriminate violence against demonstrators,” Thomson said. “Numerous people suffered physical injuries, including people who required treatment at the hospital.”

ICE did not respond to a request for information on the arrests.

Representatives of the National Lawyers Guild attended Friday’s protest to offer legal support to demonstrators in need of representation.

The protest began about 6 a.m. and the crowd was quickly met with a strong show of force by ICE and officers with Customs and Border Patrol until the crowd dispersed about 10 p.m.

People gathered outside the facility to protest the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” and the treatment of detainees inside the facility.

A small group of protesters gathered outside the facility Saturday afternoon to continue showing their support for immigrants. As night fell, the crowd had grown to about 40 people, protesting under light rain.

There was little visible presence of ICE officers. As some officers went in and out of the facility, demonstrators jeered and shouted expletives at them. Some vehicles carried detainees.

Protesters who got too close to the facility’s gated parking lot were asked to step back by agents inside. Other protesters engaged with a counter-protester in front of the facility waving an American flag and chanting “USA.”

One woman, who asked not to be named out of the fear for her safety, showed up to the facility Saturday for her first time wanting to help after she witnessed ICE arrest a man Monday in Belmont Cragin.

She left the ICE detention facility later in the evening after having helped secure the release of a detainee.

Shortly after she arrived, she noticed a man on the phone with the family of his co-worker, who was detained inside. He was holding paperwork and struggling to gain ICE officers’ attention, hoping to show them the documentation proving his co-worker was a U.S. citizen.

The woman took the documentation and repeatedly pleaded with ICE officers each time they opened the facility’s gate to allow vehicles through. Eventually, she caught the attention of one officer who took the paperwork and gave the woman a number to call within a few hours.

Several hours later, she was informed that ICE was releasing the man based on the information provided, and he left the facility shortly thereafter with his co-worker.

Naval Station Great Lakes

Nearly 200 protesters also gathered Saturday near the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago, which is being used as a staging area for federal agents as the Trump administration ramps up immigration arrests and threatens to send the National Guard to the city. Demonstrators held signs reading “Welcome the stranger” and “ICE out” and speakers spoke on behalf of immigrants in the Chicago area and across the country.

Democrats are pushing to preserve health care programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

Democrats are working to protect health care programs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — As a possible federal shutdown looms, the Democratic leaders of Congress are demanding a meeting with President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to what they call “your decision” to shutter government offices if no action is taken by the end-of-the month deadline.

Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Donald Trump's insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve health care programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

""We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,"" the two New York Democrats wrote.

“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they said. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.”

Trump, in an exchange with reporters on Saturday evening, suggested that he remains open to a potential meeting but was dismissive of the Democratic leadership.

“I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” he said.

Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.

The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted health care funds also failed.

It all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expires. Trump's first term in office saw a monthlong shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-2019.

Trump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in a closure.

Republicans have insisted they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, turning it back on Democrats.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.

While the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold that means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.

Democrats are working to protect health care programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax break and spending cut bill enacted earlier this year.

Republicans have said the Democrats' demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.

Another prohibits federal officers from entering a school without a judicial warrant and blocks schools from sharing students’ personal information.
One law requires federal agents, who may not be wearing official uniforms, to display some form of badge or identification.
Another, set to take effect in January, bans local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed five bills Saturday designed to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies, a package of legislation he described as a defense of the state’s values of diversity and inclusion.

“There’s a word you’ve never heard uttered from the President of the United States’ lips, certainly not Stephen Miller,” Newsom said during the signing ceremony in downtown Los Angeles. “That’s pluralism. We practice pluralism. It’s a deep point of pride. Those values are under assault.”

According to Newsom’s office, the bills were drafted in response to federal immigration crackdowns launched after President Trump took office and were accelerated after the administration backed aggressive ICE operations.

Several of the new laws focus on public schools. One requires staff to notify students and parents when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are confirmed to be on campus. Another prohibits federal officers from entering a school without a judicial warrant and blocks schools from sharing students’ personal information.

Other measures extend protections beyond schools. One law requires federal agents, who may not be wearing official uniforms, to display some form of badge or identification. Another, set to take effect in January, bans local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the legislative package a necessary safeguard. “All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from our own federal government,” Bass said at the event.

Federal officials immediately pushed back. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement that “the State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” adding, “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress. I’ve directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations. Our agents will continue to protect their identities.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, echoed that criticism, saying in a separate statement that “sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers.”

The political fight is not limited to Washington. The Save America movement announced Saturday that it is launching mobile “Liberty” vans staffed with trained professionals to document and film ICE raids across California.

Supporters of the legislation framed the measures as a reaffirmation of California’s role as a counterweight to federal policy. “Because America’s promise of opportunity, dignity and justice must not be surrendered to fear and hate,” said California State Assemblymember Fabian Nuñez.

Most of the new laws take effect immediately, except for the mask ban, which will begin in January.

Gavin Newsom signed a package of legislation today that would restrict the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration.

Newsom signed five bills at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, alongside LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Mayor Karen Bass, County Supervisor Hilda Solis, Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance, state Sen. Lena Gonzalez, D-Long Beach, and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.

“We’re here in Los Angeles, the most diverse city in the most diverse state, California, in the world’s most diverse democracy. It is a point of pride. … At our best we don’t tolerate that diversity, at our best we celebrate that diversity,” Newsom said.

“…Our status is unique … it’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. And it’s under assault by this administration,” the governor continued.

“There’s a word that you’ve never heard uttered from the president of the United States’ lips, and certainly not (White House Deputy Chief of Staff) Stephen Miller, and that’s pluralism. We practice pluralism. It’s a deep point of pride. Those values are under assault, to a degree we could have never imagined.”

The bills include SB627, a ban on law enforcement agents wearing masks, SB805, a requirement that they visibly display identification, and a prohibition against bail fugitive recovery agents from using their position for immigration enforcement.

Two of the bills are specifically focused on public schools: SB98 requires K-12 schools and higher education institutions to notify parents, students and staff when immigration enforcement is confirmed on campus, and AB49 requires enforcement officers to obtain a valid judicial warrant and meet other requirements before entering a school or facility. It also prevents school officials from collecting immigration information and prohibits them from disclosing pupil or family information to immigration authorities without a warrant or court order.

Newsom also signed SB81, which restricts health-care facilities from sharing patient information or granting access to immigration enforcement.

Four of the bills go into effect immediately, while the masking law goes into effect in January.

“The fact that we need bills to protect people’s rights of privacy from information sharing, masking of federal agents — if they are federal agents — protecting kids so that they can come to school … all of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from our own federal government,” Bass said. “That is profound.”

“… But what I’m so proud of in our city is that and we have legislative resistance, we have resistance from local government and state government, and we have resistance on the streets,” the mayor added.

U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli pushed back on the mask ban.

“The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” he posted on X. “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress. I’ve directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations. Our agents will continue to protect their identities.”

Carvalho noted that the LAUSD has already taken steps to prepare for immigration enforcement affecting students, including sending students home with information packets with tips for dealing with questioning from federal agents and establishing “zones of protection” for safe passage to and from campuses.

“There are no sidewalks for immigrant children and sidewalks for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity to our school,” he said.

California Democrats have assailed the raids, which began in the Southland in June. They’ve accused agents of targeting people based on their race, and of detaining people without due process. They also say the raids have failed to live up to the administration’s promise to target those undocumented immigrants suspected of committing violent crimes.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security have released the alleged criminal histories of many of the detained immigrants.

And appearing on Friday night’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” in Los Angeles, White House border czar Tom Homan said even those in the United States illegally who don’t commit other crimes create a backlog in the immigration system, delaying the process for thousands who are waiting their turn to come here legally.

“Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” Homan said. “If you send a message that there’s no consequences and you want to reward illegal behavior, (it’s) not going to stop.”

“… If you want to be a part of the greatest nation on Earth, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it,” he continued. “The ones who are here illegally cheated the system. They moved themselves to the front of the line and they overwhelmed the immigration court system back nine, 10 years, which means that people who are really trying to come here the right way are sitting in the back of the bus.”

Asked for a comment on Saturday’s signing ceremony, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson sent the following reply to City News Service:

“Did Newscum explain why he issued a threat to (Homeland Security) Secretary Noem on the same weekend of Charlie Kirk’s funeral, who was just assassinated in a disgusting act of political violence? Was that post from Newscum or the deranged leftists running his account?”

A post issued on the X account of Newsom’s press office a few hours before Saturday’s ceremony read: “Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today. You’re welcome, America.”

That post drew the following response from Essayli:

“We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials. I’ve referred this matter to @SecretService and requested a full threat assessment.”

In response, Newsom’s office reposted that statement from Essayli alongside the following tweet from Trump posted on March 10, 2020, during that year’s Democratic presidential primaries: “Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!”",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/56bf5c94ec0b0a180596d9dee106369c-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 08:56:45.316396

Alarms are flashing on Capitol Hill after the Senate rejected a seven-week continuing resolution (CR) that passed the House on a largely party-line vote, leaving leaders on both sides of the aisle at a stalemate over how to avoid a shutdown.

“We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,” the Democratic leaders wrote in the letter.

Schumer and Jeffries pointedly criticized Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for adjourning the House and Senate for a week despite the failure to reach a funding deal.

“At your direction, Republican congressional leaders have repeatedly and publicly refused to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government open,” the lawmakers continued. “Notwithstanding the fact that the partisan Republican spending bill has been defeated, the GOP majorities in the House and Senate have skipped town abdicated their responsibility to fund the government.”

The Democratic leaders have demanded that Republicans address the expiration of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies before the end of October and to restore nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding that was cut under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.

“We will not support a dirty spending bill that continues the Republican assault on healthcare, which includes devastating Medicaid and Medicare cuts; skyrocketing premiums, co-pays, and deductibles; the refusal to extend the Affordable Crae Act tax credits; unprecedented attacks on medical research and the public health system; the suppression of vaccine availability; and the forced closure of hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health clinics nationwide,” they wrote.

The massive tax and spending bill did not make significant cuts to Medicare benefits, but Democrats argue the law will affect Medicare’s long-term solvency because it added an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt, putting more pressure on the federal government’s ability to pay out future benefits.

The law also narrows who is eligible for Medicare enrollment, limiting the criteria to include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants but excluding other lawfully present immigrants.

Schumer and Jeffries said Republicans would bear responsibility for a shutdown because they have refused to negotiate with Democrats.

“With the Sept. 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,” the added in the letter to Trump.

They argued that the president now has an “obligation to meet with us directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open.”

Trump on Friday sounded pessimistic about keeping the government open without interruption and suggested the Democratic demands are excessive.

“We’ll continue to talk to the Democrats, but I think you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time,” he told reporters. “And we’ll take care of the military. We’ll take care of Social Security. We’ll take care of the things we have to take care of.

“A lot of the things Democrats fight for … will not be able to be paid,” the president added. “So, we’ll watch and see how we do with that.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/schumerchuck_jeffrieshakeem_072225gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-21 05:57:26.707099

According to a report published by the nonprofit organization Physicians for Human Rights, thousands of immigrants have been placed in solitary confinement since the Biden administration took office in 2021, and in recent months the practice has multiplied, despite the risks to the mental health of detainees. It was also found that during the first three months of 2025, vulnerable individuals were held in isolation for periods of more than twice as long as when ICE first began publishing statistics: 38 consecutive days in early 2025 compared to 14 days in late 2021. The agency defines as “vulnerable” those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or elderly; who suffer from serious mental disorders or illnesses; who are at risk of harm due to their identity; or who are victims of sexual assault or abuse.

Solitary confinement is the practice of placing a person in a small cell without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day. ICE maintains that it does not use solitary confinement in its detention centers, but reports the number of people it keeps in “segregation.”

In detention centers, the agency avoids using the term “solitary confinement” and instead uses euphemisms such as “segregation,” “segregated housing,” or “Special Management Units.” The study says that immigrants locked in such cells had been placed in “administrative segregation.”

According to the report, in 14 months from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention centers across the country. Similarly, in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the monthly increase in the use of isolation was more than six times higher than at the end of the previous administration.

The report also cites a study that found that solitary confinement in immigration detention has grown at an “alarming rate,” with an unprecedented number of immigrants being held in isolation. It also suggests that, due to the recent increase in funding approved by Congress to expand immigration detention centers, the widespread and prolonged use of solitary confinement is likely to worsen.

The UN considers solitary confinement of 15 days or more to be torture. Dr. Katherine Peeler, co-author of the study, said in a statement: “During the final months of the Biden administration and amid the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants, ICE’s own records show that the agency has subjected people to these torturous conditions — which cause devastating physical and psychological health harms.” According to experts, prolonged isolation can cause paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression, all of which can lead to suicide.

The White House response

The government denies an increase in the use of isolation for migrants detained by ICE. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told McClatchy News in an email that ICE facilities have “the highest standards.” “They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.” Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote the same media outlet that “any allegation that ICE is ‘weaponizing’ solitary confinement against illegal aliens is DISGUSTING and FALSE.” “These types of smears peddled by the media are leading to a 1000 percent increase in assault against our brave law enforcement,” she said without offering evidence. “Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,” she added.

In another statement, McLaughlin assured that ICE prioritizes the safety of individuals in custody and that detainees are placed in disciplinary segregation ”only after they are found guilty by a disciplinary hearing panel.” She also said that any detainee scheduled for removal, release, or transfer will be placed in administrative isolation for 24 hours. ICE’s National Detention Standards state that “such isolation may be ordered for security reasons or for the orderly operation of the facility.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/R2OSMFU7VFAD3JF3ZCUP425YEI.jpg?auth=8449241a4ddde276b0d78227a414ed5967e99b0b6d89068d1e279279829c3c37&width=1200,N,,2025-09-21 02:56:52.350643

The Save America Movement is described as “a rapid-response and civic empowerment initiative to ensure the American people have a clear understanding of the actions and impact of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in our communities while providing support to impacted communities.”

Organizers plan to have trained camera crews and volunteers help capture ICE operations as they’re happening. The group unveiled three specially outfitted vans Saturday, dubbed Liberty Van One, Two, and Three, which will be staffed by trained volunteers, including lawyers, clergy, veterans and videographers.

“Los Angeles will always stand with families under threat,” Mayor Karen Bass said. “Angelenos are showing the country that when our communities are targeted, we respond with solidarity, with resources, and with an unbreakable commitment to justice.”

President Donald Trump, while campaigning, promised safety and security. He promised that changes to immigration policy would target criminals. His campaign, he said, was intended to rid the country of people he has called murderers, terrorists, drug dealers, animals -– “the worst they have in every country, all over the world.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan has said undocumented immigrants in the country illegally, even without criminal records, should be arrested. “It’s not OK to be in this country illegally,” he has said.

“There are millions of people standing in line, taking their tests, doing their background investigations, paying their fees to become part of the greatest nation on earth. They’re trying to do things the right way. They’re sitting in the back seat while millions of people under Joe Biden cheated the system,” Homan told Politico in July.

Critics, however, have called the government’s mass deportation campaign inhumane.

In the coming weeks, organizers will be recruiting and training volunteers to staff the Save America Movement vehicles, to be deployed in early October.

Ganjei.
A total of 179 people face charges of illegal entry, while another 154 individuals face charges of felony reentry after removal.

Ganjei.

A total of 179 people face charges of illegal entry, while another 154 individuals face charges of felony reentry after removal. Most have felony convictions for narcotics, violent crime, immigration crimes and more. An additional 21 people have been charged with human smuggling, while the remaining six have been charged with firearms offenses, assaults on federal officers and other immigration crimes.

One of those charged is Penitas resident Diego Masiel Torres, who allegedly impeded federal law enforcement during an Aug. 27 consensual worksite enforcement operation in Harlingen. Court documents allege Torres tried to pull an officer away from apprehending an illegal alien. If convicted, he faces up to eight years in federal prison.

“The Southern District of Texas is committed to fully enforcing our country’s immigration laws, and anyone who tries to stop a federal agent from carrying out this mission will be held accountable before a judge and jury,” said Ganjei. “So, the message is simple. Don’t end up on the wrong end of a federal indictment – keep your hands to yourself.”

Among those charged this week are Gonzalo Alvarado-Cortez and Enedino Nieves-Tomas, both Mexican nationals. According to court documents, authorities discovered Alvarado-Cortez near Edinburg after his March 2019 removal and Nieves-Tomas near Roma after his October 2023 removal. Both men have prior convictions for illegal reentry and face up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.

Charges also allege Jose Manuel Lopez-Hernandez and Marcos Joel Castro-Lopez, both Mexican nationals, were found near Alamo after removals in July 2024 and February 2012, respectively. Lopez-Hernandez has a prior conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, while Castro-Lopez has a prior conviction for aggravated sexual assault, according to court documents.

In Houston, Mexican national Manuel Albert Aragon-Hernandez, 39, was sentenced to 44 months in federal prison for illegally reentering the country. Aragon-Hernandez, who has multiple prior felony convictions including theft and drug possession, was first removed in 2010 and returned illegally three times. Authorities discovered him again during a traffic stop for speeding and found methamphetamine and marijuana in his vehicle. At sentencing, the court also heard evidence that he fired a weapon while intoxicated.

Also sentenced this week was Mexican national Fidel Ramirez-Mancilla, 39, who received 15 months for illegal reentry. He has a prior conviction for aggravated felony of assault with the intent to commit mayhem, rape, sodomy or oral copulation. He was removed from the United States in 2011, but authorities encountered him again May 19.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – Homeland Security Investigations, ICE – Enforcement and Removal Operations, Border Patrol, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces and Project Safe Neighborhood.

Under current leadership, public safety and a secure border are the top priorities for this district. Enhanced enforcement both at the border and in the interior of the district have yielded aliens engaged in unlawful activity or with serious criminal history, including human trafficking, sexual assault and violence against children.

,Litigation,2025-09-21 02:21:04+00:00,Raw Story,This shocking ruling put the racism of Trump's Supreme Court on public display - Raw Story,"Bill Blum, Common Dreams, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.rawstory.com/supreme-court-2674010499/,"Like most shadow docket rulings, the Perdomo order is bare-bones, comprising a single paragraph that fails to explain the court’s rationale for its decision.
According to Georgetown University law professor and shadow docket scholar Steve Vladeck, the first Trump administration sought emergency relief 41 times.
During its recently completed 2024-25 term, the court’s shadow docket exploded to more than 100 cases, fueled by the second Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab.
Not surprisingly given those extraordinary numbers, US immigration officers have prioritized immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area.
Far from being polite and respectful, Sotomayor continued, Operation At Large has sparked “panic and fear” across Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.","In what may be its most reactionary ruling since Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court decided on Sept. 8 to allow the Trump administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to resume overt racial profiling in immigration raids in Los Angeles. The raids, which began in June under the title of Operation At Large, have resulted in some 5,000 arrests.

The order was handed down in the case of Noem v. Perdomo on the court’s emergency, or “shadow,” docket, which consists of cases decided on an expedited basis — without comprehensive briefing and without oral arguments — outside of the normal “merits docket.” The order lifts a lower-court injunction that had barred the administration from detaining suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their ethnicity, language, geographic location, and occupations.

Like most shadow docket rulings, the Perdomo order is bare-bones, comprising a single paragraph that fails to explain the court’s rationale for its decision. Nonetheless, it sends a clear message: If you are Latino, you’d better start carrying your identification papers with you — and they had better be in order. Otherwise, you will be subject to detention, and you might just find yourself on a deportation flight to El Salvador, South Sudan, or Uganda.

The Perdomo litigation originated with a lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of immigration advocacy organizations and five individuals, including two US citizens who contend they were detained by ICE during Operation At Large in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

On July 11, Los Angeles District Court Judge Maame E. Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order against the administration, finding that a “mountain of evidence” supported the plaintiffs’ claims that “roving patrols” of masked federal agents were conducting indiscriminate and sometimes violent dragnet-style immigration raids of workplaces and communities.

The court’s quick overturning of Frimpong’s TRO comes as no surprise. Although the court has a long history of entertaining emergency appeals that bypass the normal appeals process — such as last-minute requests for stays of execution in death penalty cases — no president has relied on the shadow docket more than Donald Trump.

According to Georgetown University law professor and shadow docket scholar Steve Vladeck, the first Trump administration sought emergency relief 41 times. By comparison, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations filed a combined total of eight emergency relief requests over a 16-year period while the Biden administration filed 19 applications across four years.

During its recently completed 2024-25 term, the court’s shadow docket exploded to more than 100 cases, fueled by the second Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab.

In addition to Perdomo, the court has issued pro-Trump shadow docket orders permitting noncitizens to be deported to third-party countries with histories of egregious human rights violations; barring transgender people from serving in the military; withholding $65 million in teacher training grants to states that include diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in their operations and curriculums; and endorsing the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to Social Security Administration records, to cite just a few instances.

And while shadow docket decisions are technically “interim” in nature — operating to remand cases to the lower courts for additional proceedings and leaving space for a possible return to the Supreme Court — they have enduring practical consequences. Unless and until the Supreme Court takes up the Perdomo case again, ICE will be free to ramp up its roving masked raids in Los Angeles and other cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. There are no longer any safe zones.

Of the high court’s six Republican ideologues, only Brett Kavanaugh explained his reasoning in Perdomo.

In a poorly crafted opinion filled with misstatements of fact and law, Kavanaugh cited provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act and a 1975 Supreme Court case (United States v. Brignoni-Ponce) that authorize immigration agents to briefly detain and question individuals if they have a “reasonable suspicion” (less than probable cause but more than a hunch) that the person being questioned is an alien illegally in the country.

From there, however, Kavanaugh dropped the proverbial ball by remarking, without any citations to the trial court’s evidentiary record:

The Government estimates that at least 15 million people are in the United States illegally. Many millions illegally entered (or illegally overstayed) just in the last few years.

Illegal immigration is especially pronounced in the Los Angeles area, among other locales in the United States. About 10% of the people in the Los Angeles region are illegally in the United States — meaning about 2 million illegal immigrants out of a total population of 20 million.

Not surprisingly given those extraordinary numbers, US immigration officers have prioritized immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a US citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.

Given what he took for granted as the outsized illegal alien population in greater Los Angeles, Kavanaugh reasoned that it is “common sense” (his words, trust me) for ICE agents to detain any Latinos who fit the government’s criteria of suspicion based on their race, language, or employment in low wage jobs.

In a blistering 21-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by fellow Democrats Elena Kaga and Ketanji Brown Jackson, took Kavanaugh to school, instructing the former Yale frat boy that the reasonable suspicion standard requires:

“… an individualized suspicion that a particular citizen was engaged in a particular crime” beyond just a “demographic profile...”

The Fourth Amendment thus prohibits exactly what the Government is attempting to do here: seize individuals based solely on a set of facts that ‘describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent’ people… As the District Court correctly held, the four factors [the administration relies on] — apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, location, and type of work — are no more indicative of illegal presence in the country than of legal presence.

Sotomayor also educated Kavanaugh on the harsh on-the-ground realities of Operation At Large, noting several examples from the trial court record of violence and intimidation. In the LA suburb of Glendale, for instance:

…nearly a dozen masked agents with guns “jumped out of… cars” at a Home Depot, and began “chasing and tackl[ing] Latino day laborers without “identify[ing] themselves as ICE or police, ask[ing] questions, or say[ing] anything else… In downtown Los Angeles, agents “jumped out of a van, rushed up to [a tamale vendor], surrounded him, and handled him violently,” all “[w]ithout asking… any questions.

In still another Home Depot encounter drawn from the evidentiary record, masked agents wearing bulletproof vests got out of a car and tear-gassed a crowd that had gathered to witness a raid. Far from being polite and respectful, Sotomayor continued, Operation At Large has sparked “panic and fear” across Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area,” she observed, “have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

The Fourth Amendment, she reminded her Republican colleagues, “protects every individual’s constitutional right to be free from arbitrary interference by law officers.” Sadly, she concluded, after the Perdomo ruling, “that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little.”

As a Supreme Court justice constrained by the need for collegiality on the bench, Sotomayor stopped short of denouncing Kavanaugh and the court’s Republicans as enablers of racism.

Raoul initially responded to Lyons on Sept. 12, arguing that the federal government lacks the legal authority to demand state or local law enforcement to adhere to ICE detainers.

“Responding to an ICE detainer based on erroneous information could subject Illinois law enforcement agencies to liability for ICE’s mistakes,” Raoul’s letter read, the outlet reported.

“And unfortunately, the number of erroneous detentions by ICE continues to grow at an alarming pace.”

ICE has conducted large-scale enforcement operations in several major US cities, including the Big Apple, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as part of President Trump’s directive on illegal immigration.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday ripped each state’s defiance, warning that releasing murderers, rapists, and pedophiles onto the streets will put residents in danger.

“These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities – threatening the American people’s lives and wellbeing,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

“ICE detainers ask for something very simple: To notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are released from jail or prison, to ensure that they go into ICE custody before they are released back onto our streets.

“These sanctuary state politicians should do the right thing and side with law-abiding Americans over criminal illegal aliens.”

Demonstrators took their protest to the streets as local faith leaders, community groups and regular people demonstrated against increased immigration enforcement. Their target was Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, the base of operations for ICE agents.

""That we will not be silent, not only will we not be silent, we will not back down,"" said Rev. Dr. Beth Johnson with Unitarian Church of Hinsdale, Illinois.

The Saturday afternoon prayer march began with clergy gathering for a interfaith action nearby in North Chicago. The group is demanding President Donald Trump's federal immigration agents leave Illinois.

The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant the administration's emergency request to strip protections from Venezuelan migrants.","President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Venezuela on Saturday via Truth Social, demanding the country ""immediately accept"" what he described as prisoners and individuals from mental institutions who were allegedly sent to the United States.

Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Saturday for comment.

Why It Matters

This coordinated approach represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy.

Concurrently, the administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday for an emergency order to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants currently under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

The Justice Department's filing seeks to overturn a federal judge's ruling that blocked the administration's termination of these protections.

The outcome could determine the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans currently living in the U.S., while potentially establishing precedent for how the administration handles protected immigrant populations from other countries. The administration has already moved to end TPS protections for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who received protection during former President Joe Biden's administration.

What To Know

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that found the administration wrongly ended TPS for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold Chen's ruling while the case continues. In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary in 18-month increments. Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela's TPS"" status.

Trump's latest Truth Social post claimed that ""thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed"" by individuals he characterized as coming from Venezuelan prisons and mental institutions.

The president's post provided no specific evidence or data to support these claims about harm caused by Venezuelan migrants in the U.S.

However, states like Texas and Georgia have recently begun sharing data on illegal immigrant crime in their regions, showing non-citizens are committing crimes at a lower rate than their American-born counterparts.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social: ""We want Venezuela to immediately accept all of the prisoners, and people from mental institutions, which includes the Worst in the World Insane Asylums, that Venezuelan 'Leadership' has forced into the United States of America. Thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed, by these 'Monsters.' GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT NOW, OR THE PRICE YOU PAY WILL BE INCALCULABLE!""

Adelys Ferro, co-founder and executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told Newsweek on August 29: ""We, more than 8 million Venezuelans, just didn't leave the country just because it's fun, it's because we had no choice...Venezuelans with TPS are not a threat to the United States.""

What Happens Next?

The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant the administration's emergency request to strip protections from Venezuelan migrants.

Venezuelan leadership has yet to respond to Trump's demands.

What is Temporary Protected Status?
Temporary Protected Status is a program meant to assist those who come from countries deemed to be in crisis.
A federal court temporarily blocked Noem’s decision on the basis that it may have been racially biased and likely violated the law.","Trump administration officials asked the United States Supreme Court to pause federal Judge Edward Chen’s order stating that it broke the law by taking away temporary protections for Venezuelan immigrants. Chen, earlier this month, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not follow the law when she ended the immigrants’ Temporary Protected Status, calling the move “arbitrary and capricious.”

The Washington Post reported that the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to put a hold on a part of the order about Venezuelans as federal officials appeal the case. The administration said this would affect more than 300,000 people. While the case also touches on Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, that is going to expire within months so the DOJ did not ask about that section of the order.

In Chen’s ruling, he mentioned a May Supreme Court order that allowed federal officials to eliminate the temporary protections for the Venezuelans, the Post said. Chen wrote that order only concerned the “preliminary relief ordered by this Court in postponing agency action,” and that did not stop him from “from adjudicating the case on the merits.”

The Justice Department, meanwhile, argued in its petition to the Supreme Court Friday that Chen’s actions are an “example of the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

“So long as the district court’s order is in effect, the Secretary must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest,’” the Justice Department wrote.

What is Temporary Protected Status?

Temporary Protected Status is a program meant to assist those who come from countries deemed to be in crisis. The Homeland Security Secretary can designate a place for TPS over “conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately.”

After she became part of the Trump administration in January, Noem attempted to remove TPS protections for Venezuelans and Haitians, which were put in place by former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who served under the Biden administration.

A group called the National TPS Alliance and 11 individuals sued the federal government.

“And anyone who lays a hand on a law enforcement officer, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she continued.
“We are a majority-minority state, California.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Saturday signed a first of its kind bill banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing masks while conducting operations in the state of California.

Newsom said ICE agents would no longer be “hidden from accountability” arguing masks prevent “transparency” for citizens and hinder “oversight.”

“That’s Trump’s America but that’s not the America we’ve grown up in. And so we are pushing back,” the governor said during remarks at a local high school.

Newsom said many residents are living in fear as the Trump administration cracks down on communities of illegal immigrants. Twenty-seven percent of Californians are foreign-born.

An increased presence of federal immigration officers has ramped up in the city of Los Angeles where protests broke out against the Trump administration’s deportation policies earlier this year.

Hundreds of National Guard soldiers and Marines were deployed to the city in an effort to quell the explosive outbreak of demonstrations without Newsom’s approval.

Local residents caught in the crossfire of dueling leaders both in the state and from the White House in Washington.

After days of outrage over a series of sweeping ICE raids, authorities confirmed one individual died during a chaotic raid on a California farm.

The Department of Homeland Security said 5,000 illegal immigrants in Los Angeles were arrested from June to August.

“ LA rioters would not stop DHS or slow us down. Our law enforcement will continue to enforce the law,” Department of Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem said in a statement on the large number of arrests.

“And anyone who lays a hand on a law enforcement officer, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she continued.

Newsom said Saturday said the Trump administration’s immigration measures need to change to reflect the country’s ideals.

“We are a majority-minority state, California. At our best, we don’t tolerate that diversity. At our best, we celebrate that diversity. We’re a universal state…” the governor said.

“Our status is unique in the United States of America. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. And it’s under assault by this administration.”

Newsom’s office also took aim at Noem in its announcing of the legislation, which drew a backlash from the administration.

“Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today,” Newsom’s press office tweeted. “You’re welcome, America.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Redistricting_Mueller_AP_MarcioJoseSanchez.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-20 22:57:23.493676

However, the ACLU says Gemoets’ ruling incorrectly misstates that an immigration judge ordered Guevara’s deportation in 2012.
The Board of Immigration Appeals also denied Guevara’s demand to send the reopened removal proceeding back to the immigration judge to decide his green card application.","A federal judge held an emergency hearing over the deportation risk “at any moment” for Atlanta journalist Mario Guevara on Friday at the urging of his legal team from the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Georgia.

The ACLU asked US Magistrate Judge Benjamin Cheesbro for the emergency 4 p.m. hearing and a temporary restraining order after the Board of Immigration Appeals earlier on Friday reopened Guevara’s 13-year old removal case – improperly, the ACLU contends — so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can deport him to El Salvador.

The ACLU called on the judge to order Guevara’s release from ICE detention and ensure he is not deported. Magistrate Judge Benjamin Cheesbro has given ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and Attorney General Pam Bondi until Oct. 3 to respond to Guevara’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order.

“Mr. Guevara should not even be in immigration detention, but the government has kept him there for months because of his crucial reporting on law enforcement activity,” said one of his lawyers, ACLU senior staff attorney Scarlet Kim in a statement.

“The fact that he may now be put on a plane to El Salvador, a country he fled out of fear, at any moment, despite a clear path to becoming a permanent resident is despicable,” Kim added.

Guevara has been jailed at the Folkston ICE Processing Center since June 18, even though the Salvadoran national is authorized to work in the United States while his green card application is pending.

The emergency hearing was for the habeas petition that Guevara filed on Aug. 21 challenging his ongoing detention. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Georgia, accuses ICE of retaliatory detention to silence his reporting, violating his First Amendment rights. It demands his immediate release.

Guevara ended up in ICE custody on June 18, after Dekalb County police arrested him June 14 while livestreaming a “No Kings” protest for his Spanish-language news outlet MG News. Dekalb later dropped the misdemeanor obstruction charges. Even so, the DeKalb Sheriff’s Office handed him over to ICE.

A federal immigration judge granted Guevara bond on July 1, but the Department of Homeland Security appealed.

Board of Immigration Appeals reopens old case

In a surprise development, the Board of Immigration Appeals on Friday dismissed DHS’s appeal of the bond order, saying it was moot because the appeals board had just granted the government’s motion to reopen his removal case from over a decade ago.

According to the Sept. 20 ruling, authored by Appellate Immigration Judge Marcos Gemoets, there is an outstanding removal order against Guevara from the 2012 case, because an immigration judge at that time had ordered Guevara to be deported and the Board of Immigration Appeals had dismissed his appeal.

However, the ACLU says Gemoets’ ruling incorrectly misstates that an immigration judge ordered Guevara’s deportation in 2012. Rather, the judge granted Guevara voluntary departure – and the government subsequently administratively closed the removal case. Since then, it has allowed him to live and work in the United States for over a decade, while his green card application is pending.

The Board of Immigration Appeals also denied Guevara’s demand to send the reopened removal proceeding back to the immigration judge to decide his green card application. He is eligible for a green card through his son, a US citizen, according to the ACLU.",https://atlantaciviccircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1906.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 20:56:57.826070

The department said it is putting all three states on notice because the states have not cooperated with the requests, when ICE asked local jails and prisons to alert the agency if they are releasing an undocumented individuals so they can take them into custody.

DHS said detainer compliance is necessary to prevent undocumented criminals from re-entering communities.

CBS News Chicago obtained a letter sent by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to DHS, which said the federal government does not have the legal authority to force state or local law enforcement to comply with such detainer requests.

Senior Homeland Security officials told CBS News they will tap the Department of Justice to sue states and attempt to block federal funding.

""Based on our current Supreme Court precedent, the state of Illinois stands on a strong footing,"" Arthur Acevedo said.

Acevedo is with the University of Illinois-Chicago Law School, and said the Constitution's 10th Amendment protects Illinois' policies like the Trust Act, which prohibits local cooperation on things like ICE detainers.

""It cannot order state officials or state officers to pursue or enact a federal program. So basically, whenever the federal government wants to do something, they need to put in their own staff,"" Acevedo said.

When it comes to the threat of blocking federal funding, Acevedo said the Trump Administration is facing an uphill battle. While he said legal precedent may favor states like Illinois in preventing federal funding from being cut, he expects the administration to test the limits of its power.

""The Trump administration has been successful in the eight months that they've been in office in getting the Supreme Court to at least to agree with them on an emergency basis. We still have to understand if they will prevail when the Supreme Court does a full review on the merits,"" Acevedo said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began wearing balaclavas and neck gaiters this year, in what might have been the first example of American law enforcement officers wearing masks.
California’s measure would bar law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, such as ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters, that shield their identities.
Federal agents in April tried to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools, saying they wanted to conduct welfare checks on students they said were undocumented.
Another bill bars immigration agents from entering hospitals without a warrant.","Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed legislation on Saturday that would prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state, a direct response to President Trump’s deportation crackdown in the Los Angeles region.

The new law is believed to be the first such ban in the nation, though it is likely to be challenged in court before it can go into effect in January because it is unclear whether California can enforce such restrictions on federal law enforcement. The bill also applies to local law enforcement.

In recent months, videos have spread across social media showing masked and armed immigration agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California, drawing protests and criticism in the state.

Democratic leaders and immigration activists have suggested that agents have acted with impunity, knowing that their identities were cloaked and that it would be harder to hold them accountable.

“The impact of these policies all across this city, our state and nation are terrifying. It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie — unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,” Mr. Newsom said at a signing event on Saturday afternoon at a Los Angeles high school. “This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we’ve allowed to happen in this country.”

It is extremely rare for police officers to wear masks in democratic nations. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began wearing balaclavas and neck gaiters this year, in what might have been the first example of American law enforcement officers wearing masks.

Before this year, state and local leaders had been passing more laws moving in the direction of greater transparency, such as requiring officers to wear body cameras at all times to record footage that could be used in court and seen by the public.

But this week, Department of Homeland Security officials urged Mr. Newsom to veto the bill, which they said would increase harassment and assaults on officers.

“Comparing them to ‘secret police’ — likening them to the Gestapo — is despicable,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. “Once again, sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers.”

California’s law was opposed by numerous law enforcement agencies, who argued that officers must have the choice to cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retaliation. Limiting the ways officers can keep themselves safe will make it harder to recruit people to work in law enforcement, they said.

But a number of Democratic-led states have proposed restricting masking by immigration agents. Lawmakers have introduced such bills in New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, among other states, though California is believed to be the only state where such a law has been passed and signed.

California’s measure would bar law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, such as ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters, that shield their identities. It does not apply to medical masks, clear plastic face shields, respirators, eye protection or other safety devices.

Any violation of the law would be a misdemeanor.

Legal experts agreed that California can require local officers to unmask on the job. But it’s a trickier question when it comes to federal agents operating in the state.

A state can’t directly regulate the federal government, but it can require that federal agents follow general state laws, such as requiring officers to follow speed limits or abide by stop signs, as long as doing so does not interfere with their ability to do their job.

Aya Gruber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California, said that the mask law was likely to be immediately challenged along jurisdictional lines, and that the federal government would most likely seek an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect.

“It will definitely be challenged — 100 percent,” Ms. Gruber said, adding that she expected it to eventually be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. “I don’t foresee this particular iteration of the Supreme Court taking the state’s side on this one, so this may be more of a symbolic piece of legislation.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, wrote a letter last week that urged Mr. Newsom to sign the legislation, which Mr. Chemerinsky said he believed was constitutional because it does not limit the federal government’s authority to perform its duties. Mr. Chemerinsky, a well-known constitutional scholar, said that even if a federal challenge was forthcoming, the state needed to make a forceful declaration against what he said was a practice intended to “terrorize” people.

“It’s important that the state take a stand,” Mr. Chemerinsky said in an interview. “It’s obviously not a slam dunk because there are arguments on both sides, but that’s often the case with the law.”

Brian R. Marvel, the president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, which represents over 87,000 public safety officers, said he was outraged by the passage of the law.

He said in a statement that he believed that California did not have the authority to regulate federal agents, so it would ultimately apply only to local law enforcement officers, which he called a “troubling betrayal that California’s local law enforcement community will not soon forget.” He said that limiting face coverings and opening officers up to prosecution would most likely hurt recruitment and drive officers from the state.

“This bill makes local officers collateral damage. It is a political stunt by all parties involved, plain and simple,” he said. “This bill will have a chilling effect on our profession.”

Mr. Newsom on Saturday signed four other bills aimed at restricting ICE activity in California.

One bill prevents immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant. Another requires schools and higher education institutions to notify parents when immigration enforcement is on campus.

Federal agents in April tried to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools, saying they wanted to conduct welfare checks on students they said were undocumented. The Los Angeles Unified School District did not allow the agents to enter, and school officials were outraged that students could be vulnerable to raids.

Another bill bars immigration agents from entering hospitals without a warrant. Undocumented immigrants are allowed to receive emergency care at hospitals under federal law, and California leaders fear that the threat of enforcement may deter people from seeking medical attention.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/20/multimedia/20nat-ice-bills-hfo-vpgf/20nat-ice-bills-hfo-vpgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 18:57:11.326355

THE United States, a country regarded by countless people as the “land of dreams”, has long prided itself on the ideals of freedom and equality.

However, the reality is far more complex and brutal than these slogans.

This self-proclaimed “nation of immigrants” with “E Pluribus Unum” inscribed on its national emblem is showing an unfriendly attitude towards immigrants.

Xenophobic sentiment at government and social levels, and deep-rooted racial discrimination, are constantly tearing apart the so-called “myth of American human rights”.

In 2022, Irina Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian woman, fled the war and travelled to the US in search of peace and safety.

However, last month, she was fatally stabbed three times in the back by an unknown homeless man in North Carolina.

Surveillance footage showed Irina clutching her throat in horror and crying for help from the surrounding passengers, but no one came to her aid.

The incident sent shocking waves to Ukraine and once again put the safety issue of American society in the spotlight.

A refugee who fled the war ultimately died from random violence in a peaceful country, which is undoubtedly a great irony.

Many political leaders have lobbied for the death penalty for the murderer on social media.

However, the deep-seated problems behind this incident cannot be solved simply by severely punishing the murderer.

It exposes the fragility of public safety in the US, the spread of social indifference and the disregard for the value of immigrants’ lives.

When a country cannot guarantee the basic safety of a young woman seeking asylum, it is difficult for it to be regarded as a defender of human rights.

When social indifference becomes the norm and fear replaces empathy, the so-called “American Dream” becomes a carefully packaged illusion.

In recent years, US government policies towards immigrants have far exceeded the scope of what it has termed “strict management” and have evolved into systematic and institutionalised exclusion and punishment.

The zero-tolerance policy implemented by the US has led to the separation of a large number of immigrant families, becoming a humanitarian disaster widely condemned by the international community.

According to a United Nations report, the US is the country that detains the largest number of immigrant children in the world.

In 2019 alone, more than 5 500 children were forcibly separated from their parents and detained at centres with poor conditions.

These children lacked basic food, medical and hygiene guarantees, and their physical and mental health was reported to have been severely damaged.

Shockingly, the US is the only UN member state in the world that is not a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which also gives insights into its position on human rights protection.

Additionally, since January, the deportation of immigrants has not slowed down but has accelerated.

Thousands have been forcibly repatriated.

Many immigrants have been arrested, shackled and exposed to inhumane treatment.

Recently, over 450 South Korean immigrants experienced this before their deportation.

The inhumane law-enforcement approach not only violates the basic human rights of immigrants but tells the story of a government which regards immigrants as “threats” rather than “human beings”.

Xenophobic sentiment in American society not only exists at the policy level but is also now deeply rooted in public consciousness.

This sentiment is manifesting itself in the form of racism, with frequent discrimination and violent incidents targeting ethnic minorities such as Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans.

In recent years, hate crimes against Asians have increased sharply.

From the 91-year-old Asian man being maliciously pushed down in Chinatown to the killing of six Asian women in the Atlanta spa shootings in 2021.

Such incidents reveal the systemic hostility American society is cultivating towards ethnic minorities.

The hatred is not accidental, but the result of long-term racial prejudice and political incitement.

However, xenophobia is not alien in the US.

Since the first group of African slaves were brought to Virginia in 1619, the US has systematically implemented a system of racial slavery for more than two centuries.

Millions of people were traded as commodities and driven like livestock.

Their flesh, blood and lives laid the foundation for the country’s early economy, yet received no humane treatment.

From the Chinese Exclusion Act in the 19th century to the immigration quota system in the 20th century, the exclusion of “the other” can be traced as part of American politics and society.

In 2017, the first Donald Trump administration signed what became known as the “Muslim Ban”. The ban prohibited citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US and even suspended the refugee resettlement program.

From slums of Lagos, Nigeria, refugee camps of Nairobi, Kenya, and in the villages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where war is yet to end, many young people once regarded the US as a land of hope to escape poverty and war.

Many have grown up listening to the propaganda of the “free world” and have dreamt setting foot on that land one day to create a new life with their own hands.

However, when Irina’s tragedy was reported globally, many Africans fell silent: if a white, educated woman from a European war-torn area could not be guaranteed safety, what would they, with darker skin, encounter there?

These foreign populations engage in high-intensity, low-security jobs in construction, agriculture and the service industry.

They pay taxes but find it difficult to enjoy the same social welfare.

They become political bargaining chips in politicians’ campaigns and victims of policy swings. When there is a labour shortage, they are “indispensable contributors”; when there is an economic crisis, they become “burdens to be deported”.

From family separations at the border to hate crimes in cities, from law-enforcement violence to political exclusion, and then to tragedies like Irina’s, immigrants and ethnic minorities in the US will always struggle to obtain real safety and dignity.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Trump’s insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve healthcare programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

The New York Democrats’ remarks come after the House passed a spending bill Friday to avoid a shutdown but the Senate remained stalemated.

“We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote.

“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they continued. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.”

A Trump administration official, who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, was dismissive of the Democrats’ demand.

Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.

The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted healthcare funds also failed.

It all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expire. Trump’s first term in office saw a monthlong shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-19.

Trump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in the event of a closure.

Republicans have contended that they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, blaming Democrats.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.

While the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold, which means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.

Democrats are working to protect healthcare programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ massive spending and tax cut bill enacted in July.

Republicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/430b99d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5782x3036+0+409/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2F39%2Fd895863c41d1833b5012578accce%2F145ea5f4be654b7c8bfbaaab2068aaad.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 17:56:51.820906

MADRID — If I were an immigrant (and no one is safe from becoming one; no one is immune to ruin, crisis, dictatorship; no one is safe from having to pack their bags and start their life over in the middle of nowhere), I think condescending charity would offend me almost as much as racism and xenophobia.

With a racist at least you know where you stand, but those who defend immigration with the argument that they help fund their pensions or will wipe their asses when they are old are convinced they are being kind and understanding. It is much more difficult to point out to them their egotistical arrogance, classism, and enslaving conformity than it is to denounce racists — who can be dismissed with no more than a couple of insults and a healthy dose of contempt.

The idea that immigrants are necessary because they do our dirty work is so widespread, and expressed with such gusto, that it needs to be carefully dissected to reveal its profoundly discriminatory and violent nature. Let’s try.

Immigrants fleeing poverty and arriving in wealthy societies are employed in the hardest, dirtiest, most degrading, and most undesirable jobs. It is an injustice they endure, like so many others. No one crosses an ocean out of a calling for servitude. No one is born with the dream of scrubbing toilets.

They resign themselves to it, bearing the hardship in the hope that it will be temporary. They console themselves with thoughts of what they are saving, the education their children might receive so they won’t have to clean toilets, or the bullets and hunger they are avoiding while scrubbing with a scouring pad. But that is not their mission. No immigrant thinks: how lucky I am to compensate for the falling birth rate and the overproduction of graduates in these rich societies that lack the human resources to polish the toilet bowl. They simply imagine ways to stop scrubbing aforementioned bowl, or to prevent their children from having to scrub it when they grow up.

It is like defending slavery by pointing to the pyramids.

Just like millions of Spaniards did when they had to scrub toilets in Munich, Zurich, Paris, Buenos Aires, and Havana.

Defending immigrants by talking about pension funds or the shortage of construction workers is like defending slavery by pointing to the pyramids. “We need slaves,” the free Egyptians would say, “because we’re not going to start stacking stones ourselves. Without slaves, there would be no pyramids.“

Human rights over convenience

It is striking that so many self-proclaimed progressives and democrats sing these odes to slavery without pausing to consider the grotesque nature of their arguments, which erode the very foundations of human rights. According to them, immigrants are not worthy of attention or care simply because they are human beings: Their value, instead, lies in their usefulness, in tasks like cleaning cars meticulously or ferrying children to swimming lessons.

The only progressive approach to migration is a humanitarian one. Exoduses have been a constant since the existence of rich and poor societies. The most daring or desperate people from the latter seek to improve their lives in the former. Countries of immigrants shaped by internal migratory flows such as Spain should be clear about this.

If we genuinely sympathize with the plight of the Earth’s outcasts and starving populations, we must demand that our leaders uphold the human rights charter they are obliged to enforce. The first step is to tackle the humanitarian crisis: to provide shelter and dignity to those fleeing hunger, and to do so because they are human beings who need care that any European state can easily provide. Excuses about saturation, lack of infrastructure, or limited resources are petty and untenable when weighed against per capita GDP and general budgets.

Inequality, not culture, threatens stability

The next step is to give substance and meaning to the idea of citizenship. Before we were inundated with hyper-patriotic and racist rhetoric, the European Union was an experiment in transcendent citizenship extending beyond the constraints of the nation-state. For instance, allowing EU citizens to run for mayor in cities where they reside — and to vote there, even as foreigners — enabled citizenship to move beyond rhetoric and into everyday politics. Progress in this area has been timid, and there is no reason to expect that, in the future, citizenship will become a universal condition that guarantees rights anywhere in the world, regardless of where one was born. But we must never lose sight of the idea.

Without formal equality, liberal democracy ceases to exist.

In the meantime, those concerned about the issue of migration must stop focusing on pensions and birth rates, the temptation to empathize with the borderline racist fears of “lifelong” locals bothered by a bar run by Chinese proprietors. The arrival of immigrants produces inequality, not cultural disruption. Rich societies are destabilized not by new customs or new languages that are incorporated into everyday life, but by the percentage of the population that lacks citizenship rights, which begins to be incompatible with democracy.The solution is clear: grant them those rights. Without formal equality, without individuals equal before the law, liberal democracy collapses or morphs into plutocracy or census democracy.

This is what happens in small, very wealthy countries. In Switzerland, for example, more than 30% of the population cannot participate in democracy: they cannot vote, run for office, or enter the public forum. This perverts civil liberties and reduces deliberative democracy to a system resembling the Athens of Pericles: only a few are citizens. The rest are metics and slaves.

This division must be avoided, urgently, for both moral and practical reasons, to protect an already weak and fractured democracy. To honor human rights and the notion of citizenship, immigrants arriving in Europe must be assimilated into the general population as quickly as possible. This is precisely what neither racists nor those fretting over who will change their diapers in nursing homes want. The former, because of their stupidity and backwardness. The latter because they fear that citizens equal to them will choose (as they and their own children chose) more comfortable and better-paid jobs. And here the so-called good Samaritans fail: They say, immigrants, yes — but only to clean toilets.

We progressives must say: immigrants, yes, like us. Equal and free.",https://worldcrunch.com/assets/uploads/2025/09/immigrants-1-lede-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 19:58:02.512360

The taunting post came just a few hours before the California Governor Saturday put pen to paper on Senate Bills 627, a.k.a. the “No Secret Police Act” and 805 a.k.a The “No Vigilantes Act” in a public ceremony in LA.

“ICE, unmask, what are you afraid of?” said Gov. Newsom in Sat, surrounded by Mayor Karen Bass, LA County Supervisor (and ex-Labor Secretary) Hilda Solis, LASUD Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho and others. “This is not about the pronoun police, this is about the secret police,” Newsom added, quoting The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart.

Among the dangers of the newly enlarged ICE is that they are becoming a private police force, the term limited Newson stated, “that it appears to many of us have sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not the Constitution …this is not America.”

Even with a bill in Congress and similar actions in other states, the California legislation is the first in the nation put into law the unmasking and identifying of ICE agents and others. “It’s the hunting of Latinos in Los Angeles, it is the hunting of Haitians in Florida,” Mayor Bass bluntly said Saturday of the stakes before Newsom signed the bills. “As Angelenos we will never allow this to be normalized.”

Unsurprisingly, as some wonder how the new laws can be actively enforced, the Trump administration is opposed to the measures. “Once again, sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said on September 16 of the recent enacted masking policy when it started to become clear that Gov. Newsom was likely to sign the bills into law.

The signing of SB 627, 805 and three other related bills Saturday by the Trump-trolling Newsom (who was full of his now usual swipes at the former Apprentice host and top aide Stephen Miller today) comes against the additional backdrop of a redistricting campaign to prevent Trump from rigging the 2026 midterms and increased attacks from the White House and the FCC on free speech and the First Amendment — which the governor highlighted online today too.

With a number of Trump payoffs and ring kissing having already occurred, and promises of more to come from Trump himself and FCC chair Brendan Carr, those attacks directly hit one of Hollywood most powerful corporations once again this week. On Sept. 17, Disney suddenly announced Jimmy Kimmel‘s long-running and MAGA-critical Live! would be “preempted indefinitely” after remarks the host made a couple of days before about the MAGA response to the Sept. 10 fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk sent Carr and affiliate owners blood boiling.

As Disney endure the fallout, the newly signed SB 627 would ban local, state and federal law enforcement from covering their faces during operations, including immigration raids. Expecting court challenges, the law takes effect on January 1, 2026 with more provisions taking place later.

SB 805, which goes into effect immediately, requires all local, state and federal law enforcement, like ICE, operating in the Golden State to be identifiable with a name or badge number, whether they are in uniform or not. Passed by a strong majority in Sacramento along with SB 627 earlier this month, SB 805 also bans bounty hunters from participating in any and all immigration related activity in California and permits police to demand to see ID from anyone they believe is cosplaying at being local, state or federal law enforcement.

Reminiscent in more ways than one of the yellow masked police in HBO and Damon Lindelof’s Emmy-winning dystopian Watchmen, the masked ICE agents and seemingly bonus-paid surrogates were unleashed on LA earlier this summer as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Originally promised to be targeted at those with criminal records, the policy turned into snatching people off the street, out of cars and churches, and from Home Depot parking lots indiscriminately with a number of U.S. citizens and children being abducted in the process.

Now spreading to other blue states and cities, the LA abductions saw heavy protests in DTLA and Trump federalizing the state’s National Guard and hundreds of Marines to clamp down. Though the military presence in LA has dimmed, the intense ICE raids returned as the conservative majority Supreme Court on Sept. 8 halted a temporary restraining order stopping people being spotlighted for their race, skin color (Brown and Black), language or location (like waiting at a bus stop).

Just before SCOTUS stepped in, after numerous setbacks, Gov. Newsom and state AG Robert Bonta had a belated victory in the battle for LA on Sept. 2, when a federal judge ruled the Trump administration actively violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of the military to execute domestic law.

The Trump admin is set to appeal that ruling and will surely try to find ways around or through the bills Newsom signed today.

BTW – as talks continue between much-reviled Disney brass and Kimmel’s team over a possible return by the host, Damon Lindelof has said he will not work for any Disney-owned entity until the later-nighter is back on air. Other top talent has expressed similar sentiments, some publicly, some privately.

On the other hand, the acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli calls Newsom’s Noem-taunting tweet a “direct or implicit threat” and is pursuing it with the Secret Service:

Four Republicans joined Democrats Wednesday to table that resolution, which would have also removed her from committees. U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, brought it forward because of an interview Omar did in response to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last week and reposts she made on social media.

The four-term congresswoman, who represents Minneapolis and some close suburbs, said in a note to constituents that the measure mischaracterized her words and her views.

""I have never supported political violence, and I have always spoken out against it. Attempts to twist my words into something they are not are deeply harmful not just to me, but to our ability to have honest debates in Congress,"" she said in an email about a town hall event.

Mr. Trump on Thursday said she is ""terrible"" and should be impeached. He also slammed Somalia, which Omar fled as a child before coming to the U.S. as a refugee. She later became an American citizen and first ran for Congress in 2018.

""How are they doing? How's their government? Do they have a president? Do they have a council? Do they have anything? Do they have police? I love these people that come from a place with nothing. Nothing, no anything. And then they tell us how to run our country,"" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""I think if she got censured, that's great. If she got impeached, that's even better.""

Omar's office declined to comment on Mr. Trump's remarks or his posts on social media.

In one post he said, ""what scum we have in our country, telling us what to do and how to do it"" after criticizing Somalia as a country plagued by poverty, civil war and corruption.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, who himself emigrated to the U.S. from Somalia in the early 1990s, said many Somali Minnesotans supported President Trump this past election. The president won 12% of the vote in Minneapolis, a Democratic stronghold, but nearly double that figure in some heavily East African precincts, according to an analysis by the Minnesota Star Tribune.

Hussein called Mr. Trump's remarks ""a political statement,"" but said they've also caused alarm. ""Anytime something like this happens, we as a community are on guard, partially because we have seen political violence that took the life of Charlie Kirk, that took the life of [Rep.] Melissa Hortman, that took the life of many others, and we're seeing those threats,"" he explained. ""And so that's why we are a lot more alarmed when these things are publicly played out.""

Omar has faced threats in the past. Two years ago, a man in Florida was convicted and sentenced for sending an email threatening to kill her.

""Anything can happen, anytime. That's why it's important that those around President Trump should remind him that we are in a moment where we just lost a political figure like Charlie Kirk. We can't be in this moment of continuous contention that rises to a point where individuals may kill,"" Hussein said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/16/77e0dfe8-bc62-4a63-8e19-a21e2a8b4d7a/thumbnail/1200x630/4d83b2b132893990a0eea649a2294b71/yt-thumb-021625.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 18:56:57.991943

Several FBI and Justice Department officials believed Homan’s acceptance of the cash provided strong evidence that they should continue to pursue after Homan took public office.","In an undercover operation last year, the FBI recorded Tom Homan, now the White House border czar, accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help the agents — who were posing as business executives — win government contracts in a second Trump administration, according to multiple people familiar with the probe and internal documents reviewed by MSNBC.

The FBI and the Justice Department planned to wait to see whether Homan would deliver on his alleged promise once he became the nation’s top immigration official. But the case indefinitely stalled soon after Donald Trump became president again in January, according to six sources familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, Trump appointees officially closed the investigation, after FBI Director Kash Patel requested a status update on the case, two of the people said.

It’s unclear what reasons FBI and Justice Department officials gave for shutting down the investigation. But a Trump Justice Department appointee called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025 and no further investigative steps were taken, the sources say.

On Sept. 20, 2024, with hidden cameras recording the scene at a meeting spot in Texas, Homan accepted $50,000 in bills, according to an internal summary of the case and sources.

The federal investigation was launched in western Texas in the summer of 2024 after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election, according to an internal Justice Department summary of the probe reviewed by MSNBC and people familiar with the case. The U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas, working with the FBI, asked the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section to join its ongoing probe “into the Border Czar and former Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan and others based on evidence of payment from FBI undercover agents in exchange for facilitating future contracts related to border enforcement.”

Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement early in Trump’s first term, openly claimed during the 2024 campaign that he would play a prominent role in carrying out Trump’s promised mass deportations.

Asked for comment about MSNBC's exclusive reporting, the White House, the Justice Department and the FBI dismissed the investigation as politically motivated and baseless.

In a statement provided to MSNBC, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said, “This matter originated under the previous administration and was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The Department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.”

White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson slammed the probe as a ""blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using it’s resources to target President Trump’s allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country.""

""Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,"" she added on behalf of Homan, a senior White House employee.

Homan did not reply to requests for comment.

Undercover FBI agents posing as contractors communicated and met several times last summer with a business colleague who introduced them to Homan, and with Homan himself, who indicated he would facilitate securing contracts for them in exchange for money once he was in office, according to documents and the people familiar with the case.

On Sept. 20, 2024, with hidden cameras recording the scene at a meeting spot in Texas, Homan accepted $50,000 in bills, according to an internal summary of the case and sources.

FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors took no further investigative steps in the final months of 2024, the people said, and expected to keep monitoring Homan to determine if he landed an official role and would make good on steering contracts in a future Trump administration.

When special agents in Texas began probing the subject’s claim that Homan was soliciting bribes, the White House border czar, 63, was president and owner of a private consulting business that said it could help companies in the border security industry win government contracts. Homan often accompanied Trump on the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, and for months before the presidential election publicly touted that he expected to oversee implementation of Trump’s immigration policies.

“Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen,” Homan said at the National Conservatism Conference in July 2024.

Several FBI and Justice officials believed that they had a strong criminal case against Homan for conspiracy to commit bribery based on recording him accepting cash and his apparent promise to assist with contracts, according to four people familiar with the probe. Homan could have been charged with a crime then, legal experts say, but his case was unusual: He was not a public official, and Trump was not president at the time he accepted money in the FBI’s undercover sting, so his actions didn’t clearly fit under a standard bribery charge.

Top officials privately debated the possible charges given Homan’s status at the time, people familiar with the case said. But several concluded it would be better for the investigation to continue to monitor his actions once he was back in public office. According to a document reviewed by MSNBC, Justice officials were eyeing four potential criminal charges in his case: conspiracy, bribery and two kinds of fraud.

MSNBC asked legal experts about a hypothetical situation similar to the Homan probe. They said a person who promises to influence federal contracts when they become a public official can’t be charged under the federal bribery statutes until they are named or appointed to such a post. If the person did get the administration job and then reaffirmed his promise or communicated in some way about his plan to deliver on his agreement, investigators could make a strong bribery case.

It is still a crime, however, for anyone to seek money to improperly influence federal contracts, the legal experts said, whether they are a public official or not, and whether they ever delivered on their promise or not. People in this category could be charged with conspiracy or fraud, they say.

“If someone who is not yet a public official, but expects to be, takes bribes in exchange for agreeing to take official acts after they are appointed, they can’t be charged with bribery,” said Randall Eliason, the former chief of public corruption prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. and former white-collar law professor. “But they can be charged with conspiracy to commit bribery. In a conspiracy charge, the crime is the agreement to commit a criminal act in the future.”

On Nov. 11, 2024, President Trump announced he would make Homan his border czar, a White House adviser role, which — unlike the job of director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — did not require Senate confirmation or an extensive FBI background check.

Several FBI and Justice Department officials believed Homan’s acceptance of the cash provided strong evidence that they should continue to pursue after Homan took public office. The Public Integrity Section, a squad of seasoned public corruption prosecutors typically assigned to sensitive cases involving elected and other high-profile figures, agreed to join the case in late November 2024, according to documents reviewed by MSNBC.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, however, in either late January or February 2025, former acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove was briefed on the case and told Justice Department officials he did not support the investigation, according to two people familiar with the case.

Around the same time, the Public Integrity Section was battling with Bove over his demand that they dismiss a bribery case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The section’s supervisors, who would resign one by one in February rather than agree to dismiss the Adams case, had assigned a top supervisor to help oversee the Homan case with federal prosecutors in the Western District of Texas, where the investigation began, two people said.

Homan had spent three decades in federal border protection and immigration enforcement. A former police officer from upstate New York, Homan had started work as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and later was promoted to several supervisory jobs. In 2013, President Barack Obama elevated Homan to serve as head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch.

When Trump was first elected president in 2017, he appointed Homan as acting head of ICE. In that role, Homan pushed the controversial “zero-tolerance” policy for immigrants seeking to cross the border, resulting in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents and family members.

Homan’s nomination to become the permanent ICE director stalled in the Senate amid widespread criticism over the administration’s family-separations policies and Senate Democrats’ opposition to his confirmation. After his lengthy career in government service, Homan announced in April 2018 he would retire.

Homan then launched his consulting firm, Homeland Strategic Consulting. Its website boasted of its work with the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Justice and others: “We have a proven track record of opening doors and bringing successful relationships to our clients, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts to private companies.”

During the Biden administration, as Trump prepared to run again for president, Homan remained close to Trump and his advisers, working as a Fox News contributor and with the Heritage Foundation, as well as contributing to Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Trump’s second term.

When Homan became Trump’s top border official in 2025, his consulting work and financial ties to border security and immigration-related contractors spurred questions from Democrats in Congress about his potential conflicts of interest.

Many expected Homan, a trusted Trump ally, to serve if Trump were re-elected in 2024. In a December 2023 interview on the slain conservative activist’s eponymous podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show,” Homan promised he’d be pushing a robust removal of immigrants when Trump was re-elected.

“We’re going to have the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen,” Homan told Benny Johnson, a right-wing commentator and host on the show. “And I’m not going apologize for it.”

After Trump was elected a second time in 2024, amid questions about Homan’s financial relationships with clients who sought work related to the border, Homan said he had no conflict and would take steps to prevent one. He said he was shutting down his consulting business and would remove himself from discussions of specific contracts to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.

“As Border Czar, you are uniquely positioned to help your former business client reap a huge windfall from the Trump Administration’s spending on immigration enforcement,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter last month asking for documents and communications with another firm Homan worked for, Geo Group, a major immigration detention contractor. Raskin was joined by Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, in pressing for answers about Homan’s potential conflicts.

Asked about a hypothetical situation of a person promising help with contracts once they get into public office, Eliason said federal law makes it a crime to strike a corrupt agreement to help influence government contracts and decisions, no matter the identity of the person or whether they succeed. He said a person who is not a public official yet but promises to exert influence improperly when they get the job — and accepts or solicits money to do so — can be charged with conspiracy.

Eliason pointed to the Reagan-era bribery scandal involving the now-defunct defense contractor Wedtech. Eugene Wallach, a lawyer and friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was convicted of conspiracy to commit crimes by taking substantial payments from Wedtech while promising to influence contracts once he landed a high-level Justice Department job under Meese. (A higher court later overturned Wallach’s conviction due to a faulty jury instruction.)

“The defendant is agreeing that he will commit the crime of bribery once he is appointed to be a public official,” Eliason added. “That agreement itself is the conspiracy crime, and the fact that it never actually took place is not a defense. That would be true if he were never even appointed to anything at all.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250610-tom-homan-ew-608p-556b24.jpg",N,,2025-09-20 18:57:03.013341

Pramila Jayapal from Washington's 7th Congressional District hosted a ""shadow hearing"" — an unofficial congressional hearing held by the minority party — about the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

Rep. Maxine Dexter was among the lawmakers present, and Portlander Mimi Lettunich was among the witnesses who testified about the experiences. Lettunich recalled what happened to her friend, Jackie Merlos, after a trip up to the U.S.-Canadian border.

Lettunich has been a caregiver to Merlos's four young children two months after that fateful visit.

Merlos, originally from Honduras, was visiting her sister, a Canadian citizen, at Peace Arch Park on June 28. Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Merlos as the sisters were saying goodbye, Lettunich told lawmakers.

According to a CBP spokesperson, ""Merlos was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Peace Arch Park attempting to smuggle illegal aliens into the U.S. on June 28. Removal proceedings have been initiated, and she is now in ICE custody."" Earlier this summer, they told KGW, ""Initially, the children remained with the mother — at her request — in Border Patrol custody.""

Two weeks after their disappearance, Lettunich, with the assistance of Congresswoman Maxine Dexter, said they located Merlos and her U.S.-born children in Washington state.

Dexter recalled walking into the CBP building in an attempt to free the Merlos children and connect the family with legal counsel while detained.

""When I was able to see Jackie and the children, it was exactly as described: it felt like a zoo. They didn’t know who I was when I walked in. Jackie was kneeling with the four children, praying. She looked up, asked not to be interrupted, and kept praying. I cannot describe the impression it left on me — four small children in what was probably a 10-by-10 cell, behind soundproof glass, with a gray cement bench they were kneeling on, thin mats on the floor, and a toilet in the corner. It is absolutely insane that this is what we have done to this family ... the fact that [Trump has] traumatized them for an entire lifetime,” she said Thursday.

Lettunich, who was able to retrieve the children mid-July, shared with lawmakers some of what they told her.

""Agents interrogated the children without Jackie,"" she said. ""They were asked, 'Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have any relatives? Did they have a father?' Shortly after, ICE took their dad. The children believe it was their fault.""

On the car ride back to Portland, Lettunich said the kids gave her a coloring book with a message from her friend.

""Jackie had written me a note in the inside cover: 'Mimi, thank you for everything. Hopefully, this will be over soon. I will miss my babies. Please take care of them,"" she read.

Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.","Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to check the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in California, including measures that limit their access on schools and force them to identify themselves in public.

The new laws echo the “resistance” measures California adopted during the first administration, when it passed a so-called sanctuary law to limit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents, among other policies.

President Trump promised a historic deportation effort and assault on sanctuary-style policies when he took office for the second time. His administration criticized the state’s new immigration laws even before Newsom signed them.

The Department of Homeland Security earlier this week called on Newsom to veto the mask bill — one of the more contentious pieces of immigration legislation — calling it “despicable.”

“Once again sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a Sept. 16 press release.

California may struggle to enforce the new laws, some of which have already raised constitutional questions around the state’s role in federal operations, but lawmakers maintain that they are legally defensible.

California political consultant Mike Madrid said in signing the laws Newsom is showing that he can stand up and fight, whether or not he has a chance of winning.

“In this moment, when there are very few cards to play for state governments and state legislatures, California has done what no other state has done: establish itself as the tip of the spear on resisting a lot of these efforts that are an affront to its values,” said Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.

“99% of this is the purview of the federal government. So a lot of it is just symbolic, but symbolism matters. It’s both politically astute but also morally right,” he said.

The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.

Senate Bill 627 widely prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties.

Senate Bill 805 requires that law enforcement officers identify themselves while conducting their duties, with some exceptions.

Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order.

Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.

California Democrats began drafting immigration-related bills almost as soon Trump took office in January. Those efforts accelerated after the Trump administration launched aggressive immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles, which led to weeks of protests and a subsequent National Guard deployment.

“All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from their own federal government. That is profound,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference with Newsom and other Democratic leaders.

Will the laws make a difference?

Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.

In 2018, for instance, California passed a law to restrict immigration arrests at superior court buildings. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from detaining people at those courts this year.

“The federal government is going to continue doing what it’s doing, in one form or another,” he said. “I do think the legislation gives some hope and optimism to communities that feel under fire, vulnerable and basically hated by the federal government.”

Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center, remains hopeful that the package of bills will ensure safety for people attending school and accessing health care.

“With most laws, there has to be really vigorous monitoring, both by the state as well as by advocates to ensure that it’s truly being implemented and followed,” she said.

California police opposed mask ban

The most controversial bill in the package was Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener’s proposal to widely ban federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The law, also known as the “No Secret Police Act,” does not apply to certain forms of face coverings, such as face shields, and it exempts some officers, including those who are undercover. Officers who violate the law will face an infraction or misdemeanor.

Wiener and Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez and Aisha Wahab championed the legislation after seeing footage of masked and unidentifiable agents carrying out operations.

“ICE’s recklessness creates chaos as agents run around with what are effectively ski masks and no identification, grabbing people, throwing them in unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them,” Wiener of San Francisco said at a legislative hearing in August. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust.”

California’s law enforcement groups widely opposed the bill, arguing it will largely apply to local police, rather than federal agents, because the federal government is likely to sue on constitutional grounds.

“It’s using an emotionally charged issue on a federal level to pass a bill that will only affect local peace officers,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions. “You’re upset with the feds, but you’re going to punish us.”

Other law enforcement experts echoed those concerns, arguing that it’s illegal to interfere with federal operations.

“California cops are not going to enforce this law,” said Ed Obayashi, a longtime California police officer who now is a special prosecutor and policy adviser to the Modoc County Sheriff’s Office. “You cannot regulate lawful federal conduct, whether the Legislature likes it or not.”

The law allows officers to be sued personally for “tortious conduct,” including if they assault or falsely arrest someone while masked.

“Private enforcement could be the avenue where enforcement is the likeliest,” said Johnson.

The bill caused hours of contentious debate on the Senate and Assembly floors, with many Republicans calling it misguided.

“My immigrant family is not afraid” of ramped-up immigration enforcement, Fresno Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa said, “because we did not break the law.”

But Democrats were animated because just days before, the U.S. Supreme Court had sided with the Trump administration and ICE for conducting roving sweeps through Los Angeles, apparently catching bystander day laborers or anyone who appeared Latino in their dragnet. The bill, they said, was their way of pushing back.

“We need a full front defense for the violence that is coming from this regime,” said Hector Pereyra, policy manager for the nonprofit Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which co-sponsored the mask bill and another bill to protect the private data of street vendors. “We have to respond with a united front of strength and aggressiveness, not of passiveness.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f4695da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3436x1804+0+387/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F3436x2577%20359%200%2Fresize%2F3436x2577%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd8%2F39%2Fced0413e408cb66756f021211839%2Fap24120126400719-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 16:56:43.107762

The administration’s proposed settlement agreement in exchange for releasing those funds includes a $1.2 billion fine — the largest the Trump administration has requested from a university so far.
The suit warns that UCLA is just the latest to be affected by a pattern the Trump administration is using to exert power over higher education.
“The Trump administration has developed a strategy to reverse what it calls ‘the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions,’” it reads.
Markowitz said Californians need to know what’s at stake as the regents discuss how to negotiate with the Trump administration.","University of California faculty groups are escalating their pushback against the federal government’s efforts to reshape higher education, demanding access this week to a settlement proposed by the Trump administration that they say is part of an effort to exert control over universities.

In August, the Trump administration moved to freeze hundreds of UCLA research grants totaling roughly $500 million over allegations that the school ignored antisemitism on campus. Federal officials said universities, including UCLA, Columbia and Harvard, have fallen into a “decades-long woke-capture” spearheaded by Democrats.

The administration’s proposed settlement agreement in exchange for releasing those funds includes a $1.2 billion fine — the largest the Trump administration has requested from a university so far. According to reports from the Los Angeles Times and others, it was also accompanied by nonmonetary demands that would radically remake the university “in a conservative image.”

While national news outlets say they have viewed the administration’s lengthy list of demands and reported on their broad strokes, faculty members say the UC Board of Regents is refusing to share the document, hampering their ability to fight the proposed changes.

This week, in addition to suing the Trump administration over the proposed settlement, UCLA’s faculty association and the Council of University of California Faculty Associations sued the regents for declining a public records request for Trump’s demand letter.

“We feel this is essential for us to understand what our working conditions will be like over the next few years,” said Anna Markowitz, the president of the UCLA faculty association’s executive board.

According to media reports, the proposed settlement demands that UCLA bar health care workers from offering some gender-affirming care at its hospitals, exclude transgender women from athletics and “single sex housing” and rescind records and recognitions previously awarded to transgender women in “female-only events.”

The faculty groups believe the list also calls for UCLA to revise its free expression policies and includes demands to end race and ethnicity-based scholarships, which Markowitz said help California students who might not otherwise be able to access the prestigious institution. Additionally, they said, it demands that the school alert the federal government of “disciplinary actions involving student visa holders,” among other things.

The Board of Regents, walking a thin line to try to recover the half a billion dollars in frozen research grants, told the faculty groups last month that it would not release the letter, citing pending litigation, Federal Privacy Act and other state public records exemptions.

But the faculty groups say that withholding the document violates their right to information under California’s Constitution. They say it’s unfair for the university system to call on them and other UC staff to oppose it without knowing its demands.

“The UCLA Faculty Association and the Council of University Faculty Associations … are also mobilizing in response to the Trump administration’s demands, though their efforts to do so are being hampered by the University’s refusal to disclose the requested document,” their lawsuit against the regents reads.

Alameda County Superior Court Judge Rebekah Evenson instructed the regents on Friday to present any evidence showing that producing a copy of the letter could incur damages, and to identify whether other universities that have engaged in similar negotiations with the Trump administration have released such documents.

She plans to schedule a hearing on the matter in October, according to Markowitz.

Although Markowitz said the faculty groups appreciate news reports outlining the proposed settlement demands, she said it’s important that faculty members see the document for themselves to flag specific language that could have a significant impact on their ability to teach.

“The devil is in the details, and understanding what the specific language is and what the specific requests are would give us a much better sense of to what level the federal government wants to be interfering with UC operations,” she said.

She also believes the settlement demands are relevant to all Californians, since a deal could have wide-ranging effects across the university system’s 10 campuses in the future.

The suit warns that UCLA is just the latest to be affected by a pattern the Trump administration is using to exert power over higher education.

“The Trump administration has developed a strategy to reverse what it calls ‘the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions,’” it reads. “It conditions the restoration of grant funds on both monetary payments and — critically — sweeping concessions on policies related to admissions, financial aid, free expression, faculty hiring, and inclusivity.”

Universities across the country, including UC Berkeley, are under ongoing investigations for alleged antisemitism, the Trump administration announced in March. It sent letters to 60 universities notifying schools of the probe, and last week, UC Berkeley handed over personal information for about 160 students and employees accused of antisemitism that the government subpoenaed in the spring.

Markowitz said Californians need to know what’s at stake as the regents discuss how to negotiate with the Trump administration.

“The regents have only ever talked about one demand, which is the $1.2 billion settlement … but they’re actually asking for a lot more,” she continued. “Whatever else they’re asking for is actually really important to the character and the mission of the UC and to the public of California, and we want to know what other factors might be involved as our administration tries to figure out a path forward.”

“We will not stop protesting against Derwentside IRC whilst it remains open. Whilst this government and right-wing agitators ramp up the hostile environment, we remain steadfast in campaigning to shut it down. We continue to urge the government to act on the recommendations published in this year’s Independent Monitoring Board report and reconsider closing this detention centre. The issues raised because of its isolated location, the poor mobile phone signal and the high numbers of women released on bail, as they should never have been detained, mean Derwentside IRC should be closed.”

Former MEP and women’s rights campaigner, Julie Ward, said:

“In a world riven with conflict it is no surprise that vulnerable and desperate people are seeking sanctuary. We would all do the same if we were in their shoes. More than fifty per cent of people on the move across the world are women and children. They face violence at every stage of their journeys and when they finally arrive in Europe where they hope to find safety they are faced with appalling levels of racism and institutional violence.

Our colonial past is largely to blame for the poverty and inequality that drives conflict. We pride ourselves on being a generous open country but right wing politicians and their media mates are whipping up anti-migrant sentiment resulting in new levels of racism reminiscent of the Enoch Powell era or 1930s Germany. It’s time to dial down the rhetoric and remember that we all came from somewhere else. Kindness and compassion should be our watchwords.

The costs of defying the Supreme Court in one instance could have ripple effects, leading to a cascading of other rulings against the administration that would make such a move particularly costly.
Trump’s decision to defy the Supreme Court is hardly a foregone conclusion, even for him.","The odds are, in the coming months, the Supreme Court will issue a ruling that limits Donald Trump’s unilateral assertions of power. Perhaps the court will strike down the president’s radical and unprecedented imposition of tariffs without congressional involvement or his denial of birthright citizenship to individuals born in the U.S.

Although it is impossible to know how such a situation will play out, a certain fatalism is now germinating. Political observers and even unnamed administration officials wonder in private what will happen if Trump simply defies the court, asserting his executive power and thumbing his nose at the rule of law and the constitutional system.

I believe that such a decision to ignore the Supreme Court would be more difficult and costly to Trump than many assume.

A court decision that delivers a clear, unified rebuke to the president by full court or 7-2 supermajority would marshal the authority of the U.S. Constitution. Another defiant president crumbled in 1974 when a unanimous decision instructed President Nixon to turn over the damning White House tapes or invite the revolt of his own party and much of the country.

And the court’s decision will have even more force if it deals with a situation where Trump blatantly contradicts the Constitution, as with his denial of the 14th Amendment’s granting of citizenship to “all persons born” in the United States.

Beyond their rightfully held constitutional authority, the Supreme Court also enjoys the advantage of controlling the timing of its rulings. Trump’s approach will likely be affected if the court issues a ruling during a period of political vulnerability, such as in the runup to the 2026 elections. If congressional Republicans are scrambling to win reelection in a bad year for their party, the White House may choose to avoid a constitutional crisis that forces Republican candidates to take a side.

Although congressional Republicans’ loyalty to the president has held so far, such a scenario would tempt lawmakers to protect themselves by announcing, “I’m going to tell the president that he’s wrong.”

Trump’s presumption that he has the power to impose his will may also be misplaced in certain cases. Trump ordered his administration to quickly cancel nearly nine out of 10 USAID programs. Unprecedented but straightforward and easy to do. But the president lacks comparable tools to tame the Federal Reserve Bank and its governors.

The Fed’s independence dulls Trump’s scheme to steer its interest rate policy and replace a governor with an ally. The Fed’s operations are anchored in 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and their networks of privately owned commercial banks. Its funding is derived from the bank’s operations in capital markets and is independent of Congress and the president. Trump’s favorite weapon of cutting budgets to compel obedience won’t work with the Fed if he pushed back on a potential Supreme Court decision that ruled against his firing of a Fed governor.

Then there is the matter of the remainder of the judiciary. How will it respond if Trump disregarded a clear order? In ordinary times, the federal legal system privileges the administration and its actions. But if the president spurned the Supreme Court of the United States, the judicial system would become even less inclined to trust the administration and its lawyers and give them the benefit of the doubt in other cases.

The costs of defying the Supreme Court in one instance could have ripple effects, leading to a cascading of other rulings against the administration that would make such a move particularly costly.

Trump would also be reliant on the people in his administration to carry out his decision. Causing an unprecedented constitutional crisis will pose a question of great historic import: will officials decide to obey the court or the president? Resting in the balance are their current jobs and the historic consequences of spurning the rule of law. Trump’s actions in his first term provoked resignations of protest from the Department of Justice and internal dissension among senior officials.

And make no mistake, the consequences of defying the court would be drastic. After all, the national and international economy and world leaders have always assumed that the United State is a nation of laws. But Trump’s repudiation of the rule of law would set off a constitutional crisis in the U.S., rattle investor confidence in the dollar, and trigger a sharp sell-off in the Stock Market. Although there is no precedent for constitutional defiance, markets did fall by 10 percent in the two days after high tariffs were imposed in April 2025.

Trump’s decision to defy the Supreme Court is hardly a foregone conclusion, even for him. The reality is that the stakes for Trump — and the country — of flouting the rule of law are enormous and may bring about the president’s political downfall.

Article 3 case law is being used in British challenges to deportation of migrants to France on the grounds their safety will be endangered.
“Britain is considered responsible for what will happen to these people sent to this horrible country called France,” joked Bossuyt of Belgium’s neighbour.
“There is case law in that direction which would make any extradition impossible to many, many countries,” Bossuyt said.
Because to make a court change its case law is extremely difficult.","“In the past I was accused of sacrilege,” he told The Times. “I am used to that. And, as you can see nowadays, governments do complain [about the ECHR], and then it’s a great scandal: ‘They dare to complain! How dare they?’”

His intervention comes as the question of overreach by the ECHR has never been higher on the political agenda across Europe. In Britain, judicial challenges based on cases before the court in Strasbourg have threatened to sink Sir Keir Starmer’s one-in, one-out agreement with France to return illegal migrants who crossed the Channel in small boats.

In May an open letter drafted by Italy and Denmark and signed by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said the ECHR had “limited our ability to make political decisions in our own democracies” by creating barriers to fighting illegal migration. Bossuyt writes in the diplomatic document shared by De Wever: “Governments should not be intimidated by the reproach that criticising some judgments puts the rule of law in danger.”

A wider grouping of countries, including France and Germany, according to diplomatic sources, is also engaged in finding ways to stop the derailing of the deportation of failed asylum seekers or those who have committed crimes. Bossuyt describes the practice as “judicial activism”.

“I’ve been told that it is not only the nine governments that take a critical view but many more others, including the UK, who is not a member state any more of the EU,” Bossuyt said.

• Labour ministers plan human rights overhaul to head off Nigel Farage

He makes a distinction between ordinary judicial cases and international courts making rulings that have “a very general scope and consequences, particularly as is the case with the judgments of the court in Strasbourg”.

He said: “Then the problem is not the government that is violating the principle of separation of powers, but it is the court that is violating that principle. Because it’s up to the legislators to legislate and not up to the court.”

It is states that are the “ultimate masters” of the treaties they are party to, Bossuyt said, and “governments are their representatives”. He said: “We must never lose sight of the fact that it is states that ratify conventions.”

Bossuyt reserves particular criticism for the case law surrounding article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: the “prohibition of torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment”.

Article 3 case law is being used in British challenges to deportation of migrants to France on the grounds their safety will be endangered. “Britain is considered responsible for what will happen to these people sent to this horrible country called France,” joked Bossuyt of Belgium’s neighbour. “In my opinion, that is going too far.”

In one case an Afghan fugitive wanted on French rape charges is claiming that prison cells in some French prisons might be too small, violating his rights under the convention, based on case law that “slopping out” chamber pots in Scottish prisons breached article 3. “There is case law in that direction which would make any extradition impossible to many, many countries,” Bossuyt said. “So I think that’s not the way — that’s overreaching by the court in my opinion.”

He added: “It is wrong to have judicial cases over transfers of asylum seekers between parties to the European convention such as from Britain to France or between EU countries, such as to Greece.”

The Belgian jurist, a former chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights and professor of international law, makes the case that article 3 has gone beyond “a negative prohibition on a state not to torture someone”, which he argues should be absolute, to a “positive obligation to provide decent reception services to asylum seekers”.

“If also the obligation to have decent services is considered absolute then we are indirectly responsible for what may happen in other states,” he said. “I think there, the court is going too far.”

In his paper, first reported by the Brussels website Euractiv, he suggests the law goes beyond “what was originally intended by the prohibition of torture”. He writes: “A lack of decent reception for asylum seekers is clearly not of the same order as whipping. In none of the EU member states there is a real risk that asylum seekers will be whipped.”

While some challenges are understandable, he says, there should not be a “required jurisdictional intervention, with suspentive effect, in a case where we are sending someone from one EU country to another EU country”. That includes Britain, he says, which is a state party to the convention. “If you send someone from the one state party to the other state party it is still under the control of the ECHR. That is the case if you send someone from Britain to France.”

Bossuyt suggests that governments should appoint better candidates to the bench of the court in an attempt to reform it. “National judges known for their judicial restraint should be given preference over academics,” he said, adding that the latter group were known by their writings to be in favour of “activist interpretations”.

He called on governments to intervene collectively in cases being heard at the court to make “judges aware of the importance” attached to “the issues at stake”.

• Juliet Samuel: The ECHR wasn’t meant to be used like this

Amending the convention is more difficult, he said, but it has been done with a protocol, number 15, in 2013 to give a greater “margin of appreciation”. This, he said, gave more national flexibility to prevent confrontations between governments and the court. “It is very difficult to get consensus, very difficult to get, obviously, all those ratifications, all these approvals by parliaments. I would not rule it totally out.”

Bossuyt, author of Right to Asylum: Between Demagogy and Hypocrisy, published by Hart Oxford this year, remains optimistic that the court can be changed. “Fifteen years ago, I was a very, very lonely voice. The mood is changing. That’s quite clear. But it’s very difficult. Because to make a court change its case law is extremely difficult.

“I think there is a possibility, at least, to have the court being more cautious. And I would say, to a certain extent, over the last years, the court is already somewhat more cautious than it was 15 years ago.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F6515f9e9-566a-447e-90a7-11ebc0079c60.jpg?crop=2674%2C1504%2C281%2C230&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-20 15:57:09.400991

President Trump’s proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications and renewals, set to become effective September 21, 2025.

Immigration attorneys across the U.S. worked overnight to prepare multiple lawsuits challenging the order, calling the fee excessive, unlawful, and tantamount to a ban.

Corporate legal teams scrambled to track H-1B employees and advised against international travel, fearing liability for the steep new reentry fee.

With 72% of H-1Bs held by Indians, the order disproportionately affects Indian professionals and IT outsourcing firms that rely heavily on the program.

Critics argue the proclamation bypasses Congress and established rulemaking procedures, making it vulnerable to challenge as arbitrary and beyond executive authority.

DHS may waive the fee for individuals, companies, or industries deemed critical to U.S. interests, but the process remains unclear.

Tech leaders warn the measure could cripple Silicon Valley’s talent pipeline, while policy experts say it risks a talent drain and undermines U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields.

It was a night of absolute mayhem for the H-1B visa community in the United States. Across the country, immigration attorneys from New York to California spent Friday burning the midnight oil, drafting lawsuits to challenge the executive order as early as Monday morning. Immigration lawyers’ mailing lists lit up overnight with urgent alerts, and corporate legal teams were scrambling to track their H-1B employees, making sure no one was traveling or exposed to the sudden $100,000 fee that corporations would have to pay for their re-entry into the U.S.

As news spread, attorneys quickly began scouting for plaintiffs to mount a legal challenge, while H-1B forums and social media groups buzzed with questions about the executive order’s murky clauses.

RELATED: Trump administration finally targets H-1B, set to impose $100,000 for coveted visas (September 19, 2025)

By attaching a $100,000 fee to both new and renewed H-1B visas, President Trump has delivered what critics describe as an unprecedented body blow to America’s immigration system.

Immigration attorney and founder of the Visa Code, Gnanamookhan Senthurjothi, says his phone hasn’t stopped ringing. His firm, like countless others, has been deluged with panicked calls from past and present visa holders desperate for direction. His counsel: “We strongly recommend that current H-1B visa holders avoid international travel outside the United States until further clarity is provided. If you are currently outside the U.S. on an H-1B visa, please make every effort to return before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 20, 2025, to avoid possible entry restrictions under the new proclamation effective September 21, 2025.”

But as soon as attorneys began issuing advisories urging H-1B visa holders abroad to return before Sunday, Indian nationals quickly realized the near impossibility of doing so. With India 10 hours ahead of the U.S. and most direct flights from major Indian cities taking at least 14 hours, the timing made it unfeasible for many to get back in time.

Members of H-1B community groups, however, began circulating a quick jugaad. One message floating through desi networks read, “People who are coming before September 21st, as it is the nearest port of entry.” The note referred to Abu Dhabi’s Zayed International Airport (AUH), where U.S.-bound travelers can complete American immigration and customs checks before boarding. This “preclearance” process applies to those already holding valid U.S. visas or eligible under the Visa Waiver Program.

Meanwhile, people in the H-1B compliance industry told The American Bazaar that on Friday, several passengers bound for India were asked to de-board their flights after employers advised against travel, fearing liability for the steep new reentry fee.

Sethurjothi also advises, “H-1B applicants outside the U.S. with scheduled visa interviews should proceed with their appointments as planned. There is no need to panic or cancel your visa interview at this time. H-1B visa holders outside the U.S. who are unable to re-enter should avoid traveling to the U.S. on B-1 visas unless there is a genuine and urgent reason for such travel.”

Policy experts and people in immigration circles also point to uncertainties in the order. Immigration consultant Netra Chavan strongly feels that the rule will soon be put on hold once lawsuits are filed, but she highlights its slightly ambiguous nature.

She says, “While the H-1B proclamation introduces a $100,000 payment for certain visa petitions. Interestingly, the text doesn’t call it a ‘fee’; instead, it begins with a long-winded monologue on wages and prevailing wage levels. This has caused some confusion: Is this rule about improving wages for the worker or an employer cost? The answer appears to be that it’s an employer payment, not compensation to the employee. The proclamation ties it to H-1B petition approval but also discusses wage levels, which makes the language ambiguous.”

Sethurjothi agrees. “The White House is expected to issue FAQs soon to provide further insights and clarify ambiguities in the proclamation. A careful review of these FAQs will be essential to fully understand how the restrictions and exemptions will be implemented,” he says. Experts also point out that there is currently no clarity on how this fee is to be paid.

Why the $100,000 fee stands on unsteady legal ground

The sudden $100,000 H-1B fee appears to bypass established procedures entirely, unlike previous immigration fee adjustments that followed a defined legal and regulatory process.

Chavan raises a pertinent point, saying, “The Premium Processing fee increases (from $1,500 to $2,500 (in 2020) to $2,805 (in 2024)) followed a clear legal path: Congress authorized the changes through the USCIS Stabilization Act and gave DHS authority to make periodic adjustments for inflation by publishing rules in the Federal Register. By contrast, the proposed $100,000 H-1B fee is not tied to any statutory authority or any cost recovery and would come by presidential proclamation, making it far more vulnerable to legal challenge as arbitrary, excessive, and possibly beyond executive power. In reality, the ‘fee’ if it’s a fee (ambiguity stays) is unfair, excessive, and more like a ban than a real fee, which could make it unlawful.”

The Department of Homeland Security has indicated that the $100,000 H-1B fee may be waived in cases where employing foreign workers is deemed essential to the national interest and poses no risk to U.S. security or welfare. Does this clause offer a light at the end of the tunnel for visa holders?

Attorney Senthurjothi explains, “This exemption can apply to individuals, companies, or entire industries but require formal DHS determination. The process for applying for these exemptions is not yet announced but is expected to be like previous national interest exceptions issued during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In order to preserve American workers, the $100,000 H-1B fee declaration encourages employers to hire U.S. citizens and talks about pay raises in STEM and technology-related sectors. Chavan says, “The approach may improve compliance with labor and national security regulations and increase entry-level employment prospects for U.S. graduates by improving regulatory monitoring and discouraging fraudulent operations.” But there remain significant cons to the order, as Chavan adds, “Employers may be reluctant to prolong or renew visas, which could lead to employment insecurity, and dependent children may ‘age out’ before their parents receive green cards. The charge may cause a talent drain that would reduce American competitiveness in STEM fields by encouraging skilled people to migrate to nations with less complicated immigration laws.”",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/H-1B-crackdown.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 16:57:11.420515

McALLEN, Texas (Border Report) — A new online dashboard gives real-time data on arrests and removals of immigrants by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Immigration Enforcement Dashboard tracks and combines complicated individualized case arrests, detentions, and deportations throughout the United States dating back to September 2023.

According to the data, since President Donald Trump took office in January, through July 29, arrests total 138,068. Since Sept. 1, 2023, there have been 291,668 total arrests.

Monthly arrests peaked in June, at 30,390, and dropped to 23,617 in July, which is the second-most monthly arrests so far during Trump’s second term.

Most of the arrests since January have occurred in Texas — 28,243, according to the data.

The Southwest border states of California and Arizona also have had some of the most arrests — 10,123, and 3,520 respectively. Other states among the top 10 in arrests of immigrants include:

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited.
The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers.
""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.

President Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.

""We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have relied on the program to hire foreign workers.

The plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.

The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.

Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,"" a White House aide said.

Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.

""The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,"" Anderson told CBS News.

Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.

President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.

The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March study from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.

Evett Ellis said the Moorhead Human Rights Commission could have a regular presence in different community spaces.","MOORHEAD — As some city advisory boards are phased out in Fargo, members of a Moorhead board are also questioning their role.

Trenton Gerads, a member of the Moorhead Human Rights Commission, shared his discontent with the board’s lack of action during its Wednesday, Sept. 17, meeting.

“I think as a commission and even as a city leadership group, there isn’t a true direction of what we should be doing, where we should be going,” Gerads said. “I volunteered to be part of this commission because I’m passionate about human rights — I want to see action.”

The commission has taken little action in the last couple of years.

Instead, Human Rights Commission meetings have served as a platform for different cultural organizations and community services to present on their work. Recent presentations included an immigration lawyer, the Indigenous Association and CASA, a Latino cultural organization.

In 2024, the Human Rights Commission unanimously voted to pass a resolution asking for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. That resolution was passed up to the Moorhead City Council, where it was narrowly approved.

The commission also gives out awards throughout the year, including the Moorhead Human Rights Award and the Destiny Holiday Community Champion Award.

In the past, the commission was involved in activities in Moorhead like Pride in the Park, Juneteenth celebrations and Pangea, a cultural diversity celebration.

The seven-member volunteer commission, as it exists today, was formed in 2017. The board was reformed after a two-year hiatus due to declining membership and low attendance at meetings.

The commission’s purpose is outlined in a 2017 ordinance:

“The purpose of the commission is to secure for all persons, whether residents or visitors, equal opportunity in education, employment, housing, public accommodations, and public services, and full participation for all Moorhead citizens in the affairs of this community.”

The duties of the board, as outlined by the rules of practice and procedure, include hosting an annual fair housing event, giving human rights recognitions and advising the mayor, Moorhead City Council and city manager on human rights issues and policies to “provide for full and equal opportunity in the community.”

The rules say people can bring human rights complaints to the Moorhead Human Rights Commission, but they will be referred to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.

Moorhead Governmental Affairs Director Lisa Bode said the Moorhead Human Rights Commission first met in 1990, when the Minnesota Department of Human Rights was encouraging cities to form human rights commissions.

In early years, the board focused on embracing cultural diversity, Bode said. It also adopted sexual orientation as a protected class in the city before the state of Minnesota.

""That was leadership at the time,"" Bode said.

The role of the Human Rights Commission is a policy matter for the city, and the Moorhead City Council has not discussed modifying the commission, she said.

During Wednesday’s meeting, Gerads said he wants to see more action out of the board.

“Frankly, I’m getting a little tired that every time I come to a meeting the only thing we really have action on is our minutes,” Gerads said.

He suggested the commission could educate community members about what human rights infringements look like. Member Anna Rajesh agreed.

“I feel like there’s plenty that we should be doing, and that many people’s human rights may be being violated, because they might not know that these are my human rights and that I should be standing up for myself for that,” Rajesh said.

Members suggested ways the board could reach more people. Evett Ellis said the Moorhead Human Rights Commission could have a regular presence in different community spaces. Moorhead City Council member Sebastian McDougall proposed collaborating with the Fargo Human Rights Commission.

Board chair Jenifer Cannon suggested the board set aside time during the next meeting to continue the discussion.

Across the river in Fargo, city advisory boards have had similar conversations about their roles. This summer, the city of Fargo voted to disband two advisory boards: the Sustainability and Resiliency Committee and the Police Advisory and Oversight Board.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/7f43a9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4115x2833+0+0/resize/1548x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F0d%2Fbb482e4a484f990bfcf64e0076a1%2Fimg-3604-copy.JPG,N,,2025-09-20 15:57:15.266572

WASHINGTON – Today the Department of Homeland Security, via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), followed up on instructions that it sent last week to attorneys general of the states of California, Illinois, and New York to confirm whether they will protect the American people and cooperate with ICE to detain criminal illegal aliens, or whether they will allow thousands of criminal illegal aliens back into American communities.

On September 10th, 2025, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons instructed relevant state officials to respond within two days to indicate whether they intended to honor thousands of ICE detainers on criminal illegal aliens within their jurisdictions or whether they would continue to place their states in danger.

These detainers request that these jurisdictions notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are to be released from jail or prison to ensure the safe transfer of portable criminal illegal aliens into ICE custody. Failure to honor these detainers has led to numerous illegal alien murderers, rapists, and pedophiles being released back into California, New York, and Illinois communities.

ICE received responses from Illinois and New York that underscored their refusal to honor ICE detainers. California did not respond.

Yesterday, ICE sent follow-up letters to these jurisdictions, letting them know that while ICE would prefer to work in cooperation with them, ICE will engage with the Department of Justice and other Federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures to end their inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction of the apprehension and removal of criminal illegal aliens. The Illinois Attorney Gerneral's office refused to accept the letter.

“These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities — threatening the American people’s lives and wellbeing,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE detainers ask for something very simple: To notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are released from jail or prison, to ensure that they go into ICE custody before they are released back onto our streets. These sanctuary state politicians should do the right thing and side with law-abiding Americans over criminal illegal aliens.”

The Trump Administration has consistently targeted the worst of the worst illegal alien criminals across the country. However, open border politicians in states like California, Illinois, and New York endanger their fellow citizens by refusing to honor ICE detainers against criminal illegal aliens endangering not just their own residents, but all Americans.

Over the years, these and other sanctuary state policies have impeded the Federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and have enabled thousands of violent criminals to prowl our neighbors, directly threatening innocent American citizens.

Despite that resistance from sanctuary politicians across the country, DHS has so far arrested more than 400,000 illegal aliens – 70% of whom arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.

Below are just a handful of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who were RELEASED back on the streets because of these reckless sanctuary policies:

If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.

H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.

Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “all big companies” are on board.

Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.

Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because “it’s just not economic anymore.”

“If you’re going to train people, you’re going to train Americans.” Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. ""If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.”

Trump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.

The “Trump Platinum Card” will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card.

Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.

Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it “the next best thing” to abolishing the visas altogether.

Doug Rand, a senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the proposed fee increase was “ludicrously lawless.”

“This isn’t real policy — it’s fan service for immigration restrictionists,” Rand said. “Trump gets his headlines, and inflicts a jolt of panic, and doesn’t care whether this survives first contact with the courts.”

Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval.

Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.

Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.

As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.

First lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.

In 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.

Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.

Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.

The 38-year-old city resident was one of three activists arrested by police on Friday, Sept. 12 after allegedly refusing to leave the front steps of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office on District Avenue in Burlington. Lawton-Sticklor, Nathan Philips of Auburndale, and Eleanor Reid of Hanover, New Hampshire, were scheduled to be arraigned in Woburn District Court on Friday but Reid’s arraignment was continued to March 12 and Philips and Lawton-Sticklor are both scheduled for an Oct. 24 pre-trial appearance.

It was Lawton-Sticklor’s first time at the Burlington ICE facility, the site of ongoing large-scale protests that have been taking place regularly for some time, gatherings she said are “such a testament to how horrid the place is.” She disclosed that she has heard reports of “hundreds” of people being kept overnight at the facility “even up to 20 days,” including children.

“Young people, kids taken…have shared their experiences,” she said. “It’s a zoning violation. That building is not designed to hold people overnight.”

She and the other two people were trying to deliver baskets of food — sandwiches, granola bars, fruit, and other snacks — to the immigrants at the Burlington field office after hearing reports of detainees not receiving adequate nutrition and sleeping and living in poor and unsanitary conditions.

“It’s sad that we are at a point where it is acceptable to withhold and food and other basic necessities for people while they are being detained,” Lawton-Sticklor said earlier this week.

When asked what moved her and Philips and Reid to bring baskets of food in the hopes that they would get to the immigrants inside the building, she stated “knowing people are hungry.”

“It’s a simple solution,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “If people are having food withheld from them and the state and government is not going to do anything, community members can.”

What transpired that Friday morning according to her is that they arrived at the facility and went up to the door and knocked. When a security guard came out, they told him they were there to visit people and had food for them. The guard told them they weren’t allowing visitation and do not accept food or donations.

“We said we were happy to wait if they wanted to check with a supervisor,” Lawton-Sticklor said.

So, they sat down on the steps, “careful not to block the door,” and patiently waited.

During the 90 minutes they were there they saw four or five people who went into and came out of the building for immigration appointments.

“We also saw several transport vans and ICE vehicles going in and out of the parking lot,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “It was unclear if there were people in them.”

Some time later, activity picked up.

“Several federal agents interacted with us. One lost his temper and started recording us with his phone,” Lawton-Sticklor said, adding that another federal agent told the media gathered there “to (obscenity) off.”

She reported that the first federal agent who came out — whom she believes it was Homeland Security Investigator Sarette named in the police report, although she is “not 100% sure” because he did not introduce himself — was the one who “yelled at us and recorded us and told us to leave.”

“We were already sitting down on the steps, and he grabbed the baskets of food out of [Nathan’s] hands and dumped them on the ground across the parking lot,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “He grabbed one of my arms to move me and then tried to grab me under my arm, [but] he was not successful in not moving me. It was hurting so I lifted my arms to alleviate the pressure.”

No public information on Sarette exists as government agent at the Burlington facility according to an online search. Lawton-Sticklor then said that another federal agent who took his place “was much more calm and regulated.”

“They kept repeating that they can’t accept outside food and we said we would be happy to leave once we were let in to see if our community members were ok,” she said. “We emphasized that the food was sealed and in single-size packaging to account for food safety, but they were adamant that they didn’t want anyone coming in or giving anyone outside food. At no point did they tell us no one was there.”

The Burlington police were then called. Lawton-Sticklor said there were two police officers “next to us the whole time” and she estimates four other police officers were also present.

“They tried to bargain with us,” she said. “They wanted us to move across the parking lot to the grassy area where other people have gathered. We let them know we would be happy to leave of our own volition and that it wasn’t our intention to stay, we just wanted to deliver the food. They declined to help us get access and eventually they let us know we were under arrest for trespassing.”

They were handcuffed and brought to the Burlington Police Station and later released on the condition they stay away from the Burlington office.

One piece of good news that came out of Burlington is that Honduras immigrant Blanca Martinez, who has been at the center of the protests there that have drawn hundreds of people weekly, was granted a one-year stay from removal following a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment on Sept. 16, four days after the trio was arrested.

About 500 people came to support Martinez at the immigration office in Burlington, including Massachusetts state Rep. Manny Cruz, Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo from her hometown, and Bishop Julia Whitworth of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. The outcome was a huge relief for the protesters who have been backing her and Martinez herself, who had previously received denials on appeal in her asylum case.

Lawton-Sticklor called the support for Martinez “a testament to people showing up.”

“The more people who are showing up for their community members, the harder it is for them to take advantage of people,” she said.

She stated that there has been “a big community effort, even from public officials, to get inside the building in Burlington that is rented to Homeland Security by the landlord who owns it but “they have been denied.”

Lawton-Sticklor also said that the police report detailing their exchange with ICE agents that day “is inaccurate.”

“The ICE officer who roughed me up, he reported he had interacted with my male friend and tried to escort him off the property and he initially went limp and that’s just not true,” she said. “Police said arrest was our ultimate goal, which is not true. Our goal was to get in there and give food to people and if we had been able to do that, we would have left.”

When speaking on Wednesday, she said her back and shoulder were still a bit sore from the encounter.

“I’m feeling a little bit better, but the activity definitely wrenched my back.”

What is harder to put into words is the feeling of despondence in light of what happened.

“I was just sad thinking about the people that are in there not knowing that we were outside trying to get to them and bring them food and how much we love them and care for them — and that their human rights should be respected,” she said.",https://www.lowellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sen-l-nastasiaICEarrest09192025-01.jpg?w=1024&h=1334,N,,2025-09-20 15:57:30.231598

… But we need a work permit process” that serves the needs of employers and workers, Ochoa Bogh said.
So it’s not entirely surprising that a bipartisan congressional immigration reform bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, was introduced in July by a Florida Republican and a Texas Democrat.
“I said to them, ‘You can’t keep your eyes closed and say this is what it should be, when there are certain realities we have to navigate.” So what are the chances of progress on immigration reform?","When I wrote last week about how immigration raids are targeting far more laborers than criminals, and whacking the California economy at a cost to all of us, I was surprised by the number of readers who wrote to say it’s high time for immigration reform.

The cynic in me had an immediate response, which essentially was, yeah, sure.

Bipartisan attempts failed in 2006 and 2014, so there’s a fat chance of getting anywhere in this political climate.

But the more I thought about it, nobody has done more to make clear how badly we need to rewrite federal immigration law than guess who.

President Trump.

Raids, the threat of more raids, and the promise to deport 3,000 people a day, are sabotaging Trump’s economic agenda and eroding his support among Latinos. Restaurants have suffered, construction has slowed and fruit has rotted on vines as the promised crackdown on violent offenders — which would have had much more public support — instead turned into a heartless, destructive and costly eradication.

I wouldn’t bet a nickel on Trump or his congressional lackeys to publicly admit to any of that. But there have been signs that the emperor is beginning to soften hard-line positions on deportations of working immigrants and student visas, sending his MAGA posse into convulsions.

“His heart isn’t in the nativist purge the way the rest of his administration’s heart is into it,” the Cato Institute’s director of immigration studies, David J. Bier, told the New York Times. Despite the tough talk, Bier said, Trump has “always had a soft spot for the economic needs from a business perspective.”

So too, apparently, do some California GOP legislators.

In June, six Republican lawmakers led by state Sen. Suzette Martinez Valladares (R-Santa Clarita) sent Trump a letter urging him to ease up on the raids and get to work on immigration reform.

“Focus deportations on criminals,” Martinez Valladares wrote, “and support legal immigration and visa policies that will build a strong economy, secure our borders and protect our communities.”

Then in July, a bipartisan group of California lawmakers led by State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh (R-Yucaipa), followed suit.

Ochoa Bogh urged “immediate federal action … to issue expedited work permits to the millions of undocumented immigrants who are considered essential workers, such as farmworkers who provide critical services. These workers support many industries that keep our country afloat and, regardless of immigration status, we must not overlook the value of their economic, academic, and cultural contributions to the United States.”

Ochoa Bogh told me she heard from constituents in agriculture and hospitality who complained about the impact of raids. She said her aunt, a citizen, “is afraid to go out and carries a passport with her now because she’s afraid they might stop her.”

The senator said she blames both Democrats and Republicans for the failure to deliver sensible immigration reform over the years, and she told me her own family experience guides her thinking on what could be a way forward.

Her grandfather was a Mexican guest worker in the Bracero Program of the 1940s, ‘50s and ‘60s, ended up being sponsored for legal status, and eventually moved his entire family north. Since then, children and grandchildren have gone to school, worked, prospered and contributed.

If Trump were to respond to her letter and visit her district, Ochoa Bogh said, “I would absolutely have him visit my family.”

Her relatives include restaurateurs, the owners of a tailoring business, a county employee and a priest.

“We don’t want undocumented people in our country. … But we need a work permit process” that serves the needs of employers and workers, Ochoa Bogh said.

Public opinion polls reflect similar attitudes. Views are mixed, largely along party lines, but a Pew study in June found 42% approval and 47% disapproval of Trump’s overall approach on immigration.

A July Gallup poll found increasing support for immigration in general, with 85% in favor of a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors, and 60% support among Republicans for legal status of all undocumented people if certain requirements are met.

So it’s not entirely surprising that a bipartisan congressional immigration reform bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, was introduced in July by a Florida Republican and a Texas Democrat. It would allow legal status for those who have lived in the U.S. for five years, are working and paying taxes, and have no criminal record.

Victor Narro, project director at the UCLA Labor Center, isn’t optimistic, given political realities. But he’s been advocating for immigration reform for decades and said “we need to continue the fight because there will be a time of reckoning” in which the U.S. will “have to rely on immigrant workers to assure economic survival.”

“Germany had to resort to guest worker programs when birth rates declined,” said Kevin Johnson, a former UC Davis law school dean. “We may be begging for workers from other nations in the not too distant future.”

“No side wants to give the other a victory, but there have got to be ways to close that gap,” said Hiroshi Motomura, a UCLA immigration scholar whose new book, “Borders and Belonging: Toward A Fair Immigration Policy,” examines the history and causes of immigration, as well as the complexities of arguments for and against.

“Practically and politically, there’s potential” for reform, Motomura said, and he sees a better chance for rational conversations at the local level than in the heat of national debate. “You’re more likely to hear stories of mixed families … and that kind of thing humanizes the situation instead of turning it into a lot of abstract statistics.”

Ochoa Bogh told me that when she wrote her letter to Trump, the feedback from constituents included both support and criticism. She said she met with her critics, who told her she should be focused on jobs for citizens rather than for undocumented immigrants.

She said she told them she is all for “American people doing American jobs.” But “we have a workforce shortage in the state in various industries,” and a U.S.-born population that is not stepping up to do certain kinds of work.

“I said to them, ‘You can’t keep your eyes closed and say this is what it should be, when there are certain realities we have to navigate.”

So what are the chances of progress on immigration reform?

Not great at the moment.

But as readers suggested, a better question is this:

Emergency dispatch data reviewed by The Times show a major decrease in LAPD calls for service in June, during the weeks when sweeps by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies were met by large street protests in downtown Los Angeles.

In a city where roughly a third of the population is foreign-born, the steep decline in calls adds to long-standing concerns from advocates that aggressive immigration enforcement leads to domestic abuse and other crimes going unreported because victims fear triggering deportations.

In the two weeks after June 6, when the immigration raids kicked off, LAPD calls for service fell 28% compared with the same period last year — an average of roughly 1,200 fewer calls per day.

LAPD officers responded to roughly 44,000 calls for service in that two-week span — versus nearly 61,000 calls during the same days in June 2024.

The calls include reports of serious crimes, such as home break-ins and domestic disputes, along with instances when the public has sought help with noisy neighbors, loud parties and other routine matters.

The data analyzed by The Times do not include all 911 calls — only LAPD calls for service, which are typically registered when a squad car is dispatched. Though multiple people may call 911 in connection with a single incident, in most cases only one LAPD call for service is recorded.

The decrease was especially noticeable for LAPD calls responding to suspected domestic violence and other incidents related to family disputes, which fell this year by 7% and 16%, respectively, after the ICE activity increased. Although family-related calls later began to creep back to 2024 levels, those for domestic incidents kept declining.

National experts said the findings reflect a crisis of public confidence that has followed other controversial incidents. Similar downturns in calls to local police occurred during the first Trump administration, after the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and following the fatal shooting six years earlier of Michael Brown, a Black 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Mo.

It’s hardly surprising that the same thing could happen even in a city where the police force is majority Latino and whose leaders have reaffirmed the city as a sanctuary for immigrants, said Vida Johnson, an associate law professor at Georgetown University.

“You’re going to see fear of law enforcement that is going to last generations,” Johnson said. “And that has the biggest impact on women, because women often are more likely to be victimized, and then more afraid to call for help than men.”

At least some of the decline during the initial two-week period can be explained in part by LAPD going on citywide tactical alert, which allowed the department to have more officers and resources at the ready to deploy to the front lines of the protests. During that time, the department prioritized responding to serious crimes such as shootings and robberies, leading to many other less urgent calls going unanswered.

But that doesn’t explain why calls for service remained down after the department returned to its normal operations. While police call levels began to rise again later in June and early July, they still remained down roughly 5% from the same period in 2024.

The decrease in calls was less pronounced in the nine police districts in South L.A., the San Fernando Valley and the Eastside where Latinos make up the majority of residents, but the data show a persistent dip in domestic violence calls in those areas that remained in the weeks after the immigration enforcement campaign began.

Police calls for service have been on a slow decline for years, a phenomenon that has coincided with a drop in overall crime. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell and other leaders have tried to emphasize in public remarks that local cops are not allowed to enforce civil immigration laws and only work with federal agents to arrest criminal suspects or quell unrest that threatens public safety.

But Carlos Montes, a longtime organizer with the Boyle Heights-based immigrant advocacy group Centro Community Service Organization, said the sight of LAPD officers standing alongside the feds during recent operations has ensured that even more Angelenos will think twice about calling the police for help.

“In general, in the neighborhood we don’t want to call the cops because they’re not going to solve anything or they’re going to arrest someone, or beat someone or shoot someone,” he said.

LAPD Assistant Chief German Hurtado, the department’s immigration coordinator, acknowledged that it has been a struggle to reassure the public it’s safe to call the police.

“Police are also the most visible form of government, and right now people are not trusting the government,” Hurtado said in an interview last month. “People [are] scared to be deported, and that’s totally understandable. That’s something that we’re going to have to deal with and figure out a way to heal with the community.”

In response to what he called “negative publicity” around the LAPD’s actions in recent weeks, he said the department was stepping up its outreach efforts in various immigrant neighborhoods, with a series of planned listening sessions and other events aimed at educating the public.

The department recently launched a citizens academy for Spanish speakers, and senior lead officers have been out meeting with faith and community leaders trying to get them to reinforce the message that police need victims to cooperate in order to solve crimes.

Marielle Coronel, 24, co-owner of a boxing gym in Sylmar, said she worries about being profiled while being out and about, which has also made her think twice about calling police.

Even though she believes that at least some police officers are trying to help, she said the last few months have been unnerving. She recalled how her parents recently gave her a version of “the talk” that many parents of color have with their children about how to deal with police. Their fears have grown to include unidentified masked men posing as ICE agents, Coronel said.

Her parents insisted that she start carrying her passport with her everywhere she goes and that she not lower her window to anyone unless they clearly identify themselves. Tending to her gym’s front desk one recent afternoon, she said she has taken the advice to heart.

“Even if I am a U.S. citizen, you just don’t know,” she said. “We don’t feel like we have backup from the government.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0a2e85/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3113x1634+0+229/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2F7e%2F2b719a9645048ee28635dae65ba9%2Fimmigration-raids-los-angeles-61557.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:57:33.470394

Donald Trump and his closest allies have periodically threatened immigrant rights activists and nonprofits, including those that distribute food and water to migrants or provide immigrants with legal services, with arrest. But their rhetoric has been heightened in the days following the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk this month.

Over the last week, JD Vance described civil rights groups as a “domestic terror movement”, while Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide and the architect of the US president’s mass deportation agenda, vowed that the administration would hold nonprofits, including immigrant-rights and police-reform organizations, “criminally liable” for what he baselessly described as “coordinated attacks” on Ice agents.

And on Tuesday, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) followed up with a warning: “Anyone – regardless of immigration status – who assaults an Ice officer will face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meanwhile, has expanded its definition of “threats” to include the filming Ice operations.

For Brandon Lee, communications director of the immigrant rights non-profit the Illinois Coalition For Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) the threats represented “yet another moment where the Trump administration is attempting to curtail speech, curtail organizing, to scare our people”.

“This is another example of the atmosphere of fear that the administration is trying to create,” said Lee.

Advocates and activists told the Guardian that they are advising staff and volunteers to practice caution while assisting immigrants and filming raids, while also maintaining that they will not “comply in advance” and give up their first amendment rights to document immigration enforcement.

ICIRR, which organizes teams to observe raids and help the families of those affected access legal aid and other resources, has always “been operating within the boundaries of the law”, Lee said.

“In our rapid-response teams, our role is not to intervene in Ice operations. Our team members are aware of their rights to film in public spaces, to share information,” he said. The organization tends to send out volunteers in pairs or groups, and advises them to maintain a distance from officers.

Lee said the latest rhetoric from the Trump administration felt “heightened”, but added groups like his have been dealing with these threats for months. “It’s not as if these tactics are different from what they’ve been threatening throughout the year so far,” said Lee. “It’s not the first time they’ve threatened to go after nonprofits. It’s not the first time that they’ve threatened to go after charitable foundations.”

Federal agents have already, increasingly, been arresting elected officials, protestors and bystanders at immigration raids and detention centers. In New York on Thursday, federal agents and local police arrested a total of at least 71 people – including Democratic lawmakers and activists – who were protesting at a federal building where Ice has been detaining immigrants. Lawmakers had requested access to Ice detention cells and were arrested by federal officers inside the building, while another group had attempted to block the garage doors typically used by Ice to move vans carrying detained immigrants, and the New York Police Department made arrests.

On Friday, federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse a group of about 100 protesters, including two Democratic candidates for Congress, during a series of early morning clashes outside an Ice building on the outskirts of Chicago, and people were apprehended.

The arrests were part of a pattern of aggressive tactics used against protesters and lawmakers seeking to shed light on conditions inside Ice facilities and demonstrate against the agency’s raids.

In May, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting or impeding federal agents as they arrested the Newark mayor Ras Baraka, who was there with a group of lawmakers trying to observe a detention center. In legal filings, McIver has said the indictment overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and notes that McIver’s actions were part of her authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman.

Several charges against protestors have ultimately been dropped or proved to have been exaggerated. A Guardian review of cases brought against anti-Ice protesters in Los Angeles this summer found that several charges were based on false or misleading statements from law enforcement.

This week, a jury found Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester in Los Angeles, not guilty of assaulting a border agent, after footage from a witness – and published by the Guardian – showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito, whereas there was no footage of Ramos-Brito assaulting the officer.

“We’re in an environment and you see a level of aggressiveness [from Ice and other federal agencies] that perhaps you haven’t seen before,” said Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, a group that advocates for immigrant workers in the city.

And, Gudino said, he expects Ice and the DHS could ramp up arrests of advocates and activists. “The unfortunate assassination of this individual, we feel, is only going to compound the challenges that we’ve been experiencing,” he said. “We’re seeing officials, however opportunistically, are blaming immigrants and advocates for the murder of Charlie Kirk.”

But many immigrant rights and civil rights groups said that at least for now, they are planning to work as normal.

“We’ll continue to serve. We’ll continue to follow. And we’ll continue to do the best that we can under the circumstances. And, you know, we can only hope that, you know, justice and fairness will prevail,” said Melissa L Marantes, executive director of the Orlando Center for Justice, which provides legal aid for immigrants and their families.

That resilience chimed in Texas.

“What gives me a little bit of hope is that – at least in the nonprofit social justice and immigrant justice movement here in Texas – I think we’re tougher than big corporate media and big law,” said Dustin Rynders, legal director, Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit that advocates for a legal advocacy organization. “We’re all fighters.”

And for some groups, particularly those who organized during Trump’s first time in office, the crackdown feels all too familiar.

Project South, an advocacy group based in Atlanta, has for decades helped mobilize communities in the south to push for policy changes, organize protests and provide legal support. In 2020, the group represented an Ice nurse whistleblower who said immigrant women detained at an immigration jail in Georgia were being subjected to non-consensual gynecological procedures, including hysterectomies.

Project South has learned from its experiences from that period, said Azadeh Shahshahani, the legal and advocacy director for the group. Back in 2017, Project South and other groups were surveilled by Ice after they sought to raise awareness about a suicide at a Georgia detention center.

“Instead of cowering in fear, we will continue to organize our communities and protect and defend each other,” Shahshahani added.

This shocking disregard for American workers and their role in our nation's future is unpatriotic.","A new proposal by Senator Jim Banks aims to restructure the H-1B visa system, drastically raising wage requirements and limiting alternatives companies use to hire foreign workers.

The legislation, titled the American Tech Workforce Act, was introduced this week.

Why It Matters

The bill targets what Banks, an Indiana Republican, and other critics call corporate exploitation of immigration loopholes, particularly in the tech industry. An H-1B visa is a temporary, employment-based visa that allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialty fields such as technology, engineering and medicine.

Republicans remain split over the H-1B visa program. While some argue that it displaces American workers and is open to abuse, others view it as a tool to fill labor gaps in sectors such as technology. Opponents frequently emphasize the program's potential effects on U.S. employment.

What To Know

The proposal would increase the wage floor for H-1B visa recipients from $60,000 to $150,000, eliminate the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, and replace the current lottery-based selection process with a highest-bidder system.

Banks argued that the current framework enables large tech corporations to undercut U.S. wages by importing foreign workers en masse.

""Corporations rigged the system to flood the country with cheap foreign labor and drive down wages,"" Banks said in a statement to Breitbart News. ""This bill puts American workers first.""

The American Tech Workforce Act includes three main reforms. First, it increases the minimum required salary for H-1B visa holders from $60,000 to $150,000, which may disincentivize companies to look abroad for talent.

The bill would also eliminate the OPT program, which allows foreign graduates to work in the U.S. for up to three years post-graduation.

Thirdly, the bill replaces the current lottery system with a model awarding visas to the highest-bidding employers, adding a cost-based filter to discourage misuse.

Banks hopes that the changes are essential to address what he calls ""domestic outsourcing.

What People Are Saying

Senator Jim Banks, while serving in the House, in 2022: ""Big Tech is setting aside some of the most lucrative and valuable career opportunities in America and giving them exclusively to foreign guest workers.

""They're cutting out Americans to save a few bucks. It's domestic outsourcing. This shocking disregard for American workers and their role in our nation's future is unpatriotic. We must fix Big Tech's incentives, so they begin putting Americans first.""

What Happens Next

The legislation will now enter committee review in the Senate, where it is expected to face significant scrutiny from business advocacy groups and immigration reform opponents.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2725938/jim-banks.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:57:29.326502

On an early morning in June, 31-year-old Ricardo Calderon left his wife and two children in the family's apartment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, climbed into his car, and began driving off to his job as a roofer.

Moments later, vehicles suddenly blocked him in, Calderon told Law360. Men got out and surrounded his car. A masked man demanded he open the car door.

Calderon said that at first, he refused. But when one of the men threatened to break the window glass with a club, he gave up. He was brought to an immigration enforcement office in Detroit, then a detention center in rural Michigan. Inside the lockup, he hoped his family members could hire an immigration lawyer.

Calderon and his family had already gathered evidence about the gang killing of a relative in their home country, Honduras. They had filed an asylum claim and were scheduled to appear in immigration court for a final hearing in August, he said.

Calderon hoped that if he got a lawyer, he could win release on bond. And maybe, just maybe, he and his wife could win their asylum case and stay in Michigan with their 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter, both of whom were included in the same asylum case.

Calderon waited inside the lockup while his wife and sister talked with immigration lawyers. As weeks passed, his hopes began to fade.

Two immigration law firms refused to represent Calderon, saying they didn't have the resources to take on his case, his sister Esther Calderon later told Law360.

A third law firm was willing to represent Calderon — if the family made an immediate payment of $12,000 — no installments, all the money up front, she said.

The family couldn't afford to pay.

""I started to get more depressed,"" Ricardo Calderon told Law360 in a Spanish-language interview. ""Because my time was running out, and I didn't have an answer, if they were going to help me, and all that.""

As of late July, Calderon had been locked up for weeks, still had no lawyer, and said he had been attacked by gang members inside the detention center. He was facing a deportation order and had no apparent way to fight it.

""So we are just, you know, waiting for a miracle,"" his sister wrote in a July 24 text message to Law360.

As the Trump administration follows through on campaign promises to arrest and deport millions, immigrants are increasingly finding that hiring a lawyer is impossible.

New policies are making immigration cases far harder to win — and far more expensive for lawyers to handle, especially when the clients are already locked up in detention.

Immigration lawyers across the country are overwhelmed with demand. Some immigration lawyers told Law360 that they are routinely turning down clients.

The lawyers also spoke of the mental strain of fighting a government that's bent on deporting as many people as possible.

The increasing inability to find legal representation is a problem not only for immigrants, but also for their U.S. citizen children, who may be detained and expelled along with them, and for other U.S. citizens or authorized immigrants who are swept up in immigration arrests.

The difficulty of hiring a lawyer goes hand in hand with other Trump administration actions against immigrants, including summary arrests of immigrants showing up for court dates and new restrictions that make it harder for immigration judges to grant relief.

The result of these and other federal actions is the same: Immigrants lose.

Under President Donald Trump, more and more immigrants have little to no access to due process — no real chance to prove in court that they deserve asylum protection or another form of immigration relief.

In some cases, they may have no chance to prove that they are an authorized immigrant or a U.S. citizen that the government has arrested by mistake.

Critics like Timothy Snyder, a historian of European dictatorships and mass killings, say the Trump administration's attacks on immigrant due process harm everyone and move the nation closer to authoritarian government.

His argument: If immigrants don't have due process, then no one is safe.

""It is due process, and due process alone, that allows you to demonstrate that you are a citizen,"" Snyder wrote in a blog post earlier this year.

""Without it, the masked men in the black vans can simply claim that you are a foreign terrorist and disappear you.""

Photos of a Corpse

Calderon said the story of his family's emigration to the U.S. began in 2021 in Honduras.

A gang that was active in the area began pressuring family members to join, including his wife's cousin, 29-year-old Cristian Mauricio Meza, who was living with their family.

Calderon said that when the family refused the gang's recruitment efforts, the gang retaliated against the relative.

""So they came and took him from the house where we were living,"" Calderon said. ""And then about two days later, he was found dead.""

His body was in horrific condition. ""They shot him 14 times,"" Calderon said. ""They knifed him and burned him. He was bound hand and foot.""

The gang made threats. ""They told us that we would be next.""

Law360 was unable to verify the account of the killing through news media coverage in Honduras, and Calderon said he no longer had access to documents related to the killing.

However, Honduras has struggled for years with widespread violence and extortion by organized crime groups. The violence, corruption and poverty have prompted many Hondurans to flee.

Calderon and his wife left for the United States with their young son and daughter in October 2021.

After a lengthy journey across Guatemala and Mexico, they finally walked into an official border crossing point at Calexico, California, and requested asylum, Calderon said.

The family's decision to present themselves to border officials and request asylum was a common one.

Border officials often told migrants to appear for a future immigration court date in the U.S. interior, and let them go.

Released from custody, Calderon, his wife and their children took a plane to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Calderon's wife's sister had settled.

Ricardo Calderon went to work as a roofer. After initial immigration court dates in 2023 and 2024, the family's final asylum hearing was set for August 2025 in Detroit, he said.

Calderon and his wife had gathered evidence to support their asylum claim, including details of the killing of his wife's relative.

""We had photos of him, what he looked like when they discovered his body,"" Ricardo Calderon said. ""We had his death certificate. We had some audio recordings that we received in Mexico from the same gang.""

Immigrants from Central America often lose their asylum cases. One key factor: U.S. asylum law mainly protects people who face oppression from a government, not from a private actor like a gang.

Still, immigration law was changing all the time. Smart attorneys could help clients craft a case that could sometimes win, despite the narrow asylum rules.

That is, if the immigrants could get an attorney. For Ricardo Calderon and his wife, it was proving difficult.

The exact details are unclear, but Calderon's sister in Memphis, Tennessee, shared messages with Law360 that suggest the family's initial asylum application was filed by the nonprofit Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.

But Ricardo Calderon said the family never managed to hire an attorney who could offer them full representation in immigration court.

""No, we didn't have one because the numbers that we called, they didn't answer — and there were some who told us they couldn't take our case, and others who don't take asylum cases,"" he said.

Ricardo Calderon would never make it to the August court date. His June arrest would throw the couple's plans into turmoil.

Slimy Beans in a For-Profit Prison

It's unclear why the authorities arrested Calderon. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't make an official available for an interview.

But the Trump administration is arresting and detaining thousands of people in the U.S. interior.

The president has painted this as a necessary step, portraying immigrants as bloodthirsty criminals, but the data doesn't back up his claims. Researchers from the federal National Institute of Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have concluded that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens do. That's true even when the immigrants are in the country illegally.

As of this month, about 59,000 people were being held in ICE detention, and 71% of them had no criminal conviction, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC, which collects and publishes government records.

Calderon and his sister said he has no criminal record. Law360 searched federal and Michigan databases and found no criminal records that matched Calderon's name and date of birth.

After the men surrounded Calderon's vehicle on the morning of June 19, he was brought to an immigration office in Detroit.

He said he was asked to sign a document to accept deportation back to Honduras.

""I told them I wasn't going to sign a deportation agreement, that I wanted to see a judge,"" he recalled.

He said he was transferred to North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, a small town about a 200-mile drive from Ann Arbor.

The prison had been closed until recently, but days before Calderon's arrival, as the Trump administration expanded immigration detention, it was reopened as an immigration lockup run by a private company, the Geo Group Inc.

Calderon said conditions were grim.

""They give you beans with corn. The beans are canned, but all slimy — in bad condition. The first two weeks I was there, I lost weight because the food wasn't good.""

""I lived a very ugly experience there.""

Lawyers Start Saying No

With Calderon locked up, his wife in Ann Arbor and sister Esther Calderon, who lives in Memphis, began calling lawyers.

Esther Calderon shared text messages that appear to show that the family consulted again with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, a nonprofit legal resource center.

Susan Reed, director of the center, told Law360 she can't talk about the Calderon case.

But she said Trump administration budget cuts have cost the nonprofit organization a $375,000 federal grant to run a help desk at the Detroit Immigration Court. A big federal grant to represent unaccompanied children is at risk, too. The instability has prompted dozens of staffers to quit, she said.

Under Trump, the statewide organization has lost roughly half its lawyers — from about 50 attorneys in January to just 27 lawyers now, she said — and it's lost several nonattorney support staffers, too.

Every day, five to 10 people call the organization's free hotline for immigration detainees in Michigan, she said.

And most of those detainees are receiving bad news. Though the nonprofit still offers free legal advice, the organization stopped offering full representation in new detention cases around Sept. 10, Reed said.

""We just really understood we did not have capacity to take new cases.""

She said detention cases are ""incredibly difficult.""

""The detention facilities are far away. People are moved around from facility to facility. Clients don't have access to their paperwork or documents.""

She said the experience of being locked up often leads immigrants to accept deportation. ""And that's something that immigration enforcement authorities understand — that detained people very, very often simply give up.""

She said the situation puts a big emotional strain on the staff.

""And you have to say no to a lot of callers who desperately need our help,"" she said. ""Because there's just no way to sustain and serve people well at a certain point when you're beyond your capacity.""

Unable to find a lawyer through the nonprofit, Ricardo Calderon's wife contacted Farah Al-khersan, a solo immigration lawyer in Ann Arbor.

A paralegal replied in a Spanish-language email.

""Unfortunately, our office lacks the capacity to take on a case like this one, which requires many months in court,"" the email reads in part.

In an interview with Law360, Al-khersan said she can't talk in detail about what happened in Calderon's case due to attorney-client privilege.

But she said detained clients usually need her to prepare a written motion for release on bond and to do the work under ""a huge time crunch.""

It can take days to gather the necessary documents from the detainee's friends and family, such as any marriage certificates, birth certificates of any children, and details about how the family would pay the bond amount.

And Trump has taken steps that restrict judges from releasing immigrants on bond, making the bond request process all but hopeless, Al-khersan said.

Once a judge denies bond, it only gets worse. Immigrants have to wait months in prison for a hearing. Most don't want to do it and accept deportation, she said.

Several times a week, families of detained immigrants contact her office, she said. She almost always turns them down.

""In the last few weeks, I haven't taken a single detained case,"" Al-khersan said.

She's the only attorney in her law firm, and she sees rejecting these cases as a matter of self-preservation. She said she wants to focus on other cases where her help could make a real difference.

""If I could take every case, I would. But I have to prioritize my resources, just to conserve my own sanity and emotional toll that we're all experiencing as removal defense attorneys.""

$150 For an Initial Consultation

The Calderon family contacted another Michigan firm, Immigration Law PLLC, and spoke with a nonlawyer staffer.

""They were asking us to pay $12,000 before they could even start looking at paperwork and all that,"" Esther Calderon said.

For the 27-year-old, who works as an administrator in a health clinic, the financial terms were impossible.

""Because $12,000 is not something that I can just give out, not even on a credit card,"" she said.

The initial consultation alone cost $150, according to a photo of a receipt that she shared with Law360.

It shows the $150 receipt for an initial consultation with Immigration Law PLLC. Law360 redacted Calderon's address in Ann Arbor, Michigan. (Courtesy of Esther Calderon)

The principal of Immigration Law PLLC, attorney Brad Thomson, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Esther Calderon said she regretted that she couldn't help the older brother she'd grown up with in Honduras, part of a big family raised by a single mother.

""I have always felt that I need to look out for him, and he always looks out for me.""

Far Fewer Immigrants Have Attorneys Today

Calderon's wife and sister told him the bad news about the immigration law firms. ""At that point, I began to lose all hope of going free,"" he said.

The stories of immigration lawyers refusing to represent clients might surprise Americans who grew up watching TV shows and movies that depict police officers reading Miranda rights to someone they have arrested: ""You have the right to remain silent ... You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.""

But this right applies in criminal cases. In deportation proceedings, the immigrant generally has no right to a free lawyer. Immigrants must either find a lawyer who's willing to work for free or at a big discount, or gather enough money to hire an attorney for pay.

Without a lawyer, immigrants usually find themselves in an impossible situation: facing off against a trained government attorney who argues for their deportation.

Even children sometimes have to face government lawyers alone. Without lawyers, immigrants almost always lose.

Today, the overwhelming majority of immigrants in deportation proceedings are appearing without a lawyer, according to data from TRAC.

One factor: not enough lawyers. At the start of this year, the American Immigration Lawyers Association counted only about 17,000 members in the U.S.

Even before Trump took office, there were too few immigration attorneys to handle an influx of new immigrants that had swelled the immigration court backlog to 3.3 million cases, TRAC wrote in a January 2024 report.

""Five years ago, noncitizens had found attorneys in 65% of all pending cases in the court's backlog. Today, this proportion has dropped to just 30%,"" the center wrote.

By the 2025 fiscal year, that proportion had dropped even further, to about 23%, meaning that fewer than one in four immigrants now has a lawyer.

It's Happening Everywhere

Stories like the Calderon family's struggle to hire a lawyer are increasingly common, said Jeff Joseph, a Denver immigration lawyer and president of the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

""You have this perfect storm of more demand for services, less able and willing attorneys able to do it, and the cost of providing legal services has also gone up,"" he said.

In addition to the Trump administration's funding cuts to legal aid nonprofits, the federal government is also placing far more immigrants in detention, he said.

The administration has also made it much more difficult for lawyers to represent immigrants who have been detained, Joseph said.

""In the past, if somebody gets arrested and detained, you have a minute to meet with them, figure out why they're being detained, prepare a bond motion and get it before a judge,"" he said.

""Now you don't have a minute anymore. People are getting arrested. They're being moved around from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Attorneys are having to basically follow their clients with habeas corpus motions as they're being moved around from state to state.""

The cost difference is dramatic, he said.

""If you had me estimate, I'd say it's probably three times more expensive to defend an immigration case now than it was under Trump 1.0,"" Joseph said.

And the government won't settle cases through negotiations, he said.

""In every single case, there's no settlement, there's no negotiation,"" Joseph said. ""Every case is going to full-scale war.""

In the long term, Joseph said, the solution is to train more immigration lawyers by encouraging law schools to learn the specialty, and to deregulate some elements of immigration law practice to allow more clients to access resources. In the short term, lawyers are fighting the government in court.

In Memphis, another immigration attorney, solo practitioner Andrew Rankin, said demand for his services is heavier than he's ever seen, and he's likewise rejecting clients. ""It's saturated. I have to turn away one out of every two people that call me.""

""Dead serious. Because I have to manage by my moral code and my ethical code, how much I can take at once.""

Unseen Attackers

Calderon said his first immigration court hearing inside the detention center came on June 27.

In Michigan, detention center hearings usually are held by immigration judges assigned to the Detroit Immigration Court, who often appear by video, said Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for the immigration court system.

Calderon said he told the judge he didn't have a lawyer. He asked the judge if he could leave detention, maybe with a bond or with an ankle monitor.

""Then the prosecutor told the judge no. And then the judge told me he couldn't do it,"" Calderon said.

A few days later, he said, he was sitting outside in a patio area in the detention center when people approached.

""They came up to where I was sitting and then I felt a blow in my back. And when I tried to turn around and look, I felt another blow and I fell over.""

He said he covered his face to protect himself, and he still doesn't know exactly who attacked him or why.

But based on what another detainee said, he believes the unseen attackers were Venezuelan gang members.

Law360 asked private prison company Geo Group to respond to Calderon's statements about bad food and the attack by other detainees.

Company spokesperson Christopher V. Ferreira referred questions to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE didn't respond to requests for comment.

Calderon said he wasn't seriously injured in the attack, but the incident rattled him. He didn't want to be locked up anymore.

On July 16, Calderon arrived for another appearance before the judge at the immigration court within the lockup.

""Then he told me if I wanted to wait for my next court date, I would have to wait there, detained,"" Calderon recalled.

""Or I could ask for my deportation.""

""Because of what had happened to me inside, I didn't want to stay in detention, because of that fear.""

He accepted deportation. An online database confirms that on July 16, he was ordered removed from the United States.

He said he never got a chance to present the evidence from his asylum case: the photos of the corpse, the death certificate, the threatening messages.

He recalled that on the day that he was ordered deported, he was one of 10 detainees appearing before the judge. He said none had a lawyer.

Flying Back in Chains

Calderon's deportation wouldn't take place for several more days. He said he was transferred to Virginia, then Louisiana, where a deportation plane took him to Honduras on July 28.

""To tell the truth, I was crying as I came back. I was crying as I came back because I couldn't believe I was returning once again to the place that I had left, knowing that they [the Honduran gang members] were going to hurt me.""

""So I didn't know what I was going to do. And what's more, I was coming in chains. I came with feet and hands handcuffed, in chains.""

""So I came sad because I had left my family behind, and I didn't know where I was going and where I would stay.""

One of his wife's relatives picked him up from an airport in Honduras and took him to her home.

He recalled all of this — his family's journey to the U.S., his arrest, detention and deportation — during an audio interview from Honduras via WhatsApp.

Calderon said that during the weeks he was locked up in immigration detention, he told his son and daughter in phone calls that he was away working.

Now, he finally told them the truth.

""When I got here to Honduras, I told them to forgive me for not telling them, but now I'm in Honduras.""

""And they started to cry, and told me they wanted to come here with me.""

Around the same time, his wife was packing up his clothes and other belongings to send to him. ""And the boy and the girl said that they could fit in the box too, and that we should send them here, that they wanted to be with me.""

In an Aug. 5 interview — his ninth day back in Honduras — he said he was hiding inside the house, for fear of being spotted by the gang members that had threatened him.

Calderon and his wife hadn't yet decided what to do. They were considering bringing her and the children back to Honduras, then finding a safer place to live somewhere else in the country, he said.

Law360 isn't publishing his city within Honduras in order to protect his safety.

In subsequent text messages in August and September, Calderon declined followup interviews, saying he was busy working.

In the Aug. 5 interview, he said his effort to stay in the United States might have turned out differently if he had a lawyer.

""I say it would have been good. Because the last lawyer who advised my wife said that I could have won my case. Because we had a good asylum claim.""

He sees the situation as fundamentally unfair.

""It's an injustice that they're doing,"" he said.

U.S. District Judge P. Casey Pitts granted a temporary restraining order that requires Columbian asylum-seeker Ligia Garcia to be released from detention at San Francisco’s Immigration Court, where she was held after a Thursday arrest following her immigration hearing.

The American Civil Liberties Union says that the 54-year-old Garcia spent over 24 hours in ICE custody, and reportedly suffers from high blood pressure and is hard of hearing in one ear.

Garcia is one of the four named plaintiffs in an ACLU class action filed Thursday who were either arrested or nearly arrested after an immigration hearing, and is one of two plaintiffs that remain in ICE custody.

Pitts, a Joe Biden appointee, determined that Garcia’s Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated by her detention and her release will have minimal impact on the government.

“Because Ms. Garcia has resided in the United States for 18 months — certainly long enough to ‘begin to develop … ties’ and become ‘a part of our population’ — the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections apply to that liberty interest,” Pitt wrote.

Pitt’s order also prevents her re-arrest and detention, “without first providing her with a pre-detention bond hearing before an immigration judge at which the government establishes by clear and convincing evidence that her detention is necessary to prevent her flight or to protect the public,” the judge said.

However, Pitts did deny another named plaintiff, Yulisa Alvarado Ambrocio, a temporary restraining order because she is not currently detained. The ACLU said in its complaint that intervening attorneys negotiated with ICE agents against her arrest, because she is currently breastfeeding an infant.

During that negotiation, ICE agents reportedly required Alvardo Ambrocio to check in every six months and did not guarantee she wouldn’t be arrested at her next hearing on October 16.

According to the ACLU, one plaintiff, Martin Hernandez-Torres, is currently still detained, and has been since Wednesday — well over the 12-hour limit ICE waived in June, “without making changes to its operational procedures and practices necessary for longer-term incarceration consistent with constitutional requirements, such as providing people with a place to sleep, access to hygiene products, or access to prescribed medication,” the ACLU claims in its Thursday suit.

Hernandez-Torres and Garcia seek to represent a class of people “who are or will be subjected to inhumane and punitive conditions at 630 Sansome and ICE’s arbitrary and capricious policy permitting the detention of immigrants in temporary holding rooms for up to 72 hours,” the ACLU says.

“Arresting people when they come to court is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, not a constitutional democracy. It undermines the very foundation of our legal system. The plaintiffs in this case include community members who are following the law by coming to court, only to be arrested. Coupled with the horrific conditions at 630 Sansome, these policies represent a profound breakdown of the rule of law,” Nisha Kashyap, Racial Justice Program Director for Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, said in a Thursday statement.

The ACLU is joined in filing the suit by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco and CARECEN, an immigrant legal services center.

The Thursday complaint follows an Aug. 1 petition for writ of habeas corpus filed for named plaintiff Carmen Aracely Pablo Sequen, who was similarly detained by ICE but released after a day.

The defendants of the case — including Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi, among other San Francisco ICE officials — must show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued in favor of the plaintiffs at the next hearing on September 30 in San Jose.

The town hall, which was at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, was coordinated by several elected officials representing the Lafayette area, including state Sen. Brach Myers, state representatives Annie Spell and Josh Carlson, and Lafayette city councilwoman Liz Webb Hebert.

The elected officials were asked about whether they supported several immigration proposals in the Louisiana legislature, including HB 436, which would limit non-legal residents from certain legal remedies in car crashes.

“If someone is not of legal status, they are not legally driving around, in the field of insurance it's a hard argument to say that that person should be awarded damages the same way that a person who has legal status is,” Spell said.

Carlson echoed the statement saying, “If you’re not in the country legally, and you hit someone, then I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that you don't have the right to recover.”

These comments drew pushback from attendees.

“Any human being in this country and in this state has human dignity,” said Brooke Arceneaux, one of several community members in attendance to challenge statements made by the legislators on the topic. Arceneaux went on to compare the legislation to alleged human rights violations at an immigration detention center in Basile.

“At the Basile detention facility there are documented cases of abuse from the warden… he sexually abused them, allegedly. Just because someone isn't a legal citizen of Louisiana, do they have no rights?”

Spell pushed back.

“I see sexual assault as very different from a car accident,"" she said. ""In statute, if a sexual act occurs to any human being, legal status or not, there's prosecution.”

This led to a tense exchange between Spell and an attendee that ultimately segued into the town hall’s abrupt end.

“You're denigrating them (non-legal residents) by calling them an economic issue… We're talking about human beings here… and what rights and responsibilities we have towards them as a society. We're asking you for your opinion on that, and what we're hearing back is talk about insurance,” the attendee said.

Spell responded: “The bills that were addressed were specifically regarding access to services and so I was speaking to that.”

Car insurance was also a focus of discussion.

One attendee, who was involved in an automobile crash with an uninsured driver earlier this year, asked about the possibility of requiring insurance agents to to let policyholders know about the existence of Collision Deductible Waivers (CDW) that can be added onto their policy whenever significant changes are made to the plan. CDW's are waivers in which automobile insurers will cover deductibles in cases where the party at fault is uninsured.

“I was called to public service to solve problems like this,"" said Myers, who serves on the Senate Insurance Committee. ""When I hear from you that that’s an issue, to me that’s an issue now that we’re going to solve.""

On the question of lowering auto insurance rates, Hebert touted various LCG policies aimed at reducing the number of crashes, which she said will lead to lower rates.

“We ran a campaign at various intersections within my district,"" she said. ""We’re installing more and more flashing speedometers. These are effective ways of slowing people down.”

The legislators were also asked about gerrymandering in the state in light of the ongoing Supreme Court case over Louisiana’s current congressional district map, which features two majority-minority districts, and whether the current map in their view is gerrymandering along racial lines.

“Where the Constitution provides guidance, where the Supreme Court provides guidance, that’s the guidance we need to follow,"" Myers said.

In addition to questions and public comments, the legislators used the opportunity to tout several recent changes to the structure of the Louisiana government, as well as promote an upcoming constitutional amendment on the ballot in April, which will allow $2 billion across multiple trust funds to be used for teacher pay raises.

”This is a way to take money that’s generated very little each year for education, and say, ‘let’s pay off debt, let’s free up money at the state an local level, and higher ed, and lay our teach $2,000-$2,500 more a year',"" Carlson said.

The town hall comes as the Louisiana state legislature is currently in between sessions, and could possibly meet for a special session.

The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that the administration wrongly ended Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden's presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration's emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rY40ukO9Gqx1M8azzmgSHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/fb5e9dfec30b1ab1b7894b35026c4c8f,N,,2025-09-20 09:58:50.403864

Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.
“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in.
I don't know what to do.’” The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney.
The advocates are also calling on New York State legislators to go into special session to pass the New York for All Act, prohibiting local law officials across the state from colluding with immigration officials.","The immigration raid at a Cato protein bar factory more than two weeks ago continues to have ripple effects through the community. About 50 advocates and allies gathered in Fulton Friday to share how dozens of families have been traumatized by the sudden removal of family members by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE agents. Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.

“We had a lot of folks who were detained, missing for one to two weeks, could not make phone calls to lawyers or their family members,” said Marc Alessi. He’s an organizer with the Syracuse Immigrant and Refugee Defense Network.

“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in. They were shuffled between three or four different border patrol locations to make it harder for them to contact lawyers and families.”

He said they still don’t know the whereabouts of six of the 69 people detained or deported.

Jessica Maxwell is director of the Workers Center of Central New York, and said they continue to hear stories of intimidation and threats the workers faced inside the plant. This includes not only undocumented workers, but those with valid working papers.

“This is really sending shockwaves so that now we are having people call saying, I thought I was safe, but now I don't know,” Maxwell said. “’I have my working papers, but now I'm not sure that's enough. I don't know what to do.’”

The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney. One of them was an adult son who was deported to Guatemala. Melina Ivanchikova is an organizer with Finger Lakes Rapid Response, which jumps into action during urgent immigration situations. She reads a message from the son’s mother.

“’In our household now, we have only one wage earner supporting nine people now that they took my son,”’ the mother said in her letter. ‘“We have two newborns and are going through a lot. We feel fear. Every day we are asking, what is going to happen tomorrow?’”

The family has been in Central New York for nine years. Finger Lakes Rapid Response has launched an online fundraising campaign.

Ana Mendez is Western New York Regional Coordinator for Rural and Migrant Ministry, which is tied to many of the families impacted by the raid.

“We have sat with families who are afraid to open the door when someone knocks. We have heard children crying at night, asking when mama or papa is coming home,” Mendez said. “We have seen families forced to choose between buying food and paying legal fees. And we have witnessed a deep fear and humiliation caused when people are treated as disposable rather than as human beings. This is not about politics. This is about humanity.”

Jessica Maxwell with the Workers Center said they shouldn’t be the only ones speaking out.

“If you're an employer with immigrant workers, then it is your responsibility to take action,” she said. “There should be dozens of employers standing here calling out these abuses and calling for permanent pathways for their workers.”

Nutrition Bar Confectioners is running at a fraction of its capacity after losing so many workers.

The groups also called on local and state elected officials to take action. They want Oswego County lawmakers to pass a no-collusion resolution to prohibit the county sheriff and probation department from supporting immigration-related actions. They were involved in the Cato raid.

The advocates are also calling on New York State legislators to go into special session to pass the New York for All Act, prohibiting local law officials across the state from colluding with immigration officials.

The protest is part of steady pushback against an immigration enforcement surge focused on Chicago and surrounding communities, which has put more federal agents on the streets charged with delivering on President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations. The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that almost 550 people have been arrested as part of an operation that launched just under two weeks ago.

Friday’s protest included dozens of people carrying American flags and signs with the words “Hands off Chicago.” Some participants tried to block a car from exiting the facility’s yard and were met with federal officers who deployed chemical agents that released white clouds that drove the protesters back, according to videos taken outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago.

The Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, which provided legal observers for Friday’s protest, said at least 10 people were arrested by federal agents. They also reported that some people were injured and required hospitalization, according to Brad Thomson, an attorney with the guild.

“Our legal observers saw less-lethal force such as pepper balls and tear gas used indiscriminately against demonstrators, legal observers, and the media,” he said late Friday in an email to The Associated Press.

Earlier in the day, ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin had said in a statement to the AP that three people were taken into custody.

The Broadview site is a two-story building that has been used to temporarily hold immigrants before they’re detained or deported. Its windows have been covered with wood boards for weeks. Protesters have regularly gathered there, including Catholic nuns who pray during vigils.

Friday’s protest drew advocates, residents and Democratic officials or politicians — several of whom were among the protest crowd affected by the officers’ response.

Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate who has joined protesters on several days, told the AP that she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas Friday as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car.

Abughazaleh said officers dragged one of her friends away before others picked her up and threw her on the pavement. Abughazaleh said agents then used tear gas and pepper balls, causing her eyes to run and her throat to burn.

“Protesters were completely peaceful,” she said. “We had no weapons, just signs and songs. We were afraid and angry.”

ICE officials, meanwhile, described the protesters as “rioters” and accused them of assaulting law enforcement, slashing car tires and blocking the entrance of the facility.

Demonstrators gathered outside the building again on Friday evening. Video posted online showed protesters falling back when white smoke filled the air and officers in gas masks exited a gate.

McLaughlin said local police refused to answer multiple calls for assistance from federal law enforcement. The Broadview Police Department did not immediately respond to messages Friday.

Activists and local leaders lately have stepped up pushback to the surge of immigration agents in the Chicago area, aiming to deter agents, warn residents and keep attention on a man killed by an immigration officer last week.

Authorities said agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who had entered the country illegally. They said Silverio Villegas Gonzalez evaded arrest and dragged an officer with his vehicle. The government said the officer fired because he feared for his life.

“They want us to be afraid,” Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Democrat, said in reference to the Trump administration. “They want us to just kind of go into our little corners and not do anything. ... We’re not going to let that happen.”

Experts are concerned that a smaller population could lead to a reduced workforce, higher living costs and a shortage of elder care.

States with aging populations and declining birth rates, like Ohio, may be among the first to feel the negative impacts.

The Trump administration's immigration crackdowns and"" One Big Beautiful Bill"" are driving the United States toward a smaller and slower-growing population, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is projecting.

The prediction has population experts concerned for the nation's economic future, as fewer people in the U.S. means a smaller workforce, as well as higher costs of living and a shortage of elder care.

If the CBO's predictions become true, some experts warn that Ohio would be among the first to feel the impact, as a state with an aging population, dropping birth rates and a declining number of working age people.

""What is disappointing is how counterproductive this all is,"" said Reanne Frank, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, who specializes in immigration and social demography. ""It frustrates me to no end that these demographic facts were not given more attention during the last presidential election.""

What the numbers show

Due to federal actions and new immigration policy, deaths are expected to exceed births in the U.S. starting in 2031, in part because of fewer immigrants having children in the U.S. due to deportations and detentions. The country's population is expected to grow from 350 million to 367 million by 2055, according to the report.

It's a rapid turnaround from their January report, which gave the U.S. until 2033 before deaths would start exceeding births and predicted the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million by 2055.

In the short term, at least 290,000 immigrants are expected to be ""removed"" from the U.S. and 30,000 are expected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023 saw the lowest birth rate in U.S. history, with approximately 1.62 births per woman on record. That’s well below the 2.1 replacement rate needed to maintain the population. Despite that, immigration was expected to help the country's economy stave off any economic or labor issues, according to Michael Betz, an associate professor in Ohio State University’s Department of Human Sciences.

Immigrants typically come to the U.S. to work, meaning they're of working age and likely family-building age, which contributes not just to the economy but also the birth rate — an overlooked benefit of immigration, Frank said.

The CBO acknowledges that these projections could change again as quickly as they did from January, due to legislative or administrative decisions.

Where does Ohio stand?

Roughly 5.5% of Ohio's population is made up of immigrants, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That's far behind the country's 15.4%, though Columbus is at nearly 10%.

Ohio has a population decline problem, according to sociology experts and state officials. A report issued by the Ohio Department of Development in 2023 projects that the state's population will fall by about 675,000 people by 2050, and the lowest number of births on record in Ohio was in 2023.

Betz warned that conversations around immigration crackdowns often put focus on illegal immigration without considering what could be considered ""high skill"" immigration, which he calls ""America's superpower.""

""If it becomes such a hostile environment for all immigrants, then those high-skilled immigrants are less likely to come to the United States,"" he said, adding that the U.S. risks those immigrants taking their talents elsewhere.

""The real issue here is that immigration has once again become highly politicized,"" Frank noted. ""It does not bode well for our country's projected demographic trajectory, as the CBO update shows.""","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/11/NCOD/84142312007-ice-out-protest-ac-026.JPG?crop=4499,2531,x0,y234&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-20 06:56:33.588505

In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.","Washington — The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states this week, warning California, New York, and Illinois in letters obtained by CBS News that refusal to honor immigration detainers could trigger federal legal action.

In letters dated Sept. 10, Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons ordered the attorneys general of the three states to declare within two days whether they would comply with ""thousands of ICE detainers"" lodged against individuals in state custody, according to DHS. Immigration detainers are formal requests by ICE asking local jails and prisons to notify the agency before releasing an individual, and to hold them briefly so federal agents can take undocumented migrants into federal custody.

According to DHS, Illinois and New York formally declined to cooperate. California did not respond. On Sept. 18, Lyons sent follow-up letters obtained by CBS News accusing each state of obstructing immigration enforcement and vowing to enlist the Department of Justice in response. Senior DHS officials tell CBS News the department will tap the DOJ to sue states, blocking future federal funding.

In his follow-up letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Lyons wrote that the state's refusal ""will result in thousands of criminal aliens being released into Illinois communities,"" adding that ""ICE will engage with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures against you.""

Lyons wrote in his letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, ""I take this lack of response to mean that you will continue refusing to honor ICE detainers, resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into California communities.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James received a similar warning after two aides to Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed the state would not expand cooperation, according to DHS.

CBS News has reached out to all three attorney general's offices for comment.

In a statement to CBS News, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote, ""These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities — threatening the American people's lives and wellbeing.""

A DHS spokesperson tells CBS News that the agency has arrested roughly 400,000 undocumented immigrants since the start of the Trump administration, and 70% of those arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.

Among those released by state authorities include undocumented migrants charged with sex crimes on minors, multiple assaults on police officers with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, as well as those with drug trafficking and weapons charges, a DHS spokesperson said.

Federal regulation dictates that immigration detainers instruct local jails and prisons to hold someone for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE can take custody. Historically, federal courts have ruled that these detainers are requests, with some local and state authorities outlawing compliance. Some courts have also found that holding people without a judge's warrant can raise constitutional challenges, citing the Fourth Amendment's protections against unlawful detention.

California, New York, and Illinois have each passed laws limiting compliance with ICE detainers.

California law bars local police from honoring detainers, except for individuals convicted of select serious crimes, while New York law restricts cooperation, requiring judicial warrants rather than administrative detainers to detain undocumented migrants. The New York attorney general's office advises local police departments not to honor ICE detainers unless they are accompanied by warrants issued by judges. Illinois' TRUST Act also prohibits state and local law enforcement from detaining individuals without a judicial warrant.

Supporters of city- and state-level ""sanctuary"" laws typically argue the policies lead to greater trust between local police and residents whose immigration status may make them reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement or report crimes.

But the Trump administration argues ""sanctuary"" policies make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented migrants, prompting the federal agency to send more law enforcement agents into American communities to conduct arrests on the streets. Those operations have drawn protests in major cities like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in recent months, leading to some clashes with ICE and several arrests.

In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.

In his warnings to state attorneys general, Lyons underscored that ICE prefers cooperation but will not allow what he calls ""inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction"" to continue, though he fell short of specifying exactly how the Justice Department will pursue lawsuits or other federal action in the coming weeks.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/21/b8c25668-886b-42b3-a0a4-a72f3ed11e5c/thumbnail/1200x630/36dea2c6a614e46988a9036708eea032/gettyimages-2215060401.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 09:59:03.778651

A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral.
The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working.","On September 6, after months of litigation against the Trump administration, a federal judge ruled that Venezuelan immigrants could renew their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States. However, after the ruling was handed down, only about 20 people gathered to celebrate outside the Arepazo restaurant in Doral, Florida — a focal point of the largest Venezuelan enclave in the country.

“Under normal circumstances, you would have seen 2,000 people here at Arepazo. When [former Venezuela president Hugo] Chávez died [in 2013], 2,500 came and blocked the streets. This shows that people — despite the judge’s decision — aren’t so sure. They say, ‘I’d rather stay home; I’m not going to risk being caught by the police and thrown out of the country.’ There’s fear,” says José Antonio Colina, president of Venezuelans Persecuted in Political Exile (VEPPEX). He speaks with EL PAÍS while sipping coffee at the restaurant, the only one in the area with a statue of Simón Bolívar.

In recent months, the Venezuelan diaspora has seen how the government they once supported appears to have abandoned them. The Trump administration has tried to strip them of Temporary Protected Status and has canceled humanitarian immigration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands to live and work legally in the country. U.S. authorities are detaining asylum seekers in immigration courts, while the official narrative associating Venezuelans with the Tren de Aragua criminal organization is stigmatizing them.

At the same time, President Trump has gone on a war footing against the Nicolás Maduro regime: he has sent warships to the edge of Venezuelan territorial waters and has raised tensions with Caracas to their highest point in years. In the current context, Venezuelans in the United States are presented simultaneously as victims of Chavismo — the political movement that has governed Venezuela since Chávez’s rise to the presidency in 1999 — and as criminals on American soil.

In Doral — a city that’s about 25 miles northwest of Miami — one in three people is of Venezuelan origin. And Trump’s immigration policy has been a tough pill to swallow. The majority of voters in the young city are affiliated with the Republican Party, according to figures from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office.

Many residents sponsored relatives under the Biden administration’s programs. Some beneficiaries have had to leave the country, or are hiding for fear of arrest. Others have been in the U.S. for decades and have been politically active against Maduro’s regime, which would expose them to a serious risk of persecution or retaliation if deported. And all watch in bewilderment as the Trump administration deploys destroyers to combat drug trafficking off the coast of Venezuela — a country that it deems as being safe to return to.

“It’s completely traumatic. It’s one thing to search for undocumented immigrants and another thing to place people in a situation in which they’re not in the country legally,” Colina says. “They’re not seeing us as a community affected by political problems, but as a number of migrants who could be deported to fulfill an electoral promise. The Venezuelan community that voted for Trump voted to remove Maduro from power, not to remove Venezuelans from the United States.”

TPS allows people from countries facing exceptional circumstances — such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises — to live and work legally in the United States. It must be renewed every 18 months. Some 250,000 Venezuelans received TPS in 2021 — including Colina — after years of advocacy to protect those who had fled the Maduro regime and were unable to return, while their asylum cases trickled through immigration courts.

Another 350,000 Venezuelans were granted protection in 2023, when the United States concluded that “extraordinary conditions” persisted in Venezuela and redesignated the country’s citizens as being eligible for TPS. Before leaving office, former president Joe Biden extended TPS until 2026, but in January of 2025, the Trump administration reversed this measure. Immigrant rights groups sued, sparking a legal battle against the government.

Federal Judge Edward Chen blocked the measure this past March. Subsequently, in May, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The court said the government had the authority to terminate TPS, but didn’t suspend the litigation or Chen’s case. In early September, Chen ruled that the government’s move to eliminate TPS was unlawful.

DHS Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin argued in an email to EL PAÍS that TPS “was never intended as a de-facto amnesty program” and that “the Biden administration exploited TPS programs to allow poorly-vetted migrants to gain entry into the country, from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers.” Paradoxically, however, the State Department warns its citizens against traveling to Venezuela due to the “high risk” of insecurity, such as arbitrary detentions, terrorism, and kidnappings, as well as civil unrest and crime.

Johanna is a Venezuelan citizen who came to the U.S. in 2021. She asks that EL PAÍS not reveal her identity, for fear of retaliation from immigration authorities. She tells this newspaper that she has experienced the unrest surrounding TPS in court with anguish. And, even though she applied for the extension, she has lost faith in the system. “We’ll have to see if the government will respect the judge’s decision,” she sighs. She says that, in Doral — where she works as a waitress in a restaurant — there’s a lot of fear. When she drives with her eight-year-old son, the boy looks out the window looking for police officers to warn her, for fear of being stopped.

Following the judge’s ruling, many rushed to renew their TPS before the deadline expired on Wednesday, September 10. However, the website wasn’t allowing the process, causing confusion and panic. On Friday, September 12, the same federal judge ruled that the renewal service must be reestablished.

Judge Chen’s recent decisions have taken many by surprise. “Lots of people have already left the country,” Isamar Torres points out, because they were disappointed or pessimistic. A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral. She believes the government is trying to “clean up” what the previous administration did.

“They want to find every person — regardless of nationality — and remove them. Their problem is that Venezuelans have TPS, meaning that they cannot be deported,” Torres adds. Many of those who entered through the land border “weren’t given due process, because so many people were transiting.” Thus, she affirms, “many criminals entered. Because it’s no secret that Nicolás Maduro’s regime opened all the prisons.” She repeats an argument that Trump has made numerous times, without evidence.

Torres indicates that most of the TPS renewals that her business has put together recently are “from 2021, from people who have been here for many years.” Some have multiple ongoing immigration processes, including asylum applications, so they “waited until the last minute” to renew their TPS. However, some have chosen to leave the U.S.

On Wednesday, September 10, she met a client who had a ticket to return to Venezuela that Friday. “He says he’s afraid and prefers to leave before being deported. He’s a decent person; he paid his taxes on time every year he’s been here. He’s never even had a fine,” Torres says.

That’s what 22-year-old Bárbara Reyes did, returning to Venezuela on April 7, 2025, the same day her TPS expired. Her aunt — a resident of Doral — had sponsored her under the humanitarian parole program. The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working. But she wasn’t able to study.

“I was trying to process the paperwork to study, but it seemed more and more difficult without permanent residency,” she tells EL PAÍS by phone from Caracas. She wanted to enroll at Miami Dade College, but because of her status, she couldn’t receive the in-state discount, which Florida discontinued in March of this year. “With the pressure of Trump coming and starting with the ‘I’m going to kick everyone out’ speech, I said, ‘I don’t want to give all I’ve got to one place just so they can kick me out.’”

Colina says that “criminals came in through the border, but so did good people,” including activists he knows who were imprisoned in Venezuela, as well as former officials “who refused to repress [the population].”

“But unfortunately,” he adds, “this administration doesn’t differentiate between the two. It seems that, in some ways, [for them], Venezuela is politically unstable, but in others, it isn’t.”

The Department of Homeland Security argues that it’s not in the national interest to keep these people in the country, claiming that conditions in Venezuela have improved enough for them to return. But in recent weeks, U.S. ships, warplanes and a nuclear submarine have positioned themselves near the coast of the Caribbean nation, generating tensions. This has led Nicolás Maduro’s regime to mobilize its troops in response.

Colina says that there’s hope among the public that “if they’re removing TPS and are in this operational deployment in the Caribbean, it’s because [the U.S. government] is going to remove Nicolás Maduro from power.” However, while it seems like a “somewhat excessive” deployment to combat drug trafficking, it doesn’t seem sufficient “for an invasion.” Reports indicate that there are currently about 4,500 U.S. troops in the Caribbean.

He finds it contradictory that the government wants to remove TPS under these conditions. “Maduro is still there,” he notes. He also doesn’t believe there’s a plan in place, nor a political opposition that’s ready for a transition of power. “It’s not just about removing TPS and removing Maduro. What about the transition?” he wonders.

Mariana Torrellas — the owner of a jewelry business in Doral — sponsored two relatives under the Humanitarian Parole program. She and her husband arrived in the US 10 years ago with their two children. They’re very grateful for the stability they enjoy. She’s Catholic and joined a foundation called Virgen de Coromoto to help the community.

After the social unrest that began in Venezuela in 2014 — which left dozens dead and thousands injured and detained — she saw her fellow Venezuelans arrive, fleeing with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “We helped them with food, furniture and temporary accommodation while they settled in, because there were people sleeping in the Walmart parking lot,” she recalls. She says that her country has always been supportive and welcoming of immigrants, regardless of where they come from. An estimated seven million Venezuelans have left their country as a result of the crisis.

DHS said in an email that those “whose TPS or parole status has expired — or who are otherwise in the country illegally — should take advantage of the CBP Home self-deportation process,” which supposedly gives migrants a free ticket and $1,000.

Torrellas says it’s not that simple. She knows some folks who have returned to Venezuela — especially young people, including the relatives she sponsored — but there are others who don’t have that option. “Especially families with children,” she emphasizes.

Helene Villalonga — president of the Multicultural Association of Activists, Voice and Expression (AMAVEX) — says that the recent court ruling has been “a respite” for thousands of families who “have lived in uncertainty for years.” However, she vows that they will “continue fighting for a permanent solution.”

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited.
The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers.
""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.

President Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.

""We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have relied on the program to hire foreign workers.

The plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.

The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.

Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,"" a White House aide said.

Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.

""The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,"" Anderson told CBS News.

Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.

President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.

The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March study from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.

“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” he told reporters at the White House.

H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills – such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers – to work in the US, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.

Administration officials said the change to the H-1B programme would ensure that companies would only sponsor workers with the most rarefied skill sets.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.

However, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.

The programme has come under increased scrutiny from the Trump administration amid a wider crackdown on immigration, which the US president has tied to boosting domestic labour.

As part of that campaign, the Trump administration has also sought to introduce more restrictive policies on international students studying in the US, including requiring access to social media accounts and a ban on foreign travellers from several countries.

‘Taxing away innovation edge’

The Trump administration has previously considered changing the H-1B visa rules to favour higher-paying employers, essentially doing away with the lottery system.

Supporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.

Lutnick said on Friday that “all the big companies are on board” with $100,000 a year for H-1B visas.

“We’ve spoken to them,” he said.

He added that the visa would cost $100,000 a year for each of the three years of its duration, but that the details were “still being considered”.

Trump’s move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, said Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

Some analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US’s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China.

“In the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the US risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,” said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.

Others questioned the legality of the new fees.

“Congress has only authorized the government to set fees to recover the cost of adjudicating an application,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director of the American Immigration Council, wrote on Blue Sky.

Under the current system, entering the lottery for the visa requires a small fee and, if approved, subsequent fees could amount to several thousand dollars.

This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas, with more than 10,000 awarded. The company was followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Meanwhile, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of approved beneficiaries. China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to government data.

Bridge Contracts Still Require Justification: Agencies often use bridge contracts to maintain continuity, but they still must comply with FAR rules.","In GovCIO, LLC v. United States, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Nos. 25-809 & 25-913 (August 18, 2025), in one of the first cases to test the impact of a Trump Administration Executive Order on federal procurement, GovCIO and 22nd Century Technologies challenged the IRS’s sole-source bridge contract to Iron Mountain for scanning and digitizing incoming tax filings. The agency had bypassed competition, invoking an “urgent and compelling need” based on Executive Order 14,247, which mandated digital payments and a shift away from paper-based systems by late 2025.

The plaintiffs argued that the agency’s justification was flawed, lacked support in the administrative record, and used the executive order to sidestep full and open competition in violation of procurement law. The Court agreed in part, holding that the Limited Sources Justification (LSJ) failed to adequately explain the link between the executive order and the agency’s urgency claim which is a key legal requirement under FAR 8.405-6.

The Decision

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims sustained the protest, ruling that:

Standing Upheld for Both Protesters: The government and intervenor argued that GovCIO and 22nd Century lacked standing because they had not submitted proposals or demonstrated immediate harm. The Court rejected those arguments, holding that both firms showed they could have competed and were prejudiced by the lack of competition. The Court held that this satisfied both Article III and statutory standing requirements.

Executive Order Did Not Justify the Urgency: While the IRS claimed that the executive order necessitated fast-track digitization, the Court found the LSJ did not actually explain how the mandate for digital payments created an urgent and compelling need for a noncompetitive bridge contract to scan incoming tax documents. The agency’s counsel attempted to explain the connection during litigation, but the Court refused to accept post hoc rationales, citing the well-established rule that agency decisions must be justified in the record, not in briefing.

Digitization Mandate Was Already Underway: The Court noted that the IRS had been pursuing digitization for years through pilot programs and prior initiatives well before the executive order. Therefore, the government could not credibly claim that the executive order suddenly created urgency that would justify a sole-source award.

Remand Without Injunction: Although the Court found the LSJ legally deficient, it declined to enjoin the award. Instead, it remanded the procurement to the IRS for 30 days to either supplement the justification or issue a new decision. The Court noted that halting work on the digitization project would be disruptive and expensive, and a brief remand provided a less drastic, more appropriate remedy.

Key Takeaways for Contractors

Executive Orders Don’t Override Competition Requirements: Even a presidential mandate must be clearly linked to a specific procurement decision if the agency intends to invoke an urgent and compelling need to skip competition. That reasoning must appear in the contemporaneous record.

Post Hoc Justifications Don’t Count: Arguments from agency counsel, no matter how compelling, cannot substitute for what’s missing in the administrative record. Agencies must connect the dots at the time of award.

Standing Is Broader Than You Think: Even if you didn’t submit a proposal, you can have standing if you show that you were prepared to compete but were denied the opportunity due to a flawed procurement strategy.

Remand Without Vacatur Can Be a Win: The Court’s refusal to vacate the award doesn’t diminish the protest’s impact. By identifying legal deficiencies and ordering a remand, the Court forced the agency to revisit its justification and provide transparency.

Bridge Contracts Still Require Justification: Agencies often use bridge contracts to maintain continuity, but they still must comply with FAR rules.

H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.","Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, dealing a potentially major blow to the US tech industry, which relies heavily on workers from India and China.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said at a Friday press briefing that “all the big companies” had been briefed on the new fee.

“A hundred-thousand dollars a year for H-1B visas, and all of the big companies are on board. We’ve spoken to them,” Lutnick said at an Oval Office event with the US president.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” he said.

Trump’s threat to crack down on H-1B visas has become a major flashpoint with the tech industry, which contributed millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. The tech industry relies, more than any other sector of the US economy, on H-1B visa holders. Roughly two-thirds of jobs secured through the H-1B program are computer-related, government figures show, but employers also use the visa to bring in engineers, educators and healthcare workers.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had more than 5,000 approvals each. The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.

Critics of the program, including many US technology workers, argue that it allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs. Supporters, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, say it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive. Musk, himself a naturalized US citizen born in South Africa, once held an H-1B visa.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, wrote on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

The new fee could significantly push up costs for companies, particularly smaller tech firms and startups.

“Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they are going to depart and the company is going to hire an American,” Lutnick said at the briefing. “And that’s the point of immigration. Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people. Stop the nonsense.”

Immigration experts are questioning whether the executive branch has the authority to impose the exorbitant annual fee.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on Bluesky: “the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas. None. Zip. Zilch. The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.”

Under the current system, H-1B applicants pay a small fee to enter a lottery and, if selected, subsequent fees that can amount to several thousand dollars, depending on the case. Nearly all the visa fees have to be paid by employers. H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb, or raise more money from, legal immigration. Last month, the US launched a pilot program allowing consular officers to demand bonds of up to $15,000 for tourist and business visas from countries with high overstay rates or limited vetting data. That followed Trump’s June travel ban restricting entry from 19 nations. Trump’s first-term administration issued several regulations that aimed to limit access to H-1B visas and give them to higher-paying employers, but the regulations were blocked in federal court.

In an emergency request filed Sept. 19, the Justice Department said the high court should pause a federal judge's September ruling that the administration wrongly ended a program that allowed the migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States due to living conditions in their country.

The Supreme Court sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted the federal judge's temporary order to keep the program in place as the case is being litigated.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said the lower courts are disregarding the high court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in his request. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision included no explanation for why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said, the courts have more evidence now to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security ran a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

""Neither we nor the Supreme Court had the benefit of reviewing this evidence when the Government first sought an emergency stay of the district court’s March 31 postponement order,"" they wrote.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

We had speakers talk about how immigrants are being pulled off the street, they’re being pulled out of the courthouse, abducted and deported,” added Lee, a San Francisco native with Chinese ancestry who was shot four times by the Filipino military for his work as an activist. The attack left him paraplegic.

The Filipino government, organizers said in a statement, “has offered little to no assistance to Filipino migrants in detention.” The number of Filipinos in San Francisco immigration court has decreased dramatically since the late 1990s, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

In 2024, 82 Filipinos went through immigration court in San Francisco, down from a high of 531 in 1998, according to TRAC. Across California, migrants from the Philippines are the ninth most populous in ICE proceedings, behind Colombia and ahead of Armenia.

Outside of the San Francisco immigration court, speaker Pilar Castille denounced ICE tactics against her countrymen. “Trump directs ICE agents to terrorize migrant communities to kidnap our people. Filipino migrants are left to languish in ICE detention while the Philippine state washes their hands of responsibility.”

The consulate did not immediately respond to a request for comment but in July said in a statement that allegations of the government neglecting Filipinos in ICE custody were inaccurate. “Consulate officials conducted an onsite visit and welfare check on Filipino nationals” held by ICE, it wrote.

The protest, which was organized by BAYAN USA, the Malaya Movement, ICHRP-US and the Tanggol Migrante Movement, also took aim at the Filipino consulate and denounced the government for corruption, among other things.

The activists started at Union Square around noon and marched towards 100 Montgomery St., San Francisco’s immigration court, before heading to the Philippine Consulate on Sutter Street. The march ended at around 3:30 p.m.",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSCF6335-torehan-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 02:57:08.602687

However, after the ruling was handed down, only about 20 people gathered to celebrate outside the Arepazo restaurant in Doral, Florida — a focal point of the largest Venezuelan enclave in the country.

“Under normal circumstances, you would have seen 2,000 people here at Arepazo. When [former Venezuela president Hugo] Chávez died [in 2013], 2,500 came and blocked the streets. This shows that people — despite the judge’s decision — aren’t so sure. They say, ‘I’d rather stay home; I’m not going to risk being caught by the police and thrown out of the country.’ There’s fear,” says José Antonio Colina, president of Venezuelans Persecuted in Political Exile (VEPPEX). He speaks with EL PAÍS while sipping coffee at the restaurant, the only one in the area with a statue of Simón Bolívar.

In recent months, the Venezuelan diaspora has seen how the government they once supported appears to have abandoned them. The Trump administration has tried to strip them of Temporary Protected Status and has canceled humanitarian immigration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands to live and work legally in the country. U.S. authorities are detaining asylum seekers in immigration courts, while the official narrative associating Venezuelans with the Tren de Aragua criminal organization is stigmatizing them.

At the same time, President Trump has gone on a war footing against the Nicolás Maduro regime: he has sent warships to the edge of Venezuelan territorial waters and has raised tensions with Caracas to their highest point in years. In the current context, Venezuelans in the United States are presented simultaneously as victims of Chavismo — the political movement that has governed Venezuela since Chávez’s rise to the presidency in 1999 — and as criminals on American soil.

In Doral — a city that’s about 25 miles northwest of Miami — one in three people is of Venezuelan origin. And Trump’s immigration policy has been a tough pill to swallow. The majority of voters in the young city are affiliated with the Republican Party, according to figures from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office.

Many residents sponsored relatives under the Biden administration’s programs. Some beneficiaries have had to leave the country, or are hiding for fear of arrest. Others have been in the U.S. for decades and have been politically active against Maduro’s regime, which would expose them to a serious risk of persecution or retaliation if deported. And all watch in bewilderment as the Trump administration deploys destroyers to combat drug trafficking off the coast of Venezuela — a country that it deems as being safe to return to.

“It’s completely traumatic. It’s one thing to search for undocumented immigrants and another thing to place people in a situation in which they’re not in the country legally,” Colina says. “They’re not seeing us as a community affected by political problems, but as a number of migrants who could be deported to fulfill an electoral promise. The Venezuelan community that voted for Trump voted to remove Maduro from power, not to remove Venezuelans from the United States.”

TPS allows people from countries facing exceptional circumstances — such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises — to live and work legally in the United States. It must be renewed every 18 months. Some 250,000 Venezuelans received TPS in 2021 — including Colina — after years of advocacy to protect those who had fled the Maduro regime and were unable to return, while their asylum cases trickled through immigration courts.

Another 350,000 Venezuelans were granted protection in 2023, when the United States concluded that “extraordinary conditions” persisted in Venezuela and redesignated the country’s citizens as being eligible for TPS. Before leaving office, former president Joe Biden extended TPS until 2026, but in January of 2025, the Trump administration reversed this measure. Immigrant rights groups sued, sparking a legal battle against the government.

Federal Judge Edward Chen blocked the measure this past March. Subsequently, in May, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The court said the government had the authority to terminate TPS, but didn’t suspend the litigation or Chen’s case. In early September, Chen ruled that the government’s move to eliminate TPS was unlawful.

DHS Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin argued in an email to EL PAÍS that TPS “was never intended as a de-facto amnesty program” and that “the Biden administration exploited TPS programs to allow poorly-vetted migrants to gain entry into the country, from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers.” Paradoxically, however, the State Department warns its citizens against traveling to Venezuela due to the “high risk” of insecurity, such as arbitrary detentions, terrorism, and kidnappings, as well as civil unrest and crime.

Johanna is a Venezuelan citizen who came to the U.S. in 2021. She asks that EL PAÍS not reveal her identity, for fear of retaliation from immigration authorities. She tells this newspaper that she has experienced the unrest surrounding TPS in court with anguish. And, even though she applied for the extension, she has lost faith in the system. “We’ll have to see if the government will respect the judge’s decision,” she sighs. She says that, in Doral — where she works as a waitress in a restaurant — there’s a lot of fear. When she drives with her eight-year-old son, the boy looks out the window looking for police officers to warn her, for fear of being stopped.

Following the judge’s ruling, many rushed to renew their TPS before the deadline expired on Wednesday, September 10. However, the website wasn’t allowing the process, causing confusion and panic. On Friday, September 12, the same federal judge ruled that the renewal service must be reestablished.

Judge Chen’s recent decisions have taken many by surprise. “Lots of people have already left the country,” Isamar Torres points out, because they were disappointed or pessimistic. A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral. She believes the government is trying to “clean up” what the previous administration did.

“They want to find every person — regardless of nationality — and remove them. Their problem is that Venezuelans have TPS, meaning that they cannot be deported,” Torres adds. Many of those who entered through the land border “weren’t given due process, because so many people were transiting.” Thus, she affirms, “many criminals entered. Because it’s no secret that Nicolás Maduro’s regime opened all the prisons.” She repeats an argument that Trump has made numerous times, without evidence.

Torres indicates that most of the TPS renewals that her business has put together recently are “from 2021, from people who have been here for many years.” Some have multiple ongoing immigration processes, including asylum applications, so they “waited until the last minute” to renew their TPS. However, some have chosen to leave the U.S.

On Wednesday, September 10, she met a client who had a ticket to return to Venezuela that Friday. “He says he’s afraid and prefers to leave before being deported. He’s a decent person; he paid his taxes on time every year he’s been here. He’s never even had a fine,” Torres says.

That’s what 22-year-old Bárbara Reyes did, returning to Venezuela on April 7, 2025, the same day her TPS expired. Her aunt — a resident of Doral — had sponsored her under the humanitarian parole program. The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working. But she wasn’t able to study.

“I was trying to process the paperwork to study, but it seemed more and more difficult without permanent residency,” she tells EL PAÍS by phone from Caracas. She wanted to enroll at Miami Dade College, but because of her status, she couldn’t receive the in-state discount, which Florida discontinued in March of this year. “With the pressure of Trump coming and starting with the ‘I’m going to kick everyone out’ speech, I said, ‘I don’t want to give all I’ve got to one place just so they can kick me out.’”

Colina says that “criminals came in through the border, but so did good people,” including activists he knows who were imprisoned in Venezuela, as well as former officials “who refused to repress [the population].”

“But unfortunately,” he adds, “this administration doesn’t differentiate between the two. It seems that, in some ways, [for them], Venezuela is politically unstable, but in others, it isn’t.”

The Department of Homeland Security argues that it’s not in the national interest to keep these people in the country, claiming that conditions in Venezuela have improved enough for them to return. But in recent weeks, U.S. ships, warplanes and a nuclear submarine have positioned themselves near the coast of the Caribbean nation, generating tensions. This has led Nicolás Maduro’s regime to mobilize its troops in response.

Colina says that there’s hope among the public that “if they’re removing TPS and are in this operational deployment in the Caribbean, it’s because [the U.S. government] is going to remove Nicolás Maduro from power.” However, while it seems like a “somewhat excessive” deployment to combat drug trafficking, it doesn’t seem sufficient “for an invasion.” Reports indicate that there are currently about 4,500 U.S. troops in the Caribbean.

He finds it contradictory that the government wants to remove TPS under these conditions. “Maduro is still there,” he notes. He also doesn’t believe there’s a plan in place, nor a political opposition that’s ready for a transition of power. “It’s not just about removing TPS and removing Maduro. What about the transition?” he wonders.

Mariana Torrellas — the owner of a jewelry business in Doral — sponsored two relatives under the Humanitarian Parole program. She and her husband arrived in the US 10 years ago with their two children. They’re very grateful for the stability they enjoy. She’s Catholic and joined a foundation called Virgen de Coromoto to help the community.

After the social unrest that began in Venezuela in 2014 — which left dozens dead and thousands injured and detained — she saw her fellow Venezuelans arrive, fleeing with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “We helped them with food, furniture and temporary accommodation while they settled in, because there were people sleeping in the Walmart parking lot,” she recalls. She says that her country has always been supportive and welcoming of immigrants, regardless of where they come from. An estimated seven million Venezuelans have left their country as a result of the crisis.

DHS said in an email that those “whose TPS or parole status has expired — or who are otherwise in the country illegally — should take advantage of the CBP Home self-deportation process,” which supposedly gives migrants a free ticket and $1,000.

Torrellas says it’s not that simple. She knows some folks who have returned to Venezuela — especially young people, including the relatives she sponsored — but there are others who don’t have that option. “Especially families with children,” she emphasizes.

Helene Villalonga — president of the Multicultural Association of Activists, Voice and Expression (AMAVEX) — says that the recent court ruling has been “a respite” for thousands of families who “have lived in uncertainty for years.” However, she vows that they will “continue fighting for a permanent solution.”

“TPS is a relief,” she acknowledges, “but it’s not the final goal: we need a path to residency.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WHWGL7GXYVC4ZFYJLNMIAZZXCA.jpg?auth=5404abbc5b9560b4f815d3e342efad7921aa6c4780e175fd76cd5a918dc02d7e&width=1200,N,,2025-09-20 14:57:17.907913
