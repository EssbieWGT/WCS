According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.","At the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling, judges determine whether immigrants from Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota with asylum claims, removal orders or other immigration claims will be legally allowed to remain in the country.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents now wait in the hallways, too, ready to detain individuals whose cases are increasingly being dismissed in a spate of motions from government attorneys.

There are other, more welcoming, faces as well, including a group of individuals who for eight years have been coming to Fort Snelling to sit in on immigration court hearings and monitor them. They are court observers, belonging to Minnesota organization The Advocates for Human Rights.

These observers have been a constant presence in courtrooms, meticulously documenting immigration hearings to maintain accountability in the immigration system. But in October, a change occurred at Fort Snelling. Clerks told court observers and others that hearings were closed, and doors to publicly available courtrooms were locked. Now, in Fort Snelling and immigration courts across the country, observers say they are increasingly being shut out and unable to observe the proceedings.

Closing the courts

The Advocates for Human Rights began their court observation project in 2017, during Trump’s first term, to track immigration court hearings and monitor individual cases. Since then, trained court observers have been a daily presence at Fort Snelling, taking systematic notes on immigration cases and tracking defendants as they progress through the system. For Madeline Lohman, advocacy and outreach director at The Advocates, the project is a tool for upholding democracy.

“Authoritarianism thrives in secrecy,” Lohman said. “The way governments consolidate power at the expense of the people is that they make their decisions in places that you can’t evaluate whether what they’re saying is true or not.”

The Advocates have consistently had volunteers at Fort Snelling Immigration Court since the project began in 2017, though Lohman says the total number increased significantly after Trump was elected for a second term.

Immigration court hearings generally fall into one of three categories: bond hearings, which determine whether a person will remain in detention during their case; master calendar hearings, procedural hearings to establish immigration charges against defendants; and individual hearings, often referred to as merits hearings, where the final decision on an immigration case is made.

Since October, court observers have frequently shown up to court only to be told that hearings of all types are closed to the public. Doors are now locked by default, unless a judge specifically asks for them to be opened.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, though they can be closed in cases where confidentiality is an issue. Judges also have discretion to close hearings to protect any party in the case, witnesses, or the public interest, even if the hearing would otherwise be public. Judges were slow to exercise this power in the past however, with the public generally allowed access to the majority of hearings.

Amy Lange, head of The Advocates’ court observation project, said it was rare for the public to be shut out of master calendar hearings in particular.

“We would see one of those every three months, and now this is on a daily basis,” Lange said. “There are times now when an observer will show up to court and they will say a judge is closing a courtroom for the entire day.”

Lange identified four instances since October where master calendar hearings were closed for at least the entire morning case docket, with hearings being closed the entire day of Oct. 27. She said staff from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which manages the nation’s immigration courts, has cited confidentiality as the reason for closing master calendar hearings, which overwhelmingly deal with pleadings, scheduling, and other matters not specific to an individual’s case.

“I don’t understand why a master calendar hearing would be closed to the public,” she said. “By their definition, they’re procedural.”

Merits hearings have also been increasingly closed to the public. While these individual hearings have historically been more likely to be closed to the public for confidentiality purposes, Lange says it was typically done at the behest of the defendant. She identified at least three instances since October that merits hearings were closed off to the public without individual consideration, including one in which the client’s attorney had granted permission in advance for court observers to be present.

For Lange, this increase in closed hearings raises alarm over court accountability.

“You have to operate consistently, transparently and accountably,” she said. “We have to wonder if that’s happening when closures are unexplained and indiscriminate.”

In addition to closing hearings, case dockets have increasingly been stripped of identifying details, making them difficult to track. Names are frequently removed, making it harder for both the public and respondents to get updates on cases. In the past, these details would be removed only for confidential cases, but this is now happening daily, court observers say.

Fort Snelling security has also replaced EOIR staff as the party responsible for admitting the public into the courtroom. Because these guards are not EOIR employees, they are unable to communicate with judges unless directly called. Lange said this has led to breakdowns in communication between courtrooms and observers.

To date, EOIR has not issued any policies or memos dictating additional closures of public courtrooms. A November fact sheet issued by EOIR says that judges can close a hearing based on a request from any party in the case; if the judge needs to limit attendance; or if closing the court is required by law.

The fact sheet also states that Webex links for hearings are reserved for parties appearing remotely. The public had previously been able to observe hearings remotely.

In an email to Sahan Journal, EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly cited the fact sheet as justification for increased hearing closures although it did not spell out any rationale for the change. She did not respond to Sahan’s questions about why court employees are locking courtroom doors by default and using guards rather than EOIR staff to communicate with judges.

The big picture

Across the country, immigration courts are putting similar restrictions in place.

The Acacia Center for Justice, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit, has been connecting with court observation groups nationwide to coordinate efforts and improve information sharing. According to Katie Fleming, director of public engagement and education, Fort Snelling Immigration Court is not an outlier when it comes to access issues.

Fleming said courts in many states have experienced similar issues. In her home city of Sacramento, there have been blanket denials of public access to court buildings, including the news media. Immigration court officials have also accused observers of loitering or soliciting as justification for keeping them out of the courtroom or courthouse hallways, and they have prohibited observers from talking to respondents in the hallways or sharing supporting resources with them.

Fleming said that court restrictions are being enforced inconsistently, even within the same state. To Fleming, these actions serve a clear purpose.

“It is my understanding and my belief that the administration is trying to limit public access to courtrooms because court observers can and will hold them accountable for due process violations,” she said.

Fleming added that court observers can make a tangible impact on cases.

“It can have an effect on the outcome of the case to have folks in the courtroom,” she said. “Whether it helps judges to be on their best behavior or be more thorough or the government attorney to be on better behavior, it is important to have those observers present.”

Observers from The Advocates for Human Rights will continue showing up at Fort Snelling Immigration Court. To Lohman, doing so is a fundamental responsibility of democracy. How much they will be able to see remains unclear.

“If you can’t gather independent verifiable information, then the government gets to say whatever they want about what’s happening and you can’t use the democratic process to hold them accountable,” Lohman said. “You’ve been stripped of your ability to know what’s happening and react.”",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9290.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:57:01.223470

And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival.
This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority.
Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights.","As we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the topic of migration stands at the center of concerns about the Convention’s state of health. In this blogpost adapted from my remarks at a Conference in the Federal Ministry for Justice and Consumer Protection, I argue that those attacking the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for an over-reaching jurisprudence regarding migrants’ rights misconstrue the actual case law. It is worth looking back at the early landmark cases to understand that the interpretation of Article 3 in relation to expulsion and deportation cases developed cautiously. While a critique of the Court’s decisions is the legitimate task of legal scholarship, simplistic narratives about an activist Court fail to engage with its doctrinal stringency.

Open threats to the Convention

One of the foremost birthday wishes is the wish for good health. So, as we are celebrating the ECHR’s 75th anniversary, I would like to wish good health to the European Convention on Human Rights. To take care of someone’s health, wishes are not enough though – it also needs doctor visits. In some way, interrogating the area of migration and the ECHR resembles a doctor visit, because in no other area is the health of the Convention so much at risk as it is in the area of migration.

A most evident threat to the Convention’s health is the “lettera aperta”, the open letter initiated by Denmark and Italy and signed by a total of nine European heads of state. The letter openly calls for a politically motivated restrictive interpretation of migrants’ rights and, in its assumptions, breaks with the spirit of universality of human rights. One of the many astonishing misconceptions of the lettera aperta is that it tells a story about two groups of migrants: those who come regularly, integrate well and contribute to the societies, and those who come irregularly, don’t integrate and in some cases commit crimes. To juxtapose those categories is out of touch with the reality, in which irregular pathways are the only possibility and therefore normal for most of those seeking international protection. Already the 1951 Refugee Convention reacts to this reality with its principle of non-penalization. The persisting attempt to denigrate asylum seekers for the irregularity of their arrival is at odds with the core of international refugee law. And of course, persons don’t lose their human rights because of an irregular arrival. The lettera aperta also repeatedly refers to “our citizens” whose opinions it claims to represent. This misses the idea of the Convention which is not about democratic majorities but about human rights: rights that are independent from someone’s citizenship and that are not at the discretion of the majority. Finally, the plea that there should be “more room nationally to decide on when to expel criminal foreign nationals” misses the nature of human rights protection: The basic limitations that the Convention sets for expelling persons are the limits of Article 3 ECHR, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. This prohibition applies regardless of a criminal record. It is hard to see how “more room to decide” can be understood other than wishing to depart from this universal and unconditional prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.

The successive interpretation of Article 3 ECHR in the field of migration

In defense of the lettera aperta and in other criticism of the Court, the argument is sometimes made that the jurisprudence in the field of migration has been expansive. Common knowledge about the Article 3 ECHR case law is that protection against expulsion goes back to the Soering case from 1989. Soering, a German national, was facing extradition from the UK to the USA for charges of murder. The ECtHR ruled that the potential exposure to death row would constitute inhuman or degrading treatment and that the Convention therefore prohibited an extradition. With this ruling, the Court made clear that Article 3 prohibits delivering persons under the jurisdiction of a Convention state to another state where the person faces torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The scope of the prohibition extends beyond direct acts of the state – which is also recognized for scenarios in which the state is responsible if it fails to prevent attacks from non-state actors.

Soering was not a case of migrants’ rights, but it created the ground for Article 3 ECHR jurisprudence regarding expulsions. It should not be surprising that this jurisprudence began several years after the Convention entered into force. Firstly, the Court did not hear many cases during the existence of the European Commission of Human Rights. Secondly, the late 1980s and early 1990s were the period in migrants’ rights gained a practical relevance as defense against the “emerging politics of non-entrée” (Hathaway 1992). During the 1990s, a few cases followed in which the Court interpreted the protection against expulsion under Article 3 ECHR.

The first case after Soering was the case Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden (1991). It concerned a Chilean family of three who had applied for political asylum in Sweden. Their claim had been rejected and they faced expulsion, when the case was brought before the ECtHR. The Court confirmed that Article 3 ECHR is applicable in expulsion cases, but did not find a violation, arguing that there was not sufficient evidence that the applicants faced torture or inhuman or degrading treatment if deported. Judge de Meyer dissented with the majority and suggested that Article 3 ECHR had been violated, relying also on the general situation in Chile in 1989.

In another decision from 1991, in the case Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, the Court equally confirmed the applicability of Article 3 ECHR to asylum seekers while finding no violation. The applicants were Tamils who had fled Sri Lanka and applied for protection in the UK. The ECtHR held that the situation they faced when returned did not meet the threshold of Article 3 ECHR, with Judge Russo dissenting.

The next decision about protection against expulsion was in the case Chahal v. the United Kingdom in 1996. It concerned a family of four, the parents being Indian citizens and the adult children being British citizens. The parents had been in the UK since 1974 and 1975, and the father, Mr. Chahal, was a leading figure in the Sikh community. He had been charged for terrorist activities but not convicted; nonetheless, a deportation order was based on the fight against terrorism. The Court, sitting as the Grand Chamber, held that the deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 ECHR because as a politically active Sikh, Mr. Chahal, would face inhuman or degrading treatment in India.

After this first decision in which a violation of Article 3 ECHR prohibited a deportation, an inadmissibility decision followed in the case T.I. v. the United Kingdom in 2000. The applicant was a Sri Lankan national to be removed from the UK to Germany. The Court held that the removal order from the UK without consideration of the asylum claim in substance did not give rise to an admissible claim under Article 3 ECHR because the applicant would be able to again claim asylum in Germany and did not risk immediate removal to Sri Lanka.

In Saadi v. Italy (2008), the ECtHR, sitting as Grand Chamber, held that the expulsion of Mr. Saadi, a Tunisian national, would violate Article 3 ECHR because of the risk of torture in Tunisia. Mr. Saadi had been prosecuted and jailed in Italy. The Italian government had sought assurances from Tunisia that he would not face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Such assurance was not given and the Court stressed that even if given, this would not have been sufficient alone because Italy had to assess the risk of a violation of Article 3 ECHR based on all available facts.

Returning to – when?

When I read the call for “more room” to decide nationally about the expulsion of criminal foreign nationals, I wonder if the authors mean that they disagree with the ruling in the Saadi case, and I would like to hear why and how they think the case should have been decided. When I hear a colleague suggest we should return to an earlier state of interpretation of Article 3 in the area of migration, I wonder to which state and why? The Court did not “invent” the protection against deporting someone to conditions of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment with Soering, nor did it invent it with Chahal or with Saadi. The Court interpreted the Convention. One can disagree with the interpretation but that would require some doctrinal legal arguments. Criticism of the Court’s jurisprudence should have some basis in the Convention’s text and rules of interpretation.

Judicial decisions are not taken in a political vacuum, but they also cannot be reduced to political choices. If political leaders try to reduce them to such, there should be collective resistance of all who believe in the worth of an independent judiciary.

And yes, there can be reasonable disagreement about legal interpretations. But we can only have a viable discussion based on concrete cases and interpretative alternatives, not based on abstract calls for a “more restrictive approach”. Do those calls refer to protection against deportation in cases of severe illness? Do they disagree with the ruling in case D. v. the UK (1997)? Did they notice the restrictive decisions in the cases B.B. v. France (1998) and N. v. the UK (2008)? Does the disagreement begin with later decisions in Paposhvili or Savran, and if so why?

Silent threats to the Convention’s health

Besides the open threats to the Convention, there is also the more silent disregard of the Convention’s requirements and the Court’s rulings. The ECtHR continuously holds states such as Hungary and Greece accountable for the violations of migrants’ rights, in particular due to arbitrary detention and due to inhuman and degrading treatment in camps. The numerous decisions per year do not make headlines, they do not advance new interpretations but simply apply, again and again, the Convention’s standards against state actions that violate them. I have written before about the problem of this disregard for the ECHR requirements. The Court cannot resolve this problem, it requires a broad coalition of legal and political institutions as well as civil society that uphold pressure for the Convention to be respected. This broad coalition is the Convention’s immune system.

The 75th anniversary is a helpful occasion to recall these urgent contributions we can all make to protect the European Convention on Human Rights: reaffirm the universality of its guarantees, rebut attacks on judicial independence and call for respect of the Convention, pressing states to address structural violations.",https://www.ein.org.uk/sites/default/files/images/immigration_word.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 10:57:36.900712

Sue Tincher said she heard ICE was conducting an operation in her neighborhood around 6:30 in the morning. She said she was an observer and wanted to find out what was going on. When she asked what the agents were doing, she said she was told to stand back. She didn't, and was detained.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security began what they called ""Operation Metro Surge."" Twelve people were taken into custody during the operation, DHS said. There have been continued reports since then of ICE in the Twin Cities, including in Burnsville, where family members told KARE 11 ICE detained four people over the weekend.

ICE posted on social media Tuesday a video showing of multiple arrests, with the caption ""Minnesota's weather is cloudy with a 100% chance of ICE.""

The Northside Residents Redevelopment Council says three others were detained in the raid at which Tincher was detained. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not commented publicly on this incident.

Tincher said when she was detained, she was pushed down into the snow and put into an unmarked vehicle as she yelled for help. She said she was taken to the Whipple Federal Building and held for four hours.

The bill aims to improve conditions and oversight at immigrant detention facilities, including at Camp East Montana in El Paso.

Key provisions in the bill require establishing minimum civil detention standards and allowing unannounced congressional inspections.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar has joined forces with other congressional leaders in an attempt to establish ""crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections"" for the thousands of immigrants being held in public and private detention facilities.

Escobar is a co-sponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act that looks to improve conditions within immigrant detention facilities across the country — including one of the largest lockups in El Paso.

The bill aims to improve congressional oversight of the sites, which have seen increasing accusations of human rights violations and inhumane conditions.

Key provisions in the bill would give members of Congress access to detention facilities for unannounced inspections and establish civil detention standards that match or exceed the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards.

The bill was presented by its authors U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Adam Smith, both Democrats from Washington state, on Dec. 3.

“I have seen firsthand the consequences of incompetence, cruelty and inhumane treatment that flourishes when private prison corporations are allowed to profit off suffering, including at Camp East Montana,” Escobar, D-El Paso, said in a statement. “The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act is an urgent and necessary step toward ending such abuse that’s central to the Trump administration. I’m grateful to Representatives Jayapal and Smith for introducing this bill which establishes crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections that this administration has systematically dismantled.”

There are 123 co-sponsors. It is also endorsed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Haitian Bridge Alliance and Refugees International, among many others immigrant advocacy groups.

The bill would:

Repeal mandatory detention

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over age 60

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards

Require DHS to admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

“People are being held in squalor, largely in private, for-profit detention facilities, all to pad the bottom lines of prison corporations that donate to Donald Trump and Republicans,"" Jayapal said announcing the act. ""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse. We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.”

There are currently nearly 70,000 people detained across the U.S., the majority of whom have no criminal convictions.

The legislative measure comes as Escobar and other immigrants rights advocates have raised grave concern over the conditions within immigration detention facilities.

The ICE immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss is at the center of the controversy.

Congressional concern over the Camp East Montana detention center

Escobar has continued to express her concern about the conditions at the Camp East Montana immigration detention facility, which ICE opened on land that belongs to Fort Bliss Army Post.

She has carried out three oversight visits to the facility since it began receiving detained migrants on Aug. 1, and sent at least two letters to the Department of Homeland Security over concerns about the conditions in the facility. Her concerns include inadequate medical attention — with detainees not receiving their medication — unsanitary conditions where detainees have requested equipment to clean their spaces, and poor quality to rotten food.

Escobar sent a letter to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, in November expressing her concerns about the facility. She stated then that ""conditions at Camp East Montana are dangerous and inhumane.""

The congresswoman made her latest visit to the facility on Dec. 1. She found that many of the issues that she discovered during her earlier visits have not been addressed.

""Not only is there no process being made on the issues I have raised,"" Escobar told the El Paso Times. ""But it is clear to me that the contractors are either cutting corners to create bigger profit for themselves or that the contractors are not competent.""

The facility is set to be the largest in the country, ultimately housing 5,000 detainees. The Trump administration granted over $1.2 billion dollars for its construction.

There are currently about 3,000 people detained at the immigration detention facility, Escobar said. And many of the immigrants detained at the El Paso immigration are being taken directly to the sprawling detention camp following their hearings, court observers said.

During her last visit, Escobar was able to speak with 10 women in the facility.

Escobar detailed that she has consistently heard that detainees are being forced to wash their own clothes, they are not being provided with adequate hygiene products and detainees have continued to receive food that is either foul tasting or rotten. The women she spoke with also reported having developed rashes due to the alcohol-based gel they have used to wash their clothing.

Escobar noted that some immigrants she has spoken with have been detained for nearly two months. Originally, the facility was meant to hold immigrants for up to five days.

""These are human beings who deserve to be treated as human beings,"" the congresswoman said. ""Even if there are people who do not care about the humanitarian component of my concerns, then why should be outraged that a contractor that is getting $1.24 billion dollars of taxpayer money is not meeting the obligations that they should be meeting.""

Calls to shut down Camp East Montana

The ACLU and other immigrant rights advocacy groups, including El Paso's Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Estrella del Paso, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging officials to cease detaining immigrants in the soft-sided detention facility.

Detainees held in the facility have told lawyers about the squalid conditions and human rights violations in the camps, the ACLU reports. The letter details the horrid conditions in the facility, including ""beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations.""

The letter recounts the story of four Cuban immigrants held in the facility who reported being beaten by guards after refusing to be deported to Mexico. It also recounts the experience of one detainee, Samuel, who had his ""testicles crushed"" by a guard and was beaten to the point where he was taken in an ambulance from the facility.

The ACLU letter is the latest in a series of reports highlighting the dire conditions at the facility. It echoes and cites similar concerns Escobar has expressed and internal ICE inspectors reports of violations.

Detainees were subjected to conditions that violated federal standards for immigrant detention, according to a report produced by ICE inspectors.

Inspectors found the facility failed to properly monitor and treat some detainees’ medical conditions, lacked basic procedures for keeping guards and detainees safe and inadequately provided detainees with proper means to communicate with legal representation.","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714710007-180820256-d-8-a-6521.jpg?crop=5759,3241,x0,y299&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 10:57:40.241448

Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is planning to make several changes to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application process used by business visitors and tourists to visit the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including the addition of a social media review and the requirement to provide greater detail on the applicant’s personal information and family members.

The intended changes are detailed in a CBP notice set for publication in the Federal Register (FR) on December 10. The public has 60 days from FR publication to comment on the planned changes, which also include the plan for a new optional mobile tool for any foreign national to record their departure from the United States.

According to the FR notice, CBP is planning the following changes to the ESTA application process:

Mandatory social media information collection. CBP is planning to add social media as a mandatory data element for an ESTA application and will require applicants to provide their social media information from the five years preceding their application.

Additional required personal information. CBP intends to add several data fields to the ESTA application “when feasible,” including:

Telephone numbers used by applicant in the preceding five years;

Email addresses used by applicant in the preceding ten years;

IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos;

Family member names (parents, spouse, siblings, children) and dates and places of birth;

Family telephone numbers used in the preceding five years;

Family member residences;

Biometrics – face, fingerprint, DNA, and iris;

Business telephone numbers used by the applicant in the preceding five years; and

Business email addresses used by the applicant in the preceding ten years.

Separate photo upload requirement. CBP is planning to update the ESTA website and ESTA mobile application to always require the upload of a photograph of the applicant’s face, in addition to the photo of the passport biographical page. Currently, the ESTA website does not require a separate photo upload and the ESTA Mobile application only requires the photo in certain instances.

ESTA application website decommission; ESTA Mobile as sole application option. Ultimately, CBP plans to require ESTA applicants to submit applications solely through the ESTA Mobile application and will decommission the ESTA application website. The ESTA website would remain available as an information resource for the VWP program and as a tool for ESTA applicants to check the status of their submitted ESTA applications, but applicants would be required to use the ESTA Mobile application to apply for ESTA. CBP cites certain technological limitations of the ESTA website as the basis for the planned change.

Apart from the ESTA changes, CBP also plans to implement an optional new functionality within the CBP Home mobile application that would allow foreign nationals to provide evidence of their departure from the United States. If a foreign national chooses to record their departure through the mobile application, they will be required to submit their facial image and CBP will use geolocation services to confirm that the foreign national is outside the United States. The agency will also run “liveness detection” software on the uploaded facial image to determine that the photo is a live photo as opposed to a previously uploaded one. If a foreign national chooses to submit evidence of their departure, the report of the exit would be recorded as a confirmed departure in the CBP Arrival and Departure System (ADIS).

CBP will accept public comments on the planned ESTA and departure record changes for 60 days after publication in the December 10 Federal Register notice. If the changes are then approved by the Office of Management and Budget, CBP may implement the changes in stages over the following weeks and months.

ESTA applicants should be aware that if these changes are finalized, they would be asked for a higher level of personal detail in future applications and become subject to a social media review by CBP. The increase in data collection could also mean that ESTA applicants would face an increased likelihood of being flagged for closer scrutiny and/or would experience longer waits for ESTA approval.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.
He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis... “All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.
The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.
“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times.","The prime minister has urged Europe’s leaders to reform how a major human rights treaty is interpreted in law to tackle illegal migration and prevent voters from turning to “the forces that seek to divide us"".

Sir Keir Starmer and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, have made a joint call on other leaders across the continent to agree on a “modernisation” of how the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is interpreted in their countries’ laws.

European ministers agreed at a meeting in Strasbourg on Wednesday that they will look at how to tackle concerns over migration within the legal framework.

Deputy PM David Lammy, who is at the meeting, said the convention ""was never intended to be frozen in time,"" and warned that the definition of ""family life"" should not be stretched ""to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country”.

The chief of the body which oversees the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) said ministers had taken an “important first step forward together” to agree a political declaration on migration and the ECHR.

Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset told reporters that the “living instrument” is possible to adapt, and work will begin to adopt the declaration in Moldova in May 2026.

He said: “This is really the starting of a process on a consensus basis...

“All 46 member states have reaffirmed their deep and abiding commitment to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.

“This is not rhetoric. This is a political decision of the highest order.

“But ministers have also expressed their concerns regarding the unprecedented challenges posed by migration and the serious questions governments face in maintaining societies that deliver for citizens.”

In an opinion piece for the Guardian newspaper, Starmer and Frederiksen advocated for a tougher approach to policing Europe’s borders as a means of winning against populist political opponents, saying they were “making this case across Europe”.

The ECHR, which underpins Britain’s Human Rights Act, is seen by its critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants from the country.

The right to family life, enshrined by Article 8 of the agreement, is often used as grounds in legal cases to prevent removals.

The Home Office has also said it has seen a trend of Article 3 rights, prohibiting torture, being used to halt deportations because of claims that migrants’ healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Starmer’s political opponents, the Conservatives and Reform UK, have both said they would leave the ECHR if in power.

The prime minister, in his joint op-ed with Fredriksen, acknowledged the “current asylum framework was created for another era”, adding: “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed, and asylum systems must change with it.”

Despite opponents' stated intention to leave the ECHR, Starmer's government has insisted it will remain a member of the treaty, and has adopted a series of hardline immigration measures, modelled on those spearheaded by Frederiksen’s Danish government.

“Migration must be orderly, managed and sustainable. Irregular routes should not be the go-to option – so we must dismantle the human smuggling networks that prey on desperation.

“Together, we are calling on our friends across Europe to go further in tackling these shared challenges,” the two leaders wrote.

They continued, describing a “push for a modernisation of the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – so that the convention system, which we believe in, can evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.”

In a warning to other leaders, Starmer and Fredriksen added: “Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.

“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”

The Government is expected to bring forward homegrown legislation to change how the Article 8 right to family life is interpreted in UK courts, and is also considering examining the threshold for Article 3 rights.

Amnesty International UK hit out at UK plans to lead reforms of the ECHR, describing it as weakening protections.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights programme director, said: “There is a dreadful irony in our Justice Secretary working with his counterparts to remove or reduce rights on the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

""It shows how far we have drifted from the moral resolve of the last century, when our grandparents determined that the fact we are all born free and equal must be protected in law.

“Human rights were never meant to be optional or reserved for comfortable and secure times. They were designed to be a compass, our conscience, when the politics of fear and division try to steer us wrong.

""To weaken ECHR protections now, on a day meant to reaffirm dignity and protection for all, is not reform. It is moral retreat.”

Elsewhere, French far-right leader Jordan Bardella told the Daily Telegraph newspaper he would rewrite French border policy to allow British patrol boats to push back migrant dinghies into France’s waters, if he led the country.

At issue is Senate Bill 76 — authored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, after she blocked a bill with some similar provisions during the last legislative session. That move resulted in Rokita claiming she did so because she has an “illegal alien” in her family.

Her current proposal includes language allowing state agencies and Rokita’s office to investigate the “employment of an unauthorized alien” and report possible violations to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Indiana Department of Labor.

Rokita, however, is backing a differing proposal in Senate Bill 122, which would give the attorney general’s office authority to seek court orders suspending an “employer’s operating authorizations” over such suspected violations.

Rokita, a Republican, blasted Brown on social media over her bill, saying she had “introduced a watered-down, bizarro world version … that takes all the enforcement teeth out of the bill. That makes her bill meaningless.”

Brown countered that she has worked with entities from the Trump administration to county sheriffs in order to find effective ways to help enforce federal immigration laws.

“The biggest thing is making sure that we didn’t grow government and that the power isn’t centered in one agency or individual,” Brown told reporters.

Hiring practices in question

Erin Tuttle, the attorney general office’s legislative director, criticized Brown’s bill during a Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday as an “inadequate response” to prevent businesses from hiring people who are in the country illegally.

“The Supreme Court has confirmed that states may sanction the license of employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers,” Tuttle said. “If Indiana refuses to adopt the one enforcement mechanism available under federal law, it cannot credibly claim to be a leader in combating illegal immigration.”

Immigrant advocates, however, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation.

Carolina Castoreno, co-founder of the Indianapolis-based Alliance for Latino Migrant Advocacy, told committee members that the proposal encourages racial profiling by businesses.

“It pushes them toward discriminatory hiring practices, meaning someone who fits a certain look or has a certain name or has an accent may be discriminated against, just out of precaution,” Castoreno said. “We know who is harmed, people with brown skin, people with accents, people with names that sound unfamiliar to an HR manager.”

Committee members voted 6-2 along party lines to advance the bill to the full Senate, which could take up the proposal in early January.

Rokita-Brown conflict continues

The dispute between Rokita and Brown over the legislation grows out of their conflict over an immigration-enforcement bill from the legislative session earlier this year.

House members approved House Bill 1531 in February, but Brown did not hold a Senate committee hearing on the bill and it died when the legislative session ended in April.

Rokita then claimed Brown had blocked the legislation because she had a “family member who’s an illegal alien.”

Brown called that claim “blatantly false.” She also filed an attorney misconduct grievance over Rokita’s comments with the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission that she said Tuesday was still pending.

Rokita and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks have repeatedly criticized Brown on social media over last session’s bill.

They also are backing Darren Vogt, who works on Banks’ Senate staff and is a Northwest Allen County Schools board member, in a Republican primary challenge to Brown’s 2026 reelection bid.

Following the committee vote, Rokita posted to X that the bill “would actively shield sanctuary jurisdictions and directly undermines our ongoing lawsuits to end sanctuary policies in Monroe and St. Joseph counties. We need to stop illegal immigration—not protect the counties and officials who defy state law and put Hoosier families last.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/D098C92B-C8DB-492D-AAE5-016023084083_1_201_a-2048x1364.jpeg,N,,2025-12-10 09:57:19.452017

Today, the U.S. government needs to take a hard look in the mirror.

The U.S. human rights record has been far from spotless, but under President Donald Trump, attacks on human rights at home and abroad have escalated on an alarming scale. From targeting protestors to treating immigrants cruelly, from sending militarized forces into our communities to extrajudicially killing (murdering) more than 80 people in the Caribbean and Pacific, the Trump administration’s assault on human rights must stop.

As we mark Human Rights Day, we refuse to idly stand by. Human rights are universal; they belong to everybody, everywhere, all the time, just by virtue of their being human. The Trump administration may dismiss them, but we will not. Across the country, millions of people are demanding accountability and respect for human rights. Their courage is a reminder that we must never normalize this assault.

Authoritarian Practices, Eroded Rights

Since President Trump took office, authoritarian practices and contempt for the rule of law have surged dramatically. His administration has targeted universities—crushing student protests and threatening academic freedom. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester and negotiator at Columbia University detained for months before a judge ordered his release, still faces ongoing immigration proceedings. His only “offense” was exercising his right to freedom of expression. Targeting and threatening peaceful protesters and their immigration status is a clear violation of human rights. This administration’s message is unmistakable: dissent, and you risk punishment, detention or deportation.

Khalil’s case is not unique. At least 10 international students and activists have faced similar targeting for Palestinian rights advocacy, including Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman detained since March 13, 2025, after a protest at Columbia University. She must be released immediately.

Journalists have also been targeted. Reporter Mario Guevara, detained in June for covering a protest in Georgia, was deported in October. This sends a chilling message to every journalist in the United States: reporting the truth can get you jailed or thrown out of this country.

Immigrants are being detained without warrants or due process, at historic levels in inhumane and cruel conditions. I recently met with lawyers and people previously detained in the Everglades Detention Facility, known as “Alligator Alcatraz” who shared devastating reports of torture, denial of medical care and inhumane conditions without access to attorneys. At a visit to the Krome North Service Processing Center, another immigrant detention center in Florida, I saw these conditions with my owns eyes and spoke to people detained who said they’ve “lived through hell.”

Militarized forces have taken over city streets—especially threatening to brown and Black communities—even as local officials and some federal judges demanded President Trump stop. Masked federal officers have conducted nighttime raids, terrorizing entire neighborhoods and taking people without warrants. Children are torn from their parents, and people who have come to our border seeking safety are denied their right to seek asylum.People who have protested these heavy-handed enforcement tactics are met with law enforcement in riot gear firing tear gas and rubber bullets.

These are not policy disputes—they are human rights violations.

President Trump is trying to silence dissent by invoking fear everywhere. I was one of the 7 million people protesting in October refusing to give up our rights. We, the people mobilizing to defend our rights, are growing in number and power!

Human Rights Transcend Politics

Human rights are not about left or right. They’re about right and wrong. They protect the human dignity and safety of every person. If we stay silent as rights are violated and denied, the question isn’t ifmore violations will follow, but when.

Now is the time for collective action. We are in this together. We inspire each other by protesting, speaking out and joining local movements that defend those whose rights are being violated. Colleges and universities must safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment. Lawmakers must hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. The United States must also reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems.

The adoption of the UDHR on December 10, 1948, recognized human rights as the foundation for freedom, justice and peace. All people everywhere have a right to live their lives freely, equally and in dignity. We can, and we must, do better. The path forward begins with accountability, courage and collective action—from those who lead our government and from each of us. On this day, and every day, let us raise our voices and demand that the United States do what is right.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.","President Trump’s promised executive order that would kneecap state laws aimed at regulating artificial intelligence is likely bound for the courts.

The president announced his plan Monday to create “one rulebook” by which the tech industry will abide when it comes to AI, a move that would override the regulations passed by individual states.

“We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS!” he continued. “AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”

But it could face legal headwinds and criticism off the bat, especially as AI regulation is still a fledgling effort.

“A great federal system could be better, in theory,” said Nicholas E. Stewart, executive director of the Justice Education Project. “But in practice, without a system in place, states are only really the ones filling the gaps.”

All 50 states — plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands — introduced legislation this year on AI, and some 38 states adopted or enacted about 100 measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

That patchwork of state laws could come under fire with an executive order from Trump.

Though it’s not clear what the final order will look like, a draft order seen last month by our colleague, tech reporter extraordinaire Julia Shapero, would have created a task force dedicated to challenging state AI laws and restricted certain broadband funding for states with AI laws deemed overly burdensome.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who last week proposed an AI “bill of rights” for his state, wrote on X Monday that any effort by the president to “preempt” states’ actions by overriding their laws — as Trump’s post seems to suggest — would be unlawful.

“An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action,” DeSantis said, responding to a post urging the state to challenge Trump’s would-be executive order. “Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.”

Either way, legal challenges seem inevitable — and the Trump administration could quickly run into issues.

There’s one big problem to start: At least one of the tech companies that might celebrate lesser regulation, OpenAI, has acknowledged that “federal preemption over existing or prospective state laws will require an act of Congress.”

The admission came in the footnote of a submission to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy and could be used by legal challengers to undermine the foundation and authority of Trump’s efforts.

More generally, as DeSantis noted, an order overwriting state laws could pose questions about the separation of powers between both Congress and the executive branch, and strains on federalism.

Federal lawmakers last week did reintroduce the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act, which aims to bar companies from using “biased and discriminatory AI-powered algorithms” in making “critical decisions” for American lives.

But the regulation of AI is still in early stages, and efforts to crack down on emergent technology have major gaps. That’s especially true of regulation of AI’s impact on the justice system, according to Stewart.

Stewart, lead author of the book “Next Steps into Criminal Justice Activism: Technology, Ethics, and the Future of Justice,” which publishes next Tuesday, told The Gavel in an interview that AI is already built into every stage of policing, which prosecutors now use to build timelines, case theories and arguments as opposed to human witnesses.

“Policing and prosecution are being quietly rewritten by systems that don’t think, can’t explain themselves and are not accountable to anyone,” Stewart said. “And when you remove people from key decisions, handing those decisions to generative AI, you don’t get neutrality — you get automation of the same biases and power imbalances that already exist, except they’re only faster, quieter and harder to challenge.”

The book, which was shaped by the Gen Z-led Justice Education Project, includes chapters dedicated to interviews with legal experts at Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania detailing the dangers of leaving AI’s spread into the legal system unaddressed, especially for communities already disproportionately affected by heavy policing.

Columbia University professor Daniel Richman — who, loyal readers may know just-so-happens to play a key role in the Justice Department’s dismissed case against former FBI Director James Comey — told the authors in one chapter, shared with The Gavel ahead of publication, that an “invisible system” like these can inflict harm just as well, with fewer questions asked.

“Anytime you expand data collection, you risk widening the net of the criminal justice system,” Richman said.

(We’d be remiss not to mention: Richman’s bid to temporarily block DOJ from accessing his own data, which prosecutors relied on to argue he was authorized by Comey to make disclosures to the media, was on Saturday granted by a judge.)

Stewart said that Trump’s executive order would amount to a federal takeover of AI regulation before there’s a comprehensive federal standard in place.

“So, as the administration moves ahead, we can see the strongest state-level safeguards — especially around discrimination, privacy and surveillance — overridden overnight, potentially,” he said. “And that would shift enormous power to Washington and to the tech companies building these systems (in) Silicon Valley, leaving communities with fewer tools to challenge harmful uses of AI in the justice system.”

Trump hits wall with US attorneys

Trump’s bid to install loyalist U.S. attorneys in top offices nationwide seems to have hit a dead end, as his Justice Department’s efforts to keep embattled prosecutors in their positions have faltered.

“It’s a very sad situation,” the president said Monday. “We’re losing a lot of great people.”

His remarks came after his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, stepped down as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey after a panel of federal appeals court judges ruled she was unlawfully serving in the role.

Habba was the first of his loyalist U.S. attorneys to be ruled disqualified in July, but others followed.

The top federal prosecutors in Nevada, the California district including Los Angeles and the Virginia district that includes D.C.’s suburbs have all since been found to be unlawfully holding their posts, while a challenge to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York is pending — and a judge signaled it’s one the federal prosecutor may lose.

Trump’s Justice Department has taken extensive steps to keep these attorneys in their roles, but Habba’s resignation marks a reality check for the administration.

Habba said in her announcement that the decision was to protect the “stability and integrity” of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, saying judges stopped holding trials and handing down sentences with her at the helm, “leaving violent criminals on the streets.”

Court watchers have largely attributed the disruptions to confusion around the legality of her leadership, but the consequences have been real. The New York Times reported in August that the delays were wreaking havoc on the lives of those whose lives were tied up in New Jersey’s federal courts, and the appeals court ruling came only on Dec. 1.

A similar story is playing out in the Eastern District of Virginia, where the name of Lindsey Halligan — the disqualified U.S. attorney — is still appearing on court filings.

Several outlets have reported judges pushing back from the bench, questioning why a federal judge’s ruling that found Halligan never lawfully served as the district’s top prosecutor would not preclude her participation in cases.

One of those judges, U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, oversaw Comey’s case at the trial level and Halligan’s disqualification was the reason for its dismissal. He ordered her name struck from a different man’s case records and said he was finding it “difficult to reconcile” the disqualification ruling with the Justice Department’s actions now, according to CNN.

The Justice Department hit back Monday in a joint statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that said certain district and magistrate judges in Halligan’s district were pursing an “unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility” against her and her line prosecutors.

“Lindsey and our attorneys are simply doing their jobs: advocating for the Department of Justice’s positions while following guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel,” the No. 1 and 2 DOJ officials said. “They do not deserve to have their reputations questioned in court for ethically advocating on behalf of their client.”

On Tuesday, a judge suggested at a hearing that Halligan should take a page out of Habba’s book and relinquish her role. Pointing out her resignation, Judge Leonie Brinkeman said, “that’s the proper position, in my view,” according to the Times.

The Justice Department has not appealed Halligan’s dismissal, keeping her in the role, nonetheless. It’s not clear how far DOJ will take any of the U.S. attorney disqualifications, after dismissing Habba’s case before it could reach the Supreme Court.

But the calculus could involve efforts to reindict Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), the two Trump foes Halligan was hand-picked to pursue charges against in the first place.

The bigger problem, identified by Trump, is the excessive stalling of Senate confirmation for his nominees, bumping their tenure out of the interim window where many initially served lawfully before the legality of their leadership came into question upon its expiration.

On Monday, the president blamed the Senate’s long-standing blue slip tradition that lets lets home-state senators veto presidential nominees to district courts and U.S. attorney offices.

Trump vowed in August that he’d sue over the practice, but such a lawsuit against what the president has called a “gentleman’s agreement” would face long odds and never came to fruition.

Boasberg v. Noem

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has his eye on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the judge weighs potential criminal contempt referrals.

Boasberg oversees one of the highest-profile challenges to Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to a Salvadoran megaprison.

Nearly nine months after Trump first invoked the law to quickly launch deportation flights, the case has returned to Boasberg’s court, and he’s resuming his contempt inquiry.

Noem has taken center stage upon the Justice Department disclosing for the first time that she made the final decision not to turn around planes as Boasberg handed down an oral and subsequent written order to do so on the night of March 15.

“I made the decision to continue the transfer of custody of the Alien Enemies Act detainees,” Noem, under penalty of perjury, reaffirmed in a declaration submitted Friday.

The Trump administration maintains it didn’t violate Boasberg’s directive because the flights were already out of U.S. airspace by that time.

Months ago, Boasberg disagreed, but he has yet to identify any specific officials responsible. He’s now weighing whether to refer any of them for criminal prosecution.

As the Obama-appointed judge mulls next steps, the government’s latest court filings provide the clearest picture yet of how Noem came to her decision.

Blanche and Emil Bove, the then-principal associate deputy attorney general whom Trump later tapped for a federal appeals judgeship, in sworn declarations told Boasberg they had analyzed the judge’s statements that March night.

The duo said they advised the Department of Homeland Security’s acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara. Mazzara, in turn, advised Noem, he confirmed in a sworn declaration of his own.

None of the officials disclosed what the advice was, calling it privileged material.

What’s next? Boasberg wants to hear from witnesses.

The judge asked that Erez Reuveni appear on Monday. Reuveni worked in the Justice Department this spring and has become a whistleblower, accusing top officials of ignoring court orders.

Reuveni has said Bove suggested government attorneys may need to tell the courts “f‑‑‑ you” and defy any order blocking Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. Bove denies Reuveni’s account.

Reuveni now works at Democracy Forward, a left-leaning legal organization that prolifically challenges the Trump administration in court.

After Reuveni testifies, Boasberg ordered the government to produce Drew Ensign, the deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Immigration Litigation, for Tuesday.

Boasberg has said he’s obligated to consider three factors to determine if an official should be referred for criminal contempt: (1) his order was “clear and reasonably specific”; (2) “the defendant violated the order”; and (3) “the violation was willful.”

Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are stepping up their scrutiny of the judge.

Six GOP senators — Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Mike Lee (Utah), Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) — sent a letter last month to the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit urging him to suspend Boasberg.

It comes as some in the party hope to impeach the judge. Boasberg has also drawn Republicans’ ire for signing orders barring phone providers from telling lawmakers that Special Counsel Jack Smith was searching their records and comments Boasberg reportedly made at a closed-door meeting of federal judges.

Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to hold a hearing on “rogue judges” and impeachment. It was postponed.

Chicago use-of-force case fizzling

The class-action lawsuit that sparked an expansive order restricting immigration agents’ use of force in the Chicago area is fizzling out.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has shifted his focus from Chicago to Charlotte. It left the plaintiffs declaring victory and a push to drop their lawsuit that garnered national attention.

Not so fast, however.

“This is transparent procedural gamesmanship,” the Justice Department pushed back in court filings Thursday. “To be sure, if Plaintiffs want to stop litigating and this Court grants their motion for dismissal with prejudice, that is beyond Defendants’ control.”

“But this gambit should be seen for what it is.”

The judge is expected to grant the dismissal “with prejudice,” meaning it would prevent them from bringing substantially similar claims in the future.

The Justice Department wants that to be air-tight, insisting journalists, protesters and clergy members can’t file lawsuits claiming new constitutional violations by immigration agents.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, an Obama appointee who oversees the case, hasn’t yet granted the dismissal request after holding a hearing last week. Ellis reportedly wants to give any class members an opportunity to object before ruling.

Already, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times have told Ellis that before ruling, she should first ensure the government produces various documents to the press and public related to the case.

Some have already been turned over, but others haven’t as the government works to make redactions.

“A dismissal should not derail the right of the public and the press to access the materials that the parties submitted to the Court and that the Court has already determined are a part of the public record in this case,” the outlets wrote in court filings Thursday.

SIDEBAR

5 top docket updates

Habba out: Alina Habba, the former personal lawyer to Trump, stepped down from her contested position atop the federal prosecuting office in New Jersey after federal courts ruled she was unlawfully appointed. She said she’ll take on a new DOJ role as a senior advisor to Attorney General Pam Bondi for U.S. Attorneys.

SCOTUS OKs Texas map: The Supreme Court in an emergency ruling enabled Texas to use its congressional map for the midterms that adds up to five GOP pickups and ignited a mid-decade restricting war. The court’s liberal justices publicly dissented.

Jan. 6 pipe bomb arrest: Brian Cole Jr., the Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Democratic and Republican national committee offices on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, was arrested and made his first court appearance, unraveling one of the longest lasting mysteries from those days.

James no bill: The Justice Department failed to secure a new indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) after its initial case against her was dismissed, a blunder for prosecutors who have trained their sights on the Trump adversary.

New SCOTUS emergency case: The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute involving immigration judges’ free speech rights. The dispute raises significant implications for lawsuits filed by federal employees. It’s the administration’s 32nd emergency appeal since taking office.

In other news

Privileged behavior: Trump personally asserted executive privilege to keep thousands of documents out of discovery in a long-lasting civil case stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. See his unmistakable signature yourself in the court filings here.

Stay a while: In an exclusive interview with Politico, Trump said he hopes Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas stay on the bench, a response to calls for the 70-somethings to retire so the president could appoint new conservative justices.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Birthright citizenship

Last week, we previewed six petitions to keep an eye on. The court took up four of them.

The headliner is Trump v. Barbara, the battle over the constitutionality of Trump’s birthright citizenship restrictions (for real, this time).

The justices also agreed to hear Abouammo v. United States, an appeal brought by a former Twitter manager accused or providing information to an associate of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince is Mohammed bin Salman about Saudi dissidents. Defendant Ahmad Abouammo argues he was convicted in the wrong venue.

The court also took up T.M. v. University of Maryland Medical System, which implicates the scope of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. The doctrine prohibits federal district judges from considering cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by a final state court decision.

And finally, the court agreed to hear Jules v. Andre Balazs Properties. The dispute stems from discrimination claims a security guard brought against Chateau Marmont, a historic Hollywood hotel known for its celebrity guests. At issue before the high court is a thorny jurisdiction issue.

OUT: Book ban challenge

The court declined to hear Little v. Llano County, Texas, a challenge to the county public library removing 17 books from its shelves.

A district judge found the removals were motivated by a desire to censor certain viewpoints. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed those claims, saying that public library patrons had no right to challenge the removals under the First Amendment.

The patrons had asked the high court to take up their appeal.

They were represented by Elizabeth Prelogar, former President Biden’s solicitor general. It was one of her first petitions she brought to the Supreme Court since returning to private practice at the law firm Cooley.

MAYBE: Vaccine mandates

The Supreme Court asked the Trump administration to weigh in on whether to take up three pending petitions.

The first, Does 1-2 v. Hochul, involves a challenge to New York’s COVID-era vaccine mandate for health care workers. They are raising claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The second, Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, is a major dispute over Title IX, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded schools. The petition, brought by Georgia Tech’s former women’s basketball coach and another employee, concerns if school employees have the right to bring Title IX lawsuits.

And the third, Hoffman v. WBI Energy Transmission, concerns eminent domain. The Natural Gas Act delegates that constitutional authority to condemn property to private companies so they can construct federally funded pipelines. The case involves how “just compensation” to property owners should be calculated in those cases.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

Gun rights: Last week, we highlighted the dozens of challenges to the federal crime for felons possessing firearms. No action yet, but we hope you held your beer, because the court has relisted 21 additional Second Amendment petitions. Some concern that same felon-in-possession law. Others challenge an AR-15 ban in Cook County, Ill., and high-capacity magazine bans in California and Washington state.

Rodney Reed: Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed is back at the Supreme Court in his fight for DNA testing to provide he’s innocent in a 1996 murder. Three years ago, the court ruled 6-3 in his favor that he hadn’t waited too long to seek the testing. Now, the fight concerns whether the murder weapon Reed wants tested was potentially contaminated, and whether the refusal to test it violates his due process rights. The case is Reed v. Goertz.

Fourth Amendment (pinging Luigi Mangione followers): A criminal defendant in Iowa is asking the justices to provide a national answer on whether police violate the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches when they search someone’s bag without a warrant while arresting them, if the bag was inaccessible to the person when searched. This is the issue at the center of Luigi Mangione’s ongoing pre-trial hearing in New York. The case is Scullark v. Iowa.

Vermont statehouse removal: Vermont State Police Sergeant Jacob Zorn is asking the justices to toss an excessive force lawsuit brought by Shela Linton, who suffered permanent wrist damage after being forcibly from the state House chamber floor in 2015. Linton was conducting a sit-in supporting universal health care. An appeals court ruled a judge wrongly ruled the sergeant could claim qualified immunity without going to trial. The case is Zorn v. Linton.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments regarding how multiple IQ scores factor into whether someone is eligible for the death penalty. The case is Hamm v. Smith.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal in a challenge to the president’s executive order cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) brought by 11 intelligence community members on DEI-related assignments.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in two unions’ challenge to Trump’s Labor Day executive order exempting six agencies from the coverage of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.

Thursday:

A federal judge in New York is set to hold a status conference in the sex trafficking case against former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries and two others.

Friday:

There are no notable hearings.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a challenge to Trump’s efforts to gut collective bargaining for federal workers, brought by federal employee organizations and unions.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to consider university associations’ bid for remedies against the Trump administration after the judge found Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists was unlawful.

A trial is set to begin in Alaska against a man accused of sending graphic threats to kill Supreme Court justices and their family members.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over the state’s congressional map, adopted through a ballot proposition, Proposition 50, drawn to benefit Democrats.

Tuesday:

A federal judge in Florida is set to oversee a settlement conference in a lawsuit brought by a group of migrants detained at Alligator Alcatraz and four immigration groups seeking to guarantee attorney access and other steps.

A federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a hearing regarding the Trump administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to mandate women’s registration for the Selective Service draft.

Another Massachusetts federal judge is set to hold a hearing with countering arguments for summary judgment and dismissal in a challenge to the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to end temporary protected status (TPS) for Haitians and Venezuelans.

And a third federal judge in Massachusetts is set to oversee a summary judgment hearing in a challenge to DHS’s policy seeking to deport noncitizens to a third country without giving them notice or opportunity to contest their fear of persecution there.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Following a strike on an alleged drug vessel in October, Pentagon lawyers suggested that the two survivors could be placed into a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to three officials. Later that month, Pentagon officials decided that boat strike survivors would be sent back to their home countries or to a third country, three other officials said. During a meeting with the State Department, officials made it clear that they did not want survivors to end up in the U.S. judicial system, where court cases could force the administration to show evidence justifying the strikes. Damien Cave, Edward Wong, and Maria Abi-Habib report for the New York Times.

The Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mike Rogers (R-AL), said yesterday that he does not need to further investigate the Sept. 2 strike that killed two survivors. “It’s done,” Rogers told reporters. “I’ve got all the answers I needed.” A spokesperson for Rogers confirmed the congressman’s plans, though his timeline for winding things down was not clear. Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO; Noah Robertson, Dan Lamothe, and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to commit to releasing the video of the Sept. 2 strikes in the Caribbean,” Democratic lawmakers said yesterday after a classified briefing to the “Gang of Eight.” The closed-door discussion, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratclifee, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine mostly centered on the 22 known boat strikes, according to a U.S. official. “I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) said after the briefing. Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times; Patricia Zengerle, Bipasha Dey, and Ghaneshwar Rajan report for Reuters.

Adm. Alvin Holsey, the outgoing head of U.S. Southern Command, briefed top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees yesterday. “We got some clarity on the chain of command and who made decisions at what point, but on the legality of it we didn’t get a lot of clarity,” said Representative Adam Smith (D-WA). Megan Mineiro and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times.

The U.S. military yesterday flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appears to be the closest U.S. warplanes have come to Venezuelan airspace since the strikes began in September, according to a public flight tracking website. A U.S. defense official said the jets conducted a “routine training flight” in the area. Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

“I will say frankly that I am ready for elections,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters yesterday, adding that elections could be held in the next 60 to 90 days if the United States and Europe provided Kyiv with security guarantees. Zelenskyy also said yesterday that Ukraine was still working on revising a peace plan, which would probably be sent to the United States on Wednesday. Claire Moss reports for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

A UNICEF spokesperson yesterday called for the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza to be opened to help increase the flow of humanitarian trucks which would bring down the number of children and adults with malnutrition, adding that not enough aid is currently entering Gaza. The spokesperson said that 8,300 pregnant and breastfeeding women in October alone were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition, adding “this pattern is a grave warning and it will likely result in low birthweight babies being born in the Gaza Strip for months to come…This is not over.” UN News reports.

Husam Badran, a member of Hamas’ political wing, yesterday called for the “full implementation of all the terms of the first phase” of the peace plan before moving forward, including an end to the continuing demolition of Palestinian homes in the areas under Israeli-control. Megan Janetsky and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The anti-Hamas group, Popular Forces, operating from Israeli-held areas of Gaza will continue to fight Hamas despite the killing of a prominent commander, Yasser Abu Shabab, last week, according to Ghassan Duhine, a deputy in the group. Three Egyptian sources said that such anti-Hamas groups had increased their activities since the ceasefire, and estimated they now had 1,000 fighters, adding 400 since the truce. A diplomat said the groups lacked any popular constituency, but added that their emergence raised concerns for stability in Gaza. Aidan Lewis reports for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The United States yesterday imposed sanctions on four individuals and four firms for their alleged involvement in a transnational network that recruits former Colombian military members who train soldiers for the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary. Under-Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said the RSF was supported by Colombian fighters when it captured El Fasher in October. Fatima Hussein reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has continued for a third day, showing no signs of slowing, as hundreds of thousands of people are displaced. About 400,000 people have been evacuated from across seven provinces in Thailand and around 700 schools closed, according to a spokesperson for the Thai military. The Cambodian defense ministry said that Cambodia has evacuated more than 127,000 villagers and closed hundreds of schools. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media that the two nations should “cease hostilities immediately,” adding that they must follow de-escalatory measures outlined in the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords in October. Jerry Harmer and Jintamas Saksornchai report for AP News; Kelly Ng reports for BBC News.

Russian and Chinese bombers yesterday conducted a joint, eight-hour patrol near Japan and South Korea, the Japanese defense ministry said. “The repeated joint flights of bombers by both countries signify an expansion and intensification of activities around our country, while clearly intending to demonstrate force against our nation, posing a serious concern for our national security,” Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said on social media. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense said that the patrol was a normal part of regular cooperation between the Russian and Chinese militaries. Jason Douglas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Infighting within Haiti’s Viv Ansanm gang coalition has killed at least 49 people in Port-au-Prince since Monday, according to a local human rights group. Danica Coto reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Microsoft yesterday announced that it would invest $17.5 billion in India for AI development, building on a $3 billion commitment announced earlier this year. The four-year spending plan starts in 2026 and would give Microsoft the largest cloud-computing presence in India. Aditya Soni, Deborah Mary Sophia, Nishit NAvin report for Reuters.

The Defense Department yesterday announced that it will deploy Google’s Gemini AI through the new GenAI.mil platform so all Pentagon employees can use it on their work computers. “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled A-I,” Hegseth said. Google Cloud said in a press release that employees can use Gemini for Government unclassified work, adding that none of the Defense Department’s data will be used to train Google’s public models. Sam Sabin and Colin Demarest report for Axios.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Moscow is waiting for a formal answer from Washington on Russia President Vladimir Putin’s proposal to extend NewSTART, the last remaining Russian-U.S. arms control treaty, which expires on Feb. 5, Russian Secretary of the Security Council Sergei Shoigu said yesterday. NewSTART caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that both nations can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. Guy Faulconbridge and Lucy Papachristou report for Reuters.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it plans to ask travelers eligible for the visa waiver program for a long list of personal data, including social media, email addresses from the last decade, and the names, birth dates, places of residence and birthplaces of parents, spouses, siblings and children, according to a document filed yesterday in the Federal Register. Christine Chung reports for the New York Times.

Gov. JB. Pritzker (D-IL) yesterday signed into law several measures set to increase immigration protections in Illinois, including a ban on immigration arrests at state court houses or within 1,000 feet of those facilities, and restrictions on what information Illinois hospitals, childcare centers, and colleges can share with immigration authorities. María Luisa Paúl reports for the Washington Post.

Federal immigration agents yesterday used pepper spray to force their way through a crowd in Minneapolis to reach their vehicles following an identification sweep tied to the Trump administration’s crackdown on Somali immigrants, according to City Council Members Jamal Osman and an AP News videographer. Mark Vancleave and Steve Karnowski report for AP News.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday suggested that Lindsey Halligan should resign as U.S. attorney after a ruling declared her appointment unlawful, pointing toward Alina Habba’s resignation on Monday. The judge also asked whether there was any legal guidance issued by the Justice Department to explain why Halligan is still in the job. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has advised internally that Halligan could stay because the judge’s decision declaring her appointment invalid did not require a specific measure to be taken, according to sources. Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) removed language from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have restored a State Department office tasked with relocating Afghan refugees, a senior Senate Democrat and another source said yesterday. The sources said that language reestablishing the office was included in the compromise NDAA as recently as Friday, and that Johnson and Republican leadership had scrapped it over the weekend. Eric Bazail-Eimil reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge yesterday granted the Justice Department’s motion to release grand jury material and other nonpublic evidence from the criminal case of Ghislaine Maxwell. James Hill reports for ABC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought signalled over the weekend that the White House may again use a reconciliation bill to increase defense spending next year. This approach has sparked criticism from Democrats and Republican lawmakers, who warn it sets a dangerous precedent and erodes one of the last areas of bipartisan consensus on the Hill. “I would prefer to use the regular appropriations process,” Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-MS) said. The strategy of combining a reconciliation package with the base defense budget could potentially push defense spending above $1 trillion. Anthony Adragna and Briana Reilly report for Punch Bowl News

The Trump administration has appointed Gregg Phillips, who has no official experience managing emergencies and has repeatedly claimed that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election, as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Office for Response and Recovery. Brianna Sacks reports for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, State, and Defense seeking disclosure of records related to the use of military force against civilian boats the government alleges were carrying drugs. Mariana Alfaro and Amy B Wang report for the Washington Post.

But how you enforce the law is just as important as the law itself.","The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 allowed runaway slaves to be grabbed off the street. Those who interfered or helped fugitive slaves escape were fined $500. When enslaved people escaped, plantation owners relied on state and local government officials for enforcement.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 took it a step further. While it also allowed runaway slaves to be grabbed off the street, it made the federal government responsible for enforcing the law, and imposed harsh penalties ($1,000 fines and up to six-months imprisonment) on federal marshals who refused to help.

I am in no way equating the brutal institution of slavery with violations of immigration laws.

According to the laws of the United States, it was illegal for the enslaved to escape slavery and it is illegal now to enter this country without complying with the immigration laws.

But on our streets, you’re seeing law enforcement use tactics that were also prominently used in 1793 and 1850.

We pride ourselves to the world that we are a country based on the Rule of Law. The Rule of Law safeguards fundamental human rights, protects against the arbitrary exercise of power, and applies laws equally and fairly to everyone, regardless of who they are.

I was a New Orleans police officer. All professionally trained police officers in this country worth their salt know that the enforcement tactics used are unprofessional and unsafe. If these same enforcement tactics were used by any police officer, it would be illegal in a court of law.

When I was a judge, I found that the NOPD was engaged in a selective-enforcement policy profiling Latino drivers and barred them from continuing that practice.

I am not advocating that we should not enforce our immigration laws.

The teachings of two philosophers come to mind. George Santayana said, “Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”

G.W.F. Hegel said, “History teaches us that man learns nothing from history.”

Ministers from 27 EU member nations are meeting in Brussels to discuss countering migrant smuggling, with a keynote speech by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In Strasbourg, France, representatives from the Council of Europe — 46 countries from Iceland to Azerbaijan — are expected to debate making deporting migrants easier for signatories to key treaties.

Denmark was part of a nine-nation attempt last year to curtail the power of the European Court of Human Rights, the independent legal arm of the Council of Europe. Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland argued that the court's interpretation of rights obligations prevented them from expelling migrants who commit crimes. That effort ultimately failed, but support for its basic tenets has since grown.

The European Court of Human Rights handles complaints against the Council of Europe, under the European Convention on Human Rights, including many cases involving migrants and asylum-seekers. The intergovernmental organization is not an EU institution and was set up in the wake of the World War II to promote peace and democracy.

Centrist and left-wing parties across Europe are coalescing around the idea of tougher migration policies as a way to blunt the momentum of far-right politicians exploiting discontent over immigration.

The prime ministers of Denmark and the U.K. published an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday calling for tightening migration controls to deny entry to those seeking better economic opportunities as opposed to fleeing conflict.

“For decades, citizens in our countries have demanded action. So we are acting — not to exploit these issues and stoke grievances as some do, but to find real solutions,” wrote Mette Frederiksen and Keir Starmer. “The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem.”

Illegal border crossings into the EU were down 22% from January to October this year, according to Frontex, the EU’s border and coast guard agency. The agency recorded 152,000 unauthorized border crossings in the first 10 months of the year.

Most migration to Europe happens legally, by air, with some immigrants overstaying tourist visas.

The EU has spent billions of euros (dollars) to deter irregular migration, paying countries in Africa and the Middle East to intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean of the Atlantic. At the same time, European nations facing labor shortages and an aging population are in desperate need of more workers and have been investing in programs to attract and train foreign workers.

The secretary-general of the Council of Europe, Alain Berset, said ahead of the Strasbourg meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights was “the final safeguard of individual rights and freedoms across our continent.”

“The convention’s future and Europe’s direction are inseparable,” he said.

Ministers called on the council’s Committee of Ministers to prepare a draft political declaration reaffirming the obligation to ensure the effective enjoyment of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the ECHR to everyone within the jurisdiction of member states, “in the context of these challenges”.

They also specified that the text should also take into account “governments’ fundamental responsibility to ensure national vital interests such as security and public safety”.

The declaration is expected to be adopted at the next formal session of the Committee of Ministers in the Moldovan capital Chisinau in May 2026.

The ministers also backed the development of a new recommendation on deterring and fighting the smuggling of migrants, with full respect for their human rights.

DHS called him a “predator” and said the government would not grant green cards to “child abusers.”

When KUTV contacted local ICE public information officers, they could not confirm the allegations. A search of Utah’s state court system also found no such criminal history — only a citation for texting and driving in 2024.

Celis’s attorney, Adam Crayk, said the DHS post is false and defamatory and plans to sue the department for libel. He said the accusations stem from a sealed juvenile case involving Celis when he was around 16 years old.

According to Crayk, the situation involved two teenagers in a relationship and did not include the offenses DHS publicly claimed.

“They were boyfriend and girlfriend, there was literally nothing related to sodomy in anything that happened at the juvenile adjudication,” he said. “We had two kids, a girl who could not consent, and candidly, a young man who, at the time, could not consent either. A family that was upset about the relationship and a record that was subsequently sealed.”

Utah law requires all juvenile court records to be sealed, so KUTV cannot independently confirm the details, though Crayk maintains the juvenile filings did not include sodomy.

Utah family shocked after ICE arrests husband during final green card interview

Attorney answers questions about man arrested by ICE at immigration review

The DHS post came just a week after Celis was taken into custody during what was supposed to be his final green card interview in West Valley City. Crayk said Celis has no adult criminal record and should have left that appointment with an approved green card.

Celis, who reportedly came to the United States from Mexico at age 10, overstayed a visa that expired six months later in 2008. His wife, Lexie Celis, a U.S. citizen, said the arrest has torn their family apart.

“For all the people who think that they’re just getting criminals, I am an example of them tearing our family apart,” she said. “I just feel betrayed. I feel no U.S. citizen should have to go through this.”

The couple has been married for four years and has a young child, a U.S. citizen. DHS documents show Celis’ father is a U.S. citizen, and his mother is a Mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident with a green card.

ICE issued its own statement on Tuesday saying Celis “is an illegal alien from Mexico” who overstayed a 2007 visa and was arrested for that violation.

Department of Homeland Security documents state Celis will remain in custody pending removal proceedings and is expected to appear before an immigration judge on Jan. 14, 2026, at 8 a.m. in Las Vegas.

Celis’ attorneys also provided KUTV with the DHS Notice to Appear documents filed this week. They show Celis was taken into custody on Dec. 2 at noon in Salt Lake City. The documents state:

He entered the U.S. in July 2007 as a B-2 tourist and remained beyond the January 2008 expiration date.

He applied for a marriage-based green card in November 2024.

Criminal-history checks were negative.

NCIC records showed no wants or warrants.

The “basis for ICE charges” section was left blank.

Crayk said those federal records directly contradict DHS’s public claims of criminal history and show the agency misrepresented sealed juvenile allegations to portray Celis as a child predator.

“We were appalled and disheartened to see our own government engage in a smear campaign with information that is sealed and only available to the government through their national security powers,” he said. “Even more disheartening is the fact that the government labeled Jair Celis with a title that was never proven, never established, and did not even enter into any of the record in juvenile court.”

“To be clear, under Utah and U.S. immigration law, juvenile adjudications are not criminal convictions and do not constitute criminal history,” he said.

Crayk added that immigration court records list Celis’ criminal history as “none” and said ICE officers handled the case appropriately, while DHS leadership did not.

“You would think that someone tweeting from a DHS leadership position would verify before publishing inaccurate and salacious garbage to the world,” Crayk said. “All this will do is create a wider divide and more polarizing behavior between those that support the administration and those that do not.”

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees.
Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.","The Trump administration is transforming the agency known for processing green cards and citizenship requests into one of its strongest anti-immigration policing arms.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.

Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.

Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring ""homeland defenders"" and tackling fraud.

During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that ""at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.""

The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.

It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.

With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the ""Fork in the Road"" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)

And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.

""'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,"" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.

""There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,"" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.

Rapid changes after deadly shooting

The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.

After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,"" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.

""USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,"" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.

""Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.""

Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.

The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.

The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.

Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.

""They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,"" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. ""That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.""

In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.

""Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,"" Gelatt said.

USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics

The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.

For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: ""homeland defenders.""

It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be ""interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.""

The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.

The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.

USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of ""homeland defender"" and has made ""hundreds"" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.

""USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,"" the release stated.

It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.

""Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,"" Gelatt said. ""That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.""

USCIS workers defend past enforcement

The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.

Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.

""There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,"" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.

One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes ""overwhelmed"" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.

USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.

So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.

""It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,"" the employee said. ""It seems impossible.""

USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it ""works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.

Not ""an adversarial office""

Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.

Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.

""USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,"" he said. ""They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.""

Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.

""It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,"" Welsh said.

Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.

""We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,"" Welsh said. ""If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.""

The president told the crowd gathered at a casino and resort in Mount Pocono that inflation was no longer a problem and that Democrats had used the term ""affordability"" as a ""hoax"" to hurt his reputation. But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.

""Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?"" Trump said onstage. ""Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?""

Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from ""hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries."" He added for emphasis that those places ""are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.""

Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.

Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans

Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.

""I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,"" Trump said. ""They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.""

As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.

As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem

But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.

Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.

""Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,"" said Heddy, 72.

But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.

""That's what we were originally told,"" said Vena, 66. ""Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.""

The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters ""aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.""

It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.

Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.

""We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,"" Riley said. ""We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.""

Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show ""The Mom View"" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

""We're actually going to turn that on its head,"" Wiles said, ""and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.""

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering ""A-plus,"" only to then amend his answer to ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.

""You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,"" he told the crowd. ""Two or three is nice.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6340x3566+0+330/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fed%2F0dd5b6fa4d92ad9d0aed00e75ef3%2Fap25344087106176.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 05:57:15.593621

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.
Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.
“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote.","The Republican-controlled House and Senate have not done much to stand in the way of President Donald Trump — even when his actions have encroached on terrain the Constitution reserved for them.

But there are signs that some Republican lawmakers are trying to reassert their independence.

When news broke last week that the Pentagon carried out a second strike on two individuals on a largely-destroyed alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, even some Republicans expressed alarm.

""Somebody made a horrible decision,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. told reporters in the Capitol. ""Somebody needs to be held accountable. This is our job. This is part of oversight. That's pretty straightforward.""

The strikes are not the only actions that have spurred a handful of Republicans to stake out a bit of daylight with the Trump Administration. Some have criticized Trump's tariffs, like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.

""Our lobsterman, our blueberry growers, our potato farmers will pay the price,"" Collins said in October, before a vote to roll back tariffs on Canada.

Ahead of the upcoming expiration date for enhanced health care subsidies, which Trump has signaled indifference to renewing, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned last month of a ""massive crisis unless Congress acts.""

Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon has been one of the most consistent critics of Trump's approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine. Bacon consistently calls it a soft touch, particularly in contrast to Trump's approach to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""The velvet glove, red carpet treatment for Putin and then the condescending, boorish behavior that the president and the vice president has done towards Zelenskyy – it's a contrast,"" Bacon told Nebraska Public Media earlier this year.

Senators have also pushed back on Trump's intermittent calls to end the filibuster. ""You'd have to be smoking wizard weed to vote for that,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters during the 43 day government shutdown that ended last month.

And Trump's reluctance to release the investigative files into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein spurred a break between the president and one of his closest allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""He called me a traitor for standing with these women,"" she said.

Moments of GOP resistance or a growing trend?

After months of the White House steamrolling Congress on tariffs, appropriations and military intervention, even this careful pushback is a departure, says former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Az.).

Flake says the shift is accelerating with Trump's declining approval rating. The pushback also grew following Republicans' poor performance in off-year elections last month.

""There was a lot of fear about what he could do to you electorally,"" Flake said. ""That's diminishing.""

Flake, who did not run for reelection in 2018 in part because he refused to unconditionally back Trump, says some lawmakers are now more willing to say aloud what they long expressed behind closed doors.

""Obviously behind the scenes, it's a whole different ballgame,"" he said. ""This migration is happening and when Republicans get there, they'll get to a new-old place where they were on some of these threshold issues that have animated conservatives for decades.""

But this is not the first time observers have declared a new era, only for Trump to firm up his grip on Congressional Republicans, including the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.

""A lot of us have been wrong on how long this has endured,"" he said.

Most of the Republicans vocalizing their disagreements are retiring, represent competitive districts or are perennial centrists. And some of the splits with Trump have not been over traditional Republican values, but urging him to follow through on the populist platform he ran on.

Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Congress has made some recent attempts to push back on the White House, like resolutions rebuking the tariffs and boat strikes, but they have not been very successful or sufficient.

""I'd like to see more, and I believe that if we don't stand up for our powers under the Constitution, nobody else will,"" Murkowski told NPR in an interview.

Constitutional role of Congress

The framers gave the Congress the power to appropriate funds, to declare war and levy taxes, like tariffs.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.

""I don't know how much different this one is,"" Thune told NPR. ""A lot of times if I have differences with the administration, I don't litigate it in public. But we do have a responsibility as partners to try to get an agenda done for the American people that they voted for.""

Molly Reynolds, a Brookings Institution expert on Congress, says it's true this is not just a Trump-era phenomenon. Congress has been ceding power to the executive and judicial branches for decades.

""And in some cases, Congress has been a willing and eager participant in sacrificing its own power to the other branches,"" she said.

Reynolds said this did not start with Trump's willingness to act more unilaterally in his second term, but it did escalate the trend. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) recently told The Katie Miller Podcast that, ""We have this joke that I'm not really a Speaker of the House.""

Reynolds, who jokingly calls herself a partisan of the first branch, says it is no accident the legislative branch is established in Article 1 of the Constitution. She said the framers saw the legislative branch as the closest to the people. The separation of powers and checks and balances are foundational concepts of the American form of government.

Reynolds said there is precedent for Congress taking steps to reassert its power, like the Watergate-era reforms to reign in the power of the president.

""It was in a really different political moment than the one we're living in now,"" Reynolds said, noting that politics is more polarized today. ""Which is part of what makes it challenging to see the prospects for a similar burst of institutional patriotism.""

Raul Malo, the leader of the country band The Mavericks and one of the most recognizable voices in roots music, died Monday night, according to a representative of the band. The guitarist and singer had been battling cancer.

He was hospitalized last week, forcing him to miss tribute shows staged in his honor at the Ryman Auditorium over the weekend. He was 60 years old.

""No one embodied life and love, joy and passion, family, friends, music and adventure the way our beloved Raul did,"" read a statement released by his family.

Malo's group, The Mavericks, mourned the loss of their leader in a social post.

""Anyone with the pleasure of being in Raul's orbit knew that he was a force of human nature, with an infectious energy,"" the statement read. ""Over a career of more than three decades entertaining millions around the globe, his towering creative contributions and unrivaled, generational talent created the kind of multicultural American music reaching far beyond America itself.""

Over a career that lasted four decades, The Mavericks lived up to the band's name, challenging expectations and following a roadmap crafted by Malo's expansive musical upbringing as the son of Cuban immigrants in Miami.

""I grew up in a very musical household. There was all kinds of music around always,"" he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1995. ""We listened to everything from Hank Williams to Celia Cruz to Sam Cooke to Bobby Darin. It didn't matter.""

In 1992, Malo told NPR that his widespread influences weren't always understood or appreciated in his South Florida hometown, but he said that his struggle to fit in taught him to trust his instincts. Malo had become the guitarist and lead singer for The Mavericks in 1989, alongside co-founders Robert Reynolds and Paul Deakin, and his roaring, sentimental voice defined the band's sound and remained its constant as the group's catalog moved from slow, tender ballads to full-throttle rock songs. In 1995, the band released its biggest hit with ""All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,"" a swinging country song featuring an assist from Tex-Mex accordion legend Flaco Jimenez.

As the band grew in members and devoted listeners, The Mavericks continued to push the boundaries of American music, weaving a richly layered tapestry of textures and stories. With more than a dozen studio albums, The Mavericks collected praise and recognition from the Academy of Country Music, the Country Music Association and the Recording Academy. Although they took a hiatus for several years, Malo never stopped making music — and returned to his bandmates with renewed inspiration.

Following its 30th anniversary, the group released its first full-length Spanish album in 2020, aptly titled En Español. The record reimagined Latin standards and folklore-tinged popular tunes; it also made an implicit political statement about Latin music's contributions to American culture.

""In our own little way, if we could get somebody that perhaps is on the fence on issues and hears us singing in Spanish and perhaps reminds them of the beautiful cultures that make up what this country is trying to be and what it should be, so be it,"" Malo told NPR at the time. ""Yeah, I'm OK with that.""

The following year, the Americana Music Association recognized The Mavericks with the Trailblazer Award. In 2024, the band released its last studio album, Moon & Stars. The release coincided with news of Malo's cancer diagnosis, which he discussed openly with NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.

Before being hospitalized last week, Malo had been scheduled to perform with The Mavericks at a pair of tribute concerts held this past weekend at the legendary Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Over 30 artists, including Patty Griffin, Jim Lauderdale and Steve Earle, still gathered to pay tribute to Malo, with some of the proceeds of the night going to the cancer prevention organization Stand Up To Cancer.

According to his spokesperson, though Malo was too ill to attend, the concert was streamed to his hospital room Friday night.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has mostly blocked efforts to investigate misconduct within its ranks, according to the county inspector general, who announced his retirement Tuesday after 12 years on the job.

In an open letter, Max Huntsman cited examples of how the county has thwarted his efforts to watchdog the department, which in the past has been plagued with accusations that deputies use excessive force and lie on the job.

Huntsman said one example is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s misuse of criminal enforcement powers to discredit critics, such as opening an investigation into former County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.

Villanueva was sheriff from 2018 to 2022.

“My requests for investigation were rejected,” Huntsman’s letter reads. “Even after receiving an official subpoena, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to turn over records regarding the improper surveillance.”

He added: “Sometimes members of the public wonder if frightening new surveillance techniques will be used for improper purposes under the guise of criminal investigation. Sadly, the answer is yes.”

Before becoming inspector general in 2013, Huntsman, 60, was a deputy district attorney who specialized in public corruption. He told LAist on Tuesday that the inspector general job wasn’t something he wanted initially.

“I didn’t want to go work for politicians,” he said. “But the need to provide some kind of independent reporting and analysis was significant.”

The Sheriff’s Department issued a statement saying it valued the Office of the Inspector General and all county oversight bodies and that it wished Huntsman and his family well in his retirement.

The department said it “continues to make great strides in advancing the department in a transparent manner.”

LAist also reached out to the county CEO and county counsel for comment, but they declined.

After George Floyd

In the letter, Huntsman says the state of California has come a long way in strengthening the power of local law enforcement oversight bodies, in part because of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

After widespread protests — and lobbying by Huntsman — the state provided authority to inspectors general to enforce subpoenas requiring law enforcement agencies to hand over documents and authorized external investigation of police misconduct, including deputy gang conduct.

The Sheriff’s Department — backed by county lawyers — has resisted.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote. “The county refuses to require the photographing of suspected gang tattoos in secretive groups that the undersheriff has identified as violating state law.”

“Just a few weeks ago, we requested some information regarding an investigation, and a pair of commanders refused to give it to us,” Huntsman said in an interview with LAist.

Origin of the office

The Inspector General’s Office was created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2013 in response to a scandal that included former Sheriff Lee Baca covering up the abuses of jail inmates.

Baca went to federal prison.

Since then, the office has issued dozens of reports with recommendations for improving living conditions inside jails that some have described as “filthy,” stopping abuses of juveniles inside juvenile halls and providing shower privacy for inmates as part of the requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.

“All of these abuses were reported by the Office of Inspector General and recommendations were ignored,” Huntsman wrote. Often, it took court orders to enact change.

“When we first blew the whistle on the torturous chaining of mentally ill prisoners to benches for 36 hours at a time, it was only a court order that ended the practice,” he wrote. “Time and time again, this pattern repeated itself.”

Huntsman wrote the county has permitted the Sheriff’s Department to block oversight and defunded the Office of Inspector General by removing a third of its staff.

“It's not surprising the county has driven out two successive chairs of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission,” he wrote.

“Government always claims to value transparency and accountability, but shooting the messenger is still the most common response to criticism,” Huntsman wrote.

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work

Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.

“I’ve really enjoyed the work and I’m sad to have it end,” he said.

It’s a sentiment he echoed in his letter, adding that despite the setbacks and roadblocks, he was proud of the people with whom he shared the office.

“It has been my honor to work with a talented, brave and tireless group of public servants to ensure that the public knows what its government is doing,” he wrote.

He noted the inspector general’s reports are fact-checked by the office and public.

“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote. “What you do about it is up to you.,”

The Court of Appeal followed the consistent line of case law from the European Court of Human Rights in stating that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties. This is well-established doctrine. The judgment is, however, significant as the earlier tribunal decisions in IA have played a critical role in influencing policy making in respect of immigration and human rights law. First, the tribunal decisions in IA were cited as indicative of the problems with Article 8 ECHR in legal advice that was published by the Conservative Party in relation to withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (the Wolfson Report). Second, it appears that the tribunal decisions in IA have shaped the Government’s proposal to legislate on the definition to be applied to family life (Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy). Given these developments it is essential that we examine what the Court of Appeal has determined and what this might mean for reform proposals.

The Background and Facts in IA

IA concerned a family from Gaza that was seeking reunification with a family member in the UK. The family consisted of a father, mother and their four children (who were aged 18, 17, 8 and 7). They applied to enter to join the younger brother of the father (their sponsor) who had been living and working in the UK since 2007 and is now a British citizen. They were not eligible to apply for entry under the Immigration Rules and thus they sought leave for entry outside the rules. Their application was rejected by the Home Office.

In considering whether the decision to reject the application was compatible with Article 8 ECHR, the First Tier Tribunal (FTT) held that although there was family life, such that Article 8 ECHR was applicable, the right could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. The FTT’s decision was later overturned by the Upper Tribunal (UT) on the basis that there were flaws in the way in which the FTT had assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. The UT thus remade the decision and allowed the applicants’ appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

It was the UT’s decision which then became the basis of a dispute in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister, during which the Prime Minister stated:

Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The Leader of the Opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last Government, according to their legal framework. However, let me be clear: it should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the Government who make the policy. That is the principle. The Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.

This led to a rebuke from the Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, who commented that she was ‘deeply troubled’ by the exchange between Kemi Badenoch and Keir Starmer as ‘both the question and the answer were unacceptable’. She went on to state that:

It is for government to visibly respect and protect the independence of the judiciary. Where parties, including the government, disagree with the judgment they should do so through the appellate process. Of course, MPs, just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law. I have taken this up as you would imagine and expect. I have written to the prime minister and lord chancellor.

In May 2025 the Court of Appeal granted permission to appeal to enable the Court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family.

While the appeal was pending, IA was cited in the Conservative Party’s Wolfson Report as part of the rationale for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights. The Wolfson report stated (at [45]) that:

courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.

It then cited IA in relation to its determination (at [45]) that:

The problematic effect of this in practice is that it provides first-tier judges with a broad margin within which “family life” can be found to exist, and a similarly broad margin of discretion for finding whether there has been an interference with such right and whether that interference can be justified (particularly given that the treatment of family members outside the UK can be taken into consideration when establishing whether there has been interference with the right to family life).

Following which it appears that IA, and the discourse surrounding it, fed into the Government’s proposal in November 2025 to set out in primary legislation the meaning of ‘family life’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. This is the political backdrop to the Court of Appeal judgment.

The Court of Appeal’s Judgment

Before the Court of Appeal, the SSHD argued, amongst other things, that there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR and that, even if the Convention right applied, the UT had erred in conducting the proportionality analysis. The SSHD succeeded on both those grounds. The Court of Appeal held that the proper test had not been applied by the tribunals and that applying the correct test there was no family life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. Though this would have been sufficient to allow the appeal, the Court of Appeal also agreed that even if there had been family life that the UT had made several errors in undertaking the balancing exercise. Essentially, too much weight had been given to the family’s interests, while insufficient weight had been accorded to the Government’s immigration policies. The Court of Appeal thus concluded that the UT should not have determined that the balance was struck in favour of entry.

Given the Government is proposing to introduce legislation on the definition of family life it is necessary to examine what the Court of Appeal said about the test for family life and how this aligns with the policy proposals.

Prior to clarifying the test for family life, the Court of Appeal conducted a thorough review of both the ECHR authorities and the domestic authorities. It concluded (at [60]) that:

the consistent jurisprudence of the ECtHR from S v UK [a 1984 Commission case] onwards has been that family life, within the autonomous meaning of article 8(1), is only to be found between adult siblings where “additional elements of dependence involving more than the normal emotional ties” are demonstrated.

The Court of Appeal was thus clear that the ECHR case law is not ambiguous on this point. In respect of the domestic case law, the Court of Appeal noted that while there may have been some twists and turns ‘the domestic courts have been consistently attempting to follow that ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [61]). Consequently, ‘[e]ven if some of the domestic decisions may have provided divergent interpretations of the additional elements of the dependency test, none has suggested that they wanted to depart from the ECtHR jurisprudence’ (at [117]). The Court of Appeal therefore held that the correct test is that set out by the ECtHR in Kumari and the House of Lords in Beoku-Betts (at [116]), namely that in cases not concerning the core family, family life will only be established where there are ‘additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties’ ([at 119]). The Court of Appeal also confirmed that this is a fact-sensitive exercise (at [119]), that ‘financial dependency and dependency created by physical or mental disability both play a part in the evaluation’ but that it is not necessary to demonstrate ‘exclusive or complete dependency’ (at [120]). Applying this to the facts, the Court found that although there were close emotional ties that additional elements of dependency had not been demonstrated in this case.

How then does the dependency test identified and used by the Court of Appeal in IA compare with the Government plans for reform? The Government’s policy document states that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. As I observed in an earlier blog post some confusion arises from the fact that when the Home Secretary announced the policy in Parliament she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’, an approach which is narrower than that stated in the policy document. We can therefore identify three ways in which the Government might seek to legislate in respect of the definition of family life: (i) an additional elements of dependence test (i.e. following the wording of the case law) ; (ii) an exceptionally close link test (i.e. following the wording of the policy document) and (iii) a parents and children only test (i.e. following the statement of the Home Secretary).

(i) Additional Elements of Dependence Model

The first option is that the ‘additional elements of dependence’ test, as confirmed by the Court of Appeal in IA, will be placed on a legislative footing. If future legislation simply replicates this test, then this would be no substantive change at all. It is, however, possible that any legislation might also purport to specify the criteria that the courts should apply in determining whether that dependency threshold is met. Those criteria might reflect those that have been identified in case law i.e. factors such as physical or mental dependency or financial dependency (as acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in IA). However, as the Court of Appeal observed in IA the dependency test is a fact-sensitive exercise, and the examples are non-exhaustive. Consequently, to remain compatible with Article 8 ECHR any legislation would need to both encompass what is in the existing case law while also not limiting the interpretation of dependency to those circumstances. In this regard it is worth observing that the Court of Appeal opined that ‘[i]n our judgment it is undesirable to lay down hard and fast rules as to how the additional elements of dependency test should be applied’ (at [125]).

(ii) Exceptionally Close Link Model

A second possibility is that legislation may replicate the language from the Government’s policy document i.e. introducing the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’. As I have indicated previously, this could encompass a broader category of persons than those who currently fall within the dependency test and certainly introducing a new concept is likely to result in further ambiguity. This is evident if we consider the approaches to family life that were examined in IA. In IA the applicants argued that the ‘additional elements of dependency’ test is the ‘other side of the coin’ of a ‘real, committed or effective support’ test. The reference to ‘real, committed or effective support’ derives from dictum of Sedley LJ in Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 at [17], which had been used by the FTT in IA as a means of determining whether there was family life. The applicants thus argued that where there is ‘real, committed or effective support’, which the FTT had found that there was on these facts, that the dependency test is satisfied and Article 8 ECHR is applicable. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal on the basis that it is possible for there to be ‘real support’ without there being any ‘serious dependency’ (at [122]). Consequently, it observed that while:

it would be going too far to say that it is wrong to test whether there are additional elements of dependency by reference to real, committed or effective support provided’ the fact of ‘real, committed and effective support is not the test itself, because the level of real support, for example, may be minor or insignificant, whereas the word “dependency” denotes a significant relationship. This is not a semantic point. (at [123] emphasis in original)

Indeed, the fact that this was not a semantic point was borne out by IA itself as the Court of Appeal found that the FTT had applied the ‘real committed and effective support test’ and that this was a ‘less exacting standard’ (at [128]). It went on to observe:

The FTT had said expressly that the support test was a lower one than the dependence test and that there was no need to establish dependency. As we have explained, dependency is different from support. Establishing real, committed or effective support by itself may or may not be sufficient to establish additional elements of dependency for the existence of family life between adult siblings. (at [128]).

If we consider the Government’s approach in light of this then it appears that while an ‘exceptionally close link’ can be interpreted as requiring ‘additional elements of dependency’, it can also be read as encompassing cases where there is ‘real, committed and effective support’. Bringing forth legislation based on the concept of an ‘exceptionally close link’ may thus run the risk of reintroducing the very approach that was rejected by the Court of Appeal in IA. This is clearly not what the Government intends. Yet the adoption of different language in legislation from that which is currently used in the case law inevitably raises the spectre of further ambiguity, and consequently litigation, in respect of the meaning of family life. Again, this is clearly contrary to what the Government intends.

(iii) Parents and Children Only Model

As I have observed previously, a final possibility is that the legislation might reflect the approach stated by the Home Secretary ie. purporting to narrow ‘family life’ to ‘parents and their children’. If this approach is adopted, then the legislative provision would be incompatible with the Convention unless it is framed in a manner which enables the courts to read it compatibly using section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Introducing legislation that needs to be read compatibly using section 3 in order to ultimately arrive at a position that is already established in the case law is clearly convoluted and undesirable.

It will therefore be interesting to see what happens to the Government’s proposal in the light of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in IA. One possibility is that this aspect of the reform proposal will quietly fall away. If, however, legislation is brought forward then it will be necessary to examine whether it simply reflects the current law or whether there will be an attempt to redefine family life, a prospect that currently appears to be neither necessary nor desirable.

In its 2025–26 term, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship.

Oral arguments are expected to take place in the spring of 2026; the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling by summer 2026.

Although the executive order is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision, USCIS has issued guidance outlining how the order would be applied and enforced, if upheld.

In January 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14160, which aimed to place restrictions on birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who were present in the country temporarily or without lawful status. The order would significantly abridge the long-standing constitutional guarantee of automatic citizenship for virtually all children born in the United States, as recognized in the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The order has not yet taken effect; multiple lawsuits produced preliminary injunctions in the lower courts. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published an implementation plan in July, outlining how the order would be applied.

Background on EO 14160

Section 1 of the executive order provides that a child born in the United States would no longer automatically be entitled to citizenship at birth in two situations: (1) when the mother was unlawfully present and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; or (2) when the mother’s presence was lawful but temporary (for example, under the Visa Waiver Program or on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

EO 14160 directs federal agencies to withhold citizenship documentation for such births, with the policy applying prospectively thirty days after the order, while clarifying that it does not affect, for example, children of lawful permanent residents. The order frames this position as consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 8 U.S.C. § 1401’s “subject to the jurisdiction” language.

Legal Challenges to EO 14160

Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the executive order on birthright citizenship as unconstitutional under Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment (the “Citizenship Clause”). Federal district judges in Washington State and Maryland entered injunctions blocking enforcement while the cases proceeded. In late June, in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court curtailed federal district courts’ use of so-called nationwide (universal) injunctions, without resolving the order’s constitutionality, and litigation continued in the lower courts.

Following CASA, in Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction and an order granting provisional class certification, which prevented the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a certified class of babies born on or after February 20, 2025, who otherwise would be denied U.S. citizenship under the executive order. And in State of Washington v. Trump, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the executive order was “invalid because it contradict[ed] the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In September 2025, the Trump administration’s lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court for review. The Trump administration’s certiorari petition requested that the Supreme Court review both Washington and Barbara; however, the Court’s order of December 5, 2025, indicates it will only take up the issue in Barbara. The case, expected to be argued in the spring with a definitive ruling to be issued by the end of June or early July 2026, will likely determine the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.

USCIS’s Implementation Plan for EO 14160

Although the EO is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Barbara, USCIS’s implementation plan, released on July 25, 2025, outlines how the order would be applied if it were ultimately upheld. The memo explains that “unlawfully present” refers to people in the United States without permission or those who have stayed longer than allowed, as defined in Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It also explains the difference between “unlawful status” and “unlawfully present.” For example, people paroled into the United States might not have a lawful immigration status, but they are not considered unlawfully present if they have permission to stay from the attorney general.

Since the term “lawful but temporary” presence isn’t clearly defined in the INA, USCIS has provided its own definition. This includes people who are in the United States legally for a limited time or under conditions that require them to reapply for continued stay. Examples include nonimmigrants, parolees, temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries, and deferred action recipients. USCIS also addresses the status of children born in the United States to parents with lawful but temporary status. These children do not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or U.S. nationals. To avoid negative immigration consequences for these children, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS propose allowing them to register and acquire the lawful status of at least one parent.

This proposal is similar to existing provisions for children of foreign diplomats born in the United States, who can acquire lawful immigration status through registration. Until this proposal is implemented, DHS suggests deferring immigration enforcement actions, including detention, removal, or deportation against these children, even though they may not be recognized as U.S. citizens under the proposed policy.

If the constitutionality of the executive order is upheld, a U.S. birth certificate alone would no longer suffice as proof of citizenship. Parents would need to provide documentation of the mother’s lawful status or the father’s citizen or permanent resident status.

Next Steps

With the executive order’s enforcement currently halted, the future of this policy remains uncertain. The Supreme Court will determine whether to uphold EO 14160, with significant implications for foreign nationals in the United States, depending on the scope of the ruling. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June or July of 2026.

In a speech that the White House billed as an address on the economy, amid a backlash driven in part by Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, Mr. Trump veered between assurances that life was better than ever under his administration and blaming immigrants for the country’s economic woes.

Mr. Trump revived what had been an effective campaign message, promising that sending immigrants home would mean “more jobs, better wages and higher income for American citizens,” though the early stages of his mass deportation campaign have so far coincided with widespread economic anxiety.

He earned raucous cheers from his supporters as he spoke of “reverse migration” and trumpeted what he called a “permanent pause” on immigration from “hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries.”

Soon after, a member of the crowd yelled out a crude term that Mr. Trump used during his first administration to disparage Haiti and some nations in Africa. The president laughed.

“I didn’t say ‘shithole,’ you did!” Mr. Trump replied with a grin. He then recounted his use of the term at a White House meeting in 2018 to describe countries that he was balking at accepting immigrants from. Mr. Trump had then denied saying that after it was publicly reported. Nearly six years later, he appeared proud of the remark.

Throughout the speech, Mr. Trump doubled down on a barrage of incendiary attacks that he has unleashed against immigrants since the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House last month. The day after the shooting, Mr. Trump floated the possibility of stripping naturalized American citizens of their citizenship (which is only done in rare cases) and vowed to deport all immigrants that he saw as “non-compatible with Western civilization.”

During his xenophobic tirade, Mr. Trump made little distinction between unauthorized migrants and those who followed all the correct procedures to enter the country and eventually become American citizens. He described Somali immigrants as lazy, murderous and “garbage,” and said the home countries of many immigrants were “filthy, dirty, disgusting.”

He singled out Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, referring to her hijab as “the little turban.” He again called for her to be deported, and the crowd responded by chanting, “Send her back.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/multimedia/09trump-news-somalia2-cbvk/09trump-news-somalia2-cbvk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 00:56:30.410889

Members of the couple's Middle Church family and immigration advocates rallied Tuesday to free the man who came to the U.S. in 2013 from the Cayman Islands, seeking asylum based on his LGBTQ+ identity. A decade later, the couple met and got married and filed their own immigration paperwork.

""Allan is a man who kept meticulous track of his immigration paperwork and tried to do everything by the book,"" said Alexandra Rizio, supervising immigration attorney for Make the Road New York, which filed a motion to reopen his deportation case.

While the motion is being considered, he can't be deported.

""The Trump administration has fired 25% of immigration judges in New York. When will Allan's case be heard? When will he get his day in court?"" Rizio said.

Lisa Desjardins spoke with one man caught up in what authorities call the Portland sweep now entering its eighth week.

LISA DESJARDINS: Fifty-five-year-old construction worker Victor Cruz was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on his way home from work in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Eyewitness video posted on social media shows ICE agents in civilian clothes pulling him over and arresting him.

The grandfather of two entered the country illegally 26 years ago.

He has a construction business and a work permit.

Victor was detained in Tacoma, Washington, for three weeks.

Victor joins us now with his lawyer, Julia Braker.

Thank you to you both.

You were on your way back from work when you were detained.

Tell us what happened.

VICTOR CRUZ, Detained By ICE: As I saw them stop behind me, I knew that it was ICE.

They asked for my name.

As soon as I get off from my car, I told them that I have a permit to work legally here.

And one of the officers wanted me to show the I.D.

He told me: ""This means nothing to us.

For us, you are still an illegal.""

And they just cuffed me and chained me on -- around my waist, my ankles, and they put me in their vehicle.

LISA DESJARDINS: When you got in the vehicle, it seemed they were looking for someone else.

What did you hear?

VICTOR CRUZ: One of the officers have a picture of the man that they were looking for.

And they were talking just to each other, asking if it was me, if it was the person that they were looking for.

I was scared, terrified, and I was just thinking about my family.

I didn't know at that time if they knew that I was arrested or not.

So it was a terrifying moment.

As soon as they arrest me and we got into a facility, immigration facility in Portland, Oregon, they run my fingerprints.

And still they didn't found anything.

And the other officer just told me: ""Well, since you are here, we must take you to Tacoma.""

LISA DESJARDINS: You were detained for three weeks.

There are a lot of questions about how the Trump administration's handling detention.

What was your experience?

VICTOR CRUZ: They put us in this cell with A.C.

It was really cold.

And the room was -- it's made out of concrete.

The benches are concrete.

In the cell that I put in, in the beginning, it was 80 of us.

And the food also is not good.

It was a lot of hours between one meal to another.

LISA DESJARDINS: Julia, you and another attorney were able to get him out of detention.

What is his status right now?

JULIA BRAKER, Attorney For Victor Cruz: Mr.

Cruz has what's called deferred action status, which means that the Department of Homeland Security has looked at his application and decided that they're going to defer any removal or deportation on his case while his case is pending.

LISA DESJARDINS: But he was still detained despite having that status.

JULIA BRAKER: That's correct.

LISA DESJARDINS: Is that lawful, in your opinion?

JULIA BRAKER: No, because when the Department of Homeland Security makes such a determination, it goes in complete contradiction for it to then detain that person and put them into deportation proceedings.

LISA DESJARDINS: We did reach out to the Department of Homeland Security.

And here's what a spokesman told us about this case in particular.

She said: ""No one was arrested by mistake.

ICE will continue to arrest illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country.

Work authorization does not confer any legal status in this country.""

How do you respond to that statement from Homeland Security?

JULIA BRAKER: I think this statement by Homeland Security is an attempt to obfuscate the fact that Mr.

Cruz's rights were violated in the process of this arrest.

It simply doesn't make sense that the Department of Homeland Security would both grant him a status that explicitly says that he won't be removed and at the same time put him into removal proceedings.

LISA DESJARDINS: Victor, I want to ask you.

There is a fierce debate, of course, about immigration in this country right now, as you well know.

Some people argue that you broke the rules when you entered this country, you did it illegally, and that you should be forced to leave.

What do you say to those people?

VICTOR CRUZ: I don't know if people can say that it was a crime that I crossed the border without any proper documents.

But I can tell to them that they are getting the wrong people.

In the cell that I was in, like I said, it was about 80 people; 90 percent of those people that were in there had no records at all.

LISA DESJARDINS: You now have ankle monitoring.

Your work permit, you were not given that back.

What has this time meant for you and your family?

VICTOR CRUZ: I'm not able to go to work.

And it is awful, because I'm the main provider for my family.

So, it is kind of a scare knowing that the bills and that the rent are not going to wait for us.

My wife and I are very scared to even go outside to the store because there is still a lot of ICE activity around these neighborhoods.

We also discuss about what we're going to do in the case that I get detained again.

It is sad that all this has been happening, but I told my wife and kids that, if anything happens to me again, I just don't want to live the same nightmare again.

I will just sign my deportation right away, because I don't want to go through this again.

Sorry.

It was so hard, not only on me, on myself, but on my family.

They don't think that they can go through the same situation again.

LISA DESJARDINS: That's a discussion no family wants to have.

VICTOR CRUZ: Thank you.

Yes.

I'm so proud of them.

As I saw them stop behind me, I knew that it was ICE.

They asked for my name. As soon as I get off from my car, I told them that I have a permit to work legally here. And one of the officers wanted me to show the I.D. He told me: ""This means nothing to us. For us, you are still an illegal.""

And they just cuffed me and chained me on — around my waist, my ankles, and they put me in their vehicle.

Lisa Desjardins:

When you got in the vehicle, it seemed they were looking for someone else. What did you hear?

Victor Cruz:

One of the officers have a picture of the man that they were looking for. And they were talking just to each other, asking if it was me, if it was the person that they were looking for.

I was scared, terrified, and I was just thinking about my family. I didn't know at that time if they knew that I was arrested or not. So it was a terrifying moment.

As soon as they arrest me and we got into a facility, immigration facility in Portland, Oregon, they run my fingerprints. And still they didn't found anything. And the other officer just told me: ""Well, since you are here, we must take you to Tacoma.""

Lisa Desjardins:

You were detained for three weeks. There are a lot of questions about how the Trump administration's handling detention. What was your experience?

Victor Cruz:

They put us in this cell with A.C. It was really cold. And the room was — it's made out of concrete. The benches are concrete.

In the cell that I put in, in the beginning, it was 80 of us. And the food also is not good. It was a lot of hours between one meal to another.

Lisa Desjardins:

Julia, you and another attorney were able to get him out of detention. What is his status right now?

Julia Braker, Attorney For Victor Cruz:

Mr. Cruz has what's called deferred action status, which means that the Department of Homeland Security has looked at his application and decided that they're going to defer any removal or deportation on his case while his case is pending.

Lisa Desjardins:

But he was still detained despite having that status.

Julia Braker:

That's correct.

Lisa Desjardins:

Is that lawful, in your opinion?

Julia Braker:

No, because when the Department of Homeland Security makes such a determination, it goes in complete contradiction for it to then detain that person and put them into deportation proceedings.

Lisa Desjardins:

We did reach out to the Department of Homeland Security.

And here's what a spokesman told us about this case in particular. She said: ""No one was arrested by mistake. ICE will continue to arrest illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country. Work authorization does not confer any legal status in this country.""

How do you respond to that statement from Homeland Security?

Julia Braker:

I think this statement by Homeland Security is an attempt to obfuscate the fact that Mr. Cruz's rights were violated in the process of this arrest.

It simply doesn't make sense that the Department of Homeland Security would both grant him a status that explicitly says that he won't be removed and at the same time put him into removal proceedings.

Lisa Desjardins:

Victor, I want to ask you. There is a fierce debate, of course, about immigration in this country right now, as you well know.

Some people argue that you broke the rules when you entered this country, you did it illegally, and that you should be forced to leave. What do you say to those people?

Victor Cruz:

I don't know if people can say that it was a crime that I crossed the border without any proper documents.

But I can tell to them that they are getting the wrong people. In the cell that I was in, like I said, it was about 80 people; 90 percent of those people that were in there had no records at all.

Lisa Desjardins:

You now have ankle monitoring. Your work permit, you were not given that back. What has this time meant for you and your family?

Victor Cruz:

I'm not able to go to work. And it is awful, because I'm the main provider for my family.

So, it is kind of a scare knowing that the bills and that the rent are not going to wait for us. My wife and I are very scared to even go outside to the store because there is still a lot of ICE activity around these neighborhoods.

We also discuss about what we're going to do in the case that I get detained again. It is sad that all this has been happening, but I told my wife and kids that, if anything happens to me again, I just don't want to live the same nightmare again. I will just sign my deportation right away, because I don't want to go through this again.

Sorry. It was so hard, not only on me, on myself, but on my family. They don't think that they can go through the same situation again.

Lisa Desjardins:

That's a discussion no family wants to have.

Victor Cruz:

Thank you. Yes. I'm so proud of them.

Lisa Desjardins:

Julia Braker and Victor Cruz, thank you so much for talking with us.

Julia Braker:

Thank you.

Victor Cruz:

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote.
“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote.
""Remember, SAVE borrowers have not been in repayment for years.","Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, Los Angeles educators have said the increase in immigration enforcement actions contributed to more somber graduation ceremonies, lower attendance and fewer students enrolled in school this year.

Now, a new report from UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access finds similar scenarios are playing out on campuses across the country.

“There can sometimes be a sense that, well, we're facing a set of conditions that are unique to Los Angeles,” said UCLA education professor and report co-author John Rogers. “But every state in the nation, almost every community in the nation has high schools where young people are experiencing fear and concern for themselves and for their family members.”

UCLA researchers based the report on a nationally representative online survey of 606 high school principals and follow-up interviews with about four dozen administrators who said students from immigration families experienced:

Heightened concern: 70% said students from immigrant families were concerned about the well-being of themselves and their families because of policies and political rhetoric related to immigrants.

More absences: 64% said students from immigrant families missed school.

Loss of family members: 58% said immigrant parents and guardians left during the school year, sometimes without their children.

Bullying and harassment: 36% said students from immigrant families have been bullied or harassed at their school, in part because of a “political climate that has normalized attacks on immigrant communities.

LAist has reached out to the Trump administration for comment, but has not yet heard back.

Students’ right to an education

The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that undocumented immigrants have a constitutional right to attend public schools — there are an estimated 39,000 such students enrolled in Los Angeles County.

The number of students with at least one immigrant family member is much greater. For example, almost half of California children have at least one immigrant parent, according to a Public Policy Institute of California analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

How the nation’s principals are handling increased immigration enforcement at schools

On this episode of AirTalk, senior reporter Mariana Dale and UCLA professor John Rogers discuss a new report on a climate of fear in schools around federal immigration policy.

Maria Nichols leads the union that represents Los Angeles Unified School District principals and said that there’s widespread uncertainty among students, families and educators. She is also the daughter of an immigrant from South America who was undocumented for part of her childhood.

“Are we experiencing a crisis now with immigration? Absolutely,” Nichols said. “It's extremely traumatic. It's extremely triggering for people that, you know, lived the immigrant existence. And many of us in education in Los Angeles have lived that.”

In January, the Trump administration reversed a policy that made schools and other ""sensitive"" locations off limits to immigration enforcement actions. In early June, widespread immigration raids started across Southern California. Most arrested in L.A. and nationwide have no criminal record.

“I think a purpose of the federal immigration enforcement policies is to create a level of stress and uncertainty and fear,” Rogers said. “And precisely those dynamics make it hard to sustain student enrollment and student attendance at high levels.”

Rogers said the current climate can disrupt learning for students who do make it to school.

“The extent to which young people are concerned about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families while they're at the school means there's less attention, less focus, less learning going on,” Rogers said.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has mostly blocked efforts to investigate misconduct within its ranks, according to the county inspector general, who announced his retirement Tuesday after 12 years on the job.

In an open letter, Max Huntsman cited examples of how the county has thwarted his efforts to watchdog the department, which in the past has been plagued with accusations that deputies use excessive force and lie on the job.

Huntsman said one example is former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s misuse of criminal enforcement powers to discredit critics, such as opening an investigation into former County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl.

Villanueva was sheriff from 2018 to 2022.

“My requests for investigation were rejected,” Huntsman’s letter reads. “Even after receiving an official subpoena, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to turn over records regarding the improper surveillance.”

He added: “Sometimes members of the public wonder if frightening new surveillance techniques will be used for improper purposes under the guise of criminal investigation. Sadly, the answer is yes.”

Before becoming inspector general in 2013, Huntsman, 60, was a deputy district attorney who specialized in public corruption. He told LAist on Tuesday that the inspector general job wasn’t something he wanted initially.

“I didn’t want to go work for politicians,” he said. “But the need to provide some kind of independent reporting and analysis was significant.”

The Sheriff’s Department issued a statement saying it valued the Office of the Inspector General and all county oversight bodies and that it wished Huntsman and his family well in his retirement.

The department said it “continues to make great strides in advancing the department in a transparent manner.”

LAist also reached out to the county CEO and county counsel for comment, but they declined.

After George Floyd

In the letter, Huntsman says the state of California has come a long way in strengthening the power of local law enforcement oversight bodies, in part because of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

After widespread protests — and lobbying by Huntsman — the state provided authority to inspectors general to enforce subpoenas requiring law enforcement agencies to hand over documents and authorized external investigation of police misconduct, including deputy gang conduct.

The Sheriff’s Department — backed by county lawyers — has resisted.

“Los Angeles County may not follow those laws, but it will not be able to avoid them forever,” Huntsman wrote. “The county refuses to require the photographing of suspected gang tattoos in secretive groups that the undersheriff has identified as violating state law.”

“Just a few weeks ago, we requested some information regarding an investigation, and a pair of commanders refused to give it to us,” Huntsman said in an interview with LAist.

Origin of the office

The Inspector General’s Office was created by the county Board of Supervisors in 2013 in response to a scandal that included former Sheriff Lee Baca covering up the abuses of jail inmates.

Baca went to federal prison.

Since then, the office has issued dozens of reports with recommendations for improving living conditions inside jails that some have described as “filthy,” stopping abuses of juveniles inside juvenile halls and providing shower privacy for inmates as part of the requirements under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.

“All of these abuses were reported by the Office of Inspector General and recommendations were ignored,” Huntsman wrote. Often, it took court orders to enact change.

“When we first blew the whistle on the torturous chaining of mentally ill prisoners to benches for 36 hours at a time, it was only a court order that ended the practice,” he wrote. “Time and time again, this pattern repeated itself.”

Huntsman wrote the county has permitted the Sheriff’s Department to block oversight and defunded the Office of Inspector General by removing a third of its staff.

“It's not surprising the county has driven out two successive chairs of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission,” he wrote.

“Government always claims to value transparency and accountability, but shooting the messenger is still the most common response to criticism,” Huntsman wrote.

Despite setbacks, Huntsman values work

Huntsman told LAist on Tuesday that he was proud of his career as a public servant.

“I’ve really enjoyed the work and I’m sad to have it end,” he said.

It’s a sentiment he echoed in his letter, adding that despite the setbacks and roadblocks, he was proud of the people with whom he shared the office.

“It has been my honor to work with a talented, brave and tireless group of public servants to ensure that the public knows what its government is doing,” he wrote.

He noted the inspector general’s reports are fact-checked by the office and public.

“When government abuses occur, they are sometimes kept secret, but that is no longer the case for much of what is happening in Los Angeles County,” Huntsman wrote. “What you do about it is up to you.,”

Huntsman’s last day is Friday.

The U.S. Department of Education announced Tuesday that it had reached a proposed settlement agreement to end a popular, yet controversial Biden-era student loan repayment plan.

The Saving on a Valuable Education plan, better known as SAVE, was the most flexible and generous of all income-driven repayment plans, promising expedited loan forgiveness and monthly payments as low as $0 for low-income borrowers. Republican state attorneys general, led by Missouri, sued the Biden administration, arguing in court that SAVE was too generous.

The legal challenges put all SAVE borrowers in limbo for months, during which they were not required to make payments on their loans — even after many had already spent years in a pandemic payment pause. Interest resumed accruing on SAVE loans in August.

""The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,"" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement announcing the proposed agreement. ""Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.""

Tuesday's agreement, pending court approval, would end the long legal battle over SAVE by ending SAVE itself. The Education Department would commit not to enroll more borrowers in SAVE, to deny all pending SAVE applications and to move the roughly 7 million borrowers still enrolled in SAVE into other repayment plans — though some of those plans are also in flux.

The department also said student loan borrowers would have ""a limited time to select a new, legal repayment plan."" Borrowers will have to choose between two types of plans: 1.) fixed payment plans or 2.) plans with payments based on a borrower's income.

The two new plans created by Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will roll out in July 2026, and will include a revised standard plan and a new income-driven plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. Though SAVE borrowers will be expected to change plans before then.

The SAVE plan's days were already numbered. Under the OBBBA, borrowers would have had to change plans by July 1, 2028. Tuesday's news would move that deadline up, though the administration has not provided a timeframe for the changes.

If the proposal is approved by the court, transitioning millions of borrowers to other plans will be a Herculean feat for loan servicing companies that handle day-to-day loan operations.

""It's gonna be bumpy,"" says Scott Buchanan, head of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance. ""Remember, SAVE borrowers have not been in repayment for years. They're gonna have a ton of questions and will need a ton of hand-holding to get back into repayment.""

The settlement arrives as millions of borrowers are struggling to keep up with their payments.

""We are sitting on the precipice of millions of borrowers defaulting on their loans,"" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers. ""And instead of choosing to defend a plan that would have been affordable for these borrowers, this Department of Education has capitulated to the AGs and is going to make life much more expensive.""

The American Enterprise Institute, AEI, recently published an analysis of the latest federal student loan data: In addition to the 5.5 million borrowers who are currently in default, another 3.7 million are more than 270 days late on their payments and on the edge of default. Another 2.7 million borrowers are in the earlier stages of delinquency. In all, some 12 million borrowers are worryingly behind.

Illinois courthouses are now off-limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents hoping to make an immigration arrest. Pritzker signed a bill into law that bars immigration enforcement inside or within 1,000 feet of a courthouse building.

""The idea that the Trump administration wants to prevent people from attending courts, doing their civic duty, and protecting public safety just boggles the mind,"" Pritzker said.

Since the Department of Homeland Security's Chicago-area immigration operation ""Midway Blitz"" began in September, Pritzker says, only 2.6% of the people arrested by ICE in the Chicago area were considered high public safety risks by the federal government.

Agents have shown up at places of employment, including a day care center. Churches, schools, college campuses, and hospitals have been targets as well.

""Before the bill was signed into law, ICE will just tell a hospital, you don't have the authority to tell us anything. Now, you do,"" said Democratic Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch.

Illinois' new law also requires hospitals, public universities and community colleges and day care facilities to develop plans and procedures in case federal immigration agents show up at their establishments.

""With daycare centers, it's part of the licensing process with the hospitals. It's also part of the licensing process,"" said Fred Tsao with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights.

The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee and other immigration groups worked with Democratic state leaders to write the legislation. The bill also allows people subject to civil arrest the ability to sue law enforcement officers who violate the constitution.

""No one, and I mean no one, is above the law,"" Pritzker said.

But Republicans and the Trump administration argue Pritzker is acting above the law. In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, wrote, in part, ""He must be unfamiliar with the US Constitution.... By signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause.""

The governor says he's not worried if his bill is legally challenged.

""No doubt, they have the ability to go to court about it, but I believe this is a not just a good law, but a great law,"" Pritzker said.

The courthouse element of the bill goes into effect on Tuesday. Entities like daycare centers and hospitals have been given various deadlines between January and March to provide their ICE organizational plans.

Full statement from McLaughlin:

""He must be unfamiliar with the US Constitution. Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution, still clearly states:

'This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.'

By signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause, his oath he took as Governor to ""support the Constitution of the United States"" - which itself falls under the oaths clause of the Constitution.

JB Pritzker signed legislation Tuesday that bars civil immigration arrests from being made in or near courthouses, and gives residents more leeway to sue federal agents over alleged civil rights violations.

Illinois’ “ICE out” legislation was approved this fall by Democratic state lawmakers in response to the Trump administration’s enhanced immigration enforcement being carried out across the Chicago area.

Republicans roundly opposed the measure, predicting legal challenges over whether the state can block federal action of any sort.

But Pritzker and supporters aiming to stem the fear gripping immigrant communities declared that Illinois, “in the face of cruelty and intimidation, has chosen solidarity and support.”

“The idea that the Trump administration wants to prevent people from attending court, doing their civic duty and protecting public safety just boggles the mind,” Pritzker said before signing the legislation at La Villita Community Church. “With my signature today, we are trying to protect people and institutions that belong here in Illinois. Dropping your kid off at daycare, going to the doctor, attending classes, should not be a life-altering risk.”

The new state law takes effect immediately, prohibiting immigration arrests inside or within 1,000 feet of state courthouses, which have been the sites of deportation operations over the past few months by federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection.

Department of Homeland Security officials have asserted “nothing in the Constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.” In an email, Assistant Sec. Tricia McLaughlin said “by signing this law, Pritzker violated the Supremacy Clause... We hope the headlines, social media likes, and fundraising emails he did this for are worth it!”

Federal officials say they’ve made thousands of arrests as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began winding down last month with U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino heading to North Carolina to ramp up enforcement there. Few of those taken into custody have violent criminal records, the Sun-Times has found.

Immigration raids are still happening across the Chicago area, and enforcement could be ramped up even further in the spring, sources have told the Sun-Times.

“Donald Trump, [Homeland Security Sec.] Kristi Noem, and Gregory Bovino have tried to appeal to our lesser instincts, but the best of us are standing up to the worst of them,” Pritzker said.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said if “Pritzker the Slob focused on fixing crime in his own state instead of defending criminal illegal aliens, Illinois residents would be much safer. Cracking down on crime and deporting dangerous criminal illegal aliens should not be a partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one, all at the expense of the Americans they are elected to serve.”

Illinois’ new law also requires hospitals, day care facilities and public universities to institute plans for how to deal with immigration agents who might show up at their facilities, and it bars them from sharing most residents’ information with federal agents.

It also opens the door to litigation against federal officials who “knowingly violated Constitutional rights during civil immigration enforcement operations.” Higher punitive damages can be sought against officers who fail to identify themselves, deploy tear gas or use some of the other inflammatory tactics that have angered communities this year.

“No one, and I mean, no one is above the law, especially those wearing a badge representing the law,” Pritzker said.

The governor and legislative leaders have acknowledged the law is likely to draw court challenges, which Pritzker took in stride.

“Whenever you enact something that is tough, that is about protecting people, there are going to be people out there who attack it. And no doubt, they have the ability to go to court about it, but I believe this is not just a good law, but a great law,” Pritzker said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6a107c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F84%2Fad%2Fbb9d33ca43f3b40842979e41e98b%2Ficelaw-121025-09.JPG,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:28.527352

Sir Keir and Ms Frederiksen also called on other European leaders to agree “a modernisation” of how the convention is interpreted in their countries’ laws.
The ECHR, which underpins the UK’s Human Rights Act, is seen by critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants.
Sir Keir has rejected calls by the Conservatives and Reform UK to quit the ECHR over concerns that it would prevent the UK from striking agreements with signatory countries to tackle illegal migration.
A political declaration signed by the ministers could carry enough weight to influence directly how the European Court of Human Rights interprets the agreement, it is understood.","The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) must be reformed to enable states to combat illegal migration, Sir Keir Starmer has said.

Sir Keir and Ms Frederiksen also called on other European leaders to agree “a modernisation” of how the convention is interpreted in their countries’ laws.

The ECHR, which underpins the UK’s Human Rights Act, is seen by critics as a major barrier to attempts to deport illegal migrants.

The right to family life, enshrined by Article 8 of the agreement, is often used as grounds in legal cases to prevent removals.

The Home Office has also said it has seen a trend of Article 3 rights, which prohibit torture, being used to halt deportations because of claims that migrants’ healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Sir Keir has rejected calls by the Conservatives and Reform UK to quit the ECHR over concerns that it would prevent the UK from striking agreements with signatory countries to tackle illegal migration.

‘Yesterday’s answers do not work’

In the joint op-ed in The Guardian, the Prime Minister and Ms Fredriksen acknowledged that the “current asylum framework was created for another era”.

The pair added: “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work. We will always protect those fleeing war and terror – but the world has changed and asylum systems must change with it.”

The UK has adopted a series of hardline immigration measures, modelled on those spearheaded by Ms Frederiksen’s government, in order to reduce Channel crossings by migrants.

The two leaders also wrote: “Migration must be orderly, managed and sustainable. Irregular routes should not be the go-to option – so we must dismantle the human smuggling networks that prey on desperation.

“Together, we are calling on our friends across Europe to go further in tackling these shared challenges.”

Europe ‘must act together’

On Wednesday, European ministers, including David Lammy, the Deputy Prime Minister, are due to meet in Strasbourg to discuss reforming how the treaty is interpreted in the courts.

A political declaration signed by the ministers could carry enough weight to influence directly how the European Court of Human Rights interprets the agreement, it is understood.

The joint op-ed described the efforts as a “push for a modernisation of the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights – so that the convention system, which we believe in, can evolve to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.”

Sir Keir and Ms Fredriksen said: “Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again.

On the church’s Facebook page, reaction to the Nativity scene was split.","Leaders of a Catholic church near Boston kept a Nativity display with an anti-ICE message in place on Monday, defying an order from the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston to remove it.

The display, outside St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Mass., includes the traditional shepherds, sheep and wise men gathered around a hay-filled manger. But Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus are missing, replaced by a sign reading “ICE WAS HERE” in bold blue letters.

“The Holy Family is safe in the Sanctuary of our Church,” adds a smaller note inside the Nativity scene, which is protected by a plastic shield. “If you see ICE please call LUCE.” The display includes a phone number for LUCE, an immigrant advocacy group, which tracks the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Massachusetts.

ICE began a major immigration enforcement campaign in the Boston area in September, the forefront of a wave of similar efforts in other major cities.

Speaking to reporters late Monday outside the brick church, the Rev. Stephen Josoma said the intent of the display was to “evoke dialogue,” not cause a furor. He said parish leaders would confer with leaders of the archdiocese before making a final decision on its fate.

But, he added, “that some do not agree with our display does not render it sacrilegious.”

Last week, the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston told the parish to take down the signage in its Nativity display. In a statement, archdiocesan leaders said that churchgoers “have the right to expect that they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging.”

That statement also cited church norms prohibiting “the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God’s people.”

Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, added his own criticism in recent days, telling The Boston Herald that the Nativity scene was “absolutely abhorrent” and part of “a dangerous narrative” responsible for a sharp increase in assaults on ICE officers.

Some members and supporters of the Dedham parish said they were confused by the demand from the archdiocese, which came one month after a rare and nearly unanimous statement from U.S. Catholic bishops condemning the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

“We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants,” the November statement from the bishops said. “We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care. We lament that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status.”

The display at St. Susanna, on a busy street in a well-off suburb south of Boston, is the latest in a series of nontraditional Nativity scenes staged by the parish. A version in 2018 sparked similar controversy for depicting the infant Jesus in a cage, a scene church leaders said was a reflection on immigration policy at that time. A year later, the parish focused on climate change, showing some of the figures partly submerged in water.

Other politically themed Nativity scenes have popped up around the country this Christmas season, including one at a church in Evanston, Ill., that includes a baby Jesus figure with his hands bound by zip ties. In another Nativity scene near Chicago, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are missing, with a sign telling viewers that “Due to ICE activity in our community, the Holy Family is in hiding.”

Catholics in Massachusetts tend to be more liberal than church members elsewhere, and many have defended the Dedham parish. On the church’s Facebook page, reaction to the Nativity scene was split. Some commenters thanked the congregation for “speaking truth to power,” while others offered harsh judgments, including one assertion that “the devil has infiltrated the church.”

“How shameful to make a mockery of Christ’s birth,” one observer wrote.

“You are on the right side of history,” countered another.

“I wish I lived close enough to attend this church,” one woman lamented.

Elizabeth Doris-Gustin, 67, a longtime neighbor of the parish who attends an Episcopal church, said she and many of her neighbors look forward to the Christmas displays at St. Susanna every year.

“You might not agree with everything, but it makes you think,” she said. “I wish a few more churches would be this bold.”

She hopes the parish will keep this year’s display, she said. “I’m going to say a little prayer that they keep it up.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08nat-nativity-ice-jfmz/08nat-nativity-ice-jfmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:00.518226

Troy Edgar was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in March, making him eligible for the new role without further Senate approval. No start date has been set yet, but it's likely to be soon, two sources said.

Spokespeople for the White House and Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately comment. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Edgar have had a good working relationship, multiple sources say.

El Salvador has played a high-profile role in the Trump administration's sweeping illegal immigration crackdown. The president in March invoked a 200-year-old wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to send migrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador as he sought to deport individuals his administration accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. CBS News previously reported that many of the men do not have criminal convictions.

The men imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a U.S.-brokered swap over the summer. A report by human rights groups last month determined that the deportation and treatment of the more than 200 Venezuelan migrants at the prison amounted to arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearance under international law.

Mr. Trump met in April with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has won the admiration of conservatives in the U.S. for his crackdown on gangs under a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation without due process.

Last month, the administration reached a framework for reciprocal trade agreements with South and Central American countries including El Salvador.

In a court filing Monday evening, attorneys for detainees highlighted the government's own admissions to longer custody times for immigrant children, unsanitary conditions reported by families and monitors at federal facilities, and a renewed reliance on hotels for detention.

The reports were filed as part of an ongoing civil lawsuit launched in 1985 that led to the creation of the 1990s cornerstone policy known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, which limits the time children can spend in federal custody and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. The Trump administration is attempting to end the agreement.

A Dec. 1 report from ICE indicated that about 400 immigrant children were held in custody for more than the 20-day limit during the reporting period from August to September. They also told the court the problem was widespread and not specific to a region or facility. The primary factors that prolonged their release were categorized into three groups: transportation delays, medical needs, and legal processing.

Legal advocates for the children contended those reasons do not prove lawful justifications for the delays in their release. They also cited examples that far exceeded the 20-day limit, including five children who were held for 168 days earlier this year.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Hotel use for temporary detention is allowed by the federal court for up to 72 hours, but attorneys questioned the government's data, which they believe did not fully explain why children were held longer than three days in hotel rooms.

Conditions at the detention facilities continued to be an ongoing concern since the family detention site in Dilley, Texas, reopened this year.

Advocates documented injuries suffered by children and a lack of access to sufficient medical care. One child bleeding from an eye injury wasn't seen by medical staff for two days. Another child's foot was broken when a member of the staff dropped a volleyball net pole, according to the court filing. “Medical staff told one family whose child got food poisoning to only return if the child vomited eight times,” the advocates wrote in their response.

“Children get diarrhea, heartburn, stomach aches, and they give them food that literally has worms in it,"" one person with a family staying at the facility in Dilley wrote in a declaration submitted to the court.

Chief U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California is scheduled to have a hearing on the reports next week, where she could decide if the court needs to intervene.

Before a crucial European summit on Wednesday, the prime minister urged fellow members to “go further” in modernising the interpretation of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to prevent asylum seekers using it to avoid deportation.

But Labour has been condemned for calling for changes, with human rights campaigners, Labour peers and some MPs arguing they could open the door to countries abandoning some of the world’s most vulnerable people.

Critics of the government’s asylum changes also argue that the prime minister should not be diluting protections that pander to the right, amid deepening concerns from charities that its rhetoric could demonise refugees.

On the eve of the Council of Europe summit in Strasbourg, the actors Michael Palin, Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley were among 21 well-known figures calling on Starmer to drop plans to weaken human rights law and instead “take a principled stand” for torture victims.

Under sweeping changes announced last month, the government said it wanted to introduce measures to stop asylum seekers using their rights in the ECHR to a family life to avoid deportation. The Conservatives and Reform UK have called for withdrawal from the convention altogether.

But writing for the Guardian, the prime minister said that updating the interpretation of the convention was urgently required to confront the challenges posed by mass migration – and far-right forces that sought to divide mainstream opinion across Europe.

“The best way of fighting against the forces of hate and division, is to show that mainstream, progressive politics can fix this problem,” he wrote in a joint article with the Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen.

“Listening to legitimate concerns and acting on them is what our politics is about. That’s not empty populism, it’s democracy. We are determined to show that our societies can act with compassion while upholding law and order, and fairness.”

The two leaders called on European allies to go further in tackling the shared challenge of migration by modernising the ECHR to reflect the challenges of the 21st century.

“Europe has faced big tests before and we have overcome them by acting together. Now we must do so again. Otherwise, the forces that seek to divide us will grow stronger.

“So our message is this: as responsible, progressive governments we will deliver the change that people are crying out for. We will control our borders to protect our democracies – and make our nations stronger than ever in the years to come.”

The UK has sought to emulate Denmark’s hardline asylum model. Last year, the number of people being granted asylum in the country was the lowest in 40 years, excluding 2020 which was during the Covid pandemic.

The government, which will be represented at the Strasbourg meeting by David Lammy, the justice secretary, and Richard Hermer, the attorney general, is understood to be considering all options to update the implementation of the ECHR.

The proposed political declaration resulting from the summit would carry significant political weight and, if it garnered enough signatories, could directly influence how the European court of human rights interprets and applies ECHR rights.

The government has already said it will legislate to clarify how article 8, the right to a private life, is interpreted in the domestic courts in regard to immigration rules.

Lammy is expected to argue on Wednesday that the ECHR could also be reinterpreted to limit the scope of rights under article 3, which prohibits torture and “degrading treatment”.

This could, for example, include higher thresholds for prison conditions or access to healthcare abroad where it currently prevents extradition or deportation from the UK.

The deputy prime minister will reassert the UK’s commitment to the ECHR, saying that pulling out would be a “fake solution” that would undermine every international agreement on national and border security.

At the summit, he is expected to say: “We must strike a careful balance between individual rights and the public’s interest, otherwise we risk a loss of confidence in the convention, and in human rights themselves.

“The definition of ‘family life’ can’t be stretched to prevent the removal of people with no right to remain in the country … The threshold of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ must be constrained to the most serious issues.

“States must be able to take proportionate decisions on the removal of foreign criminals, so that we renew the convention’s democratic foundation.”

The sweeping changes to the UK asylum system came against the backdrop of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK attracting support because of the failure of successive governments to stop unauthorised small boat crossings in the Channel and unease about the use of hotels to house asylum seekers.

They include measures such as forcing people with refugee status to return to their home country if it becomes safe, making people who arrive illegally wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement, and revoking the statutory legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support, including housing and weekly allowances.

Ministers say the government will introduce new safe and legal routes to the UK as a way to reduce the number of dangerous journeys in small boats across the Channel, although these routes will be capped.

Some Labour MPs, charities and legal experts have warned that if a country such as the UK waters down the application of article 3, then less scrupulous nations could follow suit, with horrific implications.

Veronika Fikfak, a professor of international law at University College London, said a change to the anti-torture provisions within the ECHR “touches the very core” of the convention.

“Prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is an absolute right. It allows for no balancing. There is no margin of appreciation for states, nor any deference to them,” she said.

Lammy will meet ministers from 45 other countries to discuss possible changes at the meeting.

“I lost my voice. I was blind for about 30 minutes,” said Khalid Mohamed, a witness at the scene. “The pepper spray they used was so strong that it blinded me for 30 minutes, actually.”

Multiple witnesses said prior to the chaos, agents were going up and down the street asking people if they had IDs and proof of citizenship.

“We said it’s wrong that we live in 2025 and our own government’s coming to our neighborhood and asking us for our citizenship,” Mohamed said. “This is not 1930s Germany.”

ICE arrests in the Pittsburgh region reached a high point in July and August at around 140 each month — more than double the number logged during any month for two years prior.

That arrest level appears to have tapered off slightly in September, as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown approaches the end of its first year.

Since January, there have been at least 948 immigration-related arrests in the Pittsburgh region, defined as a 50-mile radius from Downtown, according to the data, which ends in mid-October. That is more than triple the same period in 2024, during which the agency made 275 arrests.

Data Deportation Project. Datawrapper)

Prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration and his Immigration and Customs Enforcement surge, the number of ICE arrests in Allegheny County and nearby counties in a given month was sometimes as low as a dozen or as high as 65. The range this year has been a low of 48 in April before the summer peak, according to data made available by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Pittsburgh’s Public Source.

The data shows the vast majority of the ICE arrests as occurring in or close to Pittsburgh and is only more specific in regard to pickups at county jails. Just one of this year’s ICE arrests is listed as occurring at the Allegheny County Jail, with outlying county lockups logging larger tallies, led by Beaver (23), Washington (18) and Butler (10).

The region has not seen the kind of highly publicized ICE surges experienced by numerous other cities, including recent pushes in and around Minneapolis, Charlotte and Chicago.

But Southwestern Pennsylvania hasn’t been ignored by the rapidly expanding agency. The administration’s immigration-related activities have reached the area in many ways throughout the year, including:

November efforts to enlist local law enforcement agencies in enforcement activity, some of which were recently reversed after Public Source inquiries

September moves to deport Guatemalan children, which were stalled by court decisions but caused local advocates to scramble over Labor Day weekend

August arrests of workers at local restaurants

A midsummer blitz in Ambridge that some advocates for immigrants characterized as the most aggressive they’d seen

Winter disruptions of funding for refugee resettlement and for legal representation of immigrant children

A January pause in refugee entry, which has since morphed nationally into a halt to processing of applications from 19 countries following the November shooting of two National Guard members — one fatally — in Washington, D.C.

ICE’s increased activity has been met locally with vigorous countermeasures, notably including a Rapid Response Network that has frequently deployed volunteers to document enforcement actions. Anti-Trump protests and other activism in the region have sometimes focused tightly on immigration policy, highlighted the importance of immigrants to the economy or included those themes in broad critiques of the administration. Churches, meanwhile, have attempted to serve as spiritual sanctuaries for the region’s Latino population, even as attendance has sometimes been depressed by fear.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-arrests-ambridge.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 19:58:21.034416

Maria Elvira Salazar has recently done?

Salazar on Sunday joined a growing chorus of South Florida leaders who have decried the administration’s targeting of Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and other immigrants. Recently, a billboard along Interstate 95 featuring four civic leaders, among them Miami Dade College President Emeritus Eduardo Padrón, called on Miamians to defend “our immigrant neighbors.”

But that message is stronger when it comes from an elected Republican — especially one elected to Congress — in a county Trump carried by 11 points in 2024. Republicans can no longer ignore that Trump isn’t just going after criminals but is casting a wide net that’s catching immigrants who are following the rules.

Salazar, who’s Cuban-American and sponsored an immigration reform bill called the “Dignity Act,” issued a statement describing as “un-American” the Trump administration’s decision to order a pause of all immigration applications from nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and other so-called “high risk” countries. The policy affects green card and citizenship applications and other immigration applications for people from 19 countries. All asylum claims have also been paused regardless of the applicant’s country of origin, the Herald reported. The directive was a response to the Nov. 26 shooting in Washington, D.C. of two National Guardsmen, allegedly by an Afghan man.

“Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process,” Salazar wrote. “That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for. Background checks already exist to stop terrorists and they should.”

The new policy has already inflicted unnecessary pain. Naturalization ceremonies in South Florida have been cancelled, several immigration attorneys told the Herald. The same appears to be happening across the country. In Boston, at least two immigrants were told to step out of line before they could pledge allegiance to the U.S., the Boston Globe reported.

These individuals have lived in the U.S. legally for years. However, they’re now being turned away in what seems to be Trump’s desire to leverage the tragedy in D.C. to target immigrants from “third world countries,” in the president’s own words.

Another Republican, Miami-Dade County Commissioner Rene Garcia, recently joined members of the Cuban American Bar Association in calling out the Trump administration for ignoring due process and detaining people at their immigration hearings.

“I’m seeing more and more cases in my office and of people who are saying, ‘This is my loved one, who had no criminal history, and now we don’t know where he is,’ No. 1, or, No. 2, has been deported or is in the process of being deported,” Garcia, a lawyer, told Channel 10 in late November.

We commend Garcia and Salazar, but they shouldn’t be part of a small group of vocal Republicans. The GOP has established political dominance in Miami-Dade; Republicans make up a majority of the county’s delegation in Congress and the Florida Legislature.

Now contrast what Salazar wrote to the statement her fellow Miami Republican congressmen issued after the Trump administration halted immigration applications.

“President Trump inherited a number of problems, including a broken immigration system made worse by the Biden Administration . President Trump is protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting. That leadership is saving American lives,” U.S. Reps. Carlos Gimenez and Mario Diaz-Balart wrote on Dec. 3.

The two congressmen have in the past spoken in favor of immigrant protections, in particular Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans, and Balart has long advocated for immigration reform. But their latest statement, issued as people are reportedly being pulled out of their citizenship ceremonies, rings tone-deaf when it’s been almost a year since Biden left office.

We cannot ignore the political realities that must weigh heavily on Miami Republicans. Salazar’s District 27 is not as solidly red as the districts of Gimenez and Diaz-Balart, pushing her toward the political middle. But this should not be the moment for electoral calculations. More Republicans must speak up.

This “Behind the Brief” accompanies Policy & Advocacy’s Brief from Volume 9, Issue No. 3, “The Danger of Globally Institutionalizing Third Country Returns,” originally published on November 19, 2025. You can find the complete brief at the end.

Reason Behind the Brief

Return hubs and third country returns are two migration control measures that have gained appeal with policymakers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. These measures are being used to transfer noncitizens outside of national borders. Third country deportations are different from migration externalization measures that have been widely used for many years but which became particularly pervasive at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Here’s how return hubs and third country returns compare to externalization measures:

Safe Third Country Agreements

Country A can deem an individual ineligible for asylum and remove them to Country B, which is deemed safe, if the individual is deemed to have a connection or have passed through Country B before reaching Country A.

Example: U.S.-Canada (but see legal controversies on this agreement)

Metering

Country A limits the number of asylum seekers processed at ports of entry, forcing asylum seekers to turn back to contiguous Country B to wait for an opportunity to seek admission into Country A. Asylum seekers may have been turned back before or after arriving in Country A.

Example: U.S.-Mexico border (2016-2020)

Offshoring

An asylum seeker arrives in and applies for asylum in Country A. Country A transfers them to Country B, forcing the asylum seeker to wait there while Country A processes their asylum application.

Examples: U.S. Title 42 Expulsions (2020-2023), Australia-Nauru (2001-2023), UK-Rwanda (agreement formalized in 2022, scrapped in 2024 before individuals were deported), Italy-Albania (2023-present)

Return Hubs

Country A issues a final order of removal to a noncitizen who has exhausted their asylum application and appeals but who cannot be deported to their country of origin, for reasons of ongoing conflict, risk of torture or cruel or inhumane treatment, or rejection by the country of origin to accept the individual. Country A seeks a diplomatic agreement with Country B. Country A may pay for housing, legal, food, medical, and administrative fees in exchange for Country B accepting noncitizens.

Proposed by: The EU, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands

Third Country Deportations

Country A enters into a diplomatic agreement with Country B to accept third country noncitizens who are deported from Country A. Country A deports noncitizens with humanitarian-based protections who cannot be removed to their country origin, noncitizens who have criminal convictions, and noncitizens who are not under a period of authorized stay to Country B, without adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to challenge the removal. Upon landing in Country B, third country noncitizens are under the jurisdiction of Country B and may be removed to their country of origin, where they may face persecution or torture.

While seemingly similar to return hubs, third country deportations are less formal and executed via separate agreements with each country. Key differences from the EU return hub proposals and the U.S. practice include deporting people without adequate notice of a final order of removal and providing lump-sum payments to countries for their cooperation, rather than funding temporary housing and other services to the deported individual.

In the past half decade, there has been a concerted effort by Global North countries to institutionalize third country removals. Many of the proposals and bilateral agreements detailed in the P&A Brief have been accompanied by domestic legislative changes. These legislative changes are resulting in the codification of the erosion of human rights for migrants and asylum seekers into national laws.

The UK-Rwanda agreement was officially signed in December 2023, and the UK Parliament passed a law in April 2024 allowing the removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda. In July 2024, the new Labour Government moved to end the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership

The EU Common System for Returns (proposal for regulation) is being reviewed by the European Parliament and is expected to be in operation in 2026.

In December 2024, Australia passed the Migration Amendment Bill, which allows Australia to enter into third country deportation agreements. The bill does not include any requirements for a potential third country to have signed any refugee or human rights treaties, increasing the risk of refoulement. Australia is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.

International Human Rights Frameworks

Return hubs and third country deportations are a human rights concern because a crucial question is not being asked: “If deported to Country B (a third country), does the individual face a risk of persecution or torture?” To follow international refugee law, this question must be asked and answered on an individual basis and requires case-by-case review.

A key instrument outlining international refugee law is the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the 1967 Protocol (“Refugee Convention”). The United States participated in the drafting of the Refugee Convention and acceded to the 1967 Protocol, which incorporated the 1951 Convention. The Refugee Act of 1980 codified the United States’ obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol, establishing a legal framework for refugee admissions and asylum protections.

The Refugee Convention requires countries to:

Afford rights and protections outlined in the Refugee Convention to all refugees without discrimination (Art. 3).

The Refugee Convention prohibits a country from deporting a refugee to a place where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Countries cannot suspend or opt out of this obligation (Art. 33). Also prohibited is deporting a refugee lawfully present on grounds of national security or public order. Expulsions should be done in accordance with due process of law, where the refugee has an opportunity to submit evidence and appeal. (Art. 32)

Rights and protections outlined in the Refugee Convention are rooted in fundamental human rights. Fundamental human rights are universal and non-derogable, meaning that every human being must be able to enjoy them. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all human beings, including noncitizens, must be afforded:

The right to all fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination based on race, language, religion, or nationality (Art. 2);

The right to seek and enjoy asylum (Art. 14);

The right to leave their own country (Art. 13);

The right not to be tortured (Art. 5);

The right to life, liberty, and security (Art. 3) ;

The right not be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile (Art. 9);

The right to be recognized before the law and the right to be equal before the law (Arts. 6 and 7); and

The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent tribunal (Arts. 10 and 11).

Other human rights treaties also codify and further specify rights that must be afforded to all persons, including noncitizens.

3 of the Convention against Torture prohibits refoulement of a person to another country where they would be in danger of being subject to torture. To make this determination, authorities must consider whether there is a “consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights” in the country.

The Committee against Torture specifically stated that this absolute duty applies to third country deportations. A country should not deport an individual to another country from which the individual faces deportation to a third country where they would be in danger of being subject to torture. To ensure that this duty is absolute, the Committee has stated that each case should be given due process in a transparent process with adequate notification of intended deportation. Detention and other coercive measures should not be used to compel people to relinquish their rights. Furthermore, countries that have signed onto the Convention have a duty to prevent torture by implementing safeguards.

Narrowing the Right to Remain

Despite the international legal framework, countries are limiting these rights by ignoring them on an individual basis and haphazardly condemning wide groups, particularly noncitizens who have criminal convictions. In order to uphold the principle of non-refoulement, countries have a duty to ensure that each individual gets a case-by-case review, a chance to appeal, and a chance to exhaust other options. Countries like the United States and the UK are seeking to narrow these rights.

In August 2025, the UK increased a list of countries they deemed “safe” to 23 countries. That means nationals of those countries can be deported under the “Deport Now Appeal Later” scheme. Under the scheme, nationals of “safe countries” who have been convicted of a crime in the UK can be deported to those countries before they can appeal their humanitarian-based immigration decisions in a UK court. If individuals decide to appeal, they are allowed to do so only from overseas, via video conference.

The U.S. third country deportation scheme has repeatedly deported noncitizens who have criminal convictions without due process, putting them at risk of being returned to countries where they could face harm. Such policies perpetuate a belief that people convicted of crimes are not only undeserving of international refugee protection but manipulating the system. There are also examples of individuals without criminal convictions being deported to third countries. Recent political rhetoric has unfairly cast criminal suspicion on entire immigrant populations due to individual alleged acts. Public safety and immigration are often separate and unrelated domestic issues, but politicians too often conflate the two to enflame fear and xenophobia.

Dear MP

I am one of your constituents. I am writing to raise my deep concern at the immigration and asylum proposals set out in the Government papers Restoring Order and Control and A Fairer Pathway to Settlement published last month. Amnesty International UK has produced two short briefings on the proposals set out in these papers (these can be found here and here)

Among the proposals relating to asylum are that:

1. People recognised as refugees in the UK’s asylum system will be permitted to stay for only 30 months before being required to apply again for asylum (for another 30 months period). They will have no prospect of applying for permission to settle (permanent residence) until at least 20 years have passed since they were first granted asylum. This is a radical departure from past policy – though it is based in part on harmful proposals first introduced by a Conservative Home Secretary (Priti Patel) via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

2. Refugee family reunion, which the Government suspended in September, is to be largely closed. People recognised as refugees in the UK’s asylum system will only be permitted to sponsor their partners and children to obtain a visa to join them if they have substantial earnings or savings. This is a radical departure from past policy – though it too is based in part on harmful proposals first introduced by a Conservative Home Secretary (Priti Patel) via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

3. There will no longer be a duty on the Government to accommodate people who are waiting for their asylum claims to be determined and would otherwise be destitute. This is similar to a failed and harmful policy introduced by a Labour Home Secretary (David Blunkett) under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

4. The Government will increase its use of disused or repurposed military and similar sites as mass accommodation for people seeking asylum. The use of such sites by successive Governments since a Labour Home Secretary (Jack Straw) opened an immigration removal centre at Oakington barracks near Cambridge in 2000 has been a longstanding matter of considerable local and national controversy, which has done real harm to many people.

5. The Government will establish a limited visa route to permit refugees whom it regards as particularly “talented” or “skilled” to relocate to the UK.

Among proposals that also relate to other immigration are that:

1. The Government will legislate to restrict the application of Article 8 (the right to respect for private and family life) in immigration and asylum cases. A Conservative Home Secretary (Theresa May) did this via the Immigration Act 2014.

2. The Government will legislate to further restrict the application of modern slavery safeguards in immigration and asylum cases. This is an extension of the harmful policy of previous Conservative Home Secretaries (Priti Patel/Suella Braverman) introduced via the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 and the Illegal Migration Act 2023.

The above proposals, and others not listed here, are intended to make the asylum system harsher. This is objectionable for several reasons including:

1. The asylum system ought to focus on identifying refugees as quickly as possible, providing them safety in the UK that is secure, and enabling them to rebuild their lives and integrate well. These proposals do precisely the opposite. They make refugees’ lives extremely uncertain and prolong that uncertainty, and the isolation and marginalisation it causes, for decades.

2. The Government asserts a concern about growing social division, which it identifies in hate and racism directed towards some refugees and other migrants. However, it is giving implicit justification for some of that hate. By creating conditions in which more refugees are liable to face social isolation (including destitution, homelessness, ill-health and exploitation), it is exacerbating division and some of the social ills that enable that to thrive.

3. The Government is making far more work for the Home Office and increasing its costs. It will have to deal with thousands more applications for permission to stay by refugees, who will need to make many more applications and far more frequently. It is also making work and costs for other Government departments. These proposals have serious implications for the legal aid system, the courts, the NHS and local authorities among others. Worse, since the Home Office and courts are already struggling to manage their workloads, it is highly likely that costs will be made far greater by the further dysfunction this additional work will cause.

4. The likely human rights impact is dire. Reducing safeguards and increasing the severity of the asylum system can only increase the dependence of people who seek or receive asylum on human rights laws to protect their most basic needs and interests. In any event, the human, financial and social harms of what is being proposed will not ease tension concerning migration and human rights but rather make this worse. While the Government is formally committed to the European Convention on Human Rights, its current actions and proposals put the future of this country’s participation in this regional human rights agreement at significant risk.",https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/styles/social_share_image/s3/settings/amnesty_logo_0.jpg?VersionId=qA0vtal7uIyyFfzdjtm85CBfSTsi5Vt0&itok=V8GH6KNO,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:48.050563

Make your year-end tax-deductible gift now.

Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, Los Angeles educators have said the increase in immigration enforcement actions contributed to more somber graduation ceremonies, lower attendance and fewer students enrolled in school this year.

Now, a new report from UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education and Access finds similar scenarios are playing out on campuses across the country.

“There can sometimes be a sense that, well, we're facing a set of conditions that are unique to Los Angeles,” said UCLA education professor and report co-author John Rogers. “But every state in the nation, almost every community in the nation has high schools where young people are experiencing fear and concern for themselves and for their family members.”

UCLA researchers based the report on a nationally representative online survey of 606 high school principals and follow-up interviews with about four dozen administrators who said students from immigration families experienced:

Heightened concern: 70% said students from immigrant families were concerned about the well-being of themselves and their families because of policies and political rhetoric related to immigrants.

More absences: 64% said students from immigrant families missed school.

Loss of family members: 58% said immigrant parents and guardians left during the school year, sometimes without their children.

Bullying and harassment: 36% said students from immigrant families have been bullied or harassed at their school, in part because of a “political climate that has normalized attacks on immigrant communities.

LAist has reached out to the Trump administration for comment, but has not yet heard back.

LAUSD immigration resources

Los Angeles Unified School District offers resources for families concerned about immigration through its website.

Families who need assistance regarding immigration, health, wellness, or housing can call LAUSD's Family Hotline: (213) 443-1300

Students’ right to an education

The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that undocumented immigrants have a constitutional right to attend public schools — there are an estimated 39,000 such students enrolled in Los Angeles County.

The number of students with at least one immigrant family member is much greater. For example, almost half of California children have at least one immigrant parent, according to a Public Policy Institute of California analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.

How the nation’s principals are handling increased immigration enforcement at schools

On this episode of AirTalk, senior reporter Mariana Dale and UCLA professor John Rogers discuss a new report on a climate of fear in schools around federal immigration policy.

Maria Nichols leads the union that represents Los Angeles Unified School District principals and said that there’s widespread uncertainty among students, families and educators. She is also the daughter of an immigrant from South America who was undocumented for part of her childhood.

“Are we experiencing a crisis now with immigration? Absolutely,” Nichols said. “It's extremely traumatic. It's extremely triggering for people that, you know, lived the immigrant existence. And many of us in education in Los Angeles have lived that.”

More on immigration policy and education

The Reseda high schooler has been in federal immigration detention since August.

More than 4,000 people have been arrested across the region since June and it’s still unclear how the threat of detention may impact whether students show up to school.

Students who started high school wearing face masks and testing for COVID-19 graduate in the midst of widespread immigration raids.

In January, the Trump administration reversed a policy that made schools and other ""sensitive"" locations off limits to immigration enforcement actions. In early June, widespread immigration raids started across Southern California. Most arrested in L.A. and nationwide have no criminal record.

“I think a purpose of the federal immigration enforcement policies is to create a level of stress and uncertainty and fear,” Rogers said. “And precisely those dynamics make it hard to sustain student enrollment and student attendance at high levels.”

Rogers said the current climate can disrupt learning for students who do make it to school.

“The extent to which young people are concerned about their wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families while they're at the school means there's less attention, less focus, less learning going on,” Rogers said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08749fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5711x2998+0+421/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F6d%2F971322b64e74b682fdeb3406ac34%2Fimg-7498.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:41.665764

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

The new wave of fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has killed at least 10 people, injured around 20 people, and displaced hundreds of thousands. Fighting near the Gulf of Thailand started today, as the Thai Navy said it had conducted “military operations” to expel Cambodian forces. “We’ve got to do what we’ve got to do,” Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said today, adding, “the government will support all kinds of military operations as planned earlier.” Cambodian President of the Senate Hun Sen said, “Cambodia wants peace, but Cambodia is forced to fight back to defend its territory.” Sui-Lee Wee reports for the New York Times; BBC News reports; Jintamas Saksornchai and Sopheng Cheang report for AP News.

The Southern Transitional Council (STC), a UAE-backed separatist group in Yemen, yesterday claimed broad control across southern Yemen, including the port city of Aden, in a military operation called “Promising Future,” according to senior STC official Amr al-Bidh. Reuters reports.

Israeli authorities yesterday raided a vacant UNRWA compound in East Jerusalem, with the intention of collecting municipal tax debts, the authorities said. UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said the compound was not in active use, but that it remains a U.N. location, exempt from search, seizure, or taxation under international law. According to a municipal official, the UNRWA compound lost its exemption from taxation when Israel banned the agency. Ephrat Livni reports for the New York Times.

Lithuania’s government today declared a state of emergency over smuggler balloons originating in Belarus that have disrupted aviation, and asked parliament to allow the military to operate alongside the police and border guards. “The state of emergency is announced not only due to civil aviation disruptions but also due to interests of national security,” Interior Minister Vladislav Kondratovic said. Andrius Sytas reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Ukraine today will share a revised peace plan with the United States comprising 20 points, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters yesterday following talks in London with European allies. “The mood of the Americans, in principle, is for finding compromise,” Zelenskyy said. “Of course there are complex issues related to the territory, and a compromise has not yet been found there.” U.S. and Ukrainian officials say the Trump administration saw Zelensky’s meeting in Downing Street as an unhelpful attempt to buy time in the negotiations over Trump’s peace plan. Olena Harmash and Elizabeth Piper report for Reuters; Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces shot and killed a three-year-old girl, Ahed Tareq al-Bayouk, in southern Gaza on Sunday, according to local sources. Ahed al-Bayouk’s death appears to have taken place on the Palestinian side of the Yellow Line. The Israeli Defense Forces said that it was “not aware of a strike” but would “conduct an additional review.” James Cook reports for BBC News.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet President Trump on Dec. 29 to discuss the next steps of the Gaza ceasefire, an Israeli government spokesperson said yesterday. It is unclear where the meeting will take place. Maayan Lubell and Steve Scheer report for Reuters.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been dropped for consideration from Trump’s Board of Peace in Gaza, following objections from several Arab and Muslim states, according to multiple sources. Blair’s office declined to comment on the matter. Another source rejected suggestions that Blair would not be sitting on the board due to opposition in the region, claiming instead that Blair would not qualify for the board because it would be made up of serving world leaders. The source added that Blair is expected to sit on the executive committee alongside U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Andrew England and Neri Zilber report for the Financial Times.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The World Health Organization said yesterday that the death toll from drone strikes last week on a kindergarten and other sites in the Kordofan region is now at 114 people, including 63 children. Fay Abuelgasim reports for AP News.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary said yesterday that it had taken control of the Heglig oil field in the South Kordofan region. Sudanese government forces and workers at the oil field withdrew from the area on Sunday to avoid clashes that could have damaged the oil facilities, government sources told Reuters. Jana Choukeir and Khalid Abdelaziz report.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. lawmakers have included a provision in the final draft of the National Defense Authorization Act which would withhold a quarter of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the Pentagon fails to provide the congressional national security committees with a copy of the execute orders behind the strikes on alleged drug vessels and the “unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations.” Leo Shane III, Connor O’Brien, and Joe Gould report for POLITICO; Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to brief the “Gang of Eight” lawmakers this afternoon, according to three sources. The briefing follows the completion of the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy document last week, but lawmakers are also expected to raise questions about the legality of military strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific. Adm. Alvin Holsey, the outgoing head of U.S. Southern Command, is also expected to brief a separate group of Senate and House lawmakers today. Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali, and Daphne Psaledakis report for Reuters; Anne Flaherty, Allison Pecorin, and Mariam Khan report for ABC News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Democratic Republic of the Congo President Felix Tshisekedi yesterday accused Rwanda of violating its commitment to a U.S.-brokered peace deal in a speech to lawmakers. There was no immediate response from Rwanda. A senior Trump administration official said that Trump “has made clear to both sides that implementation is what he will judge, and as he stated, he is expecting immediate results.” Ange Adihe Kasongo reports for Reuters.

Honduran Attorney General Johel Antonio Zelaya Alvarez announced yesterday that he had issued an international arrest warrant for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was recently pardoned by Trump and released from prison in the United States. Zelaya cited charges of money laundering and fraud connected to a case involving Hernández’s first presidential campaign. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Justice Department yesterday announced that two businessmen are in custody for allegedly smuggling Nvidia H100 and H200 chips to China. The alleged smuggling network “threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” U.S. Attorney Nicholas Ganjei said. Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Trump yesterday announced that the United States would allow Nvidia to “ship its H200 products to approved customers in China…under conditions that allow for continued National Security.” Trump added that “25% will be paid to the United States of America” without giving details of the arrangement. “The Trump administration’s announcement that it will allow the export of advanced H200 AI chips to China is a colossal economic and national security failure,” several senior Democratic senators said in a statement. Demetri Sevastopulo and Michael Action report for the Financial Times.

Trump said yesterday that he would issue an executive order this week to block state laws on AI. Trump did not offer details on the order, but a draft order circulated last month directed the U.S. attorney general to sue states to overturn AI laws and federal regulators were also directed to withhold broadband grants and other funding to states with AI laws. Cecilia Kang reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Certain judges “are engaging in an unconscionable campaign of bias and hostility against U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan,” Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said yesterday after judges in the Eastern District of Virginia criticized Halligan’s continued involvement in court matters. The statement added, “This Department of Justice has no tolerance for undemocratic judicial activism.” April Rubin reports for Axios.

Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer, yesterday stepped down as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. Habba was disqualified from the role last week after an appeals court found that she was serving unlawfully. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the Justice Department will seek further review of the ruling and is “confident” the decision will be reversed. “Do not mistake compliance for surrender,” Habba wrote on social media. “This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.” Julianna Bragg and April Rubin report for Axios.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said yesterday that he signed an executive order declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations a foreign terrorist organization. Patricia Mazzei reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday unveiled a $12 billion bailout for farmers at an event at the White House. “We love our farmers,” Trump said. “And, as you know, the farmers like me.” Alan Rappeport, Kevin Draper, and Ana Swanson report for the New York Times.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development yesterday temporarily revoked a policy change that would significantly cut permanent housing funding for people experiencing homelessness, ahead of a court hearing. According to the court filing, HUD’s reasoning for rescinding the policy change was “to assess the issues raised by the Plaintiffs in their suits and to fashion a revised” notice of funding opportunity. “You can change the policy all you want but there’s a mechanism for doing so and it’s not doing things an hour before court,” the Judge said during the hearing yesterday. Katherine Hapgood reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court yesterday appeared likely to allow Trump to remove a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission purely for policy reasons. The court’s conservative majority seemed ready to overturn or limit a landmark decision from 1935, which said Congress could constrain the president’s authority to remove some executive branch officials. Devin Dwyer reports for ABC News.

A federal judge yesterday vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of windfarms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. AP News reports.

A federal judge yesterday ordered top Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign to testify on Dec 16. about the decision to deport more than a hundred men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act earlier this year. The judge also ordered testimony on Dec. 15 from Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ attorney who alleged the Trump administration sought to circumvent court orders. Peter Charalambous, Laura Romeo, and Ely Brown report for ABC News.

The creators of ICEBlock, an app on which users can report sightings of ICE agents, filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Trump administration, alleging that it illegally threatened to prosecute the app’s creators and pressured Apple to remove the app from its App Store. Andrew Pantazi reports for Axios

12 anonymous former FBI agents yesterday filed a lawsuit against the FBI and the Justice Department, alleging they were demoted or fired in retaliation for kneeling during a 2020 protest as a de-escalation tactic, conduct that the administration has characterized as participating in the demonstration. Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

An informed source told Human Rights Watch that Syrian authorities detained Jasem al-Shamsi, 55, at a checkpoint in the Damascus countryside on November 6, 2025, and have held him since without disclosing the legal basis for his detention. The UAE has pressed Lebanon and Jordan to return dissidents in recent years. If returned, al-Shamsi will be at serious risk of enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, unfair trial, and torture.

“Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Emirati authorities will once again exert pressure on another country in the region to forcibly return a dissident convicted in a sham trial,” said Joey Shea, United Arab Emirates researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Syrian authorities should deny any request to extradite al-Shamsi to the UAE, where he would face enforced disappearance and prolonged arbitrary detention.”

In 2013, Emirati authorities sentenced al-Shamsi in absentia to 10 years in prison as part of the notorious UAE94 unfair mass trial against political dissidents and human rights defenders. He was sentenced to life in prison in absentia for his peaceful advocacy in a second unfair mass trial in July 2024.

In March, Syrian authorities at the Immigration and Passports Department told al-Shamsi that there was an Interpol request for him. Human Rights Watch could not independently confirm whether there is an Interpol request for al-Shamsi. Warrants issued by the Arab Interior Ministers’ Council, a regional body concerned with security issues, are often misleadingly referred to as requests from “Arab Interpol.” These requests have led to the arrest and unlawful extradition of political dissidents and human rights defenders across Arab League countries, including twodissidents who were immediately subject to enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention upon arrival in the UAE.

Al-Shamsi was driving with his wife through the Damascus countryside when Syrian security forces stopped them and asked for identity documents. Security forces detained him and took him to the al-Fayha criminal security center, the informed source said. Security agents searched the family car without presenting a warrant and did not answer questions about the arrest. Syrian authorities have not informed al-Shamsi or his wife of the basis for the arrest.

On November 8, al-Shamsi’s wife returned to al-Fayha security center to ask about her husband, but authorities there denied knowledge of his detention and whereabouts, the source said. Al-Shamsi’s wife visited the Prisons Administration in Damascus on November 12, where authorities confirmed that he was in custody but denied knowledge of his exact whereabouts, the source said. Al-Shamsi was able to contact his family on November 27, when he confirmed that he was in custody and said he was being treated well, the source said.

Emirati authorities have repeatedly pressured countries that are members of the Arab Interior Ministers Council to forcibly return dissidents to the UAE, where they have faced enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture.

In May 2023, Jordanian authorities detained and forcibly extradited to the UAE a dual Emirati-Turkish citizen, Khalaf Abdulrahman al-Romaithi. Emirati authorities forcibly disappeared al-Romaithi upon arrival in the UAE and sentenced him to life in prison in 2024. Al-Romaithi and al-Shamsi were tried together in absentia as part of the notorious UAE94 unfair mass trial in 2013.

In January 2025, Lebanese authorities deported an Egyptian-Turkish poet, Abdulrahman Youssef al-Qardawi, to the UAE on the Emirati authorities’ request, citing charges related to his peaceful activity on social media. Lebanese authorities extradited al-Qardawi to the UAE even though he was not an Emirati citizen, nor was he in the UAE when the alleged offenses were committed.

In December 2023, the Emirati government carried out its second largest mass trial against 84 activists, dissidents, and human rights defenders, including al-Shamsi and al-Romaithi, for forming an independent advocacy group in 2010, a charge many have already served arbitrary prison sentences for as part of the grossly unfair 2013 case.

On November 19, 2025, Ali al-Khaja, one of the defendants in both trials, died in custody in the UAE’s notorious al-Razeen Prison.

Syria is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment or a threat to their life.

The latest guidance follows the EEOC’s previous 2016 Enforcement Guidance on National Origin Discrimination, which remains in effect.

Title VII, which is enforced by the EEOC, prohibits employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and applies to most private employers with 15 or more employees. Under Title VII, discrimination based on national origin with respect to compensation and other terms and conditions of employment is unlawful, and employers are prohibited from limiting, segregating or classifying employees in a way that could deprive them of opportunities based on their national origin.

The new technical assistance document defines national origin discrimination as “treating employees or applicants unfavorably or favorably because they are from a particular country or part of the world, because of ethnicity or accent, or because they appear to be of a certain ethnic background.”

The landing page emphasizes that Title VII protects all workers, “including Americans,” and explains that national origin discrimination can include preferring foreign workers, including workers with certain visa statuses, over American workers. It further highlights that discrimination can occur when the victim and the person engaging in the discrimination are of the same national origin.

The technical assistance document and landing page provide several examples of fact patterns that might constitute unlawful national origin discrimination, including:

Using discriminatory job advertisements, such as ads that suggest an employer prefers or requires applicants from a particular country or with a particular visa status (e.g., “H-1B preferred” or “H-1B only”);

Terminating employees who are “on the bench” between assignments at a higher rate than employees who are visa guest workers;

Making it more difficult for applicants of one national origin to apply for positions (e.g., subjecting U.S. workers to more laborious application methods than H-1B visa holders during the permanent labor certification (PERM) process);

Paying visa guest workers less than similarly situated American workers; or

Allowing harassment based on national origin, accent, or ethnicity that creates a hostile work environment.

The document also makes clear that the following considerations do not excuse an employer’s decision to hire foreign workers over American workers:

Customer or client preference;

Lower labor costs (whether due to “under the table” payment, or abuse of certain visa-holder wage requirement rules); or

Beliefs that workers of one or more national origin groups are “more productive” or “possess a better work ethic” than others from different groups.

Takeaways

This most recent EEOC guidance builds upon the enforcement priorities previously laid out by the EEOC around “protecting American workers from anti-American national origin discrimination.” Under the leadership of current Chair Andrea Lucas, the EEOC has emphasized protecting American workers from perceived “foreign preference” practices. In February 2025, then-Acting Chair Lucas announced a priority to “rigorously enforce” Title VII against employers that “illegally prefer non-American workers,” and vowed to protect American workers from anti-American bias.

Employers should expect to see increased EEOC enforcement around national origin discrimination, including with regard to employment actions that favor – or may be perceived to favor – non-Americans to the detriment of American workers.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15483_2235.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 14:58:06.137662

The issue is all the more critical since the Supreme Court issued a temporary order this fall allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to stop civilians without clear cause.","What Happened: A congressional investigation out today has found that, contrary to the Trump administration’s claims, immigration agents have frequently detained and mistreated U.S. citizens.

The report by Senate Democrats, which was prompted by ProPublica’s reporting, included interviews with nearly two dozen Americans.

Citizens told congressional investigators that immigration officers had dragged them from cars, detained them for days, fabricated claims of assault, routinely used excessive force and denied medical care.

The investigation also found that agents “treated children with reckless disregard for their safety and wellbeing.”

One citizen recalled that federal agents pointed guns at her youngest children, ages 6 and 8, and dragged her 14-year-old daughter out of a pickup and zip-tied her.

The citizen, Anabel Romero, told investigators that an agent threatened to “fucking blow your head off” during the chaotic raid at a rural Idaho racetrack. Romero also said agents “wouldn’t let people get diapers or food for their kids.”

Romero and her children were born in Idaho.

Five other citizens are giving their accounts publicly Tuesday on Capitol Hill.

What They Said: The citizens’ accounts paint a dire picture, the senator behind the report told ProPublica in an interview.

“What most struck me is the brutality and physical violence involved in every story,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “This is stuff that should be unrecognizable as America. It should make everyday Americans outraged that their fellow citizens could be treated this way.”

Background: ProPublica reported in October that agents have detained more than 170 Americans this year. More than 20 citizens said they were held for at least a day without being able to contact a lawyer or their loved ones. We also found that nearly 20 American children were detained. Four were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to a lawyer.

Why it Matters: The government does not track the number of Americans wrongly detained by immigration agents. The Trump administration in turn has denied that it happens. “No American citizens have been arrested or detained,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last month.

The citizens’ firsthand accounts in the congressional report show that is not true.

The issue is all the more critical since the Supreme Court issued a temporary order this fall allowing immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to stop civilians without clear cause.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that citizens had no reason to worry. “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

The congressional investigation found that one citizen was actually held for four days.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250919-Maney-Detained-Citizens-104_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-12-09 13:56:58.265310

The Trump administration has challenged ICE bans in other places by asserting those policies discriminate against the federal government.
“We are saying this is about defending city property from anyone,” Mahmood said, noting it will assert the city has a constitutional property right to protect its property and a fearful workforce.","The idea for the legislation, he told Playbook, came after the Trump administration took over city parking lots and other government property in Chicago and elsewhere for immigration enforcement sweeps and troop deployments.

“It was clear we needed something with teeth,” Mahmood said. “A city purpose is not civil immigration enforcement. This is a declaration of our local rights.”

He said his plan would not prevent ICE or other Homeland Security agents from entering city property to conduct targeted arrests — rather, they couldn’t stage operations or have an ongoing presence there. Still, the limitations would apply to large swaths of city-owned property including Golden Gate Park, the City Hall plaza and public transit stations.

There’s little doubt the proposal will draw backlash from the Trump administration, which could reignite tensions that had subsided this fall after Lurie and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, along with other prominent tech powerbrokers, implored Trump to stand down.

Mahmood seems to anticipate the legislation, written by City Attorney David Chiu and co-sponsored by Supervisor Chyanne Chen, will be challenged in court.

Lurie’s office did not respond to a request for comment, though the mayor was briefed on the plan. Lurie has deliberately avoided provoking Trump, a strategy that appears to have contributed to the president’s decision not to target San Francisco as he has Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., New Orleans or Portland.

But San Francisco’s powerful labor unions are lining up in support of Mahmood’s plan, arguing Lurie’s strategy might not work for much longer.

“Anyone who somehow thinks we can fly under the radar with this administration is living in a fantasy world,” said Rudy Gonzalez, head of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents thousands of city workers. “That, to me, is not a sustainable model. This is a very specific thing the city can do that is not performative — is not going to poke the bear, necessarily.”

Mahmood said he believes the plan is “legally defensible” because it applies to any outside government entity, including the state, that attempts to seize city property without permission.

“ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.
Our law officers are facing more than a 1150% increase in assaults against them and an 8000% increase in death threats,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Tuesday in a statement to The Hill.","The creator of ICEBlock — an iPhone app that flagged sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — sued the Trump administration on Monday, arguing Attorney General Pam Bondi violated free speech protections by pressuring Apple to remove the app from its store.

Joshua Aaron, the maker of the app, argues in the complaint that the creation, distribution and promotion of the app is protected by the First Amendment and that the alleged “pressure campaign” by the Trump administration to “to coerce Apple into removing ICEBlock from the App Store” amounts to censorship and is unlawful.

“We’re basically asking the court to set a precedent and affirm that ICEBlock is, in fact, First Amendment-protected speech and that I did nothing wrong by creating it,” Aaron told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. “And to make sure that they can’t do this same thing again in the future.”

The lawsuit also asks a federal judge to protect Aaron from prosecution, challenging the “unlawful threats made by Attorney General Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and White House Border Czar Tom Homan to criminally investigate and prosecute Aaron for his role in developing ICEBlock.”

He told the AP that one goal of the lawsuit is “to basically have them stop threatening myself and my family.”

Apple removed ICEBlock and other apps in October after Bondi said they put immigration enforcement officials at risk by allowing users of the app to track ICE activity in their neighborhoods.

Bondi, in an interview on Fox News over the summer, said Aaron was putting law enforcement at risk by “giving a message to criminals where our federal officers are. And he cannot do that. And we are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that’s not protected speech.”

“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store – and Apple did so,” Bondi said in October.

Apple notified Aaron of the decision on the same day, telling the software developer in an email shared with the AP at the time, that new information “provided to Apple by law enforcement” made clear ICEBlock violated the company’s policies.

The email noted that the tracker broke the rules “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.”

Aaron has pushed back against that argument. In a Monday interview on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront,” the plaintiff said the government used the same argument when GPS apps like Waze rolled out — which shared the location of things like speed traps and relies on public law enforcement reporting.

“Somehow, they figured, if you could see a police officer doing a speed trap in public and you told somebody else about it, magically, they were going to jump out of their car and start smashing the police car and attacking the police officer. Obviously, that’s ridiculous,” Aaron said. “That doesn’t happen. What do they do? They slow down and they avoid the conflict.”

He noted ICEBlock states in three distinct places that the app is “for informational purposes only” and “do not obstruct law enforcement.”

“So, this was never intended to be anything other than an informational tool that allowed people within a five-mile radius of the reported sighting to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to approach the area in which ICE was sighted,” the app creator said.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

On Wednesday this week a Council of Europe meeting will take place at which there is expected to be discussion around “reinterpreting” article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Because of the reporting I have seen around this, and will no doubt see more of this week, I think it is important to note that the government’s stated target is not the “torture” element of article 3 but the “inhuman and degrading treatment” part.

Focussing attention on the part of article 3 which is not at risk is unhelpful. The asylum paper singles out healthcare needs, specifically mental health cases, as being the reason that reform is needed, so it seems to be cases such as MY (Suicide risk after Paposhvili) that the government is seeking to exclude from protection under article 3.

I was very pleased to see the Migration Observatory’s piece on issues with published Home Office data last week. And on that note, as I first identified in August this year and highlighted again in November, we finally have confirmation from the Home Office that the statistics on asylum claims based on sexual orientation are currently not being published, with no firm date for their return. The Home Office is being extremely cagey about the data that is missing because of this systems change (which surely cannot be limited to these cases) and it remains unclear whether it will remain missing once publication resumes. Anyone with questions may want to try here.

On Free Movement, I think today’s post on the vicarious trauma of practitioners is a particularly timely one given the shockwaves that are still reverberating through the migrant community after the recently announced increase to refugee settlement periods and earned settlement proposals. Trying to advise desperately worried people when many of the proposals are vague at best, and without any certainty as to what is going to happen and when and who will actually be affected, does have an impact on lawyers and so please do have a read.

Also on the blog, we now have the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act 2025 after Royal Assent was given last week. I did a quick post on the Home Office writing out to Syrian refugees with pending settlement applications after I could see panic spreading fast last week.

There were a couple of case write ups including this one on sponsor licence revocation and a very useful Court of Appeal decision on the need for the Home Office to exercise flexibility in decision making, in this case in a Windrush application.

His order also targets the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist group founded in 1928.

The move closely follows a similar order issued in November by Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, DeSantis’s fellow Republican, even though only the federal government can designate terrorist organizations.

Cair and its supporters are among those who have dismissed the orders from DeSantis and Abbott as Islamophobia.

In a statement, the national and Florida Cair chapters described DeSantis’s order as a “stunt” and accused him of signing a “defamatory and unconstitutional order baselessly smearing” them. The groups vowed to sue Florida as it has Texas, where Abbott has directed law enforcement officials to investigate whether a group in Dallas is operating courts under sharia law.

“Governor DeSantis knows full well that Cair-Florida is an American civil rights organization that has spent decades advancing free speech, religious freedom and justice for all,” including for the people of Palestine, the groups said in a statement.

DeSantis said the executive order naming Cair, one of the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy groups, was “effective immediately”. His order also targets the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist group founded in 1928.

Neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor Cair are on the US government’s list of designated FTO groups.

Nonetheless, “Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organizations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” DeSantis said in a statement on X.

The order said Cair was “founded by persons connected to the Muslim Brotherhood,” which it connects to Hamas and the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Cair denies ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Cair’s Florida and national chapters said DeSantis through his order had prioritized “serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida” – and of diverting “millions in Florida taxpayer dollars to the Israeli government’s bonds”.

In a separate statement on X, DeSantis said that members of the Florida legislature “are crafting legislation to stop the creep of sharia law, and I hope that they codify these protections for Floridians against Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood in their legislation”.

Abbott’s order in Texas prohibited Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood from acquiring property in the state and authorizing legal action to shut down affiliated entities.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/072b63e4e6d795e403d221e7e81f944b7a7798f5/640_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0049e841cf4a72ff52c38668e38a6d63",N,,2025-12-09 12:57:52.916662

United States

NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the New York Civil Liberties Union today filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the immediate release of an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion and other documents related to President Trump’s illegal lethal strikes on civilian boats in international waters.

“The public deserves to know how our government is justifying the cold-blooded murder of civilians as lawful and why it believes it can hand out get-out-of-jail-free cards to people committing these crimes,” said Jeffrey Stein, staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project. “The Trump administration must stop these illegal and immoral strikes, and officials who have carried them out must be held accountable.”

Since Sept. 2, the Trump administration has conducted at least 22 strikes, murdering at least 87 civilians, in clear violation of domestic and international law. Indeed, the U.S. military may not, under any circumstances, execute civilians who are merely suspected of smuggling drugs. The federal government must first pursue non-lethal measures like arrest and demonstrate that lethal force is an absolute last resort to protect against a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death or serious physical injury. Despite bipartisan outrage over these plainly unlawful attacks, the Trump administration has said they will continue.

The groups are suing to force the disclosure of a legal opinion authored by OLC — a part of the Justice Department whose opinions are generally treated as binding within the executive branch — that apparently blesses the ongoing strikes as lawful acts in an alleged “armed conflict” with unspecified “drug cartels.” According to news accounts, the memo also purports to immunize personnel who authorized or took part in these unlawful strikes from future criminal prosecution for what would otherwise simply be homicides.

Contrary to the government’s public assertions, the United States is not, and could not be, in an armed conflict with Latin American drug cartels. Under international law, an armed conflict between a state and a non-state actor exists only if the non-state actor is an “organized armed group” that is structured and disciplined like regular armed forces and is engaged in “protracted armed violence” against the state. There is no plausible argument that any drug cartel satisfies this test vis-a-vis the United States.

“The Trump administration is displacing the fundamental mandates of international law with the phony wartime rhetoric of a basic autocrat,” said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “If the OLC opinion seeks to dress up legalese in order to provide cover for the obvious illegality of these serial homicides, the public needs to see this analysis and ultimately hold accountable all those who facilitate murder in the United States’ name.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly acknowledged the existence of the memo and continues to assert that their strikes are on “firm legal ground,” yet they are still refusing to publicly release the OLC opinion that details their reasoning. In mid-November, the Trump administration allowed members of Congress and their staffs to read the opinion. Many found its analysis deeply troubling. Indeed, one senator remarked that the opinion “would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world. I mean, it is broad enough to authorize just about anything.”

“The public deserves to know how the Trump administration is rubber-stamping the bombing of civilians in the Caribbean Sea, with no accountability,” said Ify Chikezie, staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “By claiming that these attacks are legal while refusing to provide any evidence or rationale, Trump shows once again his disdain for basic transparency, human rights, and the rule of law. The courts must step in and order the administration to release these documents immediately.”

The groups are asking the court to intervene because the government has not released any records in response to their request, despite urgent public interest in the OLC opinion and the Freedom of Information Act’s (FOIA) clear statutory deadlines.

FOIA Case Seeking the Trump Administration’s Legal Justification for Deadly Boat Strikes

The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”) authored a legal opinion that reportedly claims to justify the Trump administration’s illegal lethal strikes on civilians in boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Media reports indicate that, in addition to claiming that the strikes are lawful acts in an alleged “armed conflict” with unspecified drug cartels, the OLC opinion also purports to immunize personnel who authorized or took part in the strikes from future criminal prosecution. Because the public deserves to know how our government is justifying these illegal strikes, and why they think the people who carried them out should not be held accountable, the ACLU is seeking immediate release of the OLC legal opinion and related documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.

I’m grateful to Representatives Jayapal and Smith for introducing this bill which establishes crucial oversight and basic human-rights protections that this administration has systematically dismantled.”

Since President Trump returned to office, the use of immigration detention has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with over 66,000 people detained. During that period of time, 23 people have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Nearly 73 percent of those detained have no criminal convictions, and many of those with convictions have only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

Detained people in these facilities are being held in inhumane living conditions, with reports of overcrowding forcing 35 men to share one toilet and sleep head to toe on concrete floors, of people being served only a cup of rice a day or rotting food, and of people having their medications withheld or being denied necessary medical care. Further, the Trump Administration has restarted the practice of detaining families and children, which has long been criticized as unsafe and inflicting irreversible harm on children.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would:

Repeal mandatory detention;

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention;

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over the age of 60;

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period;

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards;

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards; and

Require DHS to admit Members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

This contribution identifies where such guidance can help, and where a significant shift in current State practice is needed: clear legal basis and safeguards for intrusive practices, data sharing and interoperability, oversight of algorithmic systems, human rights impact assessment, and the use of security and emergency regimes that dilute rights protections. Each area is framed by the need to ensure legality, necessity and proportionality, non-discrimination, and effective remedy.

Why the new guidance?

Under instruction from the UN Secretary-General, OHCHR was requested to draft Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights-Based Digital Border Governance (hereafter: “guidance”). The initiative builds on a report on the same topic produced by OHCHR and Essex University in 2023. Key issues addressed by the guidance include: (i) biometrics and large databases, (ii) risk screening and profiling, (iii) automated and AI-assisted decision-making, (iv) intra- and inter-state data sharing, and (v) private-sector participation. While the guidance will not be binding on States, it draws on best practice including developments in data protection law and AI regulation. OHCHR also benefited from the mapping conducted by the AFAR project and consultation on the draft with the AFAR team.

Legal basis and safeguards

IHRL requires a clear, accessible, and foreseeable legal basis for interferences with rights, together with appropriate safeguards. Some human rights are absolute, and their violation can never be justified. In the migration context, such rights include non-refoulement and the prohibition on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, and the prohibition of collective expulsion. There is no possible justificatory legal basis for the use of technology that enables such violations. Qualified rights may be subject to justifiable limitations, provided they are necessary, proportionate and based in law.

The deployment of digital border governance technologies often limits the rights of people on the move but the lawful basis is not always clearly established. Border and migration authorities often rely on broad enabling statutes or controller authority for data processing, which is insufficient where intrusive measures are used. Mobile phone extraction is a paradigmatic example: blanket seizure and compelled disclosure of credentials are highly intrusive and demand strict necessity, targeted authorisation, and independent oversight. Courts have begun to restrict indiscriminate practices.

Data sharing and interoperability

The systematic sharing of migration-related data within and between states, and with private actors, is another area of concern. Such practices raise serious risks that key privacy safeguards will be eroded, in particular purpose limitation and proportionality. Interoperability demands greater attention to these safeguards. Opening disparate systems to cross-searches or automated matching enhances surveillance capability and facilitates repurposing. Human rights safeguards must travel with the data, including transfer controls, audit trails, and effective access, rectification, and redress. However, binding agreements regulating transfers appear the exception rather than the rule.

Automated systems and meaningful review

The draft guidance also addresses the growing use of automated decision-making (ADM) and AI in digital border governance (see other articles in this collection). While data protection law and emerging AI regulations contain important safeguards, including the right of individuals not to be subject to ADM producing significant legal effect on an individual, this leaves a significant lacuna – insofar as AI may be used in multiple processes that support decision-making and impact human rights (for example through documentary or behavioural analysis which produces recommendations but does not constitute ADM in law). This exacerbates concerns about the implementation of the ‘human in the loop’ principle, the veracity of human review of ADM, and the extent to which these requirements will provide meaningful oversight (rather than a “rubber stamp”). (See EDPS–FRA Joint Opinion (2021); UNGA Special Rapporteur (A/75/590, 2020); UNHCR, Discussion Paper (2021); CoE CAHAI(2020)23, 2020; EU FRA Getting the Future Right)

OHCHR has called for moratoria on the deployment of AI use cases that present unacceptable human rights risks, and the EU AI Act introduces some prohibitions. Nevertheless, the private sector continues to devise high-risk uses cases and AI regulation remains uneven or absent in much of the world. The guidelines affirm that AI systems that cannot demonstrably mitigate risks and ensure compliance with IHRL should not be deployed.

Risk assessments matter

To address this challenge, the guidance urges States to undertake comprehensive risk assessments to identify and mitigate human rights risks arising from the deployment of digital border governance technologies. This reflects the growing use of risk assessments across of a range of complex policy domains, from environmental impact to AI. Specifically, the guidance recommends the systematic use of human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), supplemented where necessary by privacy/data protection impact assessments (PIAs/DPIAs, which are legal requirement for high-risk processing operations in many jurisdictions), and algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs), which are required or recommended where AI is developed by public authorities.

While these assessment tools offer distinct frameworks for identifying and mitigating the risks they address their methodologies overlap, suggesting significant (though largely unexplored) scope for consolidation. This could remove the need for duplication where multiple assessments of the same digital border governance systems are required by law or recommended as best practice.

Currently, HRIAs appear vastly underutilised in respect to digital border governance initiatives. Indeed, beyond the “fundamental rights implications” annexed to a handful of European Commission impact assessments, evidence of HRIAs in this area is vanishingly thin. Concern at such a low bar is exacerbated by the challenges that HRIAs present: they are complex and highly technical, requiring in-depth research and analysis, specialist expertise, extensive stakeholder consultations, and commensurate resourcing. There is also a surprising lack of authoritative guidance on how to conduct HRIAs beyond the Danish Institute for Human Rights’ widely respected toolkit for HRIA of digital activities – which amounts to 261 pages. While States are inevitably keen to simplify assessment processes, shortcuts and checklists risk undermining the value and validity of the exercise, particularly the requisite necessity and proportionality tests.

Given the current lack of transparency in digital border governance and the lack of alternative means to comprehensively address and mitigate the adverse human rights impact of new technologies prior to their deployment, political commitment and considerable resources are needed to ensure that States do conduct HRIAs, that those assessments are rigorous and comprehensive, and that the findings determine not just how the technology is deployed, but if it should be used at all.

Security and emergency regimes

Finally, attempts to institutionalise human rights-based approaches risk frustration by the invocation of regimes that place limits on the application of IHRL. Since the ‘9/11’ terrorist attacks, States have increasingly asserted that migration and border control is a national security issue. This conjunction has had significant effects, framing people on the move as an implicit security threat resulting in the differential and harmful treatment of “suspect communities”. After 9/11, States invoked concern with terrorism as a justification for the detention and expulsion of third country (and even dual) nationals. More recently, these practices have been supplanted by the systematic national security screening of asylum-seekers, applicants for visas and residence permits, and international travellers whose entry into many countries now requires pre-authorisation. This is a remarkable shift whose underlying assumption is that “all travellers are put under surveillance and are considered a priori as potential law breakers”. The ensuing screening systems, now required under a Chapter VII UN Security Council Resolution 2396, incorporate various methods impacting human rights: the collection and analysis of a wide range of data points, the transnational pooling of national security “watchlists”, the inclusion of protected characteristics in risk profiles, and the use of AI and automated decision-making to determine the risk posed by specific individuals. All of this raises important questions about necessity, proportionality, non-discrimination, procedural fairness and access to remedies.

The blurring of the boundaries between administrative immigration procedures and national security has also resulted in broad exemptions to legal frameworks that should protect the rights of people on the move and facilitate public scrutiny of State practices. Most data protection regimes exempt data processed for national security purposes. The EU AI Act fully exempts AI systems used for national security purposes and limits transparency requirements for those systems used for migration and border control. This will likely undermine attempts by civil society and human rights bodies to hold operators and systems to account, and may hamper the work of regulators with a formal oversight mandate.

An increase in the use of emergency powers by States to counter so-called “mass influxes” of migrants may have the same effect. In recent years, at least 11 countries across the Americas, southern and eastern Europe have declared national or localised states of emergency (or similar crisis regimes) for this purpose.

These have seen military forces deployed to support border authorities; restrictions on asylum rights; fast-track detention and expulsion; broader powers to conduct identity checks and search-and-seizure; the expanded use of surveillance drones and biometric systems; and the restriction of public and media access to border areas.

While States assert that the use of emergency powers is strictly required by the exigencies of the situation (and thus in accordance with IHRL) the suspension of constitutional and human rights, due process and oversight is fundamentally at odds with human-rights based approaches. The expansion and repeated renewal of emergency migration decrees by States risks the normalisation of extended containment and the implementation of unaccountable digital border governance regimes, whose deployment may be fast-tracked in the absence of scrutiny or safeguards. The guidance reminds States that national security should not be used as a pretext for vague or arbitrary limitations on human rights.

Where next?

OHCHR’s guidance clarifies baseline human rights requirements for the deployment of digital border governance technologies. At a minimum, States should conduct comprehensive, pre-deployment HRIAs, enhance transparency, institute oversight mechanisms capable of addressing the inherent risk of new technologies, and provide meaningful forms of redress. Without this recalibration, enhanced digital border governance continues to represent a huge risk to vulnerable and marginalised communities.",https://verfassungsblog.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/feature_vb.png,N,,2025-12-09 11:58:14.107256

Former justice department employees sound alarm over 'near destruction' of civil rights division

Sam Levine

More than 200 former employees in the justice department’s civil rights division signed a letter released on Tuesday decrying the “near destruction” of the agency that is supposed to enforce America’s civil rights laws and accused political leadership of waging a campaign to purge career experts from its ranks.

There was a mass exodus of lawyers earlier this year after political appointees removed career managers, detailed employees to menial work unilaterally dropped cases, and made it clear the division’s focus would be enforcing Donald Trump’s priorities. By 1 May of this year, the department had lost about 70% of its attorneys – a staggering number. The letter was released on Tuesday to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights division.

Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally who leads the civil rights division, has cheered the departures of career employees, describing them as activists who did not want to do the work that was asked of them. “That could not be further from the truth. We left because this Administration turned the Division’s core mission upside down, largely abandoning its duty to protect civil rights,” the letter says. “Having no use for the expertise of career staff, the Administration launched a coordinated effort to drive us out.”

The letter goes on to detail how the division has abandoned civil rights enforcement, including dismissing key cases involving voting rights, sexual abuse of unaccompanied migrant children, and multiple consent decrees involving police departments across the country. Dhillon also encouraged lawyers to leave and accept a paid leave offer and threatened to lay employees off if they did not, the letter says. Justice department officials appeared caught off guard by how many people were leaving earlier this year and quietly asked employees to reconsider leaving.

“America deserves better,” the letter says. “The future of the Civil Rights Division is in jeopardy, and with it, the rights it protects. We hope that one day we can return the Division to its righteous work. Until then, we will continue to defend those rights and the Constitution wherever we find ourselves. We call on all Americans to join us. Demand that the Division enforce our civil rights laws and defend the Constitution’s promise of equal justice for all.”

Supreme court hears arguments in case challenging campaign finance limitations from political parties

Happening now at the supreme court, arguments in a case that challenges the limits on campaign finance contributions from party committees.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v Federal Election Commission, the challengers (in this case the Senate committee focused on electing GOP members to Congress) argue that the cap on coordinated spending –violates the first amendment, and a party’s ability to sufficiently support a candidate. Depending on the scope of the decision, if the challengers are successful, a party group could spend an unlimited amount of money taking out ads during an election.

Defending the FEC today in court is the high-profile Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias, with support from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

Federal judge grants DoJ request to unseal Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury documents

A federal judge in New York has granted the justice department’s request to unseal grand jury documents in the sex-trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell – the companion and accomplice of the late sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes after the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Donald Trump signed last month.

The legislation requires the Department of Justice to release the full tranche of records related to disgraced financier, in a searchable format by 19 December.

In his order today, judge Paul A Engelmayer also granted the DoJ’s request to release discovery material – which could comprise thousands of documents and exhibits. However, Engelmayer stipulated that the justice department would still be required to abide by a protective order to “withhold or redact segregable portions that contain personally identifiable and other victim-related information”.

A reminder that Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein’s sex-trafficking crimes in a minimum security facility in Texas. In October, the supreme court rejected her petition to overturn her conviction.

Trump also said he didn’t have much hopes about European involvement in Ukraine peace talks, as “they talk, but they don’t produce, and the war just keeps going on and on.”

Jakub notes that “these comments will do nothing to reassure European leaders concerned about the anti-EU outbursts over the weekend coming from the American right.”

While these comments are, in many ways, more of the same from the president, the timing is certainly significant.

“For him [Trump] to repeat all these lines with some pride as he gets named by Politico as ‘the most powerful person shaping Europe’ at the same time as European leaders want – or, more accurately, really need – to stay close to him on Ukraine … it makes it all very complicated for everyone involved,” Jakub writes.

Donald Trump will travel to Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, today for a rally-style event to push out his administration’s affordability messaging.

As we reported earlier, the president touted the state of the US economy under his leadership in an interview with Politico. We can expect more of the same lines at his event today, in a county that swung for Trump in 2024, after voting for the Democratic candidate in several prior presidential elections.

Before Trump heads to Pennsylvania, he’ll attend vice-president JD Vance’s Christmas reception.

Trump concluded his interview with Politico with some musings on the future leadership of the Republican party. Asked if anyone in the party could energise such a wide coalition as he had, Trump said:

I hope so. I don’t know. You never know until they’re tested. You know, it’s like, uh, you jump in the water; you can swim or you can’t.

Hegseth can testify before Congress over 2 September boat strike 'if he wants', Trump says

In his interview with Politico published on Tuesday morning, Trump was asked if the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, should testify under oath before Congress about a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat on 2 September.

“He can if he wants,” Trump said, adding: “I don’t care. I would say do it if you want, Pete.”

Trump said he had seen the video of the strikes. Asked if he thought the second strike was necessary, he said:

Uh, well, it looked like they were trying to turn back over the boat, but I don’t get involved in that. That’s up to them.

Trump claimed that each strike on an alleged drug boat saved the lives of 25,000 Americans, a figure that has been strongly questioned by public health experts.

He added:

And we’re gonna hit ’em on land very soon, too.

Trump grades US economy as ‘A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus’

Asked by Politico to grade the US economy, Trump first rated it as “A-plus”, before upgrading it to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus”. Questioned over the cost of living for voters, Trump said he “inherited a total mess”, and added: “Prices were at an all-time high when I came in. Prices are coming down substantially … It’s been 10 months. It’s amazing what we’ve done.”

Asked if he would rule out reducing tariffs on any more goods, Trump said:

“On some. And on some I’ll increase tariffs. Because you know what happens is because of tariffs, all of the car companies are coming back.”

You know, we lost 58% of the automobile business. We a monopoly in the world. We had everything. And because we had presidents that either weren’t smart or didn’t have business sense or their people didn’t do a good job ... they could’ve kept that.

Trump also spoke about the computer chip industry, after yesterday’s decision to allow Nvidia to sell some of its chips to China.

“We could’ve kept the chip market. We had 100% of the chip market, Intel, all of these guys. You know, there’s the thing. They came in to see me, Intel. They needed something to be done by the government. I said, I’m gonna do it, but I think you have to give us 10% of your company. You know what happened? We made $40bn on that deal. The price went through the roof. The United States ... in about 10 minutes, I made $40bn. Nobody talks about that.”

Nvidia shares boosted by Trump’s announcement of chip sales to China

Nvidia shares rose 1.7% in US pre-market trading on Tuesday after Trump said he would allow the sale of its H200 chips to approved Chinese customers. The US president announced on Monday that he had granted Nvidia permission to ship H200 chips to China in exchange for a 25% surcharge for the US, a move that could allow the world’s most valuable company to win back billions of dollars in lost business.

China’s tech stocks slipped slightly after Trump’s announcement. China’s SSE Star Chip index dropped by 1% at the start of trading, before recovering slightly to a 0.43% fall. China’s CSI semiconductor industry index had a similar drop, before recovering to a 0.36% fall.

Last night, Trump insisted that Nvidia’s most powerful AI chips wouldn’t be sold to China, posting on Truth Social:

Nvidia’s US Customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal.

My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Trump’s move was criticized by some senior Democratic senators, including Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons — the top two Democrats on the Senate foreign relations committee — Jack Reed, the Democratic head of the Senate armed services committee, and Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate banking committee.

They, and other Democratic senators, urged Trump to reverse the decision, saying:

“The Trump administration’s announcement that it will allow the export of advanced H200 AI chips to China is a colossal economic and national security failure. The H200s are vastly more capable than anything China can make and gifting them to Beijing would squander America’s primary advantage in the AI race.”

More from that Politico interview with Donald Trump published this morning: Trump told the politics site that he would expect his pick for chair of the Federal Reserve to support an immediate cut to interest rates.

Trump has not yet chosen a new Fed chair, but has been putting pressure on the current chief, Jerome Powell, to cut rates.

Asked if the new chair should lower rates immediately, Trump said:

This guy [Powell] should too. But I think he’s a combination of not a smart person and doesn’t like Trump. But the reason he doesn’t like Trump ... is because I hit him hard because he’s doing a bad job.”

Trump says only ‘dark and sinister forces’ would want his tariffs to end

Donald Trump has defended his tariff regime as he prepares to give a speech on the US economy and cost of living at a rally in Pennsylvania this evening.

Posting on his social media platform Truth Social in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Trump wrote:

Because of Tariffs, easily and quickly applied, our National Security has been greatly enhanced, and we have become the financially strongest Country, by far, anywhere in the World. Only dark and sinister forces would want to see that end!!!

Supreme court justices are due to make a ruling on Trump’s tariffs soon, having heard oral arguments on their legal validity last month. The ruling is expected by the end of this year or early 2026.

In a second post, Trump wrote:

The biggest threat in history to United States National Security would be a negative decision on Tariffs by the U.S. Supreme Court. We would be financially defenseless. Now Europe is going to Tariffs against China, as they already do against others. We would not be allowed to do what others already do!

On Monday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said that he had told Beijing that if China did not reduce its “unsustainable” trade deficit with EU, then Europeans would be forced to take measures such as imposing tariffs on Chinese products.

On Tuesday, the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, said that “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly evident” over the course of this year, though he did not mention Donald Trump by name.

Hegseth and Rubio expected to brief 'Gang of Eight'

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Dan Caine, are expected to brief the “Gang of Eight” lawmakers on Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports, citing two sources familiar with the plan and a Trump administration official.

The “Gang of Eight” – which includes intelligence committee and Senate and House of Representatives leaders from both parties – is traditionally briefed on major national security actions.

The sources did not discuss the nature of the briefing, expected to take place at 3:30pm ET.

Tensions have been mounting between the US and Venezuela, as Donald Trump threatens land strikes against suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers, after more than three months of a military campaign against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. On Tuesday, Politico published an interview with the president in which he refused to rule out putting US troops into Venezuela. “I don’t comment on that. I wouldn’t say that one way or the other,” he said.

Asked if he would consider adopting a similar strategy to that taken with Venezuela against Mexico and Colombia, Trump replied: “Yeah, I would. Sure. I would.”

The US military has also built up the presence of warships in the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier strike group and a nuclear submarine.

Adm Alvin Holsey, the outgoing commander of the US military’s southern command, which oversees American troops in Latin America, is also expected to brief a separate group of House and Senate lawmakers on Tuesday, two people familiar with the matter said.

Holsey will step down on Friday, less than two months after the surprise announcement of his early retirement, which came just over a month into the Pentagon’s accelerating campaign against suspected drug boats. The strikes have resulted in the deaths of nearly 90 people and raised concerns among Democrats and legal experts.

Trump’s military operations have been under increased scrutiny since a 2 September decision to launch a second strike on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean.

The video of the attack, viewed by lawmakers last week, showed two men clinging to wreckage after their vessel was destroyed in the first strike, according to sources familiar with the imagery. They were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible communications equipment.

The defense department’s Law of War Manual forbids attacks on combatants who are incapacitated, unconscious or shipwrecked, as long as they abstain from hostilities and do not attempt to escape. The manual cites firing upon shipwreck survivors as an example of a “clearly illegal” order that should be refused.

On Monday, Trump said he would let Hegseth decide whether to release the full video of the strike, in a shift from comments last week when he said the government would “certainly release” any footage, “no problem”.

“Whatever Hegseth wants to do is OK with me,” Trump said on Monday.

The annual defense policy bill currently passing through Congress includes provisions that would compel the Pentagon to provide Congressional committees with unedited video of the strikes. Lawmakers in Congress have tried in recent months to compel Hegseth’s department to share more information about the attacks. The bill would withhold a quarter of the Pentagon’s travel funds if the footage is not shared.

“It would be nice if he would read it,” Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine.
As for President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, whom the Trump administration has labeled the head of a terrorist organization: “His days are numbered,” Mr. Trump said, according to the interview transcript.
Eliminating the limits, the majority concluded, could allow wealthy donors to circumvent federal limits on contributions to individual candidates.","Once appointed to the job, Ms. Halligan quickly secured indictments of both, but a federal judge dismissed those indictments on procedural grounds in November, ruling that the Trump administration had violated the law for filling vacancies for federal positions.

Still, Ms. Halligan remains listed as the U.S. attorney on court filings, drawing the attention of judges and magistrate judges in recent days.

During the hearing on Tuesday, the judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, pressed a federal prosecutor to explain why Ms. Halligan’s name remained on such filings, despite the court ruling last month. The judge noted that the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, who was appointed in a similarly unorthodox manner and was similarly found by the courts to be serving unlawfully, had resigned on Monday.

“That’s the proper position, in my view,” Judge Brinkema said. The judge also questioned whether there was any legal guidance issued by the Justice Department to explain why Ms. Halligan was still in the job.

The lawyer representing the government said only that the staff of the Eastern District of Virginia had been told in an email to keep using Ms. Halligan’s name as the U.S. attorney.

Inside the Justice Department, officials have asked the Office of Legal Counsel for guidance because the office provides legal analysis for the administration, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

The office has advised department officials that Ms. Halligan could stay in spite of a judge’s ruling declaring her appointment invalid because the decision did not require a specific measure to be taken, like her removal, the people said.

The motion seeking the unsealing of the records was made last month by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had asked the judge to expedite a ruling given the upcoming deadline set by the law, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Ms. Bondi had also asked a different judge to unseal the grand jury materials from the investigation of Mr. Epstein, who was indicted on sex-trafficking charges in July 2019 and detained pending trial; he was found dead in his jail cell the following month, and his death was ruled a suicide.

The judge in Mr. Epstein’s case, Richard M. Berman, has not yet ruled on that request.

This past summer, Judge Engelmayer and Judge Berman each denied similar requests by Ms. Bondi for the Maxwell and Epstein materials, citing grand jury secrecy. Ms. Bondi renewed her request to both judges for the materials after the new law passed last month.

The request, submitted by Ms. Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, was signed by Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The motion argues that the new law demonstrates a congressional intent “to override some of the underlying bases for grand jury secrecy.”

The motion notes, for example, that one purpose of the secrecy rule is to protect people who have not been charged “from the anxiety, embarrassment and public castigation that may result from disclosure.”

The new law mandates that materials may not be “withheld, delayed or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, political sensitivity, including to any governmental official, public figure or foreign dignitary,” the motion says.

The new law also allows for withholding certain information like records that could identify victims or contain personal medical information, or that could jeopardize an active federal investigation, the motion noted.

Ms. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 after a monthlong trial of sex-trafficking conspiracy, sex trafficking of a minor and other counts.

A federal judge in the Southern District of Florida on Friday granted the Justice Department’s request to unseal grand jury materials from an investigation there of Mr. Epstein that began in 2005 into allegations he was abusing teenage girls. As part of a deal to avoid federal charges, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges that included soliciting minors for prostitution, a deal that has been harshly criticized as overly lenient.

This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Mr. Trump said that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who has rejected parts of a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire, would have to “get on the ball” and start “accepting things.” Mr. Zelensky’s army is losing the war, Mr. Trump said, suggesting that it was time for him to compromise in the cease-fire talks.

Mr. Trump’s intervention was published a day after the leaders of Britain, France and Germany met with Mr. Zelensky in London to show their support for Ukraine and discuss alternative cease-fire plans. Mr. Zelensky reiterated after that meeting that Ukraine would not budge from its longstanding opposition to handing over land to Russia, a requirement of Mr. Trump’s proposed peace plan.

Mr. Trump also accused Mr. Zelensky of not having read a new draft of the American peace plan. “It would be nice if he would read it,” Mr. Trump said. “You know, a lot of people are dying. So it would be really good if he’d read it.”

Several elements of the American peace plan — which was published last month — echoed demands made by the Kremlin, prompting alarm across Europe.

Mr. Trump suggested that a Russian victory would be inevitable, in part because the country is much larger than Ukraine.

Russia, he said, has the “upper hand. And they always did. They’re much bigger. They’re much stronger,” Mr. Trump said. Even though he said that he gave Ukraine a lot of credit for bravery, “At some point, size will win.”

Mr. Trump called for elections in Ukraine, accusing the country’s leadership of “using war not to hold an election.”

“They talk about a democracy, but it gets to a point where it’s not a democracy anymore,” he said.

Mr. Trump also would not rule out an American ground invasion of Venezuela, which he has repeatedly threatened with military action inside the country and accused of sending drugs and criminals to the United States. As for President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, whom the Trump administration has labeled the head of a terrorist organization: “His days are numbered,” Mr. Trump said, according to the interview transcript.

Later, Mr. Trump said he had watched footage of the Sept. 2 military strike on a boat in the Caribbean that killed survivors of a previous attack on the boat, which the administration has said was involved in drug trafficking. “It’s not pretty,” Mr. Trump said. Lawmakers in Congress have been debating whether the second strike was a war crime.

“Nobody wants to drive boats to America loaded up with drugs anymore,” Trump said. “And we’re gonna hit ’em on land very soon, too.”

The court has been chipping away at campaign finance restrictions ever since. The case the justices will consider on Tuesday involves one of the remaining limits: how much money political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.

The case, National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, was brought by national Republican leaders, who argue that the limits violate the First Amendment, restricting their ability to reach and influence voters.

Depending on its scope, such a decision could swing the pendulum of power back toward the official political parties and away from super PACs. It could also allow parties to spend huge sums from big donors directly on candidates, potentially expanding the influence of big money compared with small-dollar contributions. Democrats in recent years have done better than Republicans at winning smaller donations.

In practical terms, a win for the Republicans could have an immediate impact on the midterm elections, shrinking one of the Democratic Party’s major financial advantages: lower costs for political candidates who directly buy broadcast advertising time.

Under federal law, broadcasters must offer political candidates low advertising rates. But they are not required to give super PACs those same low rates. Super PACs often pay double, triple and even four times as much money for the same TV spots as do candidates.

In recent years, Democratic candidates have tended to vastly out-raise Republican candidates, who have been more reliant on the support of super PACs and national party committees, which can accept larger donations. In practice, that means Democratic candidates have been able to take advantage of these lower ad rates more often than Republicans.

A ruling in the case is expected by July. If the court decides to allow unlimited spending by the parties in coordination with the candidates, party committees will suddenly also be guaranteed those cheaper rates — an outcome that campaign finance experts say would probably especially benefit Republicans and potentially save the G.O.P. tens of millions of dollars next fall.

While an individual donor can give only $3,500 to a candidate during an election cycle, a donor can give up to $44,300 to a national party committee’s general fund each year and hundreds of thousands more to specialty accounts. If the Supreme Court lifts limits on party committees to coordinate with candidates, the parties could use the large contributions they raise from wealthy donors to pay for low ad rates.

The ad price disparity is so big that Republicans have been testing various other ways to skirt the existing law while this challenge has been winding its way through the courts.

In 2026, the committees of both national parties that are focused on the House and Senate races will probably be financially closely matched. But the Republican National Committee itself has an edge over the Democratic National Committee, with far more cash on hand, about $91 million. The D.N.C. recently had only $18 million on hand after taking out a $15 million loan.

Democrats would probably make it a huge priority to raise money for the party committees should Republicans win at the court, potentially making a G.O.P. advantage short-lived.

The dispute before the Supreme Court began on Nov. 4, 2022, when national Republican leaders and two Ohio political candidates, including Vice President JD Vance, who was then running for the Senate, sued the Federal Election Commission.

The challengers argued that federal campaign finance laws unfairly limited political party committees “from doing what the First Amendment entitles them to do: fully associate with and advocate for their own candidates for federal office.”

The commission regularly updates limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for each election cycle. According to court documents in the case, in the 2021-22 election cycle, the National Republican Senatorial Committee spent roughly $15.5 million on coordinated party expenditures with Republican Senate nominees, and the National Republican Congressional Committee spent roughly $8.3 million on coordinated party expenditures with Republican House nominees. These expenditures primarily funded political advertising.

Such spending limits between party committees and candidates were established in 1974 in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and had been previously upheld by the Supreme Court in 2001 in a case brought by Colorado Republicans.

In that case, the justices found in a 5-to-4 decision that limits on spending were necessary. Eliminating the limits, the majority concluded, could allow wealthy donors to circumvent federal limits on contributions to individual candidates.

The limits are strict — a total of $7,000 for a federal candidate every two years. Super PACs, however, face no limits at all so long as they advertise independently of the candidates they are supporting.

The case now before the Supreme Court was previously heard by a panel of 16 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, a process called en banc review.

The challengers argued that the law and facts on the ground had changed since the Supreme Court’s 2001 decision, making it no longer binding on lower courts. They pointed to subsequent decisions by the Supreme Court tightening free-speech restrictions on campaign finance regulations.

In September 2024, the divided federal appeals court rejected that argument and upheld the legality of the regulation. In an opinion written by Jeffrey S. Sutton, the chief judge of the circuit and an appointee of President George W. Bush, the court held that “the key reality” was that “the Supreme Court has not overruled the 2001 Colorado decision.”

Judge Sutton noted that the court’s more recent rulings in other cases suggested a view that limiting money in politics violated the First Amendment, but said that lower courts did not have the authority to overrule Supreme Court precedent.

“A political party exists to get its candidates elected,” lawyers for the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote in a brief asking the justices to weigh in, adding that “Congress has severely restricted how much parties can spend on their own campaign advertising if done in cooperation with those very candidates.”

The Biden administration had defended the regulation in court. But by the time the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, President Trump had been re-elected. The Trump administration flipped sides and refused to defend the campaign spending limits. At that point, the court appointed a veteran Supreme Court litigator, Roman Martinez, to argue on behalf of the current law. The justices will also hear from lawyers for Democratic organizations, who intervened in the case and support the finance limits.

In a brief, lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and other groups argued that the case was not about the First Amendment but instead about “whether the Constitution guarantees parties an unlimited right — unique among political bodies — to subsidize the campaign expenses of federal candidates.” They added, “It does not.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/multimedia/09trump-news-promo2/09trump-news-promo2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:27.490148

The Trump administration used the Alien Enemies Act to proceed with deportation flights despite that directive, prompting scrutiny of former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni, who alleges officials discussed ignoring court orders, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign, who reportedly conveyed the judge’s instructions.

The decision marks the latest development in a long-running legal clash over the government’s use of a rarely deployed wartime statute and the subsequent handling of migrant flights to El Salvador.

Why It Matters

At the center of the escalating court fight is a fundamental test of presidential power and judicial authority: whether the Trump administration can invoke a centuries-old wartime statute to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants—and whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defied a federal judge’s order to stop those removals.

The outcome will determine not only the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for immigration enforcement but also the limits of due-process protections for people on U.S. soil and the courts’ ability to enforce their directives in real time.

What To Know

Origins of the Legal Challenge

The underlying litigation stems from a class-action complaint filed in March 2025 on behalf of Venezuelan detainees who argued that the administration’s planned removals were unlawful under the Alien Enemies Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and constitutional due-process protections.

The filing alleged that the administration intended to use a forthcoming presidential proclamation to authorize ""immediate"" removals without judicial review, relying on a theory that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constituted a ""foreign nation or government"" engaged in an ""invasion or predatory incursion.""

U.S. District Chief Judge James E. Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order the evening of March 15, 2025, barring the removal of the named plaintiffs for 14 days.

Disputed Flights and the Court’s Growing Concerns

Later filings revealed that two planes carrying Venezuelan detainees nevertheless landed in El Salvador.

The court subsequently initiated inquiries into whether that outcome violated its directive.

In a December 8, 2025 order, Judge Boasberg wrote that Secretary Noem had submitted a declaration stating she made ""the decision to continue the transfer of custody of the Alien Enemies Act detainees who had been removed from the United States before this Court issued its temporary restraining order in the evening of March 15, 2025.""

To establish a fuller factual record, Boasberg ordered that plaintiffs ""attempt to secure the presence of Erez Reuveni for testimony on December 15, 2025,"" and required the government to ""produce Drew Ensign for testimony on December 16, 2025.""

The judge found the declaration insufficient to determine whether Noem’s decision constituted a willful violation.

Because criminal contempt requires a showing that the order was ""clear and reasonably specific,"" that ""the defendant violated the order,"" and that ""the violation was willful,"" he wrote that ""the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt.""

Testimony That Could Define the Court’s Contempt Ruling

Reuveni is a former Justice Department attorney who has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging internal discussions about possibly disregarding judicial orders—allegations the administration denies.

Ensign, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, previously helped convey Boasberg’s oral and written orders to the Department of Homeland Security.

Boasberg described Noem’s filing as ""too ‘cursory’ to establish probable cause for criminal contempt"" and stated that further witness examination is necessary ""to clarify the decision-making around the flights to El Salvador before determining whether a contempt referral is warranted.""

Government attorneys have previously argued that the planes in question had already departed U.S. airspace before the restraining order was signed and that the migrants aboard them had therefore already been ""removed.""

As a result, they contend, the flights did not violate the order’s prohibition on removing ""any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days.""

The contempt inquiry runs parallel to the broader litigation over the legality of the Alien Enemies Act proclamation.

The complaint asserts that the Act can be invoked only during a declared war or an invasion by a foreign nation and argues that the administration’s application—focused on a transnational criminal group—was ultra vires [someone in power did something they had no legal authority to do].

That group was Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan-origin criminal organization that the administration attempted to treat as if it were a foreign government for purposes of invoking the Alien Enemies Act.

It further contends that the expedited removal process denied asylum rights, statutory protections under the Convention Against Torture, and due-process guarantees.

Judge Boasberg’s upcoming hearings are expected to clarify the administration’s internal communications and decision-making in the hours surrounding the restraining order.

Only after hearing from Reuveni and Ensign, he wrote, will the court determine whether the circumstances warrant a criminal contempt referral.

As the case proceeds, it continues to test the limits of executive immigration authority, the reach of wartime statutes, and the ability of federal courts to enforce emergency orders during fast-moving enforcement actions.

What People Are Saying

Kristi Noem on what should happen to the deported migrants in CECOT, said: ""We’re confident that people imprisoned there should be there…They should stay there for the rest of their lives.""

Emil Bove, DOJ, as quoted by whistleblower Erez Reuveni, allegedly told DOJ lawyers that ""the planes need to take off no matter what.""

What Happens Next

The court will now hear testimony from former DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign so Judge James Boasberg can determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem willfully violated his March 15 order halting migrant removals.

Only after evaluating their accounts and the surrounding decision-making will he decide whether a criminal-contempt referral is warranted, while the broader lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act continues on a separate track and may prompt additional injunctions or disclosures as the court works to prevent further removals during the litigation.",https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2247182200.jpg?w=1200crop=1,N,,2025-12-09 10:59:08.300748
,Policy,2025-12-09 14:08:18+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,"Democrats look to Miami mayoral race as litmus test on Trump economy, immigration policies",Cristian  Benavides,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/miami-mayor-race-eileen-higgins-emilio-gonzalez/,"The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.
Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years.
The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.
Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.
""They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,"" he said.","It's been more than 30 years since Miami last elected a Democrat to serve as mayor, but the party feels this might be its best shot to reclaim victory in decades, as its candidate said a win would be a referendum on President Trump's immigration policy.

""What I will tell our congressional delegation and every person serving in Congress and the Senate is this immigration, these tactics, they're not only cruel, I grew up Catholic, I think they're also sinful,"" Eileen Higgins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said.

Higgins, a county commissioner, is facing a runoff election against Republican hopeful Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager, Miami-Dade County commissioner and director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under former President George W. Bush.

""My opponent would like this to be a referendum on the president,"" said Gonzalez, who has been endorsed by Mr. Trump. ""I want our voters to make this a referendum on me.""

While the race is technically a nonpartisan election, national Democrats have deployed resources for Higgins, including an endorsement video by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, a visit from Arizona's Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego and a canvassing event with former Chicago Mayor and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emmanuel.

Higgins came in first in the Nov. 4 election with 36% of the vote, followed by Gonzalez's 19% — but since neither candidate reached 50% in a 13-person field, a runoff election between the top two candidates is set for Tuesday. Adding to the Democratic Party's optimism is early voting data, which shows Democrats outpacing Republicans by about 8%.

Florida Republicans have sought to downplay the significance of Tuesday's election. The state party chair pointed to the fact that Kamala Harris won the city of Miami by 1 percentage point in 2024.

Yet a win for Democrats in Florida, Mr. Trump's adopted home state, and in the city that is set to become the site for his presidential library, would be a reversal in fortune for Republicans.

Mr. Trump handily won the state in 2024 by more than 13%. Miami-Dade County, where the city of Miami is located, voted for a Republican governor in 2022 for the first time in 20 years. Statewide, Republicans have a 10-point registration lead over Democrats.

""She's certainly running a lot of high-energy efforts on the ground there, bringing in a big coalition, bringing in all types of folks to support her. I certainly think she has a great shot,"" said Ken Martin, the Democratic National Committee Chair. ""Will be a big, big win if we win that.""

The last time the city of Miami elected a Democrat as Mayor was in 1993, after a 1997 Democratic win was tossed out amid legal challenges.

Mr. Trump again weighed in on the race Monday with a post on his social media platform Truth Social: ""Miami's Mayor Race is Tuesday. It is a big and important race!!! Vote for Republican Gonzalez. He is FANTASTIC! You can also vote today. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

The city of Miami has a population that is 57% foreign-born, according to the 2024 U.S. Census, and about half are naturalized U.S. Citizens who would be eligible to vote in the election. While Hispanic voters nationally trend toward the Democratic Party, in South Florida, Republicans have found a stronghold among Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan exiles who fled communist and socialist governments.

However, Mr. Trump's immigration policy has come to something of a flashpoint in Florida. In addition to state troopers carrying out increased immigration enforcement, the Sunshine State is also home to the controversial ""Alligator Alcatraz"" detention center. The recent end of Temporary Protected Status for over 250,000 Venezuelans could also have considerable repercussions in a state with a large population of immigrants from the South American country, many of whom have been living in the U.S. for years and are deeply integrated in the local economy.

""It is ruining our economy,"" said Higgins. ""Sure, get the criminals out of here, but find a path to citizenship for people who deserve it and for an economy that needs it.""

Mr. Gonzalez said Higgins' focus on immigration is a sign that she is focused on national, not local issues.

""They want to talk about things that have nothing to do with the city of Miami,"" he said. ""Why pick a fight about national immigration policy? Next, we are going to be talking about whether men should be in women's sports.""

Higgins vowed to work with the Trump administration on issues where they can find common ground if she is elected, but warned, ""When we disagree, I'll make my voice heard.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/09/01e72041-1aac-4b36-be3b-a81c677ff725/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e7b219ec368a3360b10698ed8a61db68/ap25342783681919.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:35.126175

But that may be little more than bluster in the eyes of the Trump administration.

Deep in the spending package that ended the 43-day government shutdown, Congress inserted a few lines forbidding USDA from using appropriated funds to close or consolidate research facilities — a provision aimed mainly at the department’s 6,000-acre flagship Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland — without approval from the House and Senate Appropriations committees.

That’s an old trick that sends a message but doesn’t have much legal bite if the administration chooses to ignore it, according to experts in constitutional law.

One of the best-placed skeptics is the USDA official running the reorganization: Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden, who as the department’s top lawyer during the first Trump administration declared similar measures unconstitutional.

The issue then was the administration’s relocation of USDA’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture from Washington to Kansas City, which the department pursued unilaterally.

Congress can’t legally require USDA to secure approval of congressional committees to relocate offices or agencies, Vaden said at the time, since just one committee could theoretically block executive agencies from exercising an authority officials clearly have.

“USDA is not required to abide by unconstitutional laws,” Vaden said in a written response to a USDA inspector general’s report on the matter.

“Therefore,” Vaden wrote, “the Department declines OIG’s recommendation to ignore Supreme Court, Office of Legal Counsel, and Government Accountability Office precedent and seek congressional committee approval of the relocations.”

At issue is a Supreme Court ruling in INS v. Chada, a 1983 case in which the justices ruled against the “legislative veto.” While the details are different — in that case, one house of Congress vetoed an executive action related to immigration — requiring agencies to obtain the permission of committees rings similar in some legal experts’ view.

“Presidents of both parties have argued that this type of oversight is unconstitutional,” said Michael Berry, an associate professor of political science at the University of Colorado, Denver, who has written on the subject.

From 1985 to 2010, Congress passed nearly 800 statutes requiring committee approval — up from 150 in the years before the Chada ruling, he said.

“Although such statutes often require approval from committees of both chambers, this type of oversight seems to violate the Constitution’s bicameralism and presidential presentment requirements, which were the central pillars of the Chadha ruling,” Berry said.

On the other hand, the idea’s never been directly tested, said Soren Dayton, director of American governance policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

“It’s a surprisingly complicated question,” Dayton said.

Political pressure

In the case of the two relocated research agencies — the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture — USDA under then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue moved swiftly enough that the relocation was locked in before Congress could meaningfully weigh in. And Republicans supported the move.

While the legal lines around congressional approval may be blurry, Dayton said, the real question comes down to political will: What’s the risk in the administration starting the gradual shutdown at Beltsville anyway, a process the agency has said will take several years?

The Beltsville closure is part of a broader reorganization the department is planning — and to the extent USDA needs money from Congress to pay for it, lawmakers have some control, Dayton said.

Officials at USDA say the facility has fallen into disrepair over the years and isn’t the stellar lab it once was, an argument for moving its work to other places.

“While BARC once used to be a state-of-the-art research facility, it is no longer worth the cost to bring it into the 21st century,” USDA said in a statement through a spokesperson.

The department added, “USDA would need $500 million to fully modernize BARC to improve the facility and an additional $40 million a year in maintenance to sustain operations. This is not a wise use of taxpayer dollars when there are other USDA laboratories across the country with the capacity to house the research being conducted here.”

‘Will of Congress’

Republicans in Congress largely support the reorganization, in part because it could mean more USDA jobs in their states or districts as employees are moved out of the national capital region.

USDA has shown some willingness to test the boundaries with appropriators this year, including blocking or rescinding grants and taking tens of millions of dollars away from certain Forest Service programs in the middle of the fiscal year to compensate employees who took deferred resignation offers, generating little complaint from Republican lawmakers.

However, ignoring congressional directives to obtain permission may be more confrontational than the administration wants to be, especially when both chambers are run by the president’s party.

Usually, departments abide by the language even though it’s legally questionable, said a former congressional appropriations aide who lobbies on related issues and requested anonymity to discuss them openly.

“We’d do it, knowing it’s not legal,” said the former aide.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) — who helped shepherd the provision into the final fiscal 2026 Agriculture-FDA bill — will continue to defend the Beltsville lab, his office said. The senator, joined by fellow Maryland Demoratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, also secured $6 million to modernize buildings there.

“BARC’s research helps farmers across our country put food on the table for millions of Americans,” Van Hollen said in statement.

He added: “The Senate on a bipartisan basis has made it clear that the Administration’s attempts to shutter BARC are not in line with the will of Congress. This is not only clear in the report language we secured, but also in the funds we included to modernize BARC’s facilities. We will continue working to support and protect the critical work being done by BARC.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/90/67/a1835023455abaeb4fb394ba21bb/agriculture-department-threats.JPEG,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:38.053283

In South Florida, thousands fleeing socialist tyrannies did it the right way: applied legally, passed background checks, waited their turn.
Their nickname encapsulates their position as an inflexible and strident trio, whose collaboration illustrates the president’s influence on South Florida politics.
The Trump administration has canceled humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, many of them residents of Miami-Dade, to live and work legally in the country.
Salazar “has nothing to lose because in her district she has no one against her,” even if Trump reacts and decides to push a Republican opposition candidate.","Florida Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar has broken ranks with Cuban-American Republican lawmakers in Miami, calling the Trump administration’s decision to pause all immigration processes for citizens of 19 countries, including Cubans, Venezuelans and Haitians, “unfair” and “un-American.” The U.S. president announced the measure after two National Guard members were shot by an Afghan migrant in Washington D.C. before Thanksgiving.

“The United States doesn’t believe in collective punishment. We don’t punish the innocent for the sins of the guilty. Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process. That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for,” Salazar said in a statement sent to EL PAÍS.

“Background checks already exist to stop terrorists, and they should. In South Florida, thousands fleeing socialist tyrannies did it the right way: applied legally, passed background checks, waited their turn. Many of them ready to vote for democracy and freedom!” the congresswoman added.

Her statements contrast with those made by her fellow Cuban-American Republican congressmembers from Miami, Carlos Giménez and Mario Díaz-Balart, who held a separate press conference last Wednesday and said that the measure announced by the Trump administration was a consequence of the “reckless abandonment of border security” by the administration of former Democratic president Joe Biden.

For years, the three Cuban-American lawmakers have presented themselves as a cohesive political bloc, demanding a hard line against totalitarian regimes, applauding sanctions, and defending controversial measures in the public eye. In recent months, they have displayed almost monolithic unity in support of Trump and his agenda, to the point of being dubbed “the three crazy Cubans” by the president’s allies.

Their nickname encapsulates their position as an inflexible and strident trio, whose collaboration illustrates the president’s influence on South Florida politics. Last year, they joined forces to lobby the administration over an agreement that would have allowed Chevron to operate in Venezuela, a license that was subsequently not renewed. They have also publicly endorsed the president’s immigration policy, blaming the Biden administration for the migration crisis and portraying Trump’s measures as necessary for security, in line with the national Republican narrative.

A strategic shift

Salazar’s change of heart comes amid growing unrest in South Florida over the president’s immigration offensive, which has hit communities that supported him and helped turn Miami-Dade County — a Democratic stronghold for decades — Republican in the last presidential election.

The Trump administration has canceled humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, many of them residents of Miami-Dade, to live and work legally in the country. It has also intensified operations to arrest migrants at workplaces, on highways, and in immigration courts, separating thousands of families and creating a climate of fear in these communities.

This climate has been politically exploited. The three legislators have been criticized by Democrats in advertising campaigns with billboards that have appeared on major Miami freeways, calling them “traitors” for their support of Trump’s immigration policies.

According to analysts, Salazar is adjusting her political strategy ahead of next year’s elections, aware that her district — Miami-Dade’s 27th, with 70% Hispanic voters and 20% immigrants — is particularly volatile and sensitive to the effects of Trump’s immigration policies. Experts believe this shift could strategically position her as a voice of reason within an increasingly polarized party, while also sending a clear message that immigration is a deeply personal reality in South Florida.

“Salazar is very vulnerable in her district, which is neither homogeneous nor historically Republican, but rather has a very particular and diverse demographic, with African-Americans, Haitians and Hispanics. Even a small shift among Hispanics could cause her to lose that district,” notes Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of Political Science at Florida International University (FIU). The congresswoman “is seeing in the polls that there is a negative reaction among Hispanics,” he adds.

Gamarra led a study in May on the sentiment among Venezuelans after the end of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and the humanitarian parole program, where 43% of those surveyed said that Miami-Dade’s representatives in Congress — Díaz-Balart, Salazar and Giménez — had not adequately defended the Venezuelan diaspora on immigration matters.

“She won’t be able to win reelection with Trump and the Republicans’ policies, especially with this new hardening that has basically frozen all applications, from marriages to naturalization ceremonies. She has to move away from that hardline position,” Gamarra says. “She knows, given the demographics of her district, that she has to react, because otherwise they’re going to elect a Democrat.”

Dr. Andrew Seele, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said that “the more indiscriminate the policies are on immigration enforcement, the more likely they are to touch on people who are American voters.”

According to Guillermo Grenier, a sociology professor at FIU, Salazar’s decision is more personal. “Salazar has been uncomfortable with the immigration situation for some time, and this time she said, ‘Enough is enough.’ She’s reading the same polls as everyone else, which indicate that Trump is overstepping his bounds, and on a personal level, she saw that her position had to change,” he says.

Salazar “has nothing to lose because in her district she has no one against her,” even if Trump reacts and decides to push a Republican opposition candidate. “Her position in the party as one of the three ‘Crazy Cubans’ — now the least ‘crazy’ of the three — is firmly established, and she’s saying something that most people — Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians, whoever — are thinking: that Trump has been overstepping his bounds legally, that is, he’s gone beyond what the law allows. What she’s said is, in fact, what the polls show and what people are talking about: that what’s happening is dangerous,” he adds.

Grenier believes the congresswoman has made “a very politically sensible decision, because she is distancing herself from Trump’s arguments that have a negative impact on Miami-Dade,” without directly pointing the finger at anyone.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/NH2UF63NJNCKPORUBZ4IEY6A3A.jpg?auth=5038368523e4a33aacbb2711119617214a0f8d38f41d62f5e27b44f26d7bf062&width=1200,N,,2025-12-09 10:58:43.178154

“I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.” On other fronts, too, there are efforts to draw lines related to immigration enforcement.","The table of immigration-related bills in the Hawaiʻi Legislature’s next session was at least partially set Monday, as advocates described measures they want to see introduced and painted a picture of legal rights being trampled under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Among the bills that died last session that advocates will be pushing for again is one to address ICE’s ability to conduct enforcement actions in what have been dubbed “sensitive places,” such as schools, hospitals and churches.

“It’s not that we can keep the feds from coming in anywhere that they want to if they followed the proper procedure,” said Liza Ryan Gill, co-coordinator of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights. “But we can set protocols on making sure that they follow the proper procedure. So you can’t just bust in if you didn’t get your warrant signed by a judge.”

Another would prohibit local law enforcement officers from being deputized as immigration agents through agreements with the federal government. Under those 287(g) agreements — there are now about 1,200 nationwide, up from 135 in January — police officers can perform immigration-related enforcement such as questioning immigrants in custody about their immigration status, and arresting and turning them over to ICE.

The police departments in all four Hawaiʻi counties already have agreements with federal agencies including Homeland Security Investigations, a division of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE. But police officials have said those agreements enable officers to take part in law enforcement operations aimed at transnational crimes such as drug or human trafficking— and that they do not allow officers to join in immigration enforcement. Critics say the agreements are a slippery slope that make that all too possible.

The hearing at the state Senate Judiciary Committee was called by Sen. Karl Rhoads, the only lawmaker in attendance. He offered the advocates a friendly forum. In the 2025 legislative session, Rhoads introduced a bill to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from collaborating with the federal government for immigration purposes except in limited cases. It died at the committee level before getting a vote.

A former lawyer, he opened Monday’s meeting by saying some of the administration’s enforcement policies and actions “appear to me to be of dubious legality.”

More Than Just Criminals

The hearing was partly an opportunity to correct narratives that undocumented immigrants are all criminals who hurt the economy, said longtime Hawaiʻi civil rights activist Amy Agbayani. “Data do not support that,” she said, adding that one in five state ​​residents is foreign-born.

The Trump administration, while claiming to be going after hardened criminals, has targeted many others, including immigrants with legal residency status and people who turned out to be U.S. citizens, she and other advocates said.

ICE officers arrested 153 people in Hawaiʻi between January and July — a 273% increase from the same period in 2024, when there were 41 arrests, said Bettina Mok, executive director of The Legal Clinic, a nonprofit that provides legal, education and advocacy services to immigrants.

But 67% of people held by ICE at the federal detention center near the Honolulu airport have no criminal record, and “very few” have been charged with a violent crime, Mok said.

Rhoads returned repeatedly to the question of whether ICE has been violating constitutionally guaranteed due process rights during arrests.

He expressed disbelief when Mok described the case of a young man from Central America who was in Florida on a student visa and was arrested for speeding. He was turned over to ICE after police found out he was not actively enrolled in college, Mok said, and was transferred six or seven times among federal detention facilities before ending up in Hawaiʻi’s.

The student, Mok said, had never been told what he was being detained for.

“The lawyer in me is just like, ‘What?’” Rhoads said.

At another point, Rhoads asked for advocates to ignore his law degree and explain due process.

“Does that apply to everybody or is that just U.S. citizens? If you get picked up for whatever reasons do you always have the right to some sort of due process?”

“It should apply to everyone but what we have seen is that the same rights that should be afforded are not being given to immigrants or detained individuals,” said Stephanie Haro Sevilla, a fellow and immigrant advocate at the Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Hawaiʻi law school.

‘You’re Not Immune’

After the hearing, Rhoads told Civil Beat that he was concerned a lot of people “see the stuff on TV from the continent and they think, ‘Well, that doesn’t have anything to do with us here in Hawaii.’ And that’s not true. I want people to know that this kind of stuff is happening here, and that if there’s no due process, you’re not immune to it either.”

Gill of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights said based on preliminary discussions with legislators, she is confident the bills she and allies are backing — including one that would clarify the criteria under which immigrants who are crime victims can become eligible for residency — will get a hearing in the next session.

What happens next, she said, is up to legislators who should know by now that the president sees very few limits to his authority.

“I’m sympathetic to the idea that under the first Trump administration, it’s like, ‘OK, well if we don’t cross this particular line, then maybe X, Y, or Z won’t happen,’” Gill said. “What is so different about this, the second administration, is that none of that holds water anymore.”

It’s hard to forecast the prospects for immigration-related bills in the upcoming session, Rhoads said.

“There’s a big divide in the Legislature,” he said.

There are lawmakers who believe “laying low” is the best way to get through the Trump era, Rhoads said. “I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.”

Response

It may be helpful to explain that under current constitutional arrangements in the United Kingdom (UK), asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office. This includes the provision of asylum accommodation and support to people seeking asylum who would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application. It also includes decisions relating to UK immigration policy, including the application of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions and other restrictions or conditions applied to people seeking asylum, visa holders and anyone who requires permission to enter or remain in the UK but does not have it. The Scottish Government has no control of these processes.

People who have entered the UK irregularly and have not made an asylum application would be undocumented and would be subject to immigration control, and under reserved immigration legislation and rules they would subject to NRPF.

In the UK, the term person seeking asylum, or asylum seeker, refers to someone who has lodged an application for international protection under the United Nations (UN) 1951 Refugee Convention or Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and is waiting for a decision from the UK Government. An asylum application is therefore a process to determine whether someone is recognised as a refugee. The UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are present in the UK.

Asylum is the process by which someone applies to the UK Government to have their refugee status recognised.

1. How many illegal migrants have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

We do not hold any information on illegal immigrants that have been housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness or Stirling in the past 3 years. People who require permission to enter or remain in the UK are restricted from accessing local authority housing or homeless services.

This is a formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

2. How many asylum seekers have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. We do not hold information about the total number of people seeking asylum provided with accommodation by the UK Government over the past three years in Scotland or in the cities you have specified in your request.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

The UK Government regularly publishes statistical data online which may be of interest in relation to your request. To note, many of the data tables report the number of people at the end of a quarter, not cumulative totals, and therefore the total number of people in the asylum system over a certain time period may not be able to be calculated. Table Asy_D11 includes the number of people in receipt of asylum accommodation and/or support and is available in the quarterly immigration system statistics data tables on the UK Government website: Immigration system statistics data tables - GOV.UK.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website.

Regional and local authority data, including a breakdown for Scotland, is available here: Regional and local authority data on immigration groups - GOV.UK.

3. How many have gone unchecked/unvetted by Police Scotland in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government holds no information in relation to individuals known to have criminal convictions in their country of origin and also the nature of their crimes. No information is held with regards to recorded offences committed by those with no legal status since arriving in Scotland.

As such, I hereby provide you with formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the UK Government website for published information which may be relevant to your request: Statistics on foreign national offenders and the immigration system - GOV.UK.

4. How much of Scottish taxpayer's money is being used to house, feed, maintain the lives of each individual asylum seeker and/or illegal immigrant?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government does not hold information on how much taxpayers money is used for each individual asylum seeker/illegal migrant.

The taxpayer cost is likely to vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual needs and eligibility of the individual and any time spent in the UK asylum system. As explained above, people seeking asylum and undocumented migrants (people who require leave to enter or remain in the UK but do not have it) are subject to No Recourse to Public Funds, this means that they cannot access certain public funds as defined under the UK Immigration Rules. This includes restriction from accessing local authority housing, most mainstream benefits like Universal Credit and emergency crisis payments from the Scottish Welfare Fund.

People seeking asylum may be provided with asylum accommodation and/or financial support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application from the UK Government. As provision of asylum accommodation and support is reserved, the Scottish Government does not hold information relating to the cost of this provision.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the following link which sets out the Scottish Governments spending and tax plans for the year ahead: Scottish Budget 2025 to 2026 - gov.scot.

5. Were there public consultations with the people of Scotland to ask our permission to house them here? If so, please provide dates, locations of these meetings, minutes of these meetings including the voting ratio results of the public poll at these meetings.

As explained, the UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are in the UK. This is because the UK is a founding signatory to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. The 1951 Convention was the culmination of international cooperation to assemble a set of guidelines, laws and conventions aimed at protecting everyone’s basic human rights and the treatment of people forced to flee conflict and persecution, following significant displacement during the first and second world wars in Europe. More information about the 1951 Convention can be found on the UNHCR website: The 1951 Refugee Convention | UNHCR UK.

The UK operates an asylum application system to determine whether people who have presented to the UK Government to be recognised as a refugee meet the definition of a refugee as set out in the 1951 Convention or require protection under any other relevant legislation or conventions to which the UK is a signatory. People seeking asylum can apply to the Home Secretary for asylum accommodation and/or support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application.

The UK Government is responsible for UK asylum policy, legislation and rules. The Scottish Government does not hold information about whether any public consultations were undertaken by UK Governments since the 1951 Refugee Convention was signed. This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

It may be helpful to note that the dispersal of people seeking asylum to accommodation across the UK was introduced under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. For over two decades Glasgow was the only Scottish local authority to participate in dispersal, however in 2022 the UK Government introduced full dispersal policy which presumed asylum accommodation could be procured in any local authority across the UK, rather than only in those local authorities which had voluntarily agreed to participate.

Additionally, as asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office, you may wish to contact the Home Office at foirequests@homeoffice.gov.uk to find out whether there is further information which they would be able to provide in relation to your request.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website: Home Office - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)

Arrested immigrants sue Trump administration

What we know:

Since the immigration enforcement operation started on Dec. 1, the Trump administration said it has arrested some of ""the worst of the worst,"" a phrase it has used to describe those in the country illegally, with criminal histories.

According to federal court filings, 11 immigrants have sued the administration in federal court in Minnesota in December. Four of the lawsuits were filed by immigrants who were arrested since the ongoing enforcement operation launched.

Nearly all are challenging their detention, and at least three of them face deportation. Some said they are seeking asylum or are eligible for it. Another said he has a pending visa application. And another said he is in the country legally and is eligible for naturalization.

Abdul Dahir Ibrahim, who came to the United States from Somalia in 1995 and now lives in Shakopee, was ordered removed in 2004. He was arrested on Nov. 29, shortly before the immigration operation started.

In a social media post announcing his arrest, Homeland Security officials said he was ordered deported after asylum and fraud convictions in Canada.

The agency also included photos of Ibrahim with several Minnesota Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, among others. The connection between Ibrahim and the elected leaders beyond the photographs is not clear.

According to court records, Ibrahim was granted and then lost his immigration status and is awaiting a hearing on his most recent application to renew that status. Until then, he is subject to deportation, the records said.

Another man, Mahamed Cabdilaahi Awaale, immigrated to the United States from Somalia in 2022 after a member of his wife’s tribe stabbed him and killed his mother, court records said. He is seeking asylum.

Weiser’s office dropped its lawsuit against Zwinck after he resigned from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.
“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities.
The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).","Last week, Mesa County filed a motion in federal court arguing that by preventing local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal law enforcement, the laws make it impossible for local law enforcement to conduct drug task force activities because the federal government maintains the national databases used in drug enforcement.

“As part of their law enforcement duties wholly unrelated to federal immigration enforcement, Plaintiffs regularly obtain and transmit information that is used to identify an individual for purposes of legitimate state and local law enforcement functions,” the document stated.

On Aug. 7, Mesa County filed a lawsuit in federal court against Polis and Weiser alleging a series of laws passed between 2021 and 2025 pertaining to disclosing personal information for the purposes federal immigration enforcement known as “Article 74” conflict with federal law and are unconstitutionally vague or otherwise unenforceable.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction against enforcing the Article 74 laws until they can be clarified.

Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell, Undersheriff Matt King and Captain Curtis Brammer are named as plaintiffs in the suit in their individual capacities.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a lawsuit from Weiser’s office against former Sheriff’s deputy Alexander Zwinck, which alleged Zwinck had violated Article 74 by providing information to federal immigration enforcement during a traffic stop that led to the detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of a college student from Utah who had lived in the United States for 12 years and had no criminal history.

On June 5, Zwinck stopped Caroline Dias Goncalves near Loma for following a semi-trailer too closely, according to body camera footage of the stop.

Zwinck shared a picture of Dias Goncalves’ driver’s license with a group chat called “GJ Highway Hitters” that included federal immigration enforcement, according to an investigation into the stop. After letting Dias Goncalves off with a warning, he provided the chat with a description of her vehicle and direction of travel.

Dias Goncalves was born in Brazil and moved to Utah at age seven. She has no criminal history but had a visa issue, according to an investigation into the stop.

In a statement, Rowell apologized to Dias Goncalves for his office’s role in the incident.

An administrative investigation by the Sheriff’s Office found that Zwinck had violated several Sheriff’s Office policies and Article 74 laws, and the deputy was disciplined with three weeks of unpaid leave. He later resigned from the Sheriff’s Office.

Weiser’s office dropped its lawsuit against Zwinck after he resigned from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.

The county’s lawsuit against Polis and Weiser continues, however.

Polis and Weiser filed a motion on Oct. 30 asking for the county’s lawsuit to be dismissed, saying the county’s case lacks standing, and that the laws in question are not so vague to be voided in a legal challenge, and do not conflict with federal law as claimed in the county’s initial complaint.

“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities. The remaining alleged harms involve speculation about hypothetical future enforcement actions. Emphasizing the lack of an actual case or controversy, Plaintiffs identify a list of hypothetical questions for which they seek advisory opinions. And all claims against the Governor are barred by sovereign immunity,” the motion to dismiss stated.

In a response filed Dec. 4, the county argued the lawsuit should not be dismissed, and should be allowed to proceed on its merits so the laws can be clarified.

“As drafted, the new law is both indefinite and vague, making it impossible for Plaintiffs to do their jobs,” the county’s response stated. “This flaw is especially important because Article 74 punishes those who ‘intentionally’ violate its provisions with a fine of up to $50,000.”

The response stated the laws punish actions local law enforcement officers take in the course of their regular duties not related to immigration enforcement, and gave the lawsuit against Zwinck as an example.

“Simply stated, Plaintiffs contend that performance of their duties could subject them to prosecution similar to the enforcement actions Defendants have already taken,” the response stated.

The response also said the enforcement of Article 74 laws has been arbitrary, as Weiser’s office sued Zwinck but not other officers who engaged in similar conduct. The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

The county’s filing stated, “as employees within Article 74’s scope facing a similar threat of litigation and enforcement, and with no other mechanism available to them to avoid prosecution, Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to obtain clarity and finality as to what conduct is or is not prohibited under the statutes, and whether they even pass constitutional muster.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/7d/c7d90487-e4cb-48d9-b002-dfaec67860a3/68ae1a61e5a89.image.jpg?crop=1344%2C706%2C0%2C194&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-09 06:57:20.817492

We began this year uncertain about what exactly would unfold, but certain of two things: the unparalleled power of the American people and the Democracy Forward community’s commitment to doing whatever it takes to harness that power to fight autocratic threats. As the Trump-Vance administration trampled on Constitutional rights, dismantled core protections, deployed the military in our communities, oversaw raids, and made it harder for Americans to make ends meet, the American people have met the moment. And, because of you, we have too.

When the president threatened lawyers and law firms, our Democracy Forward community was strong, ensuring that the American people are able to access the courts, represented by exceptional lawyers who are winning court orders at historic rates. We have been able to mount scaled responses to the Trump-Vance administration’s federal attacks — filing hundreds of legal actions and winning — while also continuing our mission-critical work in states and communities across the nation.

“In the United States there is no king.” These words appeared in the lawsuit we filed in the early weeks of this administration, challenging the president’s mission to rewrite history and stamp out free speech. The call has been repeated across the nation as millions have mobilized in the largest peaceful protests in U.S. history, determined to defend our rights. As powerful institutions have stepped back, the people have stepped forward. And, with your support, the people of this nation have been able to make their case heard both in the court of law and in the court of public opinion.

These pages provide a mere glimpse of the wins that you have supported and the impact our work has had for the American people this past year. They also show how we have used momentary setbacks to push forward, and how we are working to transform this historic crisis in our nation as a catalyst for generational change.

Uncertainty is still with us. But our work this year has made us all the more certain that the people can — and will — prevail. Courage is now the new currency — you have shown us that with your support.

We are made for this moment and we are ready for what’s next. We are so grateful to have you with us.

Bruna Ferreira, a longtime resident of Massachusetts, received a $1,500 bond on Monday from an immigration judge at a Louisiana detention centre. Ferreira was arrested by ICE agents last month while driving to pick up her 11-year-old son in New Hampshire. She was previously engaged to Leavitt’s brother, Michael.

Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said in a text message that “we argued that she wasn’t a danger or a flight risk,” and added: “The government stipulated to our argument and never once argued that she was a criminal illegal alien and waived appeal.”

The White House has sought to distance Leavitt from the case, saying in a statement that Ferreira had not spoken to the press secretary “in years”. Trump administration officials have not provided evidence for their claims about Ferreira’s history.

However, court filings, family photographs, and previous reporting indicate Ferreira lived with her son and shared custody with Michael Leavitt. In an interview with The Washington Post, Ferreira said she had chosen Karoline Leavitt to be her son’s godmother.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said in an email that Ferreira is a “criminal illegal alien” who had been detained for battery, an allegation Pomerleau denies. DHS also stated that Ferreira entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to leave the country in 1999.

“She will have periodic mandatory check-ins with ICE law enforcement to ensure she is abiding by the terms of her release,” the DHS spokesperson added.

A Trump administration official described Ferreira as an absentee parent who “has never lived with her son”. The official said the child has lived full-time with Michael Leavitt in New Hampshire since birth.

Ferreira said the White House’s characterisation of her as someone who had never lived with her child is “disgusting” and untrue.

According to the North Andover Eagle-Tribune, Ferreira and Michael Leavitt were engaged in 2014, when their son Mike Jr was eight months old.

Pomerleau disputes those accounts, insisting his client has shared custody. He said Ferreira came to the US as a toddler and later enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, which grants protection from deportation to people brought to the country without authorisation as children. According to him, the 33-year-old has maintained legal status under DACA and is now seeking a green card.

Efforts by former President Donald Trump to end DACA during his first term were blocked by the US Supreme Court.

Karoline Leavitt has declined to comment on the case. The current press secretary rose to prominence as Donald Trump’s spokeswoman during his 2024 campaign and now serves as a key member of the White House. She has become one of the leading defenders of the administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants and has publicly supported stricter ICE operations.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_690a5c3e0e6f-1762286654.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-09 05:58:17.431288

Apparent ICE Raid in Burnsville

What we know:

A woman who lives in the Burnsville home tells FOX 9 multiple Latino people who rent rooms were arrested by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities after being followed home from the store on Dec. 6.

A portion of the video shows one man being taken down in the driveway, and another woman running inside to her child.

We're told the four people taken into custody are now being held in immigration facilities out of state. That includes the parents of a seven-year-old boy.

What they're saying:

Former state senator and current congressional candidate Matt Little says he's troubled by what he saw in the video, and wants people to know their rights.

""They certainly have a right to a hearing, they certainly have a right to a lawyer, they have a right to contact the people in their lives who can help them out. You have all these rights, so make sure you are showing up and letting your neighbors know (that),"" said Little.

In the wake of the apparent raid, the city of Burnsville released a statement saying they are aware of the immigration enforcement operations happening in the city, and that their police department does not engage in enforcement and is not typically notified of their operations.

""ICE was here,"" reads the large sign that accompanies an empty manger outside St. Susanna Church in Dedham, Massachusetts, referring to immigration raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""The Holy Family is safe in The Sanctuary of our Church,"" the sign adds. ""If you see ICE, please call LUCE,"" referring to an immigrant assistance network in Massachusetts.

Reported last week by local and national media, the Nativity scene at St. Susanna's prompted strong online reactions. ICE acting director Tod Lyons told Fox News Digital that the scene was ""abhorrent"" and that it added to a ""dangerous narrative"" that he said has resulted in a 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers.

Hundreds of people from across the country also flooded the parish Facebook group page with angry comments while parishioners defended the provocative manger display.

""It sure seems like it's hard to have a conversation with people,"" Fr. Stephen Josoma, the pastor of St. Susanna Church, told National Catholic Reporter. Josoma said the parish office received numerous calls where people started cursing as soon as he picked up the phone.

""It's not a conversation,"" Josoma said. ""You say 'Have a nice day' and hang up. You can't do much more than that.""

Josoma spoke with NCR a day before a spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese said that the parish manger scene should be removed and the manger restored ""to its proper sacred purpose.""

""The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,"" Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said in response to NCR's inquiry.

Donilon said in an email that the Catholic Church's canonical norms ""prohibit the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God's people,"" adding that those objects include images of the Christ Child, which Donilon said ""are to be used solely to foster faith and devotion.""

Donilon added that St. Susanna Church ""neither requested nor received permission"" from the archdiocese to ""depart from this canonical norm or to place a politically divisive display outside the church.""

In a prepared statement provided Dec. 8 to NCR, Josoma and members of St. Susanna's parish council said they were waiting for ""an opportunity of dialogue and clarity"" with Boston Archbishop Richard Henning before reaching any final decisions regarding the Nativity scene.

They defended the parish Nativity as ""faithful to the Gospel and Catholic teaching"" and a ""prophetic reflection that challenges the faithful to find new paths to bring the Good News announced that first Christmas to all of God's people.""

They also pointed out that the Vatican itself displays different themed Nativity scenes each year highlighting social issues to contemporary life.

""Some of these have also been controversial (like one focused on the plight of refugees in 2016) all moving beyond static traditional figures and designed to evoke emotion and dialogue,"" the statement said, adding that it was the parish's hope to similarly evoke dialogue around an issue that is at the heart of contemporary life.

""That some do not agree with our message does not render our display sacrilegious or is the cause of any 'scandal' to the faithful,"" the statement said.

St. Susana Church is one of several churches that have changed their traditional Nativity displays this year to highlight immigration concerns. One church in Illinois depicts Roman soldiers wearing ICE vests, the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph donning gas masks and the Christ Child’s hands bound with zip ties.

In his interview with NCR, Josoma said the Gospel is clear about treating immigrants with respect. He noted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' recent ""special message"" where the bishops expressed their solidarity with migrants amid the federal government's immigration crackdown.

""And we've had the privilege of assisting 10 refugee families to resettle in the area since 2018,"" said Josoma, who added that those families originated from Burundi, Afghanistan, Honduras, Guatemala and Myanmar.

Josoma said that his parish's Pax Christi Peace and Justice Group has used the parish manger scene in previous years to also highlight issues pertaining to migration, gun violence and climate change.

""Every year we try to hold up a mirror to the world and say, 'If the Incarnation took place this year, what would that look like?'"" said Josoma, who added that the idea is to reflect the celebration of Christmas and the Incarnation with the reality of ""the world around us.""

""We've done this since 2016. It came out of our parish Pax Christi group. It really strikes at people and it gets the conversation going,"" Josoma said.

In 2018, St. Susanna Church also attracted national attention when its Nativity scene depicted the Christ Child in a cage and the three Wise Men behind a wall. The scene was designed to protest the first Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border, Josoma said.

That earlier controversial Nativity scene was cited by C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, in a prepared statement where he described this year's manger scene as ""another tawdry act of political grandstanding by a priest who believes that his parish church is his personal soapbox.""

Under its secretive deportation deal, the Albanese Government is attempting to permanently exile hundreds of people to Nauru on 30-year visas.
Frontline services report that at least 70% of their clients facing deportation to Nauru suffer from chronic health conditions, and approximately 90% live with a mental health condition.
Refugees previously sent to Nauru under Australia’s offshore processing regime received inadequate medical care and suffered violent attacks requiring urgent evacuation.
Prior to this, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees raised concerns that Australia’s deportation deal with Nauru is contrary to the Refugees Convention.","The High Court will today hear a challenge to the Albanese Government’s power to deport people to Nauru in TCXM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.

The Human Rights Law Centre has been granted leave to participate as amicus curiae (or ‘friend of the court’) to make submissions about the correct legal test that will apply in future to all deportations from Australia. We will argue that the government should not be able to deport people to a place where they would face death or serious harm.

Under its secretive deportation deal, the Albanese Government is attempting to permanently exile hundreds of people to Nauru on 30-year visas.

Many of the people facing deportation have life-threatening medical conditions that could not be treated in Nauru, including serious psychiatric conditions and physical disabilities. Frontline services report that at least 70% of their clients facing deportation to Nauru suffer from chronic health conditions, and approximately 90% live with a mental health condition.

In addition to medical neglect, people facing deportation to Nauru are at risk of violence and forcible return to the countries from which they fled – but there is currently no obligation on the Australian Government to consider these risks before deporting someone. Refugees previously sent to Nauru under Australia’s offshore processing regime received inadequate medical care and suffered violent attacks requiring urgent evacuation.

Two weeks ago, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre obtained a transcript from an interview with Nauruan President David Adeang that revealed that Nauru intends to return refugees to the countries from which they fled, a move that would breach international law. Prior to this, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees raised concerns that Australia’s deportation deal with Nauru is contrary to the Refugees Convention.

There have also been serious allegations of corruption by senior Nauruan officials resulting in a Senate inquiry into Australia’s offshore processing and resettlement arrangements that will report in June 2026.

Despite the ongoing investigations and legal challenge, the Albanese Government has already deported five people to Nauru.

Sanmati Verma, Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Deportation from Australia cannot be a death sentence.

“The Albanese Government knows that most of the people it is seeking to deport to Nauru have lifelong health conditions caused or exacerbated by the years they spent in indefinite immigration detention. It knows that refugees previously sent to Nauru have died from treatable conditions, because of a lack of basic medical care and disregard for the lives of refugees. That is why it has changed the law so it can avoid having to confront these consequences when deporting people.

“We must draw a line when it comes to the punishment of migrants and refugees – even, and especially, when our governments fail to.”

Simon Eccleshall, Head of Programs, Medecins Sans Frontieres, said:

“Australia’s policy of offshore processing is cruel, inhumane and degrading. It inflicts predictable, preventable suffering that violates basic human dignity and health. Offshore processing should be closed, not expanded.

“Based on our experience providing mental healthcare to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru in 2018, offshore processing and indefinite detention is directly responsible for severe mental health harm – including high rates of self-harm, suicide attempts and deep psychological trauma.

“Medecins Sans Frontiers calls for the immediate evacuation of asylum seekers and refugees from Nauru, and an end to offshore processing altogether – including the Government’s new tactics to deport people to Nauru on 30-year visas.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor, Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said:

“Australia outsourcing our obligations has become endemic.

“This without question, is a complex group of people, complexity that is underscored by chronic health conditions and a significant deterioration of mental health, many with illnesses that will never be remedied. The fact remains Australia knows that Nauru does not have the capacity to care for the people it intends to send there, if it did, it would not be costing the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars to establish the infrastructure, that won’t go towards even making a dent towards the level of care required.

We don’t have to wonder what might happen, our recent history shows us exactly what will happen, and it will be tragic.

“Today’s challenge will have implications beyond one man, it will set the standard of the level of harm and suffering we are prepared to accept at the cost of our actions.”

Ogy Simic, Head of Refugee Leadership, Advocacy and Communication, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said:

“This case is about far more than one person. It is about the way we look at human rights and it’s about the government’s bloody-minded determination to continue signing contracts that seemingly funnel taxpayer money to bikie gangs, multinational corporations and corrupt officials. This government is so determined to prop up its cruel and failed policies that it will do anything – including handing blank cheques to bad actors.”

“In the last few weeks alone we have seen that despite allegations that the Albanese Government knew about corruption at the highest levels in Nauru, and yet it still proceeded to sign a new 2.5-billion-dollar deal to send just a handful of people into permanent exile. This has never been about safety or justice – it’s just been about politics and stoking fear for political gain.”",https://www.hrlc.org.au/app/uploads/2025/12/A4-Hi-Rez_2025_12_09HRLC-027-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 05:58:21.660682

A former personal lawyer to President Trump, Ms. Habba began leading the New Jersey office in March.","The threat was the latest aggressive action that Mr. Trump has taken against some of America’s biggest trading partners. In October, Mr. Trump raised the nominal tariff rate for Canadian products to 35 percent from 25 percent, and he has also threatened to raise Mexico’s tariff rate to 30 percent from 25 percent. If Mr. Trump follows through on his threat for an additional water tariff, tariffs on Mexican products could increase to a maximum of 35 percent — though most imported goods from Canada and Mexico have duty-free exemptions.

Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, saying that a yearslong drought had significantly hindered the country’s ability to provide the full amount of water the agreement called for. Ms. Sheinbaum’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rising temperatures and long droughts have made water more scarce, making the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.

When Mr. Trump threatened in April to raise tariffs over the issue, Ms. Sheinbaum took a conciliatory stance: She immediately transferred some of Mexico’s water reserves and agreed to give the United States a larger share of the flow of water from the Rio Grande through October.

At the time, the Mexican borderlands were enduring extreme drought conditions, and the country’s water reserves were at historic lows. Now the drought has subsided, and a strong rainy season has replenished much of Mexico’s water reserves.

But Mexican farmers have pressed their government to oppose further concessions to the United States in what has been a yearslong dispute over the countries’ shared rivers. In 2020, tensions over water sharing exploded into violence, and Mexican farmers seized control of a dam in the border region in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the U.S.

Mexican farmers and their supporters have blockaded commercial shipping at the border in protest over water rights. In Juárez, farmers recently blocked some 7,000 trucks loaded with car parts and other goods from crossing into the United States, according to local officials.

For years, New York had allowed exemptions to school immunization requirements for students who held religious objections to vaccines or were unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. But after a large measles outbreak that was concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County, New York State eliminated the religious exemptions in 2019.

In the years since, childhood vaccination rates against measles climbed in New York. But the change to the law was challenged by a lawsuit filed in Rochester by a number of Amish people and Amish schools on the grounds that it interfered with their right to practice their faith and impart their religious values to their children. At least two federal courts in New York rejected their arguments.

New York is one of only five states not to offer an exemption from school vaccine requirements for religious or personal reasons, and, in one of those states, West Virginia, the governor has sought to introduce them.

In its March ruling, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, noted that in the years before the 2019 change a growing number of parents were receiving religious exemptions from vaccines for their children, undermining disease control efforts.

At private and parochial schools, the percentage of students invoking religious exemptions had jumped from .54 percent to 1.53 percent, according to the court record. In Rockland County, an epicenter of the 2019 measles outbreak and home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, up to 20 percent of students had religious exemptions at some schools.

The religious exemptions “resulted in clusters of low vaccination rates and an inability to achieve herd immunity in certain communities,” the ruling said.

Epidemiologists estimate that at least 95 percent of a community needs to be vaccinated to protect a community from a measles outbreak.

Dr. Howard Zucker, a former New York State health commissioner, said that declining vaccination rates nationwide have led to a resurgence of measles. An outbreak in the Southwest this year has led to more measles cases nationally than in any year since 2000, when the virus was declared eliminated in the United States.

“The decision to eliminate the once exploited religion exemption for vaccinations in New York State was grounded in public health principles: protecting herd immunity and preventing outbreaks,” said Dr. Zucker, who had advocated eliminating religious exemptions for school immunization while health commissioner.

The removal of religious exemptions has been credited with increasing childhood vaccination rates against measles in New York. But some schools — including three Amish schools that challenged the change to the law — did not require proof of vaccination before enrolling children, according to health authorities. The state fined the three schools $118,000 in all, triggering the lawsuit.

“The Amish community in New York wants to be left alone to live out their faith just like they have for 200 years,” said Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal organization that defends religious freedom and represents the Amish men and schools in the Rochester suit.

The order from the Supreme Court did not direct the lower appeals court to reach a particular result, but lawyers at First Liberty found the development encouraging.

The Supreme Court order directed the Second Circuit to reconsider the case in light of a recent ruling on religious freedom involving a very different topic. The ruling that the Supreme Court cited, Mahmoud v. Taylor, decided in June, involved storybooks with L.G.B.T.Q. themes and whether parents with religious objections could have their children excused from classes where the books were discussed.

First Liberty has argued that the Supreme Court’s ruling in the storybooks case shows that the Second Circuit was too dismissive of the Amish parents’ claim about how the school vaccine requirements threatened their religious beliefs.

“We believe the Second Circuit should reach a different result, and it seems that the Supreme Court agrees,” said Hiram Sasser, the executive general counsel at First Liberty.

In a legal brief to the Supreme Court, the New York State Attorney General’s Office noted that New York first enacted a school vaccination requirement in 1860, against smallpox. For more than a century, New York’s laws did not contain a religious exemption.

The legal brief also mentioned “the long tradition recognizing the States’ wide latitude to enact neutral and generally applicable laws promoting public health, safety, and child welfare even in the face of competing claims of religious liberty.”

Judge Saris, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the Interior Department had not provided a “reasoned explanation” of its decision to stop approving wind projects, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, she said, the “agency defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.”

Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of wind power, issued the executive order on his first day back in office in January. At the time, states like Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had been planning to build more than a dozen large wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean to meet their renewable energy goals.

The order effectively put a stop to many of those efforts. At the moment, one offshore wind farm has been completed and five more are under construction in U.S. coastal waters. But developers have been unable to receive permits for additional wind farms, and some planned projects have been canceled altogether.

The directive also stymied wind farms on federal land. In particular, it prohibited the development of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a large wind farm in Idaho that the Biden administration had approved.

Led by New York, a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia challenged the executive order in court in May. They were joined by the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Albany, N.Y.

“As we look to build the electric grid that will power America’s future, wind energy is a key component,” Marguerite Wells, the executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said in a statement. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the decision was “a major victory for our state and the entire region” that would protect “thousands of good-paying jobs” supporting the offshore wind sector.

Asked about the ruling, Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the Biden administration had given offshore wind projects “unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.” She said that Mr. Trump’s executive order, had it remained in effect, would have spurred federal agencies to study whether offshore wind projects were raising energy costs for American families.

Matthew Nies, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on whether the agency would appeal the ruling.

But even if the decision withstands a challenge, it could have a limited impact, according to a research note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. That’s because the courts typically cannot compel federal agencies to approve new projects. Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In addition to the freeze on new permits for wind farms, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits that were issued by the Biden administration for wind farms off Maryland and Massachusetts. It has also attempted to halt construction of two wind farms that were already partly built, including Empire Wind off Long Island and Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Those efforts have also faced pushback from the courts: In September, a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that construction could restart at Revolution Wind, saying that the administration’s stop-work order threatened “irreparable harm” to its developer. (The Trump administration has also allowed work at Empire Wind to restart after negotiations with Ms. Hochul.)

Mr. Trump has disparaged wind power ever since he failed 14 years ago to stop an offshore wind farm visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient. He railed against renewable energy during his presidential campaign last year, when he also promised oil and gas executives that he would make policy changes that would help their industry, such as rolling back environmental rules.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.

Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

The measure would also restrict the arrests of people showing up for or leaving check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with some allowances.

“You cannot sandbag people who are trying to do this the right way,” said Representative Daniel Goldman, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. He added, “These are nonviolent, noncriminal people, often escaping terrible conditions in their country, seeking refuge here.”

Migrants have been so afraid of being arrested at their appointments that the vast majority of them — 80 percent — have not been showing up, Mr. Goldman said at a news conference outside 26 Federal Plaza, the site of immigration courtrooms that has become the epicenter of migrant arrests in New York City. Many of those who are detained there are then taken to detention centers across the United States and quickly deported.

Their failure to show up is a violation of federal orders that compromises their path to living in the country legally.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security, denied Mr. Goldman’s assertion that people’s due process rights were being violated. She said that it was safer for federal agents to arrest immigrants in court, where they are screened for weapons, than out in the community.

“Rep. Goldman needs to stop defending violent criminal illegal aliens as he demonizes and dehumanizes American law enforcement,” Ms. McLaughlin wrote in an email. She added, “No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States.”

About half of all Americans support the broad idea of sending undocumented immigrants back to their home countries, according to polls from The New York Times and Siena University and Marquette Law School. Americans’ approval of Mr. Trump’s overall “handling of immigration” is about 45 percent, slightly higher than his overall job approval rating, which has been hovering in the low 40s, according to a review of polls conducted by The New York Times.

Mr. Goldman acknowledged that his bill faces long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress, but he said that Democrats were acting to resist President Trump’s expanding deportation crackdown not only through legislation but also by witnessing arrests and denouncing due process violations. Representative Adriano Espaillat, who also attended Monday’s news conference, said that he planned to show up to 26 Federal Plaza every week, and Mr. Goldman observed that agents had not arrested anyone in his presence.

Over the weekend, Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, released a minute-and-a-half-long video to teach residents about their rights when encountering ICE agents. In the video, Mr. Mamdani outlined legal protections available to residents, including their right to protest.

“New York will always welcome immigrants,” Mr. Mamdani says to the camera. “I will fight each and every day to protect, support and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters.”

Under the legislation introduced on Monday, any arrest carried out during a check-in would require the written authorization of a senior supervisory official citing its legal basis. The arrest would have to be reported to the Homeland Security inspector general within 30 days.

The legislation would also require federal regulators to submit a report to Congress on the department’s compliance. The report would include information regarding the number of arrests and attempted arrests made; the basis of such arrests; and steps taken by the agency to ensure compliance as well as any guidance or training provided to its employees.

An analysis of ICE data by The Times shows that most immigrants arrested in city crackdowns do not have a criminal record. Less than 30 percent of the people arrested in any of the operations had been convicted of a crime, and a very small share had been convicted of a violent crime. The most common nonviolent convictions were for driving under the influence and other traffic offenses.

In a social media post, Mr. Trump said the Commerce Department was finishing the details and would make similar opportunities available to other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The president said a portion of the chip revenue would go to the U.S. government, a proposition that experts say could violate U.S. law.

The decision is a major win for Jensen Huang. Nvidia’s chief executive, who spent months lobbying the White House to ease its export restrictions.

The move is also a departure for Mr. Trump, whose administration initially promised to restrict sales of A.I. chips to China. The early position had support across much of Washington, and a looser policy that has become clear in recent months has drawn bipartisan complaints from Congress.

Last week, six senators, including Pete Ricketts, a Republican from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, introduced a bill that would limit the sale of A.I. chips to China.

The administration’s shift followed a campaign by Mr. Huang and David Sacks, its A.I. and crypto czar, who have pushed back on national security concerns regarding A.I. chips. They have argued that increasing Nvidia’s sales to China would make Chinese companies dependent on its technology and give it more money to develop future generations of chips.

Mr. Huang met with Mr. Trump at the White House last week, and Mr. Trump praised the executive afterward, saying, “He’s done an amazing job.”

John Rizzo, an Nvidia spokesman, said offering H200 chips to approved commercial customers that had been vetted by the Commerce Department would strike “a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”

“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America,” he added.

The approval of the chip sales was reported earlier by Semafor.

Now the question is: Will China buy Nvidia’s latest offering? The administration wants to encourage Chinese companies to use Nvidia’s H200 chip, which it released last year, while limiting sales of the company’s latest generation of chips, known as Blackwell.

In July, the Trump administration dropped its restrictions on sales of a chip called the H20, which Nvidia developed specifically for China. But Beijing discouraged companies from buying the chip, with administrators warning that it could have “backdoor security risks.”

Nvidia could run into similar challenges when it begins selling the more powerful H200. After the first Trump administration and the Biden administration began limiting U.S. technology sales to China, Beijing increased its spending to become technologically self-reliant. Huawei, the country’s tech giant, has been improving its own A.I. chips.

This summer, Mr. Trump proposed the idea of the government’s taking a cut of A.I. chip sales to China. On Monday, he reiterated that, writing that “$25% will be paid to the United States of America” — a 10-percentage-point increase from what the company previously agreed to pay the U.S. government.

Government lawyers have been researching how to enact such a policy, given that U.S. law prohibits the charging of fees for export licenses. Mr. Huang said in a news conference in Washington in October that government officials were working on a new policy to collect the fees.

Neither U.S. nor Chinese officials have publicly acknowledged that the H200 chips were under discussion. But U.S. rules around the sale of technology to China have been a central issue in the countries’ relationship.

After Mr. Trump imposed double-digit tariffs on Chinese exports in April, Beijing restricted exports of rare-earth minerals essential to a variety of industries. The countries tentatively agreed to walk back those restrictions this spring, but the truce fell apart after the United States announced new restrictions on Chinese technology companies. Chinese officials argued that those measures violated the spirit of their agreement.

At a meeting in South Korea in October, Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the leader of China, restored that truce, with the United States promising to keep tariffs low and Beijing to provide steady exports of rare earths and resume its purchases of American soybeans. The agreement was also widely believed to include a de facto U.S. freeze on any new technology restrictions.

Since then, the countries have been working to keep the peace, and in a call with Mr. Xi in late November, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to visit China in April. On Friday, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, spoke with China’s vice premier about the steps the sides were taking to maintain the agreement.

But others in Washington have been critical of the administration’s warmer stance toward China. In a letter last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, expressed concern over the potential sale of the H200 chip.

“I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security,” she wrote.

For months, the top Republicans and Democrats on the congressional national security committees have tried without success to compel the Defense Department to share critical information about the attacks, which the Trump administration says are targeting narco-terrorists bringing drugs to the United States.

The legislation aims to force the Pentagon to be more forthcoming. It would withhold 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if he failed to give the congressional national security committees a copy of the execute orders behind the strikes, or to outline how he planned to facilitate future briefings about the operation with lawmakers in accordance with federal law.

The bill also would require that the Defense Department hand over to Congress “unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations” in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific.

Mr. Hegseth has posted edited footage of the strikes on social media, but has so far refused to share the full videos with lawmakers. Some senior members of Congress viewed video of the first strike on Sept. 2 in a classified briefing last week, but have not viewed unedited footage from any of the other 21 known strikes the Pentagon has carried out over the last three months.

Similarly, while the Pentagon has provided lawmakers with summaries of the orders behind the attacks, officials have not provided the actual orders, known as EXORDs, as requested by the House and Senate defense committees, according to a spokesman for Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The new demand and threat to withhold money from the secretary’s office reflected mounting concern among top lawmakers in both parties over the lack of transparency around the open-ended military campaign that has killed at least 87 people.

Mr. Reed said in a floor speech last week that Mr. Hegseth’s unwillingness to answer basic questions on the strikes and provide documents to Congress on the operations, as required by law, was troubling.

“This suggests they know this operation and the tortured legal rationale they use to justify it cannot withstand scrutiny,” he added.

Mr. Reed said that he and Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had given Mr. Hegseth “more than enough time to respond in good faith to reasonable questions,” but that the defense secretary “has refused.”

The two senators had warned in October that the Pentagon was skirting Congress as it continued to ramp up the campaign against alleged drug traffickers at sea. They made public two letters sent to Mr. Hegseth demanding more information on the strikes, saying the secretary had failed to respond.

Federal law requires the Defense Department to send execute orders to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within 15 days of the defense secretary issuing the orders, but officials have failed to do so in the case of the boat strikes. The law also mandates that if the top Republicans or Democrats on the committees were to specifically request such an order, the department would have 30 days to comply, another timeline that the Trump administration has ignored.

The new requirements were added during final negotiations to reconcile the two chambers’ versions of the roughly $900 billion defense policy bill, which the House is expected to pass this week. The Senate is expected to approve it next week, sending it to the president’s desk.

The bill requires that the videos and other documents be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, meaning they would not be seen by the public, unless later declassified and released.

But calls from Democrats for the public release of the video of the Sept. 2 strike are mounting. The opening salvo in the administration’s strikes on traffickers at sea, the early September attack has faced heavy scrutiny partly because of a follow-up strike that killed two survivors.

While Mr. Trump has said he would have “no problem” with the release of the video, Mr. Hegseth over the weekend suggested he would not make it public.

The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Adam Smith of Washington, who saw the footage last week in a classified briefing, told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, “It seems pretty clear they don’t want to release this video because they don’t want people to see it, because it’s very, very difficult to justify.”

“This bill would help prevent unaffordable increases in health insurance premium costs for many families by extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits for two years and putting a reasonable income cap on these subsidies to ensure they are going to the individuals who need them,” said Ms. Collins.

Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho, the Republican chairmen of the health and finance committees, respectively, have another approach under consideration that would send money for the premiums directly to consumers, rather than insurance companies.

It would funnel the funds through tax-free health savings accounts, an approach that Republicans have long embraced, with limited success. The legislation would also expand eligibility for high-deductible catastrophic plans and cut federal Medicaid funding to states that provide coverage to undocumented immigrants.

“Instead of 100 percent of this money going to insurance companies, who take 20 percent of it, we give 100 percent, almost, to the patient, to our fellow American, in an account that she controls and use as she wishes,” Mr. Cassidy said. “Let’s give power to the patient, not profit to the insurance company. Let’s make health care affordable again.”

A progressive health care group immediately decried the bill as an “utter joke.”

“Republicans are proving once again how unserious they are,” said Brad Woodhouse, president of the group, Protect Our Care.

Speaker Mike Johnson has also said that House Republicans may come forward with their own health care plan, and other Republican proposals could surface, as well. But so far, the party has yet to unify around any one plan.

Republicans are rushing to come up with a counter to the Democratic legislation, which would extend the subsidies at the center of the fight that shut down much of the government for 43 days. In agreeing to reopen the government, Democrats received a commitment from Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to allow them to bring a proposal to the floor this month to extend the tax breaks currently slated to expire at the end of the year.

Lawmakers engaged in bipartisan talks to try to come up with a consensus plan that could attract the 60 votes required to overcome a Senate filibuster, but none emerged. A bipartisan group in the House last week proposed scaling back the subsidies and extending them for two years, but that proposal has little chance of being considered, given that it is opposed by most Republicans.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said last week that Democrats would now forge ahead with a three-year extension without any of the changes sought by Republicans to rein in costs.

“It’s going to be one of the most important votes we take,” Mr. Schumer said, “because it’s showing who is on the side of the American people and lowering their health care costs and who is on the side of the big special interests and is going to raise health care costs.”

The plan has deep Democratic support and could draw votes from a handful of Republicans. But most G.O.P. lawmakers, who have long railed against the Affordable Care Act, oppose it.

Democrats say the best solution at the moment is to ease the threat of premium increases by extending the tax breaks for three years while pursuing longer-term solutions. They say that the emerging Republican plans are inadequate and will lead to more Americans going without health care coverage.

Republicans say that they are worried about the impact of the rising premiums and are willing to entertain any extension tied to other changes in the program, but that Democrats have chosen to get behind legislation that they know will fail in an effort to create a winning political issue for the midterm elections. They also say that the problem was created by Democrats who beefed up subsidies for the Affordable Care Act during the pandemic and established a cutoff date on their own.

“I refuse to let the American people pay the price for the Democrats’ incompetence,” said Mr. Moreno, the Ohio Republican. “I am willing to work with anyone to finally bring down costs for all Americans, and hope my colleagues across the aisle will commit to doing the same.”

Democrats who emerged from a showing of the video described it showing the two men clinging to wreckage to avoid drowning, and that the images were shocking and would repulse the public. Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the two survivors “were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities,” when the follow-up strike took place.

Mr. Trump told reporters who asked about the video last week, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.”

But on Monday he denied ever endorsing its release and referred the issue to Mr. Hegseth. On Saturday, Mr. Hegseth told the Reagan National Defense Forum that he would not commit to making the video public.

“We’re reviewing the process, and we’ll see,” Mr. Hegseth said. “Whatever we were to decide to release, we’d have to be very responsible about reviewing that right now.”

The Pentagon has possessed the video since the mission took place in early September. It immediately released a video of the initial strike on the boat, which killed most of the crew and capsized the craft. But it did not initially make mention of the fact that it took more strikes to sink the boat, and that survivors had been seen.

The Pentagon’s story about where the boat was headed at the time has changed repeatedly, and the administration has refused to release the legal rationale, drafted at the Justice Department, justifying the strikes on the boats. The U.S. military has carried out 22 such strikes, killing at least 87 people.

Outside experts say that because drug-runners are not armed military forces, the strikes are illegally targeting civilians who should, instead, be subject to apprehension and arrest by the Coast Guard.

Visitors will instead get free entry on June 14, which is both Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday.

The changes follow previous moves by the Trump administration to take down materials mentioning slavery at national parks and come as part of a broader effort by the White House to erase or play down Black history at government sites.

The Interior Department, which oversees the park service, said in a news release that the changes reflected the administration’s “commitment to making national parks more accessible, more affordable and more efficient for the American people.”

Derrick Johnson, the chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a statement that removing dates recognizing Black history was part of an effort “to distract and divide us by undermining progress attributed to the Black community.”

Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, called the moves “extremely disappointing” and said the holidays “commemorate people and stories that are essential to understanding the history of our country.”

There will be 10 free entrance days at national parks in 2026 — including Memorial Day, Independence Day weekend and Veterans Day — up from six this year. Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States and became a federal holiday in 2021, was added as a free entrance day last year. Not all free days are federal holidays: Also being honored are the National Park Service’s 110th birthday (Aug. 25), Constitution Day (Sept. 17) and Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday (Oct. 27).

The park service will limit free entrance on those dates to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. “Nonresidents will pay the regular entrance fee and any applicable nonresident fees,” the agency’s website says. Previously, anyone could visit national parks at no charge on free entrance days.

The changes are part of the administration’s “America-first pricing” model announced in November. That initiative includes charging nonresidents $250 for an annual national parks pass (compared with $80 for U.S. citizens and permanent residents) and a fee of $100 per person for nonresidents without a parks pass at 11 of the nation’s most popular parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite.

A former personal lawyer to President Trump, Ms. Habba began leading the New Jersey office in March. In July, when her tenure was expected to end, the Justice Department kept her in place through a series of complex maneuvers that led to immediate legal challenges.

Last week, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that Ms. Habba had been serving unlawfully, a challenge to her authority that could place precedent-setting limits on President Trump’s power to choose his own top federal prosecutors.

The court affirmed an earlier ruling that said the Justice Department could not indefinitely extend the tenure of interim U.S. attorneys who were neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by district trial court judges — the two conventional ways for being appointed to the role permanently.

“As a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down,” Ms. Habba wrote, adding: “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”

Ms. Bondi said Monday that the court’s ruling had “made it untenable” for Ms. Habba to run her office effectively, “with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice.”

Ms. Bondi said that she would appeal the Third Circuit’s decision, and said that if it were reversed, Ms. Habba would return to lead the New Jersey office.

But it was not clear whether it would be possible to appeal the Third Circuit’s decision, given that Ms. Habba’s resignation would seem to have put the issue to rest. The Justice Department had also said it would appeal a similar ruling disqualifying the U.S. attorney in Eastern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, and has yet to do so.

In her own post, Ms. Habba blasted judges in New Jersey who declined to extend her tenure, as well as the so-called blue slip tradition, which allowed New Jersey’s senators to block her permanent appointment to the role.

The judges instead appointed Ms. Habba’s top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to replace her. The Justice Department fired Ms. Grace, keeping Ms. Habba in the role.

Ms. Habba will not be replaced by any one U.S. attorney, but instead by three prosecutors who were already in the office: Philip Lamparello, Jordan Fox and Ari Fontecchio. They will divide the responsibilities of the U.S. attorney among them.

Mr. Lamparello will run the office’s criminal division; Ms. Fox will run its civil and appeals division; and Mr. Fontecchio will oversee administrative matters. Mr. Lamparello and Mr. Fontecchio worked closely with Ms. Habba, while Ms. Fox was a chief of staff to the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche.

Ms. Fox will maintain her role for Mr. Blanche, a Justice Department spokesman said. That dual role, as well as Mr. Lamparello’s and Mr. Fontecchio’s close ties to Ms. Habba, could help ensure that the New Jersey office remains under firm control from Washington. But the unconventional arrangement could lead to further challenges from defense lawyers, and it is unclear how judges will view the matter.

The state’s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, urged the White House to work with them to find a “qualified candidate” to lead the office for the next three years and to “give the Senate a full, fair opportunity to consider that nominee.”

“Today’s resignation of Alina Habba from her role as U.S. attorney for New Jersey brings to a close a troubling chapter and confirms what we have warned from the start,” they said in a statement, adding that her appointment “undermined the credibility of the office and eroded the public’s trust in the state’s chief federal prosecutor.”

Ms. Habba’s time leading the office was turbulent. Days after Mr. Trump announced on social media that he was appointing her to the prestigious post, she told a podcaster that she hoped to use her job in the traditionally nonpartisan office to help Republicans “turn New Jersey red.”

Less than two months later, her office had brought charges against two prominent New Jersey Democrats, Mayor Ras J. Baraka of Newark and Representative LaMonica McIver, after a May 9 clash with federal agents outside a migrant detention center.

She quickly dropped the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka. The episode elicited a harsh rebuke from a judge who suggested that the charges had been brought too hastily.

Mr. Baraka is suing Ms. Habba for malicious prosecution, and lawyers for Ms. McIver, who is charged with assault, have moved to have her case dismissed. They have argued that Mr. Baraka’s arrest was ordered by the deputy attorney general, and that the prosecution of Ms. McIver smacks of disparate treatment, particularly in light of the president’s leniency toward the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters.

Ruling against Ms. McIver, a judge has said that the case could proceed, although she is expected to appeal that decision.

Ms. McIver is accused of slamming her forearm into one immigration agent and trying to restrain another as she tried to block Mr. Baraka’s arrest. Her lawyers have countered that it was the federal agents who “precipitated and were responsible for creating several minutes of physical chaos.”

Ms. Habba had no experience in criminal law before being appointed in March to an interim, 120-day term as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.

Early on, she emphasized her close relationship with the White House and began traveling with a security team that included federal marshals. From late March through August, this security detail cost taxpayers $2.3 million, including more than $560,000 in costs associated with travel, according to information provide by the U.S. Marshals Service through a records request.

The Justice Department pushed to keep her in office after her interim term expired, but in August, a judge ruled that her authority had expired, thrusting the state’s already paralyzed federal court system deeper into disarray and further eroding office morale. Since January, dozens of seasoned prosecutors have left for new jobs.

“Because she is not currently qualified to exercise the functions and duties of the office in an acting capacity, she must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases,” the judge, Matthew W. Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, wrote.

Ms. Habba had refused to recuse herself. And many proceedings, including plea hearings and trials, were postponed as judges waited for additional guidance, wary that actions taken in cases involving Ms. Habba, or prosecutors she supervises, could be challenged by defense lawyers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08trump-news-promo7p/08trump-news-promo7p-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 23:56:48.349870

Speakers described the raids as part of intensifying enforcement tactics and urged Tucsonans to prepare and organize before future actions occur.

On Friday, federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies raided several Taco Giro locations across town as part of a broader immigration and tax investigation. Protesters, journalists and community members gathered at the restaurant’s North Grande Avenue location.

Agents fired tear gas, pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse the crowd, which included Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who identified herself as a member of Congress and attempted to de-escalate the situation.

In a statement issued Friday evening, Grijalva said she and her staff were on their way to get lunch when they encountered the raid at Taco Giro, which she said has served the community for decades.

“It’s in the heart of our community — right next to a church and a preschool,” Grijalva said. “When I presented myself as a Member of Congress and asked for more information, my staff and I were pushed aside and pepper-sprayed by masked agents. While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?”

Grijalva went on to say that communities across the country are “being terrorized by a lawless agency” under the Trump administration, adding that residents “deserve to know whether these raids are targeting genuine public safety threats — or law-abiding neighbors who have called our communities home for decades.”

“No family in our community should live in fear, and I will not rest until we get clear answers and accountability,” Grijalva said.

Mayor Regina Romero issued her own statement Friday, saying she shared community members’ fears created by President Donald Trump’s “immoral and inhumane immigration policies.”

“Under the Trump administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like ‘police’ to purposefully confuse the public,” she said, adding that uniformed Tucson Police Department officers at the scene were there only to close the street and keep residents safe. “They were not involved in the use of force against community members. We are committed to having a safe city where everyone’s rights are respected and legally enforced at all times.”

An Instagram post began circulating Saturday morning inviting people to a community assembly at Menlo Park to discuss ways to support and defend community members from ICE.

Speakers said the gathering was meant to create space for difficult conversations about the fear and “terror” they believe federal enforcement is bringing to the community, and to begin deciding together how to organize against ICE.

They emphasized the need for neighborhood-level safety groups, shared information and empathy, noting that many people hesitate to speak out because of scarce information and fears of retaliation, including job loss.

“We’ve been doing community response for quite some time now, and it seems the ICE raids are amping up,” said a woman named Aurora. “It almost seemed kind of like a tactic. Like why hadn’t Arizona been targeted yet, knowing that we have such a big immigration and refugee population?”

Aurora said she believed the agencies had been testing the waters in other jurisdictions before executing raids in Tucson, pointing to the forthcoming federal detention center in Marana.

“They’re going to want to fill it,” she said. “We have to organize preemptively rather than responding when it’s already happened.”

A follow-up meeting is planned for Jan. 10.

The California Faculty Association (CFA) sued the California State University Board of Trustees in October, later adding Teamsters and United Auto Workers units at CSU as fellow plaintiffs.

An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.","California State University is caught between a federal government eager to investigate alleged antisemitism and employees concerned about privacy.

That dilemma has landed the nation’s largest four-year public university in Los Angeles County Superior Court, where labor unions representing employees around the 22-campus system are waiting to see if they can win the support of a Superior Court judge — or perhaps reach an agreement with CSU itself — to allay members’ fears of harassment and surveillance by the Trump administration.

Faculty members, a graduate teaching assistant, and a supervisor in a campus facilities department are among the employees who have filed declarations in state court, saying they are worried that Cal State will put their scholarships and well-being at risk by handing over personal information like cellphone numbers and email addresses to federal agencies. Their lawsuit seeking to require CSU to notify employees if it receives federal requests for such information in the future is being heard by Judge Stephen Goorvitch. The parties plan to hold a conference with the judge as soon as next week, a spokesperson for the faculty union said.

The nine sworn statements, filed by employees from San Bernardino to Humboldt County in early November, show the fallout after CSU revealed in September that it is the subject of a systemwide investigation into allegations of antisemitism and a hostile environment by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). EEOC has filed one complaint related to that investigation, but CSU anticipates others will follow.

Separately, Cal State alerted Cal State LA employees in September that it had complied with an EEOC subpoena related to a January complaint against the campus of roughly 22,000 students. The subpoena sought the contact information of all Cal State LA faculty and staff in connection with an investigation that also hinges on allegations of antisemitism.

The California Faculty Association (CFA) sued the California State University Board of Trustees in October, later adding Teamsters and United Auto Workers units at CSU as fellow plaintiffs. The unions said in court filings that prompt notification of future federal subpoenas would give employees the opportunity to object and attempt to intervene if they don’t want their information shared with the federal government.

The conflict between Cal State and the employee unions comes amid a sweeping campaign by the White House to crack down on colleges and universities that it accuses of fostering political views with which it disagrees, including protesting Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and supporting the rights of transgender students. The University of California system and the University of Pennsylvania are among the colleges facing EEOC investigations alleging a hostile work environment for Jewish employees.

Cal State says it has not received a subpoena related to the systemwide EEOC investigation and that there have not been any findings, settlement discussions or other federal actions in regard to it. The EEOC did not respond to a request seeking comment.

Judge Goorvitch on Friday was scheduled to weigh the unions’ request for a preliminary injunction. The court ultimately did not issue a decision and will instead accept additional briefing from CSU, said university system spokesperson Jason Maymon. A status conference on the matter is set for next week, CFA spokesperson Kenyon Farrow said.

A balancing act for Cal State

The systemwide EEOC investigation poses a subtle balancing act for Cal State, which has said it will cooperate in good faith with federal investigators while seeking to protect its employees’ privacy. “Fulfilling our legal obligations does not mean surrendering our rights or agreeing with the allegations,” the university system advises on a frequently asked questions webpage. “CSU is required by law to cooperate with an EEOC investigation, but cooperation does not mean that CSU accepts the allegations as true or automatically provides everything that is requested.”

At Cal State LA, the university system has said it filed a petition to modify the subpoena, narrowing its original scope to exclude home addresses and details about why employees left the university. But Cal State LA ultimately provided information, including employees’ names, genders, race and ethnicity, personal phone number, personal email and work sites.

In November, Cal State filed a brief opposing the unions’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which the unions have since revised. Attorneys for the university system argued that federal law preempts state privacy protections and that its disclosure of information to a federal agency was permitted under state law.

Employees cite ‘fear and intimidation’

Sworn statements by employees at Cal State LA depict what one described as an atmosphere of “fear and intimidation” on campus since employees learned that their personal contact information had been shared with the EEOC.

Philosophy master’s student Eric Phipps said that shortly after CSU alerted employees about the disclosures, his professor and classmates in a course related to gender “expressed fears that their participation in the course could cause them to be targeted by the federal government and that CSU would not protect them.”

Phipps, who works as an instructional student assistant, is now second-guessing whether to pursue a career in academia. “I feel that academic freedom is no longer guaranteed, and I am now hesitant to publish my thesis because of the political views expressed therein,” he wrote.

Faculty also worried that future federal requests would seek private emails with students and colleagues, or other information about their teaching, social media use and political activism.

Cal State LA professor Ericka Verba said she worries that if CSU were to provide the text of her emails to the federal government, she could face retaliation for her activism related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Verba, a member of Cal State LA’s Latin American Studies Program, said her emails also “contain sensitive information about students’ immigration status” that is not relevant to an antisemitism probe.

Concerns not limited to Cal State LA

Similar concerns have spread to employees at other CSU campuses, who said in court declarations that they are worried that future federal requests may seek information they consider confidential and personal.

Christopher Cox, a San Jose State University lecturer in sociology and interdisciplinary studies, wrote that his teaching specialties — including topics like colonization and international human rights — make him concerned “that I will be targeted for the courses that I teach at SJSU if my private information is subpoenaed by the EEOC or another federal agency.”

At Cal Poly Humboldt, a philosophy lecturer said he feared his views on political issues, including LGBTQ+ rights, would put him at risk. Loren Cannon, who has worked at the Humboldt campus since 2006, said he was concerned that CSU may in the future turn over information about his scholarship and teaching “that would subject me to additional scrutiny, harassment and even the termination of my position.”

Institutions of higher education have varied in how they respond to EEOC investigations into alleged discrimination against Jewish employees. The University of Pennsylvania sought to revoke an EEOC subpoena in its entirety, the federal agency said in a court filing. EEOC denied that effort and has asked a federal district court to force Penn to comply with a modified order. Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York City agreed to pay $21 million to settle an EEOC investigation.

The developer of ICEBlock, an iPhone app that anonymously tracks the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has sued the Trump administration for free speech violations after Apple removed the service from its app store under demands from the White House.

The suit, filed on Monday in federal court in Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally prosecute the app's developer and pressured Apple to make the app unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October.

Following Apple ejecting ICEBlock, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that ""we reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so.""

Lawyer Noam Biale, who filed the suit against the administration, said Bondi's remarks show the government illegally pressuring a private company to suppress free speech.

""We view that as an admission that she engaged in coercion in her official role as a government official to get Apple to remove this app,"" Biale said in an interview with NPR.

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.

When reached for comment, Apple also did not respond. The lawsuit, which does not name Apple, says the tech giant bowed in the face of political pressure.

""For what appears to be the first time in Apple's nearly fifty-year history, Apple removed a U.S.-based app in response to the U.S. government's demands,"" according to the suit.

Developer calls immigration crackdown 'abhorrent'

Joshua Aaron, the Austin, Texas-based developer of ICEBlock, said he launched the app as a way to empower those opposed to Trump's immigration crackdown.

""It was just the best idea I had to do everything I could to fight back against what was going on,"" Aaron said in an interview, describing Trump's immigration enforcement blitz as ""abhorrent.""

The app allows people to report an ICE agent sighting within a 5 mile radius, similar to how map apps, like Waze and Google and Apple Maps and others, alert drivers to police setting up speed traps. The ICE sighting alerts do not include photographs or videos and expire in four hours.

Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies. An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.

Aaron's lawsuit says Bondi is mischaracterizing the purpose of the app.

""Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,"" according to the lawsuit.

Attorney General Bondi, in a July interview with Fox News, suggested Aaron was under investigation and had committed a crime. ""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.

To legal experts, ICEBlock is latest ""jawboning"" example

To First Amendment advocates, the White House's pressure campaign targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what's known as ""jawboning,"" when government officials wield state power to suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice ""censorship by proxy.""

ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action and Bondi promising a crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are two other prominent instances.

""The use of a high-level government threat to force a private platform to suppress speech fundamentally undermines the public's right to access information about government activities,"" said Spence Purnell, a resident senior fellow at R Street, a center-right think tank. ""If high-level officials can successfully silence political opposition, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free expression in this country.""

Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the White House's campaign against ICEBlock shows the administration using what has become a familiar playbook: ""To use threats of adverse legal and financial consequences, sometimes vague sometimes not so vague, to pressure universities, media companies, law firms, you name it, into not speaking in the ways they like,"" she said.

One potential weak spot for the lawsuit, however, is a lack of direct evidence that Attorney General Bondi, or other administration officials, made threats against Apple to have the app removed, rather than merely convinced the tech company to do so.

""And government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they persuade private speech platforms to suppress speech because that speech poses a national security risk or is harmful in some other way,"" Lakier said. ""They only violate the First Amendment when they coerce or attempt to coerce the private platform to suppress the speech.""

Since Apple kicked ICEBlock out of its app store, it cannot be downloaded now, but those who had it on their phones before the ban can still use it. Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.

Aaron said he hopes the suit will lead to ICEBlock being restored to the iPhone app stores and for a clear message to be sent to the Trump administration that prosecuting him for his role in developing the app would be illegal.

Aaron said he and his legal team ""have been preparing for this fight,"" adding that ""we will take it as far as it needs to go to ensure this never happens again.""

Twelve FBI agents who were fired this year for taking a knee during racial justice protests in the heated summer of 2020 are suing the Bureau and its director, alleging unlawful retaliation.

The former special agents—who together have nearly 200 years of experience—once received awards for helping disrupt mass shootings, expose foreign spies and thwart cyber attacks.

But they say as elite federal law enforcement agents, they never received training on crowd control, nor did they have riot shields, gas masks, or helmets when they faced down volatile crowds in the streets of Washington, D.C., in June 2020.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on Monday, described the small group of FBI agents as vastly outnumbered and literally backed against the wall of the National Archives building as unrest swept the country over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Court papers said they kneeled not to reflect a left-wing political point of view, but rather to de-escalate a situation that threatened to spin out of control.

""Mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences, Plaintiffs knew that a split-second misjudgment by any of them could ignite an already-charged national climate and trigger further violence and unrest,"" said the lawsuit, filed by former Justice Department prosecutor Mary Dohrmann of the Washington Litigation Group.

Accused of 'lack of impartiality'

The Justice Department inspector general reviewed the incident in 2024 and found no misconduct. But the episode went viral on social media, attracting critics who cast the kneeling as a political act. Before he returned to the White House, President Trump also posted a negative story about the matter.

Soon after new FBI Director Kash Patel joined the Bureau this year, the lawsuit said he began targeting the agents involved in the episode for retaliation. Several of plaintiffs were yanked from supervisory roles at the FBI. Officials launched a new investigation. The matter was still pending when they were all fired in September, shortcutting typical procedures for FBI misconduct probes.

In their dismissal letters, Patel wrote: ""You have demonstrated unprofessional conduct and a lack of impartiality in carrying out duties, leading to the political weaponization of government.""

During his confirmation hearing, Patel told senators he would honor the internal review process. But the lawsuit accuses him of breaking that pledge for his own political purposes.

The abrupt departure of the fired agents disrupted important work, including evidence collection in Utah following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and efforts to support the Trump administration's executive order on ""Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,"" court papers said.

The case alleges violations of the agents' First Amendment rights to free association and their Fifth Amendment right to due process. They're asking to be reinstated to their jobs and for back pay.

The FBI declined to comment on pending litigation.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said ICE officers arrested Jesus Saucedo-Portillo while he was getting into his car on campus on Saturday afternoon.

DHS officials said Saucedo-Portillo is a registered sex offender and has a prior arrest for driving while intoxicated.

A search of the Minnesota court records website and the national sex offender registry did not return any results for Saucedo-Portillo.

In an email to students and staff, Augsburg University’s provost said ICE agents in an unmarked car approached Saucedo-Portillo around 3 p.m. in Parking Lot B on campus.

The provost went on to say that campus security and an on-call administrator arrived, and the agents told them they did not have a judicial warrant.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused the administrator and campus security of attempting to obstruct the arrest and stated that ICE officials told university staff they had a warrant for Saucedo-Portillo’s arrest.

The full statement from Assistant Secretary McLaughlin is below.

“On December 6, ICE officers arrested Jesus Saucedo-Portillo, a criminal illegal alien while he was getting into his vehicle. He is a registered sex offender and has a previous arrest for driving while intoxicated.

“A university Administrator and campus security attempted to obstruct the arrest. Our officers told the school Administrator and campus security that ICE had a warrant for the illegal alien’s arrest. The school Administrator told ICE officers they were violating university policies. Our officers informed them that federal law supersedes any University policy and that if campus security would not stop blocking the law enforcement vehicle from exiting, they would be obstructing justice. The school administrator continued her efforts to block the vehicle from leaving and ordered campus security to stand in front of the vehicle. Our officers followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to clear the area and successfully arrested this criminal illegal alien.

“There is a growing trend of agitators and rioters obstructing the arrest of illegal aliens. Our officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them as they arrest the worst of the worst including murderers, sexual predators, terrorists, and gang members.“

After her arrest, the White House claimed Ferreira had not spoken to Leavitt in years and that Ferreira had never lived with her son.
The Independent has requested comment from the White House.
“It's outrageous and abhorrent, and the rhetoric alone is disgusting,” he told The Independent last month.","An immigration judge has ordered the release of the mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew after she was arrested by immigration agents last month and threatened with removal from the country.

Bruna Ferreira, who is originally from Brazil, was driving to pick up her 11-year-old son from school when she was suddenly surrounded by federal officers. Since then, the 33-year-old Brazilian mother has been detained inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana.

An immigration judge ordered her release Monday on a $1,500 bond while she continues a legal battle against President Donald Trump’s administration, which has labeled her a “criminal illegal alien.”

“She will be released on that amount of bond once it is processed by ICE,” her attorney Todd Pomerleau told The Independent.

Immigration Judge Cynthia Goodman ordered her release on the lowest-dollar bond possible, according to Ferreira’s legal team. Pomerleau said they argued she wasn’t a flight risk while government lawyers “never once argued” in court that she was a “criminal illegal alien” and waived appeal, he told The Independent.

Her attorneys said that the Trump administration’s characterization of Ferreira is “unfair and untrue,” according to The Washington Post, which first reported the bond order.

Following her bond order, a spokesperson for Homeland Security once again labeled Ferreira a “criminal illegal alien” and stressed that she will continue to have “periodic mandatory check-ins with ICE law enforcement to ensure she is abiding by the terms of her release.”

“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to work to remove all aliens illegally present in the country as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson told The Independent.

The story of Ferreira’s November 12 arrest and detention is deeply familiar to hundreds of immigrant families embroiled in similar legal battles and deportation threats. The revelation of her ties to Leavitt, whose brother is the father of Ferreira’s child, has complicated the Trump administration’s fervent anti-immigration agenda.

“She’s somebody that has generated publicity because of her relationship to somebody who is part of the inner circle of the White House, but at the end of the day, that she’s just one of many thousands and thousands of people that are getting this treatment on a daily basis in this administration,” Jeffrey Rubin, whose firm is representing Ferreira, told The Independent last month.

Ferreira’s parents emigrated from Brazil and brought their young daughter with them in 1998 when she was roughly 6 years old. Her two younger siblings were born in the United States.

She received temporary legal protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that has shielded tens of thousands of people who arrived in the country as children without legal status, and she was in the process of obtaining a green card, according to her legal team.

Ferreira, who lives in Massachusetts, does not appear to have had any criminal convictions, and she shares custody with her son, according to her lawyers.

In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Ferreira said she wanted Leavitt to be her son’s godmother.

“I made a mistake there, in trusting,” she said. “Why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

She was arrested for being in the United States without legal permission after overstaying a visa that expired when she was a child, according to her attorneys.

After her arrest, the White House claimed Ferreira had not spoken to Leavitt in years and that Ferreira had never lived with her son. Homeland Security also accused her of being arrested for “battery,” but her legal team cannot corroborate the administration’s allegations.

Ferreira was previously engaged to Michael Leavitt, Karoline’s brother, but they broke up more than 10 years ago, according to the family.

The Independent has requested comment from the White House.

Speaking to The Washington Post while in ICE custody, Ferreira said the administration’s claims are “disgusting” and false.

Before her arrest, she was managing a cleaning businesses, going to yoga class and spending time with her son, who has “everything a young boy needs,” she said.

Her arrest is among many in a “random and cruel mass deportation campaign” under an administration that has performed warrantless searches, arrested and deported immigrants without due process, and stripped legal protections for tens of thousands of people who were previously allowed to live and work in the country, according to Rubin.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, the mother of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew, was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 12 in Massachusetts as she was on her way to pick up her son — Leavitt’s nephew through her brother — from school.

The 33-year-old, who arrived from Brazil as a young child in 1998 with her parents, was accused by the Department of Homeland Security of overstaying her tourist visa and was taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana.

""She looks forward to being reunited with her son and carrying on with her life as a hard-working business owner and resuming life in the only country she considers home,"" Jeffrey Rubin, an attorney for Ferreira, said in a statement to USA TODAY. Rubin said Ferreira was released on a $1,500 bond, the minimum amount under federal law.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ferreira shares an 11-year-old son with Leavitt’s older brother, Michael, and the two share joint custody of the child, Ferreira attorney Todd Pomerleau previously told USA TODAY. The couple was engaged about 12 years ago and eventually broke up.

According to Ferreira’s legal team, she was in the final stages of getting her green card, with the last interview scheduled for the spring.

Ferreira, who owns and operates a cleaning service business and online clothing, had been allowed to live and work in the country as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipient under the Obama administration.

The woman's legal team previously told USA TODAY that Ferreira decided to pursue a green card after the first Trump administration sought to terminate the DACA program; legal challenges have made the process long-winding.

A DHS spokesperson described Ferreira as a ""criminal illegal alien"" with a ""previous arrest for battery."" The spokesperson did not provide details on the arrest.

When asked whether Ferreira has a criminal record, Rubin said ""any reference to a criminal record was in the context of as a juvenile, an altercation with another teen occurred over $8 outside a Dunkin Donuts where all charges were dropped.""

Arrest outside Boston

Ferreira’s attorneys said that the woman was arrested in Revere, Mass., outside Boston, as she was on her way in the afternoon to pick her son up from school in southern New Hampshire, which is about 35 minutes from where she lives. Attorneys described her as a highly involved mother who spent multiple days with her son every week.

Leavitt did not provide comments to USA TODAY but a source familiar with the dynamics between the two women said they haven't spoken to each other in years.

The source also said that the child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born and that he had never resided with his mother.

Ferreira’s family started a GoFundMe page to raise money for legal expenses. The effort had raised more than $37,000 as of Dec. 8 at 4:30 p.m.

""Bruna’s absence has been especially painful for her 11-year-old son, Michael Leavitt Junior, who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she’ll be home in time for the holidays,"" says Ferreira’s sister Graziela DosSantos Rodrigues on the GoFundMe page.

Former FBI Acting Director Brian Driscoll has filed a federal civil lawsuit challenging his termination.
And a group of FBI agents who were under scrutiny for their roles in the investigation of the Capitol riot have also filed a lawsuit to challenge that investigation.","In a federal civil lawsuit filed in Washington Monday, a dozen former FBI agents are seeking to get their jobs back, claiming they were fired during the second Trump administration for their efforts in 2020 to head off a riot in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.

The former agents say they were unlawfully terminated by the Justice Department earlier this year for kneeling in 2020, as tensions were rising on the streets of Washington, D.C., soon after Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.

They allege FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and the Justice Department terminated them based on a perception of the agents that they were ""not affiliated with President Trump.""

The lawsuit recounts the actions the former agents say they took on June 4, 2020, just over a week after Floyd was killed. That day, as they were patrolling the district, the agents ""were confronted by a mob that included hostile individuals alongside families with young children,"" the lawsuit said.

""The Special Agents closest to the mob were the first to kneel,"" the plaintiffs' suit said. ""Their intent was to prevent a dangerous situation in which confrontational or unwitting civilians might make physical contact with agents or even attempt to gain control.""

And the former agents also contend that they had not been issued ""sufficient equipment for responding to civil unrest such as riot shields, gas masks, helmets, or other tactical gear.""

The former agents are not publicly named in the lawsuit and are referred to as Jane and John Does.

""Plaintiffs had been informed that the purpose of the deployment was to show a visible law enforcement presence, and they wore vests marked 'FBI' and carried their firearms,"" the lawsuit said. ""But they were not properly prepared or instructed to conduct crowd control operations."" It continued, ""As a result of their tactical decision to kneel, the mass of people moved on without escalating to violence.""

Mary Dohrmann, an attorney representing the agents in the lawsuit, told CBS News, ""Internal FBI processes are being subverted in a way that makes us all less safe.""

An FBI spokesperson told CBS News the bureau does not comment on pending litigation, and the FBI did not comment when CBS News reported in September that agents had been fired for kneeling in 2020.

The civil case is filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The fired FBI agents include counterterrorism specialists and agents with more than 15 years' experience in combating criminals.

According to the lawsuit, ""Plaintiff Jane Doe 5 was informed that she was being removed at the direction of Defendant Patel from her position at FBI Headquarters as a Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI overseeing counterintelligence at the direction of Defendant Patel because she kneeled on June 4, 2020.""

Their civil case argues that Patel's statements show ""his actions in this case were motivated by partisan animus toward plaintiffs and not by a fair evaluation of the facts on June 4, 2020.""

The former agents cited Patel's book, ""Government Gangsters,"" in which he wrote that some government employees should ""be removed from their posts and replaced with people who won't undermine the president's agenda.""

They spent several weeks inside a family ICE detention center and were released on parole in early summer.
The family had settled in New York City and Yuanxin had just started first grade at a public school in Astoria, Queens.","More than 200 people rallied Sunday in support of a Chinese father who is in immigration detention while his 6-year-old son is in being held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement following a routine immigration appointment in New York City.

Fei Zheng and his son, Yuanxin, showed up to the offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York City on Nov. 26 for a routine check-in, according to Jennie Spector, a community activist who coordinated two volunteers to accompany Zheng and Yuanxin to the appointment. The volunteers waited for Zheng and his son outside the ICE offices, since they’re not allowed inside check-ins.

“They never heard from him,” Spector told NBC News on Monday. “After a number of hours, we kind of assumed that they had been arrested.”

Zheng was taken to the Orange County Correctional Facility, where he remained in immigration custody as of Monday, and his son was transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds unaccompanied immigrant children, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

A child taken into ORR custody is placed with an ORR-approved guardian, similar to a foster family, or taken to an ORR facility. It is unclear exactly where ORR is holding the boy.

Spector, who receives calls from Zheng while he is in detention, said the father was able to briefly speak with his son over the weekend. That was his first time hearing his son’s voice since they were separated on Thanksgiving eve, Spector said.

“He was able to be put in touch with his son, but he doesn’t know exactly where he is or what kind of place he is living in,” Spector said. “No one has confirmed that to him.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News in an email that “ICE does not separate families,” but places minors and adults in custody as “consistent with past administrations immigration enforcement.”

According to McLaughlin, Zheng and Yuanxin are Chinese nationals who are living in the United States without authorization and “were given a lawful order of removal as a family unit.”

Mike Gao, an attorney for Zheng, previously told The New York Times that his client had refused to board an ICE flight to China in September because he feared government retribution there. Gao did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.

“Mr. Zheng refused to board the plane and was acting so disruptive and aggressive that he endangered the child’s wellbeing,” McLaughlin said, adding that the father “had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully choose to not comply.”

“To be clear, refusing a judge’s deportation order is a crime. As a result, the child was placed with ORR Custody,” McLaughlin said.

Over 200 people, many of them members of Yuanxin’s school community, attended Sunday’s protest, according to Devora Fein, a leader of the western Queens chapter of Indivisible, a group that opposes the Trump administration’s immigration policies and which organized the rally.

They gathered at a playground in Astoria, where children and adults were seen holding signs that read: “Kids Aren’t Pawns” and “Kids Belong In School Not In Detention.”

“They wanted a place to come together to voice their outrage, to be among others who are feeling the same and want to send this message to Trump and ICE that this is unacceptable,” Fein told NBC News on Monday. “We cannot pull children into this horrible game.”

Community advocates reached out to Democratic Reps. Nydia Velazquez and Grace Meng, both of New York, as well as New York City Council Member Julie Won to request help locating Yuanxin and push federal authorities to reunite the boy with his father.

“We are pushing for answers and doing everything we can to support this family during this incredibly difficult time. Our offices have been in touch with the attorneys for Fei and Yuanxin and with the appropriate city and federal agencies,” Velazquez, Meng and Won said in a joint statement Friday. “At this time, though there are legal limits on what can be shared publicly.”

The Democratic lawmakers added: “Immigration proceedings should not end with a family being torn apart and a 6-year-old child separated from his parent. Families must never be used as leverage to force deportations. Situations like this traumatize immigrant communities and sow distrust of the government.”

According to the local news outlet The City, which first reported on the case, Zheng first attempted to cross the southern border with Yuanxin in April to seek asylum in the United States. They spent several weeks inside a family ICE detention center and were released on parole in early summer. They were arrested again at an August ICE check-in and returned to Dilley Immigration Processing Center, the family detention center where the two had previously been held.

Online records of the Executive Office for Immigration Review show Zheng and Yuanxin had an immigration court hearing on Sept. 8 while they remained detained. According to The City, a judge administratively closed their asylum case during that hearing, often considered a sign that DHS is not actively seeking the person’s deportation.

The father and son were then released on Oct. 24, Spector told NBC News. “They were given parole for a year, and then just a month into that they were arrested again,” she said. The family had settled in New York City and Yuanxin had just started first grade at a public school in Astoria, Queens.

One of Yuanxin’s teachers showed up to Sunday’s rally and delivered an impromptu message, Fein said. The teacher said the 6-year-old boy loves making puppets and playing with them and described him as “incredibly good at math for a first grader.”

EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — Human rights groups, including the ACLU, Texas Civil Rights and Human Rights Watch, sent a letter on Monday, Dec. 8 to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to quit detaining migrants at Camp East Montana on Fort Bliss property.

The groups summarized in the letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

Camp East Montana opened on Fort Bliss property last summer.

Other alleged abuses included beatings, coercive threats to compel to deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other violations, the groups said.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has been critical of the migrant facility numerous times after talking to detainees there after it opened.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, the human rights groups said.

Numerous detained people told lawyers that officers have engaged in a widespread and “unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force,” the human rights groups said.

According to the human rights groups, one detained teenager, going by the pseudonym Samuel, told lawyers he was beaten by officers so badly that he suffered injuries across his body, lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital by ambulance.

The letter relays Samuel’s account that his right front tooth broke from the force of being slammed to the ground, and as Samuel attests, one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.”

Samuel went on to say that while he was feeling “dizzy” and was “fighting to remain conscious,” an officer laughed at Samuel for having a chipped tooth after being slammed to the ground and told Samuel he was “like a little girl.” Samuel said that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear is so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

In the letter, the groups also reiterate their calls to immediately halt deportations of people to third countries to which they have no ties.

Interviewees said that at Fort Bliss, the prospect of such removals has taken on a particularly abusive character, according to the human rights groups.

People detained attested that officers at Fort Bliss have beaten detained people and used the threat of violence, criminal charges, and imprisonment in attempts to coerce non-Mexican immigrants held at Fort Bliss to cross the border into the Mexican desert, the human rights groups said.

Isaac, a Cuban immigrant held at Fort Bliss, attested in a sworn declaration that officers told him that he was going to be deported to Mexico. Isaac told lawyers that, “the guards hit my head” and “slammed it against the wall approximately 10 times.”

He also said that officers grabbed and crushed his testicles between their fingers, and that soon after, officers handcuffed Isaac and approximately 20 other people, placed them on a bus, and drove them to the border, where they were told they could get off the bus and cross into Mexico. Isaac added that officers told them, “If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa.”

Isaac is also using a pseudonym to protect his identity.

The letter – which was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Mexico, ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, and Texas Civil Rights Project — also follows widespread media coverage detailing abusive conditions.

In September 2025, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Fort Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

The human rights groups say the “Trump administration hastily opened the sprawling tent camp in August 2025, despite warnings from members of Congress and advocates that the facility would be a humanitarian disaster. The facility is located on the military base formerly used to intern people of Japanese descent during World War II and currently holds over 2,700 people, making it the country’s largest immigration detention center.”

Ricardo said he fled Cuba, first arriving in Houston, Texas, to get away from an oppressive regime.

“I am grateful for all the good that this country has always provided to people,” Ricardo said through a translator in his Bristol home Monday.

He was set to take his citizenship examination on Nov. 12 but had to postpone that appointment because of emergency open heart surgery. His new test date was set for Jan. 6, 2026.

Ricardo, 59, then got a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services last week informing him that his appointment was canceled.

“It’s unimaginable how much a person can suffer, with things happening inside their body – in pain, in anxiety, in depression,” he said. “And then, as if that weren’t enough, receiving news like the one I received at that moment was something truly devastating.”

The USCIS letter did not give a reason for the cancellation.

NBC Connecticut reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but the agency did not provide a comment Monday.

USCIS did issue a Dec. 2 memo ordering a pause on all immigration for people from 19 countries, including applications for citizenship.

The memo came after an Afghan refugee allegedly shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., killing one.

“Recently, the United States has seen what a lack of screening, vetting, and prioritizing expedient adjudications can do to the American people,” the agency wrote in the policy memorandum.

The order pauses applications for people who entered the U.S. from one of the 19 countries on or after Jan. 20, 2021, but also allows for additional review for people who entered before that date.

Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, continue to criticize the Trump administration’s immigration pause.

“We are a nation of immigrants,” Rep. John Larso (D-1st District) said in a statement. “(President) Donald Trump and (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem’s extreme immigration application ban has nothing to do with national security – it is discrimination.”

Ricardo, meanwhile, hopes the immigration process will resume and he’s able to get a new appointment for his citizenship test.

He’s been in Connecticut for three years, now living with a son who also came from Cuba.

Ricardo is waiting for his citizenship so he can retire and collect social security once he’s eligible.

He’s worked as a truck driver and for a tree removal service.

Slaughter, a case about President Donald Trump’s authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission.
Slaughter sued, and quickly won a federal court order blocking her firing.
And in September, his allies on the Supreme Court temporarily lifted the lower court’s order and let him fire Slaughter, federal law be damned.
“I really don’t understand why the agencies aren’t answering to Congress,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
For all their feigned concerns about democratic accountability, the only actor with governing authority is the Court.","The Supreme Court heard oral argument today in Trump v. Slaughter, a case about President Donald Trump’s authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC is the federal agency charged with protecting the public from unfair business practices. In order to defend the agency’s ability to do so without interference from the president, Congress passed a law in 1914 that explicitly says FTC Commissioners can only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Yet in March, Trump fired Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter anyway, declaring that their continued service would be “inconsistent” with his administration’s policies. In a statement, Bedoya took a guess as to what those policies entail: “The president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies.”

Nearly a century ago, in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld statutory removal protections of independent agency officials as constitutional. Slaughter sued, and quickly won a federal court order blocking her firing. Nevertheless, Trump argued that for-cause removal restrictions are unconstitutional. And in September, his allies on the Supreme Court temporarily lifted the lower court’s order and let him fire Slaughter, federal law be damned.

During oral argument in Slaughter on Monday, the Republican justices left no doubt of their intentions to finish what they started. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, for instance, said “there’s been an eroding of Humphrey’s Executor over the years,” while Justice Neil Gorsuch contended that Humphrey’s was “poorly reasoned” from the start. “Humphrey’s Executor is just a dried husk of whatever people used to think it was,” said Chief Justice John Roberts.

The question is not whether the 90-year-old precedent in Humphrey’s Executor is going down, but how much of the administrative state’s ability to make decisions based on the public’s best interests rather than President Trump’s interests will go down with it. When the Republican justices invited the Trump administration to explain the purported dangers of independent agencies, Solicitor General D. John Sauer emphasized that “the president is answerable to the voters” but agencies “have no boss.” According to Sauer, the president “must have the power to control” administrative agencies, and “the one who has the power to remove is the person that they have to fear and obey.” The Republican justices accepted this explanation without pushback.

Throughout oral argument, the Trump administration and the Court’s conservatives treated administrative agencies as some kind of headless, out-of-control fourth branch of government, accountable to no one. The problem with this idea of wholly unconstrained agencies is that agencies are in fact subject to constraints—principally, from the lawmakers that created the agencies to begin with. “I really don’t understand why the agencies aren’t answering to Congress,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Congress established them and can eliminate them. Congress funds them and can stop.” The real problem is not about a lack of reins, but about who is holding the reins. The Republican justices are eager to make it the president—unless and until the president is a Democrat, of course.

Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the Trump administration that “unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,” he claimed that the Court has “taken great steps” to limit Congress making “broad delegations,” specifically through its invention of the “major questions doctrine.” Much like how the federal government came to the rescue of banks during the 2008 financial crisis by declaring them “too big to fail,” the Supreme Court has taken to effectively declaring some (generally liberal) executive actions too big to be legal. As Kavanaugh put it today, the major questions doctrine prevents the Court from “being casual about assuming that Congress has delegated major questions of political or economic significance.”

Kavanaugh’s invocation of the major questions doctrine reveals just how little the Court respects Congress and the presidency as co-equal branches of government. The Court’s Republicans are happy to completely disregard the express, codified will of Congress, allowing their preferred president to neutralize agencies’ regulatory functions by firing people willy-nilly. But when a different president appoints different people to those agencies—people who may actually be interested in using the state’s capacity to protect the public—then the Supreme Court retains the power to swoop back in, and use the major questions doctrine to strike their actions down.

At the same time, Trump’s executive order would affect everyone in America, not only immigrants.
That Trump was able to push the litigation as far as he has is, in itself, a victory for those who have long campaigned to undermine birthright citizenship.","Maybe, if the country is lucky, the Supreme Court has decided to hear the case of Trump v. Barbara because it wants to reiterate something that the Constitution, federal law, and its own previous rulings have already clearly said, just more loudly, so that even the President can hear it: virtually all babies born in America are American citizens. The case is Donald Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that threw out an executive order he issued in January, in which he declared that a large number of babies born here each year—estimates range to the hundreds of thousands—are not citizens. Why? Because he said so. When the Justices announced, on Friday, that they would hear him out, rather than simply turning the appeal down flat, they didn’t give an explanation. It takes four Justices out of the nine to grant cert (the technical term for taking a case), but their motives might be mixed. Some conservative Justices may want to let the President down easy, with a display of deference before ruling against him, and some liberals may want the opportunity to come down hard in defense of the babies. Maybe the Justices, who are not without vanity, just want to expound a bit. Perhaps they’ve already worked out some resounding phrases in their heads.

All those possibilities would be preferable to another one: that a critical mass of Justices has become convinced that there is a question about birthright citizenship, and that they are willing to upend our long-shared understanding of what it means to be born an American. With this Court, at this moment, it would be reckless to ignore that prospect. Ted Cruz and eight other Republican senators have submitted an amicus brief that largely supports Trump’s order; so have the attorneys general of twenty-four states. Even the more benign rationales for the Supreme Court taking the case carry with them the cost of leaving the impression that birthright citizenship is an unsettled matter. The wait for a ruling in Trump v. Barbara—which will likely come in June or July, after oral arguments this spring—will be one more destabilizing element in our already chaotic national scene.

Another case related to the executive order, Trump v. CASA, was decided by the Court in June, but that one did not address the substance of the order. Instead, it was about whether lower-court judges could use what are known as universal, or nationwide, injunctions to stop it from going into effect. The Court said that they could not. (Trump v. Barbara is a class-action suit, on behalf of babies born after the executive order; this, along with a case brought by Washington and other states, has allowed judges to put a hold on the order even without a universal injunction.) When CASA was argued, the executive order’s opponents suggested that the Administration might never appeal its various lower-court defeats, because it must know that it would lose—the order was so clearly unconstitutional. “If I were in your shoes, there is no way I’d approach the Supreme Court with this case,” Justice Elena Kagan said at the time to D. John Sauer, the Solicitor General, who argued that case for the Administration. But, when Justice Gorsuch asked Sauer if he would appeal if Trump lost in the lower courts, Sauer said, “Absolutely.” And he has. The question now is what, if anything, Trump thinks he can win.

The big prize for the White House, of course, would be an end to birthright citizenship, which many conservatives and opponents of immigration have come to deeply resent, with talk of “anchor babies” and demographic doom. Unfortunately for them, birthright citizenship is not some misty, novel concept or expansion of ill-defined rights. It is the hard promise, in plain language, of the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to previously enslaved Black Americans but was recognized from the beginning as having a broader effect. The citizenship clause reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

The opponents of birthright citizenship hang their arguments, such as they are, on the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” In 1898, which was only thirty years after the amendment was ratified, the Supreme Court ruled definitively on the meaning of that phrase in the case of Wong Kim Ark, a man born in California to Chinese immigrants who were precluded from becoming citizens by the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Court ruled that the only babies born in the U.S. but not “subject” to its jurisdiction in this sense were those born to “foreign sovereigns” or diplomats (for example, if a French ambassador happened to give birth in the U.S.); or those born on a foreign-government-owned ship within U.S. territorial borders; or those born to “enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory.” The “single additional exception,” the Court said, was the case of children born to certain Native American tribes, based on treaty relations that they then had with the federal government.

The Native American exception was, at the time, the most consequential, and had its own dark history. It was, however, for the most part done away with as a result of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. One fascinating aspect of Trump v. Barbara will be seeing what Justice Neil Gorsuch—a conservative who is also, somewhat idiosyncratically, an expert on and champion of tribal legal rights—makes of Wong Kim Ark’s legacy. In sum, Wong’s was a landmark case, not an obscure one, and the Court referred back to it in the decades that followed; its majority opinion in a 1957 case, for example, notes that a baby born to parents in the United States illegally “is, of course, an American citizen by birth.” Legislators shared that understanding of birthright citizenship when Congress incorporated the Fourteenth Amendment’s language into federal law, in 1940 and 1952.

Trump’s executive order represents a complete break with that history. It says that a baby is not a citizen if the mother has no legal status, or if her status is legal but only temporary (for example, if she is on a work or student visa), and if the father is not a citizen or legal permanent resident. Incredibly, the Administration, in its petition to the Supreme Court, argues not only that the order is legal but that the Court can uphold it without overruling the Wong Kim Ark precedent, which it claims has been “misread” for more than a hundred years.

In defense of this indefensible position, the Administration notes that Justice Horace Gray, who wrote the majority opinion in the case, mentioned a number of times that Wong Kim Ark’s parents were “resident” or “domiciled” in the United States. But, as the lawyers for the Barbara babies have argued, Gray went further, saying that anyone residing in the U.S. is clearly subject to its jurisdiction and, importantly, that those here just temporarily are subject to it, too. (Again, the narrow exceptions had to do with diplomats, invaders, and Native Americans.) If you are in the U.S. just temporarily, as a tourist or a student, say, you are still bound by American laws and the government’s authority.

Yet the Administration not only acts as if residency is a magic condition but offers a completely illogical and contradictory definition of what residency is. If parental residency is a requirement, then Trump’s lawyers are making a pretty good case for the citizenship of babies whose parents have lived established lives in this country for years or decades—whatever their legal status. But the Administration’s brief slips between the terms “resident” and “lawful permanent resident,” as if they meant the same thing. And if a parent acting unlawfully, perhaps by staying in the U.S. despite a deportation order, precludes a baby’s citizenship, why are the children of native-born criminals unquestionably citizens? (Actually, one might worry about how Trump would answer that question.)

For example, Sarah (as she is known in Court papers), a baby who is one of the parties in Trump v. Barbara, was born in Utah earlier this year to a mother from Taiwan who has lived in the United States for more than a decade and has a student visa. The idea that Sarah is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is absurd on its face. Indeed, this Administration has argued that noncitizens are in some ways hyper-subject to its jurisdiction—that it has more of a right to monitor them and limit their freedoms than it does in the case of citizens.

Still, the focus on residency and legal status may point to a possible consolation prize for Trump in this litigation. He may not end birthright citizenship across the board, but perhaps he can turn the various, differently situated groups affected by his executive order against one another—with parents who are holders of H-1B visas arguing that they should not be grouped in with parents who have no legal status; people who arrived here as children saying that they are more clearly resident than students or people with temporary protected status; and everyone trying to avoid being connected to a country with a travel ban. There is enough division already without such quarrels.

At the same time, Trump’s executive order would affect everyone in America, not only immigrants. How is any baby supposed to prove the citizenship or legal status of its parents? In the months since the CASA decision, the Administration has put together some “guidance” to help answer that question; it’s an unhelpful mishmash of talk about hospitals collecting the parents’ Social Security numbers to check citizenship status (an imperfect system, particularly for green-card holders) when the babies are born and about the production of U.S. passports (which only about fifty per cent of Americans have). Ominously, there is a reference to resolving problems via a national 800 number that will connect parents to “updated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology to route them to a self-service option.”

Another possibility is that the Supreme Court could definitively throw out the executive order—but do so in a way that leaves room for Congress, though not the President, to redefine the meaning of the citizenship clause. Or the Court could chip away at the edges, perhaps with some ambiguous language deploring so-called “birth tourism.” At this rate, the Administration’s next move might be to try denying citizenship to babies born in neighborhoods that it says are under occupation by foreign gangs. That Trump was able to push the litigation as far as he has is, in itself, a victory for those who have long campaigned to undermine birthright citizenship. With Trump v. Barbara, the Supreme Court has made itself a part of the fight. The Justices will now have to either stand by the American babies whom Trump wants the country to disown, or join him in abandoning them. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6936f382a7df430610883e1b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Sorkin-GettyImages-2244625931.jpg",N,,2025-12-08 18:58:49.031110

Eshun secured U.S. citizenship under a provision reserved for U.S. servicemembers that requires the servicemember to serve honorably for at least five years. After he naturalized, the U.S. Marine Corps court-martialed and dishonorably discharged Eshun for attempted sexual abuse of someone he believed to be fourteen years old.

“As alleged, this defendant betrayed the uniform, abused the trust of this nation, and targeted who he believed was a child,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. “Under strong leadership, this Department is using every lawful tool to protect the American people and to ensure that citizenship is not a shield for criminals who never deserved it in the first place. If you commit heinous crimes, you will be held accountable. This is how we make America safe again.”

“Today’s denaturalization against Nicholas Eshun, a court-martialed sex offender, demonstrates the United States’ commitment to using every tool available under the law to pursue those who obtain their U.S. citizenship unlawfully,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Thanks to the intrepid investigators of NCIS, we now know the danger this man poses to this country. He is no longer serving as a Marine. There is no lawful basis for him to keep the citizenship he secured as one.”

Ten months after immigrating to the United States, Eshun enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in October 2011. In 2013, he naturalized under a statute that expedites U.S. citizenship for individuals serving in the U.S. armed forces. But two years later, while serving overseas, Eshun tarnished the honor of the Marine Corps by exchanging lewd messages with someone whom he believed to be a fourteen-year-old girl and by attempting to sexually abuse her. Eshun was, in fact, communicating with an undercover officer with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. His actions resulted in his court-martial and conviction. On May 16, 2016, the Marine Corps dishonorably discharged Eshun after 4 ½ years of service. Defendant is thus subject to denaturalization under 8 U.S.C. § 1440(c), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to servicemembers who naturalize through military service but who are dishonorably discharged without serving honorably for at least five years.

This case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Hans H. Chen of the Justice Department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, Affirmative Litigation Unit, with assistance from the U.S. Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division, U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland.",https://www.justice.gov/themes/custom/usdoj_uswds/images/metatag-image--press-release.png,N,,2025-12-08 18:58:52.920149

Recently, the ACLU released a harrowing letter documenting the neglect and abuse pregnant and postpartum women endure in ICE custody. Working alongside the National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, and other advocacy organizations, the ACLU interviewed women detained while pregnant and in October presented their accounts to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the joint coalition letter. The coalition urged ICE to immediately release all pregnant and postpartum people from detention. In response, ICE dismissed the findings. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin expressly stated the coalition letter relied on “anonymous, unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims.”

What the letter reported is chilling. Women described being shackled and placed in solitary confinement. They recounted delayed or substandard prenatal care and being denied basic necessities such as prenatal vitamins, adequate food, and clean water. Others underwent medical procedures without informed consent or access to translation services. Most disturbing of all, women who were actively miscarrying, an already physically painful and emotionally shattering experience, said they were ignored entirely by facility staff. Several later developed serious infections as a direct result of ICE’s medical neglect.

None of this is new. In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff released the Senate investigation ”The Abuse of Pregnant Women & Children in U.S. Immigration Detention,” which documented widespread mistreatment of individuals in DHS custody including physical and sexual abuse, and pervasive medical neglect of children. The investigation identified 14 credible reports of abuse involving pregnant women alone.

Their accounts echo what the American Civil Liberties Union has now brought forward: pregnant women forced to sleep on floors, denied medical care, and left to miscarry without assistance. One woman reportedly bled for days before finally being taken to a hospital, only to be left alone for more than 24 hours as she miscarried. Others were told to “just drink water” instead of receiving required medical exams, while some waited weeks for appointments that were ultimately canceled.

In response to Ossoff’s investigation, DHS released a statement claiming that “pregnant women [in their care] receive regular prenatal visits, mental-health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care,” and asserting that no woman has been forced to sleep on the floor.

But these denials cannot erase the consistent, detailed testimonies of multiple women.

None of this should be happening. ICE’s own policies make that clear. Under ICE Directive 11032.4, which remains in effect, pregnant and postpartum people are not supposed to be detained at all, and if ICE discovers someone is pregnant or postpartum after arrest, they are supposed to be released, unless an “exceptional circumstance” truly exists.

So what qualifies as “exceptional”? The directives define only a few narrow situations where detention is permitted: when a person poses a national security threat or presents an imminent risk of death, violence, or physical harm to someone else.

Are we really to believe that every pregnant woman reporting neglect—every woman forced to sleep on a floor, denied medical care, or left to miscarry—met these extreme criteria?

Currently the true number of pregnant and postpartum detention is largely unknown. The Women’s Refugee Commission states oversight has become nearly impossible due to curtailed access to facilities and the lapse of a congressional mandate requiring ICE to regularly report how many pregnant people it detains.

And even in the circumstances where putting these women into detention or keeping them in detention is legally permissible, ICE’s obligations are strict. The directives require enhanced monitoring of the individuals’ general health and well-being to ensure appropriate pre- and/or postnatal and other medical and mental health care. ICE also must ensure they are housed in facilities suitable for their medical and mental health needs.

In short, the law does not merely discourage the detention of pregnant people, it pretty much prohibits it without exceptional circumstances. When ICE detains them anyway and keeps them detained, and then fails to provide even the most basic care—as laid out in the ACLU report—it is violating not only humanitarian principles but its own written policies.

What’s more, ICE’s treatment of pregnant and postpartum women isn’t just a violation of its own directives—it’s unconstitutional. The Constitution protects all persons within U.S. borders, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. The Supreme Court has confirmed that undocumented people qualify as “persons” under the Fifth and 14th Amendments, and therefore receive constitutional protections such as due process and equal protection.

Together, these constitutional protections make one thing unmistakable: Women in DHS and ICE custody have a constitutional right to adequate medical care, to ensure their safety, and to be given humane treatment. And the government has a constitutional duty to provide it.

When the United States takes a pregnant woman into custody, it assumes full responsibility for her safety. Denying medical care is not a policy choice—it is a constitutional violation.

You do not need to be “pro-immigrant” to care that women in U.S. custody are left to miscarry on concrete floors, ignored while bleeding, or denied water and prenatal vitamins. This is not “free health care for immigrants.” It is the bare minimum of humane treatment required by law.

ICE is perpetrating clear and ongoing human-rights violations, enabled by this country’s indifference and hostility toward immigrants.

We once claimed to be a model for humane treatment. Yet today, ICE points guns at pregnant women before establishing any cause to detain them. We watch a man appear to suffer a seizure while holding his daughter as agents arrest his wife, then watch officials publicly accuse him of faking it.

ICE does not need new rules. It already has them: clear directives, constitutional duties. It simply refuses to follow them. This is not an isolated failure. It is a pattern, a system that has normalized cruelty. These are not bureaucratic errors or “oversights” that can be fixed with tighter procedures. They are acts of cruelty that meet the moral threshold of crimes against humanity. And they are happening right in front of us. ICE must immediately end the detention of pregnant and postpartum people and comply with its constitutional and moral responsibilities.

The real question is whether we are still capable of protecting what remains of the American conscience, or whether it has already been hollowed out in the name of politics.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b07a07f5-8e7e-4360-a107-ba45809218bf.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:46.948773

Ferreira, 33, had a relationship with Leavitt’s brother, 35-year-old Michael Leavitt.
They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11.
Ferreira told the Post that she also “moved mountains” to ensure her son could attend Karoline Leavitt’s wedding to real estate developer Nicholas Riccio in early January.
Ferreira also said she approved her son to attend the White House Easter egg hunt in the spring.","The Brazilian-born mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew – who was recently detained by US immigration authorities – has rejected the Trump administration’s characterizations of her as an absentee parent.

Bruna Ferreira, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in November during a traffic stop in Massachusetts and was being held at a Louisiana detention center, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the White House’s statements that she had never lived with her son or spoken with Leavitt “in many years” were incorrect.

Ferreira, 33, had a relationship with Leavitt’s brother, 35-year-old Michael Leavitt. They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11.

She said she was offended by the White House’s characterizations, calling them “disgusting”. She said she takes her son to Dave & Buster’s, a food and video games chain; ferries him to school, cheers at sports games; and fills his bedroom with “everything a young boy needs”.

Ferreira told the Post that she also “moved mountains” to ensure her son could attend Karoline Leavitt’s wedding to real estate developer Nicholas Riccio in early January. Ferreira also said she approved her son to attend the White House Easter egg hunt in the spring.

“I asked Karoline to be godmother [to Michael Jr] over my only sister,” she told the Post. “I made a mistake there, in trusting.

“Why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

The differentiated accounts came as Ferreira was released on a $1,500 bond on Monday after immigration judge Cynthia Goodman ordered that she be freed on the lowest-dollar bail possible, according to her lawyers. Attorney Jason Thomas told the judge that the government’s characterization of his client was “both unfair and untrue”.

A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not object to Ferreira’s release and said he agreed with her lawyers that she was not a danger to society or a flight risk, the Washington Post reported.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed Ferreira’s detention in November followed a prior arrest for battery. The DHS spokesperson said the tourist visa with which Ferreira gained entry into the US required her to leave on 6 June 1999.

Ferreira came to the US from Brazil with her family when she was six years old. DHS officials have not produced records relating to her alleged arrest for battery.

Ferreira’s lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, told the Post his client had no criminal record, with immigration authorities possibly alluding to an incident when she was summoned to juvenile court after a fight outside a Dunkin’ Donuts over $8 in 2008. Pomerleau said the case was dismissed and did not amount to criminality because Ferreira, then 16, was a juvenile.

She told the outlet that she had met the elder Michael Leavitt at a nightclub. They fell in love, got engaged, had a child, and lived together – but instead of marrying they broke up in 2015 and have since shared parenting responsibilities.

Ferreira has alleged in court documents that her son’s father had threatened in the past to try to get her deported. Leavitt, in a text exchange with the Post, denied seeking to have her deported.

“I had no involvement in her being picked up by ice,” he reportedly wrote on Wednesday to the outlet. “I have no control over that and had no involvement in that whatsoever.” He also said that he wanted their son “to have a relationship with his mother as I always have shown that”.

Ferreira told the Post that other potential deportees in the detention center had questioned her about her relationship with the White House press secretary, including asking: “Did she not like you?”

“Your guess is as good as mine,” Ferreira said she responded.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9f2cb1430b078e1e0fa2a57db9482e9729635e/0_45_854_683/master/854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3ad52cbeaa77724e519078c88eb2ebb",N,,2025-12-08 17:56:36.251603

In order to do so, a party must allege and ultimately prove more than a simple breach of contract.

Typically, however, a mere breach of contract claim does not give rise to a Chapter 93A claim. In order to do so, a party must allege and ultimately prove more than a simple breach of contract. The conduct alleged must cross the line into an unfair and deceptive business practice where the breaching party attempts to secure benefits for themselves in disregard of known contractual arrangements.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court recently examined this long-standing principle in Filzer v. Pitsick LLC. During a zoning litigation dispute in Massachusetts Land Court, a developer and the owners and abutters of the properties at issue entered into a settlement agreement that agreed to “compromise their differences without further litigation.” Among other things, the agreement required the developer to pay the abutters an agreed upon fee; pursue, with the abutters’ support, a special permit to reconfigure the property at issue; record restrictive covenants and perform restoration work; and ultimately dismiss the ongoing Land Court action once the other conditions in the agreement were met. The parties did not disclose the settlement agreement to the Land Court. The Land Court subsequently issued a decision prior to completion of the terms in the agreement, and as a result, the developer took the position that the rulings rendered the settlement “null and void.”

The abutters then brought this action for breach of the settlement agreement and violation of Chapter 93A. The Appeals Court affirmed the finding that the developer violated Chapter 93A when it attempted to leverage a better deal for themselves against the owners and abutters disregarding the terms of the settlement agreement. In finding the developer acted unfairly, the Court focused on the developer’s refusal to provide written assurances that it would honor the settlement agreement, its attempts to renegotiate a better deal after the Land Court ruling, its declaration that the settlement agreement was void without following the procedures outlined in the agreement, and its refusal to allow its lender to disburse the agreed upon settlement payment. The Court found this conduct crossed the line from a mere contract dispute into one where the developer used improper leverage as a wedge to gain an advantage over the owners and abutters.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-12/Massachusetts%20MA%20Flag%20Gavel%20Litigation%20Court%20State-95720414.jpg.webp?itok=_plxhcHD,N,,2025-12-08 17:57:02.532776

His right front tooth broke, and he said one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” He added that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear was so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

Samuel’s is just one of dozens of accounts of abuse from the immigration detention site at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas. These accounts reveal an unfolding humanitarian crisis at the military base — one which may spread across the country as the Trump administration expands detention dangerously, recklessly and with unprecedented speed.

Human rights organizations, including the ACLU, sent a letter Monday to U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) detailing accounts of violent assaults and sexual abuse by officers. It also reveals details of other forms of intimidation used to pressure detained immigrants into self-deporting or agreeing to removal to third countries where they have no ties. The findings are based on interviews with more than 45 people currently held at Fort Bliss, and the letter includes 16 signed declarations by people detained at the facility.

ICE began detaining people at Fort Bliss three months ago, while the site was still an active construction zone. Fort Bliss is the largest detention facility in the country, holding roughly 3,000 people, just a few thousand shy of its planned maximum capacity. Immigrants are housed in tent structures in the extreme El Paso heat. This tent camp, built on a former Japanese internment camp, marked the Trump administration's novel approach to expanding the immigration detention system in its second term. Fort Bliss is the administration’s first detention facility at a military base, but likely not the last. With a $1.2 billion price tag, the facility marks a pivotal point in the Trump administration’s effort to use the U.S. military, in this case its bases, as a central tool of immigration enforcement.

Detained Immigrants Describe Alarming Conditions at Fort Bliss

Since its opening, media reports and stories from people detained affirm the conditions, rights violations, and deliberate opacity the ACLU warned would follow the opening of this site. Recent reporting reveals alarming conditions at Fort Bliss. The site has already racked up 60 violations of federal detention standards within its first 50 days of operation.

Each pod holds 60–70 people who report chronic food shortages, with meals sufficient for only about 50 individuals. People are forced to ration food, skip meals, or take turns eating — and when food is available, it is often spoiled or partially frozen, causing widespread vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid weight loss. Basic hygiene supplies are scarce: pods receive only a handful of rolls of toilet paper, and people go days without soap, clean clothing, or access to functioning showers. Detainees describe tents and bathrooms flooded with foul water mixed with urine and feces, creating squalid and unsafe living conditions.

Access to medical care is equally alarming. Individuals with serious conditions report going days or weeks without prescribed medication or having medical requests ignored until someone collapses. They are named here using pseudonyms to protect their identities. Josefina, who has diabetes, describes receiving insulin at erratic intervals that cause dangerous spikes and crashes in her blood sugar. Fernando went 15 days without his prescribed blood pressure medication. Others, including Ignacio, who previously suffered a stroke, report blurry vision and other clear warning signs while officers fail to provide timely care. Detainees consistently say that staff do not respond to medical requests for days and that people must faint or bleed before receiving attention.

Extreme and unlawful use of force is also prominent at Fort Bliss. Several detained individuals have described violent assaults by officers, including sexual abuse. Ignacio, Samuel, and others report officers crushing their testicles during beatings — a tactic used while people were already restrained or after they refused coerced removal to Mexico. Abel, Benjamin, and Eduardo also reported being slammed, stomped on, or beaten when they expressed fear of being sent to Mexico or when they simply requested their medication. These are not isolated incidents; they reflect a pattern of brutality that violates even ICE’s minimal standards.

Access to counsel and legal services is similarly inadequate. When Fort Bliss opened, it relied almost entirely on tablets for visitation and attorney communication, offering no privacy for confidential legal calls. The facility has since modified its protocols, but legal service providers are now allowed to meet with only ten detainees per day — an impossible limitation for a population of roughly 3,000. Many still lack working PINs to call attorneys, and the so-called law library contains no legal materials.

These rights violations — layered on top of hazardous conditions such as leaking water, unstable infrastructure, filthy tents, and ongoing construction — paint a grim picture.

Fort Bliss Signals the Dangerous Future of Immigration Detention Under Trump

If this is the state of a brand-new, billion-dollar facility within its first 90 days, the outlook for the next wave of military-base detention centers is dire. As detention sites open every few weeks nationwide, the ACLU anticipates that Fort Dix in New Jersey will be the next military site the Trump administration will use for mass immigration detention. There have also been reports of ICE scouting a Coast Guard base in New York for immigration detention.

What we are witnessing at Fort Bliss is not an anomaly; it is a warning. The conditions at Fort Bliss reflect a broader pattern of ICE evading oversight and accountability. The facility is a failed experiment that exposes the dangers of rapidly expanding detention, minimal safeguards, limited transparency, and virtually no oversight.

Despite clear congressional authority to conduct announced or unannounced visits to ICE facilities, ICE continues to enforce a policy that requires congressional offices to give them a seven-day notice ahead of detention visits and routinely denies them access to Fort Bliss and other sites. During the recent government shutdown, ICE even classified its congressional relations staff as “non-essential” and furloughed them. As a result, ICE detention facilities turned into information blackout sites with no direct channels to learn about what was happening inside.

The grim reality unfolding at Fort Bliss should serve as a stark warning: the Trump administration’s mass detention surge is not just unsustainable, but fundamentally dangerous. What is happening at Fort Bliss today foreshadows the humanitarian crises that will follow at every new facility opened under this unchecked strategy. Unless policymakers, courts, and the public intervene now, Fort Bliss will not be an outlier; it will be remembered as the template. Congress must hold the Trump administration accountable and ensure ICE immediately halt detention at Fort Bliss, and cease expanding the use of military resources for immigration detention and enforcement.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/fort-bliss-welcome-sign-f.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:50.699449

Birthright Citizenship is currently guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment, and provides that persons born on U.S. soil are, with very limited exceptions[1], U.S. citizens.

The Birthright Citizenship Executive Order was signed as a “Day One” Executive Order on Jan. 20, 2025, as part of the Administration’s stated efforts to “protect the meaning and value of American citizenship.” The EO would prohibit conferring U.S. citizenship to children born on U.S. soil, whose mother is either unlawfully present in the U.S. or in the U.S. lawfully but in temporary status, and whose father is neither a U.S. Citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth.

Children born in the U.S. to parents without lawful status or those with lawful statuses including H-1B, TN, F-1, etc. would no longer automatically be U.S. citizens. The EO would also impact children born through Artificial Reproductive Technologies (ART), as the definition of mother/father is limited to immediate biological progenitors.

The new policy was to take effect as of Feb. 20, 2025, but implementation has been enjoined since Jan. 23, 2025, after multiple lawsuits were brought to court. While the Supreme Court previously reviewed, and ruled against, the legality of nationwide (or “universal”) injunctions issued by federal courts, the Court has agreed to review the legality of the Executive Order, under the U.S. Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment, and subsequent Wong Kim Ark[2] decision that “affirm[ed] the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.”

While an exact date has not yet been scheduled, the Court has indicated that it would fast-track review and could hear oral arguments as early as Spring 2026, for a decision by the time it goes to recess (late June/early July 2026).

The case, Trump v. Slaughter, arose from President Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling known as Humphrey's Executor upheld limits established by Congress that enabled the president to remove members of commissions like the FTC only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.

The Trump administration argues those limits violate the separation of powers. The FTC wields executive power, so the president should have the authority to fire its members for any reason, it says. Slaughter's attorneys argue the removal protections fall within Congress' power to determine the structure of the government, and say the administration's position would allow the president to upend many other longstanding independent agencies and commissions that have been established by Congress.

During oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, the three liberal justices defended the removal protections and warned that a decision in Mr. Trump's favor could cause chaos across the government. The court's conservatives, meanwhile, expressed skepticism with the argument that Congress could limit the president's ability to remove officials from the FTC and other independent agencies, opening the door to a ruling in the administration's favor.

Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter

Solicitor General D. John Sauer presented the case for the administration. He urged the justices to overturn the decision in Humphrey's Executor, saying it encroaches on the president's removal authority under Article II of the Constitution.

""Humphrey's must be overruled. It has become a decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions. It was grievously wrong when it was decided,"" Sauer said. ""It continues to generate confusion in the lower courts, and it continues to tempt Congress to erect, at the heart of our government, a headless fourth branch, insulated from political accountability and democratic control.""

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, were skeptical of Sauer's argument.

""You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,"" Sotomayor said.

She warned that a decision invalidating removal limits for members of the FTC could also put at risk the independence of other federal entities, such as the U.S. Tax Court and broader protections for the civil service. Slaughter's lawyers have warned that a ruling expanding presidential power over multi-member agencies could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, though the Supreme Court has indicated that it views the central bank differently.

Kagan zeroed in on the impacts of a decision overturning Humphrey's Executor, raising the prospect that a ruling striking down the precedent could be used to target protections for officials across the government: ""The question is, where does this lead? Where does it take you to, given what your primary rationale is? Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century … Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way.""

She noted that independent agencies also wield legislative and judicial powers and warned that expanding the president's control over them would put ""massive uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president"" and leave the nation with a leader who then has ""control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking in this country.""

Jackson said that Sauer is ""asking us to infer"" that the removal protections are unconstitutional based on the structure of the Constitution, ""and I don't know why we'd make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.""

The court's conservatives were more receptive to the Trump administration's arguments.

""I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.

Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that ""a lot of legislative power has moved into these agencies,"" but said that ""if they're now going to be controlled by the president, it seems to me all the more imperative to do something about it.""

Attorney Amit Agarwal presented Slaughter's case, and argued that the removal protections have a long tradition in American history. He said that Congress has a role in limiting how officials on independent commissions like the FTC can be removed.

""Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,"" Agarwal said.

Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas tested the boundaries of Agarwal's position, asking him whether Congress could transform Cabinet-level executive departments into multi-member commissions and limit the president's ability to fire their leaders. Agarwal said the Constitution would largely prohibit such a move, since Congress cannot limit the president's authority over officials who are wielding his ""conclusive and preclusive"" powers, which would apply to most departments.

Justice Samuel Alito was similarly skeptical of Agarwal's argument, saying that ""I don't know that you can make the argument that the logic of [Sauer's] argument is going to cause these allegedly revolutionary results without being prepared to explain more concretely than you have the limits of your own argument.""

Agarwal added later: ""We have a 111-year-old statute that was enacted by the people's elected representatives. It was signed into law by a president of the United States. It was unanimously affirmed by this court. And it's been followed by every single president since 1935 until the present. We don't need an abstract theory to tell us that the FTC Act is OK. It's the other side that needs to give you a really compelling theory to explain why, in our view, 200-plus years of precedent and history need to be abandoned.""

Gorsuch continued to probe Agarwal's position, hinting that he thought the line Agarwal was trying to draw to limit the president's power to remove officials was unwieldy: ""How are we supposed to decide which powers are exclusive? … What powers are going to fall in and what are going to fall out? Are we going to have just as much litigation over that as anything else we might do in this case?""

The background of Trump v. Slaughter

The case is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of that New Deal-era ruling in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have chipped away at that precedent. Most recently, the high court invalidated removal protections for leaders of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.

But the Slaughter case now gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to overturn that 90-year-old precedent entirely.

Since he returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the bounds of presidential power and moved to oust a host of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions, including Slaughter.

Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by former President Joe Biden, Slaughter received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her ""continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.""

Slaughter, like many other agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, filed a lawsuit arguing that her firing was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Her lawyers argue that Mr. Trump violated that law and Supreme Court precedent with the firing of Slaughter and a second commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya.

A federal district court sided with Slaughter and ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks later, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated to her role at the FTC once again.

The Supreme Court agreed in late September to hear the case and allowed Mr. Trump to fire Slaughter while it considers the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the FTC.

The Trump administration argued in filings that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him ""illimitable"" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. Removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president ""saddled with subordinate officers"" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, Sauer wrote.

While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers ""to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,"" Sauer wrote.

Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.

In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power and said Congress could impose removal restrictions for multimember agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, like the FTC.

But the Trump administration argued that since 1935, the FTC has accumulated executive powers. Today, the commission executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote in his filing.

More than 200 Democrats in Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. They wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that over the past 100 years, 15 different presidents from both parties have signed bills into law that created independent agencies.

Still, Mr. Trump has already seen some success at the Supreme Court in his bid to assert more control over these bodies. The high court's conservative majority has allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause while legal challenges to their removals moved forward.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/08/b79febee-3c14-432f-b07c-6d3f3e192433/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4175b7735f257e8fb424563dc96bb14d/gettyimages-2250109930.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:24.710880

Dec 8 (Reuters) - The developer of the most popular app used to share information about sightings of federal immigration agents sued the Trump administration on Monday, alleging free speech violations after Apple removed ICEBlock from its online store.

The lawsuit was filed in ​federal court by Joshua Aaron, the developer of the ICEBlock app that had over 1 million users before it was removed by Apple ‌in October following pressure from the Trump administration, a rare instance of a tech company removing an app based on a complaint from the U.S. federal government.

Aaron named Attorney General Pam Bondi, ‌Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Director Todd Lyons among other administration officials as defendants.

ICE agents have regularly raided businesses and other places to arrest migrants, even detaining them following immigration court hearings as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

People who oppose Trump's immigration agenda or who say they want to keep immigrants and others safe have used apps and other means to track and document ICE activities and warn people who might be at risk of being detained.

Aaron said he ⁠thinks the Trump administration is not just attacking his free ‌speech rights, but those of all citizens when it goes after apps like ICEBlock, and that he hoped his lawsuit helps stop the administration ""from eroding the Constitution.""

""When we see our government doing something wrong, it's our duty as citizens of this ‍nation to hold them accountable, and that is exactly what we're doing with this lawsuit,"" Aaron said.

The Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Aaron's suit. Apple, which is not named as a defendant, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

APPLE CITED ​LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION

When it removed the app from its store, Apple said it took action based on information from law enforcement about safety risks. The ‌Justice Department confirmed that it had contacted Apple to pull the app, and Bondi said in a statement at the time that ICEBlock was designed to put ICE agents at risk, which the developer strongly disputes.

The app, which is still functioning for people who downloaded it before its removal from app stores, allows users to report publicly observable activity of federal immigration agents and their locations. Aaron, in his lawsuit, argues that the function is similar to what mapping apps like Waze and others do when they allow users to report the locations of police.

The lawsuit says Aaron submitted the app to Apple for approval and that ⁠it had been available through the company's app store since April of this year ​before being removed.

Legal experts have told Reuters that surveillance of immigration agents is largely protected under ​the U.S. Constitution - as long people don't interfere with the agents' work or encourage others to do so. Courts have long held that recording law enforcement activities in public areas is legal.

The suit cites a message Apple sent to Aaron that said ""information provided ‍to Apple by law enforcement"" showed ⁠that his app violated the company's guidelines ""because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.""

Aaron told Reuters earlier this year that his app in no way encouraged violence against federal agents and ⁠rejected accusations that it allowed users to dox those federal agents by noting his app does not allow users to upload any photos or videos.

Instead, the app serves as an ""early warning system"" ‌that was based on what was happening in public spaces, Aaron said, adding, ""you can't limit what everybody can see with their own ‌eyes.""

Clarke have strongly condemned the Trump administration’s immediate, indefinite “administrative hold” on all processing of immigration paperwork by immigrants from 19 countries, including Haiti, that it placed under a travel ban in June 2025.
All 19 countries, which have either partial or full travel restrictions, have been deemed of concern to the administration.
“The actions are despicable and do nothing more than push our immigrant neighbors into the margins,” Awawdeh added.
“We saw it with the Muslim Ban, a policy rooted not in national security but in xenophobia and fearmongering.
“But instead of holding federal agents accountable for their aggressive tactics, the NYPD instead helped facilitate ICE’s campaign of terror.","Caribbean immigration advocates and Caribbean-American Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke have strongly condemned the Trump administration’s immediate, indefinite “administrative hold” on all processing of immigration paperwork by immigrants from 19 countries, including Haiti, that it placed under a travel ban in June 2025.

Besides Haiti, the other 18 non-European countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iran, Laos, Libya, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.

All 19 countries, which have either partial or full travel restrictions, have been deemed of concern to the administration.

The New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), an umbrella policy and advocacy organization that represents over 200 immigrant and refugee rights groups throughout New York, said the pause suspends green card applications and US citizenship requests, prevents refugees and some others from getting or renewing work authorization, and stops individuals from getting protection for torture and persecution by indefinitely pausing asylum applications.

“Every individual from each country will need an individual review of their case file to move forward,” NYIC President and CEO Murad Awawdeh told Caribbean Life on Wednesday, Dec. 3, stating that the “administrative hold” also halts the completion of citizenship ceremonies for legal US permanent residents from those 19 countries, delaying their path to becoming naturalized American citizens.

“An indefinite pause is a ban, plain and simple,” he added. “The Trump administration is using the recent shooting in DC (Washington) as a pretext for a dangerous escalation of its attacks on immigrants that are rooted in racism and xenophobia.”

Awawdeh said many of the immigrants affected by these policy changes have already undergone extensive vetting, “often taking years, after having arrived in America seeking security, stability, and the opportunity to rebuild their lives.

“Their futures are now in chaos,” he lamented. “People at every stage of the immigration process are already having their lives disrupted, including those who are just one ceremony away from becoming US citizens.

“The actions are despicable and do nothing more than push our immigrant neighbors into the margins,” Awawdeh added. “We urge members of Congress to condemn the Trump administration’s actions and call on the Trump administration to reverse course.”

Congresswoman Clarke, a daughter of Jamaican immigrants who represents the 9th Congressional District in Brooklyn, also told Caribbean Life that the administration’s decision to freeze green-card and naturalization applications for people from the 19 countries is “an outrageous and discriminatory overreach that undermines our values and endangers the lives and futures of countless families.

“Instead of responding to a single, tragic incident with facts and restraint, the administration has chosen once again to scapegoat immigrants — especially those from predominantly Black, brown, Muslim, and other marginalized nations,” said Clarke, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus.

“We have seen this before,” she added. “We saw it with the Muslim Ban, a policy rooted not in national security but in xenophobia and fearmongering.

“Today’s action is a continuation of that same shameful agenda,” Clarke continued. “This policy will trigger fear and despair among immigrants who have already endured years of vetting, only now to be told their hopes of citizenship and full participation in this country are suddenly on hold.”

The congresswoman noted that due process, individualized review, and evidence-based policy are “the cornerstones of a credible national security strategy — not political opportunism.

“Punishing entire populations for the actions of one person is not only unjust — it is un-American,” Clarke said. “Immigrants from nations across Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East and beyond are part of the very fabric of American life — contributing immeasurably to our economy, neighborhoods, and our country’s vitality. They deserve fairness, dignity, and a government that treats them as human beings rather than political pawns.

“I stand firmly with immigrant families, asylum seekers, and all those who came to America in search of liberty and opportunity,” she added, urging the Trump administration to “reverse this reckless and unjust suspension immediately.

“I will continue fighting alongside my colleagues to ensure that our laws reflect our values — not fear, bias, or political manipulation,” Clarke added. “Immigration should not be weaponized. Citizenship should not be suspended based on birth or nationality. Our nation is better than this.”

On Dec 2, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted a policy memorandum in which it directed its personnel to “place a hold on all Forms I-589 (Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal), regardless of the alien’s country of nationality, pending a comprehensive review.”

It also directed its personnel to “place a hold on pending benefit requests for aliens from countries listed in Presidential Proclamation (PP) 10949, Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, pending a comprehensive review, regardless of entry date; and conduct a comprehensive re-review of approved benefit requests for aliens from countries listed in PP 10949 who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021.”

USCIS said the memorandum “mandates that all aliens meeting these criteria undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility.

“An individualized, case-by-case review and assessment will be done of all relevant information and facts,” it added, stating that it will also conduct “a comprehensive review of all relevant policies, procedures, and operational guidance for compliance, accuracy and needed improvements during this time.

“This guidance outlines the adjudicative hold, procedural requirements, and processes for the rereview, interview, or re-interview of affected aliens,” continued USCIS, stating that “personnel are instructed to prioritize national security and public safety concerns and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations during the adjudication process.”

USCIS noted that, on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14161, titled Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorist and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, which “aims to safeguard US citizens from aliens who may seek to commit terrorist acts, pose threats to national security, promote hateful ideologies, or exploit immigration laws for malicious purposes.

“EO 14161 underscores the importance of vigilance during the visa issuance process to ensure that individuals approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or compromise US national interests,” USCIS said.

“Recently, the United States has seen what a lack of screening, vetting, and prioritizing expedient adjudications can do to the American people,” it added, noting that an Afghan national, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, “planned a terrorist attack in the United States on Election Day 2024.”

USCIS said Tawhedi pled guilty in federal court to conspiring and attempting to provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

In another instance, USCIS said an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is “suspected of planning and executing a terrorist attack in Washington, DC against two National Guard members, one who was killed and another who remains critically injured.

“In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the memo said. It also said “USCIS may, when appropriate, extend this review and re-interview process to aliens who entered the United States outside of this timeframe.”

Tanya Greene, US director for Human Rights Watch, said, “Nothing meaningfully links these 19 countries except the administration’s opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born.

“This sweeping change is not about safety; it is about scapegoating entire nationalities for the actions of one individual,” she said. “This policy will tear families apart, endanger people fleeing persecution and further damage US credibility on human rights.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center also said in a statement that the Trump administration is “using the tragic shooting of two national guard members to scapegoat and roll out yet another ban on Black and brown migrants.

“Where there is grief and heartbreak, the Trump administration sees opportunity — i.e, the opportunity to unveil more racist and anti-immigrant policies.

“Neither of these policies are responsive to the tragic events of last week,” it added. “These actions will put countless individuals and families in limbo and jeopardize their right to due process and protection under US and international law.”

Awawdeh said the Trump administration’s latest announcements are “part of an ongoing campaign to attack immigrants’ legal status and dismantle lawful pathways to safety.

“These cruel actions reflect a strategy to put increasing numbers of people on a direct path toward deportation, no matter the cost to our families, communities, or economy,” he said.

In a White House Proclamation, on June 4, 2025, Trump said he was “restricting the entry of foreign nationals to protect the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats.”

At the time, Trump said he had “determined to fully restrict and limit the entry” of nationals from 12 countries including Haiti, Afghanistan, Burma, Iran and Libya, and primarily from African countries – Chad, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The US president also said he had “determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals” from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

At the same time, the administration has been unrelenting in deporting undocumented, and often documented, Caribbean and other immigrants.

On Sunday, NYIC, elected officials, member organizations, allies and immigrant New Yorkers rallied and held a press conference at a federally-owned parking garage in lower Manhattan.

The day before, several immigrants were arrested amid a protest outside the entrance of the parking garage, where dozens of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared to be gathering for an immigration raid nearby.

Awawdeh said the protest led to scuffles with NYPD officers.

He said, while police officers are barred from colluding with ICE in New York City, due to sanctuary protections, “they continue to provide ‘crowd management’ assistance to federal agents – which led to increased tensions with protesters.

“Hundreds of New Yorkers gathered today to stop ICE from attacking our neighbors,” Awawdeh said. “Instead of protecting the residents of our city, the NYPD violently confronted and arrested protesters. New York is a sanctuary city, and the NYPD has no business collaborating with ICE.

“The violence that occurred today could have been avoided had ICE agents not escalated tensions,” he added. “But instead of holding federal agents accountable for their aggressive tactics, the NYPD instead helped facilitate ICE’s campaign of terror. ICE must stop wreaking havoc across New York — separating families and harming our communities.

“The NYPD must immediately release the New Yorkers who they arrested, and stop all collaboration with ICE,” Awawdeh continued. “Our police force should be using its resources to improve public safety for all New Yorkers.”

Natalia Aristizabal, deputy director of the immigration group Make the Road New York, said that “the NYPD’s response, to escalate tensions, violence, and make arrests, all to clear the way for ICE, runs counter to the spirit of the laws and culture of our city.

“The NYPD must release all New Yorkers arrested and stop facilitating ICE’s actions,” she added. “New Yorkers will not back down in defense of our neighbors, our communities, and our rights, on Canal Street (in lower Manhattan), in Corona (Queens), or on any block in our city.”",https://www.caribbeanlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7449.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-08 19:57:32.853641

But strikingly absent from today’s argument was any interest from the conservative Justices in probing what the Constitution’s history and original meaning say about independent agencies.

The Constitution was originally ambiguous about the scope of presidential authority to fire federal officers—as extensive scholarship and an abundance of amicus briefs in this case have shown—and that’s why the issue has been debated since literally the beginning of the nation. Yet during today’s argument, both the Solicitor General and Justice Amy Coney Barrett—the only conservative Justice to ask about history—wrongly suggested that early precedents barred Congress from limiting the President’s firing authority. As our amicus brief shows, that simply is not true.

When the Constitution’s meaning about the respective powers of Congress and the President is this indeterminate, both Founding-era history and the Supreme Court’s own precedents make clear that the unelected judiciary should not interfere with the choices that those branches themselves—the people’s elected representatives—have made for the past 150 years.

Congresses and presidents have jointly created independent commissions like the FTC for more than half of the nation’s history. The executive branch, whose prerogatives the Trump administration now purports to vindicate, has not only acquiesced in this historical practice, but has actively helped to shape it: for more than a century, one president after another has helped create these agencies, modify them, fund them, and appoint their leaders.

As counsel for Commissioner Slaughter said in response to Justice Barrett today at oral argument, such acquiesced-to, long-established practices—including practices that began after the Founding Era—settle the meaning of the separation of powers. The Supreme Court has recognized in many cases that this is precisely what the Framers envisioned. Even if Humphrey’s Executor had never been decided, fidelity to this principle would decide this case in favor of Commissioner Slaughter.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:54.504248

Immigration Judge Cynthia Goodman on Monday ordered the release of Bruna Ferreira, 33, from the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Todd Pomerleau, an attorney for Ferreira, said. The facility is about 80 miles from Baton Rouge and more than 1,500 miles from where Ferreira was arrested.

Bond was set at $1,500, the lowest amount allowed under the law, according to Pomerleau.

In court Monday, Ferreira’s attorneys argued “she’s not a danger, she’s not a flight risk,” Pomerleau said.

The lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security did not fight the defense argument and waived appeal, according to Pomerleau.

CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.

Ferreira was arrested while driving to pick up her 11-year-old son from New Hampshire, Pomerleau told CNN. Ferreira was previously engaged to the boy’s father, Michael Leavitt, and the two share custody, Pomerleau said.

Michael Leavitt is the brother of Karoline Leavitt.

Pomerleau said he didn’t know exactly when Ferreira would be released, as it depended on ICE receiving the judge’s order and her family paying the bond.

Then she will return to Massachusetts and her case will be transferred back to Boston immigration court.

It’s all part of what Pomerleau called the “unconstitutional merry-go-round.”

Another of Ferreira’s attorneys said she just wants to be with her son.

“She has established her entire life here in the United States since she has been a child,” attorney Jeffrey Rubin said. “She looks forward to reuniting with her son and getting back to her life as a hard-working business owner.”

A DHS spokesperson previously told CNN that Ferreira was in the US illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that required her to leave the country in June 1999. Ferreira is “a criminal illegal alien from Brazil,” DHS said.

Pomerleau said the DHS statement is inaccurate.

Ferreira’s attorney said she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which grants temporary protection from deportation for those brought to the US as children, but was unable to renew her status a few years ago during President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the program during his first administration and is currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Trump, which are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
These lawsuits protect an importer’s right to refunds of those tariffs if the Supreme Court determines that they should be returned.

A timely CIT filing is the most conservative and reliable way to maintain one’s position while the legal landscape continues to evolve.
Whether to file a protective CIT action depends on several factors that should be imminently considered.","In recent weeks, dozens of importers have filed protective lawsuits in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) to preserve potential refund rights related to the tariffs at issue in Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, which are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. These lawsuits protect an importer’s right to refunds of those tariffs if the Supreme Court determines that they should be returned.

As discussed in Holland & Knight alerts published on Nov. 7 and Nov. 25, 2025, the Supreme Court recently heard argument on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., authorizes the president to impose tariffs. The Court’s forthcoming ruling could affect the lawfulness of duties already paid and mechanisms available for recovering them.

Given the stakes and procedural uncertainty, importers should evaluate now whether a protective CIT filing is necessary to safeguard their rights.

Many companies are acting because the current posture is, by any measure, unusual. It remains unclear how the Supreme Court's ruling will apply to past entries of goods or what procedural avenues will exist after the decision. Waiting may inadvertently limit importers’ options. A timely CIT filing is the most conservative and reliable way to maintain one’s position while the legal landscape continues to evolve.

Key Concern

A primary concern is entry liquidation, which constitutes U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) final computation of duties owed. Once an entry liquidates, the ability to adjust or recover duties becomes constrained. Given the real possibility that duties may be refundable if the Supreme Court rules against the government, importers should not allow entries to liquidate without considering whether affirmative action is required. A CIT lawsuit provides a mechanism to seek suspension of liquidation and prevents entries from reaching a point where refund claims could become significantly more difficult – or foreclosed altogether.

In addition, there remain open questions regarding administrative remedies and protests that address the legality of the tariffs themselves. It is not yet clear that issues tied to presidential authority under IEEPA would fall within the scope of traditional, protestable CBP decisions. If these issues are ultimately deemed non-protestable, relying solely on protests could leave importers without a viable refund remedy. Filing in the CIT before liquidation is final offers a prudent safeguard against this scenario.

A protective filing also provides procedural advantages should refunds become available. If the Supreme Court’s decision leads to judicial or administrative refund mechanisms, importers with pending CIT cases will already have jurisdiction, timeliness and preservation-of-rights arguments firmly in place. They may also receive earlier clarity regarding legal issues and administrative requirements and avoid future bottlenecks associated with large-scale post-decision refund claims.

For many companies, a protective CIT action is proving to be a cost-effective risk-management strategy. The burden of initiating litigation is modest relative to the financial exposure involved – especially if a later ruling opens the door to significant refunds but procedural obstacles prevent recovery. A filing now may also reduce downstream legal costs associated with attempting to reopen liquidated entries or contest adverse administrative determinations.

Conclusion

Given the financial implications and the rapid increase in filings, importers should review their circumstances immediately. Whether to file a protective CIT action depends on several factors that should be imminently considered.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14849_2738.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:59:11.082500
,Policy,2025-12-08 19:57:17+00:00,American Enterprise Institute - AEI,Trump Administration Proposes Misguided Approach to the Public Charge Rule,"Josh Tubbs, Alan D. Viard",,,,,https://www.aei.org/economics/trump-administration-proposes-misguided-approach-to-the-public-charge-rule/,"To that end, Congress has enacted a law, commonly referred to as the public charge rule, that bars immigration by any person who, in the “opinion” of the government, “is likely at any time to become a public charge.” Unfortunately, the Trump administration recently proposed to implement the rule in a harmful and unnecessarily stringent manner.
Under 1999 field guidance, a green card application was denied under the public charge rule only if the applicant was viewed as likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government.
Under the proposal, the public charge rule would be implemented in a manner at least as stringent as the 2019 regulation.
Benefits were foregone by refugees and asylees (whom Congress has exempted from the public charge rule), green card holders, and US-citizen children of non-citizens.
It estimates that hundreds of thousands of non-citizens would forego claiming Medicaid, food stamps, and other benefits, often due to “misunderstanding” by those not actually subject to the public charge rule.","Congress has long sought to prevent potential immigrants from imposing undue fiscal burdens on American taxpayers. To that end, Congress has enacted a law, commonly referred to as the public charge rule, that bars immigration by any person who, in the “opinion” of the government, “is likely at any time to become a public charge.” Unfortunately, the Trump administration recently proposed to implement the rule in a harmful and unnecessarily stringent manner.

The administration’s proposal would primarily impact non-citizens who apply for green cards (through a process called adjustment of status) while in the US on temporary visas. Green cards provide permanent residence and a pathway to citizenship.

Under 1999 field guidance, a green card application was denied under the public charge rule only if the applicant was viewed as likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government. Primary dependence was defined as long-term institutionalization at government expense or reliance on public cash assistance for income maintenance.

In 2019, the first Trump administration adopted a regulation that introduced a much more stringent approach. An application was denied if the applicant was viewed as likely to receive any of a wide range of cash or non-cash government benefits for a number of months in any future three-year period.

In 2022, the Biden administration replaced the 2019 regulation with a regulation that effectively restores the 1999 approach. The 2022 regulation is still in effect.

The Trump administration’s recent proposal (open for public comment through December 19) would repeal the 2022 regulation. Under the proposal, the public charge rule would be implemented in a manner at least as stringent as the 2019 regulation. Unfortunately, confusion about the proposal’s treatment of past benefit receipt would cause many people to unnecessarily disenroll from, or refrain from enrolling in, benefit programs.

The proposal, like the 2019 regulation, would treat past benefit receipt as predictive of future benefit receipt. Accordingly, a green card application could be denied if the applicant previously received government benefits.

The proposal’s treatment of past benefit receipt would have little effect if everyone correctly understood it. Because non-citizens with temporary visas are ineligible for nearly all government benefits, they rarely receive benefits that could adversely affect a green card application under the proposal. Indeed, the administration notes that not a single application was denied due to the 2019 regulation.

While that regulation was in force, however, many people who were not actually subject to the regulation refrained from participating in benefit programs because they mistakenly feared that receiving benefits would have adverse immigration effects. Benefits were foregone by refugees and asylees (whom Congress has exempted from the public charge rule), green card holders, and US-citizen children of non-citizens.

The administration acknowledges that a similar chilling effect would occur under its new proposal. It estimates that hundreds of thousands of non-citizens would forego claiming Medicaid, food stamps, and other benefits, often due to “misunderstanding” by those not actually subject to the public charge rule. It concedes that the failure to claim benefits might lead to worse health outcomes, higher prevalence of communicable diseases, increased poverty, housing instability, and lower educational attainment.

The proposal’s stringent approach is unnecessary. As Pia M. Orrenius, Madeline Zavodny, and I noted in a recent AEI report, the economic literature has found a generally favorable net fiscal impact of immigration.

Even immigrants who appear at first glance to pose a fiscal burden may actually provide a net fiscal contribution due to indirect and long-term effects. For example, a 2017 National Academy of Sciences study found that, although the average low-skilled immigrant imposed a lifetime net fiscal burden, the burden was outweighed by a net fiscal contribution from the immigrant’s descendants. Orrenius, Zavodny, and I also observed that the entry of immigrant workers boosts business investment, which generates additional tax revenue. We further noted that Congress must eventually adopt tax increases and spending cuts to address the long-term fiscal gap, which will increase the net fiscal contribution of all future Americans, including immigrants and their descendants.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AEIdeas-Viard-120825.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:39.834326

Now, he’s doing everything in his power, working with their immigration attorney, to get Bulavina out as soon as possible.","A San Diego man is pleading for help to get his wife released from the Otay Mesa Immigration Detention Center after ICE officials detained her following her green card interview.

Last Thursday, Viktoriia Bulavina, a Ukrainian refugee, and her husband, Viktor Korol, came to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for what was supposed to be Bulavina's green card appointment.

But Korol left without her because she was detained by immigration officials. Now, he's trying to figure out a way to get her released and back home.

Bulavina arrived in the U.S. in 2022 as a refugee, with a humanitarian parole, fleeing from the war in Ukraine.

“Airplanes were dropping bombs, and missiles, and she’s there, they said, for a week in a basement, and then they fled to the other part of Ukraine,” Korol said.

She has been by her husband’s side while he was battling cancer.

“She was there for me when I was in the hospital and then the chemo,” Korol said.

In October 2023, Bulavina filed for and was granted Temporary Protective Status. In January, three months before her TPS status was set to expire, she applied for a renewal, Korol said.

According to her attorney, the online portal said a decision on that extension would have been made within two weeks. In March, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services scheduled Bulavina for a green card interview on December 4.

“Both attorney and me, we were talking to the ICE people, explaining to them her status, you know, that it is a perfect status. That she has TPS, she filed for an extension, and waiting for the extension. I repeated it a couple of times, but they were saying ... her status was expired, so they will detain her,” Korol said.

NBC 7 reached out to USCIS and ICE for information regarding Bulavina's detention and is awaiting a response.

Right now, Bulavina is being held at the Otay Mesa Immigration Detention Center, Korol said. Her husband says she has spent the last few days with little to no sleep.

“She said [they have a] very harsh and inhumane attitude. Basically, you don’t have anything, you don’t have a phone, you don’t have spare clothes, she basically didn’t sleep for three days,” he said.

On Sunday, he visited her at the detention facility. Now, he’s doing everything in his power, working with their immigration attorney, to get Bulavina out as soon as possible.

“This is a complete and utter injustice that is happening to my wife, which is frustrating. It cannot happen in the United States. I’m coming from the USSR, I can understand that I can understand that random stuff and inhumane stuff can happen in those regimes, but this is totally out of whack for where we are and how we feel here,” Korol said.

He also hopes she can get a hearing with a judge to get her case resolved.

In a press release Friday, Bulavina's attorney said in part, “This is a woman who did everything right…There is no justification for detaining her and tearing her away from her family.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/12/Ukrainian-woman-detained-e1765221893923.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-08 18:58:13.032790

There were echoes on Monday of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in another major case involving Mr. Trump.
The Supreme Court in January will hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed’s board.
“A lot of these independent agencies, Congress creates them to protect the little guy.”","Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is almost always in the majority in significant cases, said the F.T.C. that opinion shielded 90 years ago looked nothing like the modern commission. Over time, he said, the commission has come to exercise significantly more executive power, an authority the Constitution generally reserves for the president. He referred to the 1935 precedent as “just a dried husk of whatever people used to think it was.”

Even as they appeared receptive to the Trump administration’s maximalist position, several key justices seemed intent on making sure the court’s eventual decision in this case did not threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve. The justices will hear a separate case dealing with Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire a Fed governor in January.

The court’s three liberal justices warned of the far-reaching consequences for the structure of the modern government if the majority sided with the Trump administration in the Federal Trade Commission matter.

A decision in the president’s favor, they said, would call into question the constitutionality of job protections extended to leaders of more than two dozen other bipartisan commissions and boards. Congress intended to protect these agencies from partisan pressures and charged them with protecting consumers, workers and the environment.

Justice Elena Kagan said such a ruling would “put massive, uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the administration’s lawyer that “you’re asking us to destroy the structure of government” and to “take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a — the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

In response, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said that “the sky will not fall” if the justices give the president this new power. “In fact, our entire government will move toward accountability to the people,” he said.

Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has fired government watchdogs, leaders of independent agencies and rank-and-file federal workers, drawing multiple legal challenges.

The Supreme Court has generally allowed the firings to take effect through temporary emergency orders. Monday’s case presents the first opportunity for the court to issue a conclusive ruling on the underlying legal questions of Mr. Trump’s firings.

Next month, the justices will separately consider whether the president has the power to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. The justices have allowed Ms. Cook to remain in her post for now, signaling that the central bank may be uniquely insulated from presidential interference because of its history.

At issue on Monday was Mr. Trump’s firing in March of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic member of the F.T.C., who attended the argument and listened intently from the courtroom. Mr. Trump said he was removing her because she did not align with his agenda, despite a law that says the president can remove commissioners only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Ms. Slaughter promptly sued.

Her lawyer, Amit Agarwal of Protect Democracy, told the justices on Monday that presidents of both parties had long accepted that F.T.C. commissioners could not be removed without good cause in part to ensure regulatory stability.

“Folks in power today may not be in power tomorrow, and you want a structure that will be able to withstand the test of time,” Mr. Agarwal said. He added, “Presidents have understood and appreciated the vital interests of the American people can be served by having constraints on the exercise of power.”

Congress intentionally created such bipartisan commissions — made up of experts who could not be fired by the president without cause — to ensure that policy decisions would be made free from politics.

The F.T.C., created in 1914, protects consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power. It is led by five commissioners who serve staggered seven-year terms; no more than three can be members of the same party.

The F.T.C. has been led by only Republicans since March, after Mr. Trump fired a second Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya. After initially challenging his firing, Mr. Bedoya resigned, citing financial pressures.

A district court judge said in July that Ms. Slaughter’s firing was illegal, and in early September, a divided court panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstated her. The panel pointed to the job protections upheld by the 1935 decision that also involved a fired F.T.C. commissioner.

In that decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., the Supreme Court unanimously upheld removal restrictions for government officials on multimember boards. The justices in that case said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove a member of the F.T.C. merely because of political differences.

But in the last 15 years, the court has repeatedly narrowed that decision to give the president more control over executive officials.

The court found in 2020 that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional because it did not allow the president to fire its single director without cause. The court allowed the job protections to remain for multimember bodies like the F.T.C.

But in its emergency orders issued this year, the conservative majority has let the president temporarily remove leaders of agencies led by such multimember boards, including the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

As a result, Mr. Sauer told the justices that the precedent at issue “stands as an indefensible outlier” and must be overruled. “It continues to tempt Congress to erect at the heart of our government a headless fourth branch insulated from political accountability and democratic control,” he said.

Throughout the lively two-hour argument, the justices appeared divided along ideological lines with questions that underscored their starkly different visions of the president’s powers and the role and history of independent agencies.

Liberal justices pointed to recent historical scholarship showing that Congress has long had the power to devise such agencies and fill them with nonpartisan experts.

“Congress is saying expertise matters,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said. “So having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything, is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States.”

Conservative justices in turn expressed concern about independent agencies exercising vast power over individuals and billion-dollar industries without being accountable to the president, who has authority over the executive branch.

“I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said.

But it was unclear exactly how the court’s eventual decision would affect agencies beyond the F.T.C. Several justices, including Neil M. Gorsuch and Chief Justice Roberts, were critical of the reasoning in the 1935 decision, which dealt specifically with the trade commission. But, the chief justice said, that does not mean that “the other agencies fall with it as well.”

Still, if the administration prevails, Mr. Agarwal said, “everything is on the chopping block” — warning that would include the independence of the Federal Reserve.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. pushed back on claims that the Trump administration’s legal arguments would lead to “revolutionary results.” Justice Kavanaugh more than once suggested that the court would carve out an exception to preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve based on the central bank’s history.

There were echoes on Monday of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in another major case involving Mr. Trump. The conservative majority’s decision in Trump v. United States gave the president immunity from prosecution for his official actions. But the administration relied on it throughout the argument to bolster its expansive view of presidential power.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked the solicitor general whether there were any limits on the president’s authority to fire leaders of multimember commissions even for arbitrary reasons.

Mr. Sauer responded by invoking the immunity decision.

“No,” he said. “This court in Trump against United States held that the president’s power to remove officers wielding the executive power is conclusive and preclusive.”

Abbie VanSickle and Aishvarya Kavi contributed reporting.

The past and future of such agencies were the central topic at Monday’s Supreme Court argument about whether President Trump has the power to fire a leader of the Federal Trade Commission. The court’s decision will have profound consequences not only for that agency, but also for dozens of other bipartisan commissions and boards created by Congress.

Some are well-known bodies like the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates plane crashes, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the nation’s top securities regulator.

Others are relatively obscure but can wield significant powers. Take the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. The tiny Transportation Department agency draws little notice outside the shipping and maritime industries, but it maintains a key North American trade route that $26 billion a year in cargo traverses.

A brief filed in the Supreme Court case lists 50 boards and commissions that could be affected by the court’s decision. They have one thing in common: Congress mandated that they be run by bipartisan leadership groups.

Those boards typically have an uneven number of members, with staggered terms, all appointed by the president — but the various laws that created them often specify that no more than a bare majority of members can come from the same political party. The intention is to insulate the groups from partisan pressures and to encourage negotiation and consensus building.

And Congress frequently adds an additional safeguard by mandating that leaders can be removed by the president only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” That’s the provision the Supreme Court seems poised to overturn.

In March, President Trump fired the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. His administration claims that the Constitution forbids Congress to limit the president’s ability to run the executive branch.

If the Supreme Court upholds the firings, he will still have to replace the two ousted commissioners with appointees who are not Republicans — or leave the spots vacant — but Mr. Trump will be free to select leaders more aligned with his own views.

That potential change, which would upend a legal precedent that has stood for more than 90 years, alarms critics who fear it would undermine the independence and stability Congress sought to give to agencies with bipartisan leadership.

“Removal protections help ensure that presidential influence is exercised in a more consistent manner than it would be through removal and replacement of the entire board at will,” a coalition of 33 former board members of independent federal agencies wrote in a brief filed to the Supreme Court, adding, “The structure of independent agency boards tends to dampen radical shifts.”

Bipartisan leadership boards are especially prevalent at regulatory agencies with significant power over financial affairs and safety issues.

“Why would you want the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be independent? Well, you don’t want the president firing people for their politics,” said Victoria Nourse, the director of Georgetown Law’s Center on Congress and Democracy. “You want them to be deciding cases based on the physics and their expertise.”

Advocates of multimember commissions argue that those groups operate more deliberatively, especially those stocked with a mix of Democrats and Republicans, than agencies led by a sole director. Forcing officials with diverse views to work collaboratively, the thinking goes, ensures that minority perspectives will be part of the discussion as decisions are made. And it can push regulatory bodies toward compromise positions that temper partisan extremes.

“Every chair in these commissions wants a unanimous decision whenever she or he can,” said Allison Herren Lee, a former S.E.C. commissioner. “It doesn’t always happen, but they try, and that negotiating process almost always produces a better, more balanced rule or decision.”

Ms. Lee, a Democrat, was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2019 and served as the acting chair for the first few months of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s term. “There are always times when the majority just steamrolls, but that’s not the norm,” she said. “And it’s always understood that can be a risky approach to take, because minority commissioners do have tools at their disposal to respond both in the moment and with future issues that arise.”

Those kinds of checks and balances appealed to federal lawmakers stretching as far back as Alexander Hamilton, who proposed the structure the first Congress adopted for the Sinking Fund Commission. He saw it as a way of insulating the commission from political pressure, according to a 2020 article by Christine Kexel Chabot in The Notre Dame Law Review.

The group’s five members included some, like the vice president, who could not be removed at will by the president. And Hamilton himself, then the Treasury secretary, served on the inaugural Sinking Fund Commission alongside Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, his bitter political rival. (The commission disbanded in the 1830s, after the war debt was resolved and the Treasury secretary assumed more direct control of the nation’s spending.)

Rachelle Chong, a Republican, spent three years as a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission during President Bill Clinton’s administration. She sees the removal protections afforded to commissioners as a vital safeguard not only for those officials and their work, but also for the politicians they ultimately serve.

“We can make hard decisions and take the heat for it, whereas the elected politicians can say: ‘Well, I didn’t do it. Those guys did it, and they’re the independent agency,’” she said.

Both Ms. Chong and Ms. Lee — who each signed the former board members’ Supreme Court brief — fear for the stability of regulatory bodies, and the industries they oversee, if those removal protections vanish.

The Federal Reserve is the most prominent and powerful example of an independent agency led by a bipartisan board. The Supreme Court in January will hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed’s board.

But the court’s decision in Monday’s case will affect the boards of many agencies that shape aspects of Americans’ daily lives. They include the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which investigates products that cause injuries and deaths; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s antitrust watchdog; the National Labor Relations Board and other worker-protection agencies; the Postal Service; and the federal commissions that oversee campaign finance laws, international trade and nuclear safety.

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.
Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies.
""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.
Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.","The developer of ICEBlock, an iPhone app that anonymously tracks the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has sued the Trump administration for free speech violations after Apple removed the service from its app store under demands from the White House.

The suit, filed on Monday in federal court in Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally prosecute the app's developer and pressured Apple to make the app unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October.

Following Apple ejecting ICEBlock, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that ""we reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so.""

Lawyer Noam Biale, who filed the suit against the administration, said Bondi's remarks show the government illegally pressuring a private company to suppress free speech.

""We view that as an admission that she engaged in coercion in her official role as a government official to get Apple to remove this app,"" Biale said in an interview with NPR.

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.

When reached for comment, Apple also did not respond. The lawsuit, which does not name Apple, says the tech giant bowed in the face of political pressure.

""For what appears to be the first time in Apple's nearly fifty-year history, Apple removed a U.S.-based app in response to the U.S. government's demands,"" according to the suit.

Developer calls immigration crackdown 'abhorrent'

Joshua Aaron, the Austin, Texas-based developer of ICEBlock, said he launched the app as a way to empower those opposed to Trump's immigration crackdown.

""It was just the best idea I had to do everything I could to fight back against what was going on,"" Aaron said in an interview, describing Trump's immigration enforcement blitz as ""abhorrent.""

The app allows people to report an ICE agent sighting within a 5 mile radius, similar to how map apps, like Waze and Google and Apple Maps and others, alert drivers to police setting up speed traps. The ICE sighting alerts do not include photographs or videos and expire in four hours.

Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies. An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.

Aaron's lawsuit says Bondi is mischaracterizing the purpose of the app.

""Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,"" according to the lawsuit.

Attorney General Bondi, in a July interview with Fox News, suggested Aaron was under investigation and had committed a crime. ""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.

To legal experts, ICEBlock is latest ""jawboning"" example

To First Amendment advocates, the White House's pressure campaign targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what's known as ""jawboning,"" when government officials wield state power to suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice ""censorship by proxy.""

ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action and Bondi promising a crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are two other prominent instances.

""The use of a high-level government threat to force a private platform to suppress speech fundamentally undermines the public's right to access information about government activities,"" said Spence Purnell, a resident senior fellow at R Street, a center-right think tank. ""If high-level officials can successfully silence political opposition, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free expression in this country.""

Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the White House's campaign against ICEBlock shows the administration using what has become a familiar playbook: ""To use threats of adverse legal and financial consequences, sometimes vague sometimes not so vague, to pressure universities, media companies, law firms, you name it, into not speaking in the ways they like,"" she said.

One potential weak spot for the lawsuit, however, is a lack of direct evidence that Attorney General Bondi, or other administration officials, made threats against Apple to have the app removed, rather than merely convinced the tech company to do so.

""And government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they persuade private speech platforms to suppress speech because that speech poses a national security risk or is harmful in some other way,"" Lakier said. ""They only violate the First Amendment when they coerce or attempt to coerce the private platform to suppress the speech.""

Since Apple kicked ICEBlock out of its app store, it cannot be downloaded now, but those who had it on their phones before the ban can still use it. Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.

Aaron said he hopes the suit will lead to ICEBlock being restored to the iPhone app stores and for a clear message to be sent to the Trump administration that prosecuting him for his role in developing the app would be illegal.

Aaron said he and his legal team ""have been preparing for this fight,"" adding that ""we will take it as far as it needs to go to ensure this never happens again.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1290x726+0+229/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8b%2F87%2Fa4dd5c35457fa5839bf36613d6e1%2Ficeblock-photo.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:32.727605

Sounding the alarm, liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor said that independent agencies have existed throughout US history.
Similar protections cover officials at more than two dozen other independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.
Loren AliKhan, a Washington-based US district judge, in July blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter, rejecting his administration’s argument that the tenure protections unlawfully encroached on presidential power.","The US supreme court on Monday appeared poised to back the Trump administration’s argument that the president should be able to fire independent board members that for almost a century have been protected from presidential interference.

The court heard arguments concerning the legality of Donald Trump’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and appeared to be split down partisan lines in favor of a historic expansion of executive power, with the conservatives – including the sometimes swing vote of Justice Amy Coney Barrett – seeming to side with the administration.

The justice department has appealed a lower court’s decision that the Republican president exceeded his authority when he moved to dismiss Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic FTC member, in March before her term was set to expire.

John Yoo, who served as a justice department lawyer under George W Bush, told Reuters the case presents “one of the most important questions over the last century on the workings of the federal government”. He added: “The future of the independence of the administrative state is at issue.”

The case gives the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, an opportunity to overturn a New Deal-era supreme court precedent in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v United States that has shielded the heads of independent agencies from removal since 1935.

D John Sauer, the solicitor general, repeatedly argued that independent agencies like the FTC are a “headless fourth branch” with limited government oversight and that, in general, “independent agencies are not accountable to the people”. He argued that the key 90-year precedent, Humphrey’s Executor, “must be overruled”, describing the ruling as a “decaying husk with bold, and particularly dangerous pretensions”.

Regarding the 1935 precedent ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts said that historic precedent has “nothing to do with what the FTC looks like today”. That decision, he said, “was addressing an agency that had very little, if any executive power”.

The liberal justices, meanwhile, appeared sympathetic to Slaughter’s lawyer warning that “there are real-world risks that are palpable” in allowing a president the power to fire leaders of independent agencies. Doing so meant that “everything is on the chopping block”, Amit Agarwal said.

Sounding the alarm, liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor said that independent agencies have existed throughout US history. “You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” she said.

Justice Elena Kagan warned that the court should not ignore “the real-world realities” of what its decisions do. “The result of what you want is that the president is going to have massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power,” she told Sauer. “What you are left with is a president ... with control over everything.”

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also expressed doubt that more presidential firing power is better for democracy and emphasized that centering so much power under presidential control would undermine issues that Congress decided should be handled by nonpartisan experts in independent agencies.

“Having a president come in and fire all the scientists, and the doctors, and the economists and the PhDs, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,” she said.

A 1914 law passed by Congress permits a president to remove FTC commissioners only for cause – such as inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office – but not for policy differences. Similar protections cover officials at more than two dozen other independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.

The conservative justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern to Sauer about threatening the independence of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank.

Kavanaugh asked Sauer: “How would you distinguish the Federal Reserve from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission?” In another case involving presidential powers, the court will hear arguments on 21 January in Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor, a move without precedent that challenges the central bank’s independence.

Justice department lawyers representing Trump have advanced arguments embracing the “unitary executive” theory. This conservative legal doctrine sees the president as possessing sole authority over the executive branch, including the power to fire and replace heads of independent agencies at will, despite legal protections for these positions.

Slaughter was one of two Democratic commissioners who Trump moved to fire in March from the consumer protection and antitrust agency before her term expires in 2029. The firings drew criticism from Democratic senators and antimonopoly groups concerned that the move was designed to eliminate opposition within the agency to big corporations.

Loren AliKhan, a Washington-based US district judge, in July blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter, rejecting his administration’s argument that the tenure protections unlawfully encroached on presidential power. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit in September in a 2-1 decision kept AliKhan’s ruling in place.

But the supreme court later in September allowed Trump’s ouster of Slaughter to go into effect – an action that drew dissents from its three liberal justices – while agreeing to hear arguments in the case.

The supreme court is expected to rule by the end of June.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cd2c23300e3ba73484df981e3719c181c4ce27/402_0_3633_2907/master/3633.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28799b39fbd68573313a27af6e8130bf",N,,2025-12-08 15:58:53.749283

These ongoing efforts are now grouped under our Immigrant Rights Observatory project. Over the years, our reports have documented both serious concern for the rights of migrants in our state, as well as areas of significant progress in protection of immigrant rights. In recent months, however, threats to the rights of immigrant Washingtonians have increased severely, to the point where egregious violations including enforced disappearance and refoulement are now taking place in our state. Over the next year, we hope to strengthen both our methodologies and our partnerships with impacted communities and frontline advocates to better document and denounce these mounting abuses.

Gross Human Rights Abuses Against Migrants in Washington State

In August this year, we published a report documenting the cases of 14 individuals and two families who have been subjected to enforced disappearance by the U.S. government, including seven Venezuelans illegally expelled to the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador; and six people sent to military detention at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, prior to their deportations. UWCHR researchers compiled information across multiple sources to document these individuals’ ties to Washington state and the circumstances surrounding their disappearance and deportation. In addition to specific cases of enforced disappearance, our research raises concerns of a much larger universe of deportations occurring daily without real due process, under conditions which may constitute refoulement, or the practice of sending a person in government custody to a place where they are likely to face grave danger.

We also documented the role of local institutions in facilitating these deportations: from Boeing Field and Sea-Tac Airport, which provide the infrastructure through which deportations occur daily; to the state Department of Corrections, which collaborates in the detention of Washingtonians completing prison sentences; and the Washington State Investment Board, which invests public funds in businesses that profit from the brutalization of our neighbors. The goal of this research is to make all Washingtonians witness to what is happening on our watch, in the hopes that we might come together in new ways to stop these abuses.

Human Rights Conditions in Immigration Detention

Over the last year, we published two reports as part of our ongoing research regarding human rights conditions at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. The concerns raised by these reports have only deepened as the detained population at the facility has increased in recent months.

The first of these reports, “‘TPD Doesn’t Respond Here’: Patterns of Neglect in Tacoma Police Department’s Response to Reports of Crimes at the Northwest Detention Center,” reviewed ten years of reports of abuse and assault at the detention facility, documenting systematic failure by local law enforcement in its response to reports of crimes at the facility, especially when detained people were the victims. We presented these findings to Tacoma stakeholders including city and TPD officials upon release of the report. Unfortunately, ongoing research suggests that, despite assurances, detained people continue to have little recourse to report crimes in Tacoma.

The second report, “Compliance Theater: The NWDC’s Unenforced Contract,” examined the provisions on ICE’s contract with the GEO Group for operation of the detention facility. Our research found no evidence that ICE has ever exercised its authority to sanction GEO Group under the terms of the contract, even in cases of documented failures to uphold contract provisions. In addition, when UWCHR researchers submitted a series of FOIA requests for documentation mandated under the contract, ICE responded in multiple cases that the required documents did not exist, including reports relating to sexual assault and use of force at the facility. These findings are particularly alarming given the fact that the contract between ICE and GEO Group for the facility expired in September 2025 and is likely to be renewed for an extended period.

Monitoring State Immigrant Rights Laws

UWCHR continued to monitor compliance with state immigrant rights laws including the Keep Washington Working Act and Courts Open to All Act, which have come under threat as the federal government pressures local and state governments for collaboration with immigration enforcement. In coalition with a broad array of immigrant rights organizations, we investigate cases of potentially unlawful local collaboration with federal immigration enforcement activities, and have provided analysis in support of advocacy efforts seeking to protect Washingtonians from federal attempts to access their private data via state institutions like the Department of Licensing.",https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2025/08/Gross-human-rights-violations-in-WA-state-cover-750x971.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 18:57:57.068564

The aid package will include up to $11 billion in one-time payments under a new program administered by the Agriculture Department.

""As the president said, we are very pleased to announce that today we are going to be effectuating an $11 billion trade by not trade, but bridge payment to our farmers,"" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a White House roundtable event with Trump. ""The money will move by Feb. 28, 2026, but by the end of this month, so just in the next couple of weeks, every farmer that is able to apply for it will know exactly what that number looks like.""

Trump argued that the money was made available due to his own trade policies.

""This money would not be possible without tariffs, the tariffs are taking in, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars, and we're giving some up to the farmers because they were mistreated by other countries,"" he said.

The Supreme Court today appeared poised to side with Trump and allow him to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, a provocative move aimed at upending the long-standing concept of independent federal agencies.

In a significant case on the structure of the federal government, the conservative-majority court heard oral arguments on whether Trump had the authority to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter notwithstanding a law enacted by Congress to insulate the agency from political pressures.

The 1914 law that set up the FTC says members can be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has already signaled, with strong opposition from the three liberal justices, that Trump is likely to win the case by allowing Slaughter, a Democrat, to be removed from office while the litigation continues.

But Zohran Mamdani and his aides say their high-intensity canvassing effort was a difference-maker in both beating Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary and then preventing the former governor from mounting a comeback in the New York City mayoral general election last month, which Mamdani won by about 9 points.

Mamdani’s field operation embraced risk and de-emphasized scripts in its strategy to reach voters directly, said eight campaign officials, volunteers and political observers, offering a potential road map for Democratic canvassing efforts in the midterm elections and beyond.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer delivered a brief rebuttal before the court adjourned.

He rejected the idea that the administration's position would ""change the structure of our government"" and warned, on the contrary, that a certain interpretation of the independence of some federal agencies could result in the conversion of others into ""multimember agency commissions outside the government’s control.""

If the justices construe the president's powers narrowly, Sauer said, ""then we have a situation where Congress could erect virtual, reconstruct, virtually the entire executive branch outside the president’s control. And that is not even a republican form of government. But that is the logic of the position that’s being advanced here. That is the parade of horrible as the court ought to consider.""

At the end of his rebuttal, Sauer urged the Supreme Court to ""restore the separation of powers to our government.""

Supreme Court arguments this morning in Rebecca Slaughter's challenge to her firing by Trump from the Federal Trade Commission could lead to a dramatic change to long-held Supreme Court precedent and give the executive branch significantly greater authority over federal agencies.

This has been, as we call it in the business, a “hot bench”: Every justice asked several questions of both sides, and the justices were at times stepping over one another in trying to get their questions in. (Lots of “Go ahead."" “Please.” “No, go ahead.”)

The three ideologically liberal justices provided perhaps the strongest commentary of the day during questioning.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.

“Once you’re down this road, it’s a little bit hard to see how you stop,” Justice Elena Kagan added.

“Having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.

Amit Agarwal, the lawyer representing fired Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, argued that the administration's argument to allow the president to fire members of independent agencies would upend precedent.

""Petitioners are asking you to abandon precedent after precedent after precedent,"" Agarwal said. ""A lot of precedents would go south if their constitutional theory is correct, and a whole lot of history, and dozens of institutions that have been around for a long time that have withstood the test of time, that embody a distillation of human wisdom and experience, all of those would go south.""

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is arguing on behalf of the administration, on the ramifications of independent federal agencies reporting to the president rather than Congress.

""Congress established them and can eliminate them,"" she said. ""Congress funds them and can stop, so to the extent that we're concerned that there's some sort of entity that is out of control and has no control, I guess I don't understand that argument.""

Later, Jackson explained that she believed independent agencies exist ""because Congress has decided that some issues, some matters, some areas, should be handled in this way by nonpartisan experts.""

Jackson, one of the court's liberal justices, added that she understood the creation of independent agencies to be because ""Congress is saying that expertise matters with respect to aspects of the economy and transportation and the various independent agencies that we have.""

""So having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don't know anything, is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,"" she said.

Sauer emphasized in his response that the Constitution ""forbids Congress from shaving away the president's control.""

Trump lashed out at Paramount, which owns CBS News, over a ""60 Minutes"" interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, reigniting an old beef with the show and potentially complicating Paramount's already messy fight to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.

""My real problem with the show"" wasn't Green, R-Ga., the president posted on Truth Social, ""it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well, far worse things can happen.""

The president's post came while Paramount CEO David Ellison, whose father is major Trump donor Larry Ellison, was being interviewed on CNBC to defend his company's hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount lost a bidding war for the company to Netflix, which agreed to buy Warner Bros.' studios and HBO streaming assets, but Ellison isn't deterred.

Trump's dissatisfaction with Paramount could upend the regulatory process. Paramount and many critics within Hollywood have said a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. would be anti-competitive. Trump himself said he could see an issue with Netflix gaining so much market share. But he also praised Netflix and co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who has reportedly cultivated a relationship with the president.

Washington, D.C., Police Chief Pamela Smith is stepping down after two years, she and Mayor Muriel Bowser announced this morning.

Trump said this morning that he will sign an artificial intelligence executive order this week aimed at superseding state efforts to regulate the technology.

On Truth Social, the president posted: ""We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS.""

""I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,"" Trump added.

Former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred announced this morning that he is ending his Senate campaign in Texas and running for the House, shaking up the primary just hours before filing deadline.

Allred’s announcement that he is instead running for the redrawn 33rd Congressional District in North Texas comes as Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett has been openly weighing a Senate run. She is announcing her decision later this afternoon.

“In the past few days, I’ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,” Allred said in a statement. “That’s why I’ve made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., will face a primary challenge from progressive state Sen. Julie Gonzales, who announced her Senate bid today.

Gonzales is the first major primary challenger to try to unseat Hickenlooper.

In her announcement video, Gonzales framed Hickenlooper as a longtime politician and criticized the “establishment.”

“I know we’re not fooled by his so-called ‘common sense approach, 'cause there is no sense in voting for Donald Trump’s nominees or parading across the country to tell us we don’t want universal health care when millions of families are struggling to make ends meet every month,” she said in the video. “This ‘go along to get along’ politics is robbing us blind.”

A spokesperson for Hickenlooper's campaign told NBC News in a statement that the senator ""is focused on delivering for Colorado"" and pointed to his efforts opposing the administration and working to lower costs.

""Republicans know their only hope of flipping Colorado hinges on dividing us,"" the spokesperson said. ""John Hickenlooper has spent his time as Mayor, as Governor and as U.S. Senator uniting us, and now fighting against the illegal chaos and outright corruption that has come to define MAGA and our President. Senator Hickenlooper looks forward to a healthy and unifying primary.""

Hickenlooper won his first Senate term in 2020, flipping the seat blue. He previously served as Colorado governor.

In a high-profile interview, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., bashed Trump, accusing her onetime political ally-turned-foe of inciting death threats against her and her son and failing to live up to his campaign pledge to focus on improving the lives of Americans.

“For an ‘America First’ president, the No. 1 focus should have been domestic policy, and it wasn’t. And so, of course, I was critical, because those were my campaign promises,” Greene said in an interview that aired last night on CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” “Once we fix everything here, then fine, we’ll talk to the rest of the world.”

Later, CBS News’ Lesley Stahl asked Greene: “Are you MAGA?”

“I am America First. ... MAGA is President Trump’s phrase. That’s his political policies,” Greene said, referring to Trump’s signature motto, “Make America Great Again.” “I call myself America First.”

Trump has said he is “disappointed” with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he said had not read the latest plan to end Russia’s war.

Trump’s criticism adds to mounting U.S. pressure on Kyiv as Zelenskyy prepared to meet today with top European leaders, amid fears on the continent that Washington was pushing a deal that was favorable to Russia.

Trump’s team held talks with Ukrainian officials in Miami after flying to the Kremlin with a revised version of the peace proposal, but the push from Washington has so far failed to find a breakthrough. The Kremlin has not publicly supported a plan and has stuck to its hard-line demands.

In a significant case on the structure of the federal government, the conservative-majority court is hearing arguments on whether Trump had the authority to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission regardless of a law enacted by Congress to insulate the agency from political pressures.

The court has already signaled, with strong opposition from the three liberal justices, that Trump is likely to win the case by allowing the Democratic-appointed commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, to be removed from office while the litigation continues.

READ: The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents","WASHINGTON (AP) — The maker of an iPhone app that flagged sightings of U.S. immigration agents sued the Trump administration for free speech violations on Monday, alleging that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi used her “state power” to force Apple to remove the app.

Apple in October removed ICEBlock and other apps from its app store after Bondi said they put Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at risk by enabling people to track ICE activity in their neighborhoods.

The lawsuit from ICEBlock app maker Joshua Aaron argued that the government's actions violated the First Amendment.

The lawsuit also asks a federal judge to protect the Texas-based software developer from prosecution, alleging “unlawful threats made by Attorney General Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and White House Border Czar Tom Homan to criminally investigate and prosecute Aaron for his role in developing ICEBlock.”

The Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICEBlock was the most widely used of the ICE-tracking apps in Apple’s app store until Bondi said in October that her office reached out to Apple “demanding that they remove ICEBlock” and claiming that it “is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.”

Apple soon complied, sending an email to Aaron that said it would block further downloads of the app because new information “provided to Apple by law enforcement” showed the app broke the app store rules.

According to the email, which Aaron shared with The Associated Press in October, Apple said the app violated the company’s policies “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.”

An example of the latter comes from Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). The senator wrote the Trump administration a letter expressing concern over H-1B. So far so good.

But the senator says in his letter that “we must ensure such programs are not used to undercut or replace U.S. employees.”

Say what?

When Congress makes it explicitly legal to replace Americans with H-1B workers, Congress has to expect that employers will replace Americans with H-1B workers. Congress designed the H-1B program to replace Americans with cheap, foreign workers. The adverse effects of the H-1B program that we are seeing are exactly what Congress intended when it created H-1B.

Some of the questions in the Senator’s letter are troubling.

4. How will you ensure companies make good faith efforts to fulfill all H-1B requirements, including those requiring prioritization of U.S. workers over H-1B employees?

No such requirement effectively exists. Congress enacted a sham requirement that basically applies to no one and is designed to be unenforceable.

5. The press release announcing Project Firewall states the Secretary of Labor will personally certify the initiation of investigations. How will you ensure this personal certification requirement does not needlessly add red tape, enable corruption or pay-to-play, or hamper the visa program’s overall objectives?

Congress created the requirement that the Secretary of Labor personally certify investigations. Congress was trying to make sure such investigations did not happen.

If the president is free to fire the leaders of independent agencies, they said, the longstanding civil service laws could be struck down as well.
But the six conservatives said they were concerned that these agencies were exercising “executive power” that is reserved to the president.
It was not clear, however, whether the court will rule broadly to cover all independent agencies or focus narrowly on the FTC and other similar commissions.","The Supreme Court’s conservatives sound ready to overrule Congress and give President Trump more power to fire officials at independent agencies and commissions.

The justices heard arguments Monday on whether Trump could fire Rebecca Slaughter, one of two Democratic appointees on the five-member Federal Trade Commission.

The case poses a clash between Congress’ power to structure the government versus the president’s “executive power.”

A ruling for Trump portends a historic shift in the federal government — away from bipartisan experts and toward more partisan control by the president.

Trump’s Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the court should overturn a 1935 decision that upheld independent agencies. The decision “was grievously wrong when it was decided. It must be overruled,” he told the court.

The court’s three liberals strongly argued against what they called a “radical change” in American government.

If the president is free to fire the leaders of independent agencies, they said, the longstanding civil service laws could be struck down as well.

It would put “massive, uncontrolled and unchecked power in the hands of the president,” said Justice Elena Kagan.

But the six conservatives said they were concerned that these agencies were exercising “executive power” that is reserved to the president.

It was not clear, however, whether the court will rule broadly to cover all independent agencies or focus narrowly on the FTC and other similar commissions.

For most of American history, Congress has created independent boards and commissions to carry out specific missions, each led by a board of experts who were appointed with a fixed term.

But the court’s current conservative majority has contended these commissions and boards are unconstitutional if their officials cannot be fired at will by a new president.

Past presidents had signed those measures into law, and a unanimous Supreme Court upheld them 90 years ago in a case called Humphrey’s Executor vs. U.S.

In creating such bodies, Congress often was responding to the problems of a new era.

The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to regulate railroad rates. The FTC, the focus of the court case, was created in 1914 to investigate corporate monopolies. The year before, the Federal Reserve Board was established to supervise banks, prevent panics and regulate the money supply.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the stock market and the National Labor Relations Board to resolve labor disputes.

Decades later, Congress focused on safety. The National Transportation Safety Board was created to investigate aviation accidents, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission investigates products that may pose a danger. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission protects the public from nuclear hazards.

Typically, Congress gave the appointees, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, a fixed term and said they could be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.”

Slaughter was first appointed by Trump to a Democratic seat and was reappointed by President Biden in 2023 for a seven-year term.

But conservatives often long derided these agencies and commissions as an out-of-control “administrative state,” and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he believes their independence from direct presidential control is unconstitutional.

“The President’s power to remove — and thus supervise— those who wield executive power on his behalf follows from the text” of the Constitution, he wrote last year in his opinion which declared for the first time that a president has immunity from being prosecuted later for crimes while in office.

Roberts spoke for a 6-3 majority in setting out an extremely broad view of presidential power while limiting the authority of Congress.

The Constitution in Article I says Congress “shall have the power...to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution...all other powers vested” in the U.S. government. Article II says, “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.”

The current court majority believes that the president’s executive power prevails over the power of Congress to set limits by law.

“Congress lacks authority to control the President’s ‘unrestricted power of removal’ with respect to executive officers of the United States,” Roberts wrote last year in Trump vs. United States.

Four months later, Trump won reelection and moved quickly to fire a series of Democratic appointees who had fixed terms set by Congress. Slaughter, along with several other fired appointees, sued, citing the law and her fixed term. They won before federal district judges and the U.S. Court of Appeals.

But Trump’s lawyers filed emergency appeals at the Supreme Court, and the justices, by 6-3 votes, sided with the president and against the fired officials.

In September, the court said it would hear arguments in the case of Trump vs. Slaughter to decide on whether to overturn the Humphrey’s Executor decision.

At the time, conservatives applauded the move. “For far too long, Humphrey’s Executor has allowed unaccountable agencies like the FTC to wield executive power without meaningful oversight,” said Cory Andrews, general counsel for the Washington Legal Foundation.

In defense of the 1935 decision, law professors noted the court said then that these independent boards were not purely executive agencies, but also had legislative and judicial duties, like adopting regulations or resolving labor disputes.

But Roberts and the conservatives have not been swayed by those arguments.

They are, however, not sure what to with the Federal Reserve Board, whose independence is prized by business. The Chamber of Commerce said the court should overrule the 1935 decision, but carve out an exception for the Federal Reserve.

Trump’s lawyer grudgingly agreed. If “an exception to the removal power exists,” he wrote in his brief in the Slaughter case, it should be “an agency-specific anomaly” limited to the Federal Reserve.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29e0eff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6123x3215+0+435/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9e%2F831abe4e4ae69296cd11f8bb770d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2203860656,N,,2025-12-08 14:57:08.973796

It sheds light on how their lives have changed under President Donald Trump's second term. The report shows how federal policies, combined with Florida's state policies, have pushed the immigrant community into social isolation.

USF sociology professor Elizabeth Aranda oversaw the research project. She said the report does not recommend specific policy decisions but could serve as a resource for lawmakers and the public.

The group interviewed include those without legal status, asylum seekers, people in the country with temporary protected status (TPS), DACA recipients, legal permanent residents known as Green Card holders and U.S. citizen children of immigrants.

""The impact of these enforcement policies really seeped into virtually every area of social life,"" said Aranda.

Avoiding law enforcement

In their testimonies, immigrants reported not going to work, church, the doctor or grocery stores to avoid contact with law enforcement. They also expressed hesitance to contact local police if they were victims of crime or witnessed a crime.

Florida holds the most 287(g) agreements with federal immigration agencies, the report stated. Those agreements allow local law enforcement and state agencies to aid federal immigration efforts.

""Across the board, everyone in the sample talked about insomnia, issues with their appetite — either losing their appetite or eating more — anxiety, depression, fatigue, hair loss, just a range of psychosomatic symptoms,"" Aranda said.

Parents said their U.S.-born children experienced similar ailments and were hypervigilant.

Aranda described one interviewee who said her daughter asked if her mom would still be home when she returned from school.

""She was always gleefully surprised that her mother was there. It gives you a little window into how children are thinking,"" said Aranda.

Interviewees described employment becoming more precarious. Immigrants have moved from construction, agriculture and other industries into more informal work, such as delivery driving or small-scale reselling, that are lower-paying and potentially exploitative.

Migrant farmworkers choose to stay

The fear of being stopped by law enforcement, the report said, did not only end travel to local job sites. Migrant farmworkers, who travel out of state for seasonal farm work, have also opted to stay in the state.

Immigrants also spoke of exploitation and scams.

Amanda, a 39-year-old asylum seeker from Venezuela who has lived in the U.S. for 11 years, described how members of her extended family lost thousands of dollars to a sham recruitment operation.

Amanda describes how her uncles paid a $400 deposit but ultimately were not hired to work.

""As work becomes less stable and more dangerous, the ripple effects extend directly into the home. Families already struggling to maintain employment now face shrinking options for where and how to live,"" the report said.

Some reported having to sell their homes, while others downsized and moved in with family members to consolidate expenses.

Even with increased enforcement, however, the report said that a majority spoke about staying.

""People felt like moving to another state wasn't necessarily going to solve things,"" Aranda said, ""so the question was, do they leave the country or not? And many of them chose to stay because the original reasons they left and the original reasons they built their lives here [in the U.S.].""

Rosa, a 42-year-old undocumented mother from Mexico, said she wants to stay in the U.S. for her children.

""Sometimes I would like to [leave]. But because of my children, no, since they're studying here, I think about it more for them. When I get stressed … yes, I would like to leave, but I try to keep going for them,"" said Rosa.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f09a5a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4725x2481+0+335/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2Fe1%2F4da6b9cb493f820dc944729ef136%2Fap23258621693075.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:43.636187

WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced the launch of a new webpage, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which aggregates information on criminal illegal aliens arrested by DHS during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump Administration.

The webpage allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens who have been arrested across all 50 states, with criminal histories that include homicide, assault, rape, drug trafficking, child molestation, cruelty toward a child, battery, and armed robbery, among other crimes.

“This new Worst of the Worst webpage allows every American to see for themselves the criminal illegal aliens that we are arresting, what crimes they committed, and what communities we removed them from. This is all about transparency and showing results,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “As the media whitewashes the facts, day in and day out, our brave men and women of ICE risk their lives for the American people. Americans don’t have to rely on the press for this information – with this transparent tool, they can see for themselves what public safety threats were lurking in their neighborhoods and communities.”

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has fulfilled President Trump’s promise to carry out mass deportations – starting with the worst of the worst – including the thousands of criminal illegal aliens featured on the new webpage.

The launch comes as sanctuary city and state leaders refuse to assist federal law enforcement in honoring federal immigration detainers, and as malicious lies and hoaxes, driven by hateful rhetoric from the mainstream media, continue to distort the work of the brave men and women of ICE and CBP. With assaults against officers up more than 1,150% and an unprecedented surge in vehicle ramming attacks, the page showcases the incredible work of our officers as they continue to remove violent criminals from our streets and protect American families. The new page will feature 10,000 arrests upon launch and the Department will continue to update the page.

Some of the Worst of the Worst arrests featured on the page include:

Some conservatives on the court have been signaling for years that they were eager to overturn the precedent, decided in 1935, that protects independent agencies.
Like other independent agencies, it was designed by Congress to be shielded from politics.
Mr. Trump dismissed her in March in an email that said her service was “inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.” She then sued.
Congress has also created dozens of new independent agencies that have wide-ranging responsibilities.","As a young staff member in the Reagan administration, John G. Roberts Jr. was part of a group of lawyers who pushed for more White House control over independent government agencies.

The “time may be ripe to reconsider the existence of such entities, and take action to bring them back within the executive branch,” the future chief justice of the United States advised the White House counsel in a 1983 memo. Independent agencies, he wrote, were a “constitutional anomaly.”

Once he ascended to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts joined other conservatives on the bench in a series of rulings that have chipped away at Congress’s power to constrain the president’s authority to fire independent regulators.

That decades-long project of the conservative legal movement collides on Monday, when the case is argued in the court. At stake is President Trump’s desire to oust officials across the government, in defiance of federal laws meant to protect their jobs and shield them from politics.

The result, the Supreme Court’s recent decisions suggest, is that the majority will likely side with Mr. Trump in a move that could significantly shift power from Congress to the president and usher in a dramatic change in the way the federal government is structured.

“This is not a bolt out of the blue,” said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer representing an agency official in a separate case who was also fired by the president.

“There is a tendency to see this as merely part of a recent short-term drama about President Trump, but really a majority of the justices have long been sympathetic to the argument that the Trump administration is making here — and that’s a view that transcends this presidency,” he said.

Monday’s case specifically tests whether President Trump can fire Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, simply because he says she does not align with his agenda — despite a law that says the president can only remove commissioners for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The court’s ruling, expected by the end of June, has implications for more than two dozen other agencies that are charged with protecting consumers, workers, the environment and nuclear safety, and have traditionally been insulated from complete presidential control by similar laws.

Since he returned to the White House, Mr. Trump has repeatedly ousted Democratic leaders of independent agencies, including at the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to make way for replacements who share his policy priorities.

A number of the officials have sued. The Supreme Court has generally allowed their firings to take effect but has done so in temporary emergency orders while their lawsuits proceeded through lower courts. In Ms. Slaughter’s case, the court will render a final and lasting judgment on the legality of Mr. Trump’s firings, a major test for the justices to determine how far to expand presidential power.

In January, the Supreme Court will separately consider whether the president has the power to fire Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor. In that case, the justices have allowed Ms. Cook to remain in her post for now, signaling that the central bank’s history may mean it can be uniquely insulated from presidential interference.

The Trump administration’s robust view of the executive is being weighed by a conservative Supreme Court majority that has also embraced the so-called unitary executive theory. That is the idea, dating back to the Reagan administration, that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and that he must be able to control everything the executive branch does.

Some conservatives on the court have been signaling for years that they were eager to overturn the precedent, decided in 1935, that protects independent agencies.

In a 2010 decision, Chief Justice Roberts said the president’s power generally includes “the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties. Without such power, the president could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities.”

Then, in 2020, during Mr. Trump’s first term, the court took a major step toward expanding the president’s power to fire independent officials. In a 5-to-4 decision, the court said the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional because it did not allow the president to fire the director without cause.

But the majority decision, again written by the chief justice, made a distinction between government agencies run by a single director and those led by multimember commissions that “do not wield substantial executive power.”

In its recent emergency orders, the court, with three justices nominated by Mr. Trump, has telegraphed strongly that it is now poised to give the president more direct control over those agencies as well.

“Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the president,” the majority said in an unsigned opinion in May, “he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”

Such orders have drawn vigorous dissents from the court’s three liberal justices, who accused the majority of displaying “impatience” to decide the fate of the 1935 precedent, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. The majority, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in September, seemed determined to “extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.”

Created in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power. Like other independent agencies, it was designed by Congress to be shielded from politics. It is led by five commissioners who serve staggered seven-year terms; no more than three can be members of the same party.

Ms. Slaughter, first nominated by Mr. Trump in 2018, was renominated by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2023, and unanimously confirmed by the Senate to a term that expires in 2029. Mr. Trump dismissed her in March in an email that said her service was “inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.” She then sued.

Mr. Trump dismissed a second Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya, as well. He initially challenged his firing but later resigned, citing financial pressures. As a result, the F.T.C. has been led by only Republicans since March.

Lower-court judges sided with Ms. Slaughter. A district court judge said that her firing was illegal and pointed to the job protections upheld by the 1935 decision.

Echoing the chief justice’s arguments dating to the 1980s, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, told the justices that those tenure protections are unconstitutional because they infringe on the president’s power to run the executive branch. The heads of government agencies are essentially the president’s “alter ego” and his ability to oust regulators is an “indispensable tool of control,” he said in a filing.

The F.T.C. regulates matters ranging from credit cards to horseracing, he added, and Congress cannot empower “unelected agency heads to wield executive power walled off from presidential control and electoral accountability.”

Pointing to the recent Supreme Court decisions, he wrote that if the 1935 precedent “is not already a dead letter, this court should overrule it.”

(As a secondary matter, Mr. Sauer said courts have no power to reinstate Ms. Slaughter even if she was improperly removed.)

The administration’s position has the backing of former Republican attorneys general Edwin Meese and Michael B. Mukasey and groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

Ms. Slaughter’s legal team is led by Amit Agarwal, a former law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. He contested the administration’s view of the Constitution’s text and of history and urged the court not to transfer to the president “vast new powers that Congress and prior presidents, working together, chose not to vest in the president alone.”

Her lawyers noted that in the years since the court first held that Congress could adopt job protections for independent agency chiefs, 15 presidents of both parties worked within that system and accepted that F.T.C. commissioners could not be removed without good cause. Congress has also created dozens of new independent agencies that have wide-ranging responsibilities.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/00dc-scotus-agencyheads-top-mvgb/00dc-scotus-agencyheads-top-mvgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:55.141066

In many cases, ICE agents are telling detained spouses at green card interviews that they had overstayed tourist or business visas.
In July, ICE took Soliman into custody after he appeared at a routine check-in with ICE.
During his 73 days in detention, Soliman said he never saw sunlight, never breathed fresh air and never ate a raw fruit or vegetable.
ICE officials invariably say they are just following orders but maybe they should be considering whether their orders are legal.","Back during the first Trump term when we witnessed the child separation policy ripping families apart, I thought we had reached the height of cruelty. But I was wrong. ICE and Border Patrol are trying for a new standard. And there are so many awful stories to learn about. Somehow the idea of deporting the “worst of the worst” got lost and inexplicably the new mission is persecuting the most innocent.

ICE has been arresting foreign-born spouses of U.S. citizens who are complying with the law and trying to obtain permanent residency. The New York Times just did a feature story about this. In many cases, ICE agents are telling detained spouses at green card interviews that they had overstayed tourist or business visas. Foreign-born spouses are being handcuffed and taken away right from the interview.

The government strategy appears to be to induce couples to give up, abandon their case and accept the foreign spouse’s detention. There has been no consideration for either the fact of marriage or the reality that the couple may have small children.

The Times highlighted the case of Stephen Paul who is married to a British wife. Paul works for the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department and he and his wife have a four-month-old baby. At her green card interview, federal agents swooped in and took Paul’s wife away. She had been living in the U.S. for 14 months.

Paul said, “It’s insane to have them rip our family apart. Whoever is directing this has completely lost touch with their mission to the country.”

People like Paul’s wife have always been eligible for green cards in the past. Arrests like this were exceedingly rare as foreign spouses of Americans have typically been approved for permanent residency. The Trump regime is prioritizing fast track deportations regardless of circumstance, no matter how compelling the case or cruel the result.

Paul learned that the government was threatening to deport his wife without a hearing. More generally, this has become their go-to play. Paul’s lawyer had to file a lawsuit in federal court to halt her removal. That worked and secured her release.

Then there is the case of the interfaith chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Ayman Soliman. Soliman is Egyptian and has been in the U.S. since 2014. He had been in trouble with the Egyptian military regime as he had been working as a journalist. Because of his work, he was detained four times by the Egyptian authorities and he had been tortured. He came to the U.S. on a visa to study film and once here he applied for asylum. In June 2018, he was granted asylum.

In July, ICE took Soliman into custody after he appeared at a routine check-in with ICE. His asylum status had been revoked. He spent 73 days in detention. Without proof, the government stated he was part of a terrorist organization. During his 73 days in detention, Soliman said he never saw sunlight, never breathed fresh air and never ate a raw fruit or vegetable.

Because of his popularity for his work pastoring to very ill and dying children, Soliman got widespread support in Cincinnati. He received 760 letters of support from people in the community. The support was so intense that ICE released him from custody and he now awaits a green card determination.

I also wanted to mention the story of Ruperto Vicens-Marquez who has lived in the U.S. for two decades. He and his brother Emilio co-own a locally well-known Mexican restaurant, Emilio’s Kitchen, in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, a seashore community. Ruperto is head chef. He had moved to the U.S. from Mexico in 2007. He had a visa that was legally renewed and he was authorized to be in the U.S. until 2029.

Ruperto did not show up at work on Oct. 17. ICE had picked him up a block away from the restaurant, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and falsely asserted he had an order of removal from the U.S.

ICE held Ruperto at their immigration detention facility in Newark for over a month. The town of Atlantic Highlands was so upset, advocates in the community organized two demonstrations and created a GoFundMe campaign that raised almost $100,000 for legal defense. On Oct. 18, Ruperto was released by an immigration judge’s order.

The Department of Homeland Security says that 500,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office. NPR says 300,000 is a more accurate number.

In immigration court, ICE attorneys are short-circuiting due process by filing motions to pretermit which, if granted, avoid giving immigrants any chance to argue their asylum claim. When such motions are granted, people get deported without a chance to testify. The need for zealous immigration lawyers has never been greater.

Someday this entire enterprise of indiscriminate and racist deportation will be seen for the crime it is. It fits in with other seedier episodes of U.S. history like the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Japanese-American internments and Operation Wetback. If justice ever prevails again, there should be investigations and prosecutions of officials like Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller and Greg Bovino for their violations of due process which have characterized this regime.

ICE officials invariably say they are just following orders but maybe they should be considering whether their orders are legal. When what you are doing is heartless and mean as a crazed rottweiler, it is time to bail.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons sent a letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul calling on him to put the safety of Americans first and honor ICE arrest detainers of the more than 4,000 criminal illegal aliens in the state’s custody including murderers, sexual predators, and those convicted of or charged with weapons offenses.

Illinois' failure to honor ICE detainers has resulted in the release of 1,768 criminal illegal aliens since January 20. The crimes of these aliens include 5 homicides, 141 assaults, 23 burglaries, 4 robberies, 24 dangerous drugs offenses, 15 weapons offenses, and 10 sexual predatory offenses.

There are currently 4,015 aliens in the custody of an Illinois jurisdiction with an active detainer. The crimes of these aliens include 51 homicides, 1,134 assaults, 107 burglaries, 36 robberies, 275 dangerous drugs offenses, 120 weapons offenses, and 813 sexual predatory offenses.

In September, ICE sent a letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul asking for cooperation in honoring ICE detainers on criminal illegal aliens. His office did not respond.

“Governor Pritzker and his fellow Illinois sanctuary politicians are releasing murderers, pedophiles, and kidnappers back into our neighborhoods and putting American lives at risk,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “We are calling on Governor Pritzker and his administration to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 4,000 criminal illegal aliens in Illinois’ custody. It is common sense. Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”

Some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens released by Governor Pritzker and his fellow Illinois sanctuary politicians include:

Victor Manuel Mendoza-Garcia, a 49-year-old illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted for 3 counts of aggravated kidnapping/ransom and sentenced to 18 years in Illinois Department of Corrections in Cook County Court in Illinois. ICE’s detainer for Mendoza-Garcia was not honored. On November 12, ICE arrested Mendoza-Garcia where he remains in ICE custody.

Juan Morales Martinez, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was arrested after a vehicle crash near Westfield, IL where he was a passenger. Early reports of the vehicle crash show two fatalities (a county board member and his wife). Police also found an extended magazine and ammunition in the vehicle. On October 25, ICE lodged a detainer on Morales Martinez. On October 27, ICE arrested Morales after his release from the Clark County Jail. The jail did not cooperate with ICE, but ICE officers suspected his release and performed an enforcement action outside. He has now been removed from the United States.

Amilcar Waldo Gonzalez-Jimenez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted for 1 count of driving under the influence and domestic battery and 2 counts of criminal sexual assault. ICE’s detainer for Gonzalez-Jimenez was not honored. On November 13, ICE arrested Gonzalez-Jimenez.

Juan Alberto Caro Marin, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse/victim/family and sentenced to 6 years in Illinois Department of Corrections. ICE’s detainer for Caro Marin was not honored. On November 9, ICE arrested Caro Marin where he is currently in ICE custody.

Jose Manuel Fuentes-Vargas, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested for domestic battery, violation of protection order, and convicted of sexual assault of a victim less than 13 years of age. ICE’s detainer for Fuentes-Vargas was not honored. On October 30, ICE arrested Fuentes-Vargas where he is currently in ICE custody.

Leonardo Ignot-Osto, an illegal alien from Mexico, has illegally entered the U.S. at least four times. Ignot has a lengthy criminal history dating back to a December 27, 2010, conviction for theft in Cook County. Most recently on September 18, 2025, Cook County convicted Ignot for child abduction/lure child/victim for a child less than 17 years of age, sentencing him to 1 year imprisonment. Despite an Immigration Detainer lodged September 23, 2025, with the Cook County Jail, Ignot was released. ICE was able to locate and apprehend Ignot and on November 19, 2025, he was removed from the U.S.

Jaime Mandujano-Nunez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment in Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), after his February 9, 2012, conviction for Predatory Criminal Sex Assault of a Child in Cook County. On December 11, 2024, ERO Chicago lodged multiple Immigration Detainers with IDOC. However, on an unknown date, the IDOC released Mandujano back into the community without honoring ICE’s detainers. Mandujano was located and apprehended by ICE and on November 15, 2025, ICE removed him from the United States.

Alfonso Batalla Garcia, an illegal alien from Mexico, with a criminal history including arrests for battery, carrying/possessing a firearm, battery with bodily harm, domestic battery, and Cook County ultimately convicted Batalla in 2001 for attempted murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault with bodily harm, and aggravated kidnapping, sentencing him to 30 years in Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). IDOC refused to honor ICE’s Immigration Detainer and released Batalla on an unknown date. ICE was able to apprehend Batalla and removed him from the U.S. on November 5, 2025.

Guillermo Garcia-Porcayo, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, was arrested by Chicago PD for aggravated battery with great bodily harm. Garcia was then convicted on February 9, 2018 in Cook County of attempted murder with intent to kill and sentenced to 12 years with the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). On July 2, 2018, ERO Chicago lodged an Immigration Detainer with IDOC. On June 25, 2025, IDOC released Garcia back into the community without honoring ICE’s detainer. On July 15, 2025, ERO Chicago removed Garcia from the United States to Mexico.

This month’s blog focuses on the move-on support provided to individuals with newly granted international protection status, which frequently leaves people who the Government has accepted require sanctuary, facing street homelessness and imminent destitution.

What is Asylum Support?

The Home Secretary has an obligation to provide accommodation and financial support to individuals seeking international protection who are assessed as destitute, while their claim is being determined. This is known as ‘asylum support’ and is most commonly provided under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum act 1999.

The statutory scheme currently provides that asylum support will be terminated 28 days after an individual is granted some form of international protection. The notice period given by the Home Office before ceasing that asylum support is known as the ‘move-on period’. This move-on period has long been a topic of contention and subject to policy change.

Expert homelessness and refugee organisations have long expressed serious concerns about the 28-day move-on period. For example, in December 2018, the British Red Cross published a report showing that the 28-day move-on period often leaves people facing extreme poverty and homelessness and recommending that the move-on period should be extended to at least 56 days.

Background: A History of the Move-On Period

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Home Secretary operated a practice of ceasing asylum support 28 days after receipt of a Biometric Residence Permit (“BRP”). This practice resumed after a period of temporary operational adjustments introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce street homelessness.

In August 2023, the Home Secretary significantly changed her policy, calculating the move-on period as commencing on the date of the grant of status, prior to being in receipt of a BRP. In effect, this resulted in individuals having a move-on period as short as seven days in some cases. This change led to devastating levels of destitution and in December 2023 the Home Secretary reverted to her previous practice of calculating the move-on period from the date of receipt of a BRP.

On 5 December 2024, the Home Secretary announced a Pilot policy to extend the move-on period to 56 days from the date of the grant of status, a move which was welcomed by NGOs and front-line agencies who had long been calling for such a change as a way to significantly reduce homelessness of newly granted refugees. In the announcement, the Home Secretary confirmed that the decision had been made as an interim measure during the period of increased decision making and the transition to eVisas and that it would remain in place until June 2025. Before June 2025, it was extended for a further three-months.

Curtailment of the Pilot

On 10 July 2025, the Home Secretary announced that the Pilot would be extended again until the end of 2025, to maintain support for local authorities and newly granted individuals during the continued period of increased decision making, and to allow a full assessment of the impact of the Pilot. However, on 26 August 2025, the Home Secretary announced her unexpected decision to curtail the Pilot for all single adults.

As a result of this curtailment of the Pilot, on 1 September 2025, the move-on period was reverted to 28-days for all single adults who do not fall within the ‘exception criteria’. The ‘exception criteria’ includes pregnant women, persons over the age of 65, persons with a known/evidenced disability, and families. Those falling within the exception criteria continue to receive 56 days’ notice.

The decision to curtail the Pilot appears to have been made with the intention of rapidly reducing the number of asylum seekers accommodated in hotels, as a response to the recent riots and growing public interest on the matter.

Insufficiency of the 28-day Move-On Period

As set out above, the move-on period has long been a subject of significant concern for NGO’s and front-line organisations. The insufficiency of a 28-day move-on period to allow time to source accommodation and to access mainstream benefits, if so required, is well-documented.

There is substantial evidence that a 28-day move-on period is incompatible with the interrelated systems of relevant organisations. In summary:

to apply for Universal Credit, an individual must have opened a bank account. Many banks will not approve an account for an asylum seeker, and even once they are granted status, individuals often face barriers such as having a valid proof of address and ID;

claims for Universal Credit usually take an average of five weeks from the date of application until receipt of the first payment. It is therefore not normally possible to be in receipt of Universal Credit prior to the expiry of a 28-day move-on period;

local Authority interim housing is only available if an individual is assessed as being ‘priority need’. Priority need does not include healthy, single adults and so most individuals affected by the curtailment of the Pilot will not be eligible;

Local Authorities have a relief duty to assist individuals who are assessed as homeless to source accommodation. This relief duty usually applies for a period of 56 days which is at odds with the 28-day move-on period; and

it often takes more than 28 days for clients to secure employment. Many refugees suffer from physical or mental health conditions, or speak limited English, which can make it particularly difficult for them to access work.

How to Seek a Reinstatement of Support

Although she has failed to make this clear nor to publish any clear process for seeking extensions of support, the Home Secretary has a discretion to extend the move-on period for individuals. This is otherwise known as a ‘reinstatement request’. This is set out in limited detail in the Home Office’s guidance on ‘Ceasing Section 95 Support instruction’.

DPG is representing a number of individuals who are affected by the curtailment of the Pilot to assist in preventing destitution and street homelessness and, through legal correspondence, the Home Secretary and Migrant Help have confirmed that reinstatement requests should be submitted to:

Conclusion

On 12 September 2025, over 60 NGOs and front-line organisations wrote to the Home Secretary expressing their concern over the curtailment and what will inevitably result in increased pressure on local authorities and increased levels of destitution and street homelessness in the winter months.

These NGOs have called on the Government to reverse its decision, reinstating a 56-day move-on period for single adult refugees – safe and essential transition time that aligns with existing support systems – and allowing the full pilot evaluation to complete so that the evidence can be used to make wider improvements to the move-on process.

It is hoped that the Government will take these calls seriously as it is clear that reverting to a move-on period of 56 days would have significant benefits for both refugees, a particularly vulnerable cohort, and the UK as a whole. In 2020, the British Red Cross published a cost-benefit analysis of extending the move-on period to 56 days which concluded that extending the move-on period to 56 days could result in net annual benefits of between £4 million and £7 million to the UK.[1]

Moreover, as Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council has rightly said: “For too long refugees have been at risk of becoming homeless at exactly the point the Government grants them safety. Extending the time people have to move on should give men, women and children who have lost everything more of a breathing space to find accommodation and work as they rebuild their lives and contribute to our communities.”[2]

Campaign Launches With New Video Here

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR) announced the launch of the Masks Off, Rights On campaign, a new effort aimed at advocating for transparency, accountability, and civil rights in the face of increasingly anonymous and masked law enforcement actions in our communities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

A recent national poll by LCCHR found a solid majority (56%) disapproves of ICE’s performance, and a plurality (46%) strongly disapproves. Only 4% of Hispanic voters say ICE is making life better for everyday Americans. Despite federal law enforcement being required by law to wear identifying uniforms when addressing civil disturbances, the Trump administration’s decision to allow ICE agents to wear masks while carrying out arrests is a dangerous tactic that undermines accountability and public safety.

Maya Wiley, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference, said: “The Trump Administration is sending ICE and other agents into our streets and communities – and it’s making us less safe. ICE is menacing innocent people, including children at school, sowing fear, and even using physical force without justification. They are causing chaos and committing civil and human rights abuses while hiding behind masks and refusing to identify themselves. This is wrong, and it’s dangerous. We’re going to call it out and make our voices heard.”

If ICE agents can be anonymous, criminals can pretend to be them. Agents who abuse people can get away with it. This makes everyone less safe. It erodes trust and makes our neighborhoods places of fear.

The Masks Off, Rights On campaign will bring together policy recommendations, local advocacy tools, storytelling, and a coordinated media strategy to:

Highlight the civil rights and community safety risks of anonymous ICE actions

Support partners and supporters in pushing for transparency and identification protocols

Provide resources to know your rights, prepare for ICE encounters, and take action

Mobilize communities to take action at the local, state, and federal levels

The new public awareness campaign will include:

A launch advocacy toolkit featuring an open letter from LCCHR President, Maya Wiley

A “How To” guide on sending a message to your local representatives or school board, urging them to keep our communities safe.

A video documenting ICE’s masking policy and its impacts on communities

The call for transparency is a call for basic public safety. Our neighbors, our communities, and our safety depend on protecting our basic rights.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in the United States. The Leadership Conference works toward an America as good as its ideals.

Trump administration argues that decision stopping president from removing officers must be overruled

Arguments in the case that will decide whether Donald Trump can fire officials from independent agencies have started.

First up is solicitor general D John Sauer, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration.

He kicks off his opening remarks by arguing that the key 90-year precedent, known as the Humphrey’s Executor, “must be overruled”.

He describes the ruling as a “decaying husk with bold, and particularly dangerous pretensions” that ultimately creates a “headless fourth branch insulated from political accountability and democratic control”.

A quick reminder that, in September, the supreme court granted a justice department request to block a lower court’s order that shielded Rebecca Slaughter, from being dismissed from the consumer protection and antitrust agency before her term expires in 2029. She will remain fired until the court issue their decision.

While answering questions from justices today, Agarwal said that the “real world danger” if the administration is successful, is that “everything is on the chopping block”.

He added that there was “absolutely no principled basis” for “carving out” independent agencies from Congress’s purview.

“We’re talking about more than two dozen traditional independent agencies that have been established by statutes enacted by the people’s elected representatives and signed into law, all of them by democratically elected presidents,” Agarwal said.

The bench just wrapped its questions to the administration’s lawyer, solicitor general D John Sauer.

Arguing on behalf of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the fired Democratic member of the FTC, is Amit Agarwal.

“Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790,” Agarwal said in his opening remarks. “So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start.”

Justice Jackson is now pushing back against the administration’s claims that these independent agencies aren’t answerable to Congress – which delegates their creation, oversight, budgets and laws.

“Part of your argument seemed to revolve around this notion that there’s some kind of thing happening with the independent agency that the reason why the president needs to control it is because they don’t answer to anybody,” she said.

“What I don’t understand from your overarching argument is why that determination of Congress, which makes perfect sense given its duty to protect the people of the United States, why that is subjugated to a concern about the president not being able to control everything.”

Updated at 11.13 EST

As he responds to questions from justices today, Sauer has repeatedly argued that independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are a “headless fourth branch” with limited government oversight.

When responding to questions from justice Brett Kavanaugh, the solicitor general said that these agencies exercise “a great deal of control over individuals and business” but “ultimately do not answer to the president”.

Share

Speaking now is the third liberal justice on the bench, Elena Kagan.

She says that what the administration is asking for would give the president “massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power” over independent agencies. It’s a role that Congress, with its Article I power, has controlled for 9o years.

Share

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, also pushed back on the administration’s premise – in line with justice Sotomayor’s line of questioning.

“I appreciate that Article II has some language in it that you’re pointing to, but as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the constitution does not speak specifically to removal,” she said. “I don’t know why we’d make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.”

She went on to probe the solicitor general as to why he thought that Congress was “somehow less democratically accountable” for the way in which it constructs agencies and determines the terms of its officers.

“You seem to think that there’s something about the president that requires him to control everything as a matter of democratic accountability, when on the other side, we have Congress saying we’d like these particular agencies and officers to be independent of presidential control for the good of the people,” Jackson said.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of three liberal justices on the bench, seemed unconvinced with the administration’s argument off the bat.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government,” she told solicitor general D John Sauer. “To take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

Supreme court to hear arguments in case testing Trump's ability to fire officials

In less than an hour, the supreme court will here arguments in a landmark case that tests Donald Trump’s ability to fire officials.

Earlier this year, the president moved to fire Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. Trump actually appointed her to the position back in 2018, and she was re-confirmed for a second term under Joe Biden that was set to expire in 2029.

One of the main questions the nine-justice bench will consider today is whether to overturn a key 1938 decision which established that the president requires Congress’ signoff to fire an official from an independent government agency, and it needs to be “for cause”.

Slaughter’s case is the latest emergency appeal that the supreme court will hear from the Trump administration, after a lower court judge blocked her firing, and an appeal court upheld that decision. A reminder that, in May, the court allowed Trump to remove two Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board – despite job protections for these posts – while litigation challenging those removals proceeded. And in September, they deferred action on the Department of Justice’s request to allow Trump to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, at least until it hears oral arguments on the case in January.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest out of Europe, particularly the London meeting between Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several Nato allies – France’s Emmanuel Macron, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, and Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Jakub notes:

The sombre tone of the opening remarks was highly telling: it’s clear that this was not merely another photo opportunity designed to merely convey solidarity with Zelenskyy, but they face urgent – increasingly so – issues that need to be resolved soon.

A reminder that Donald Trump Jr warned that his father may walk away from the Ukrainian war in a lengthy tirade against the purpose of continued fighting in Ukraine, as he also claimed Ukraine’s “corrupt” rich had fled their country leaving “what they believed to be the peasant class” to fight the war.

Meanwhile, the president said on Sunday that Russia is “fine” with the peace proposal (although he didn’t elaborate if this was the same framework that Moscow seemed initially unhappy with during Steve Witkoff’s visit). Trump added: “But I’m not sure that Zelenskyy’s fine with it. His people love it. But he isn’t ready.”

More than 2,000 national guard soldiers have been in Washington since Donald Trump’s initial deployment in August, part of the president’s contentious immigration and crime crackdown targeting Democratic-led cities.

In what was seen by many as an example of federal overreach, the president federalised DC’s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its history over the summer.

Trump said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi.

This was despite violent crime in Washington DC actually having fallen sharply since 2023.

Smith says 'there comes a time when you just know it's time' to step down

Axios broke the news of Pamela Smith’s resignation. Speaking to the outlet, she said: “There comes a time when you just know it’s time.”

Smith, who has 28 years of law enforcement experience, said her decision is not related to the deployment of national guard troops to the city.

Speaking to Fox 5 about her decision to resign, the outgoing police chief said it was a “tough” decision and was made to spend more time with her family.

She said:

I have been going nonstop. I have missed many amazing celebrations, birthdays, marriages, you name it, within our family.

And being able to come home for thanksgiving two years after my mum passed really resonated with me and has allowed me to make a decision that I think is necessary not just only for me but also for my family.

Smith is expected to step down on 31 December and the mayor’s office will name an interim chief shortly, according to Axios.

Throughout this period, they consistently had a higher median entry wage than immigrants of all the provinces.","The median wage earned by new immigrants in Canada one year after admission can be a good predictor of their future economic outcomes. The real median entry wage (after adjusting for inflation) of newcomers decreased by 10.6% from 2022 to 2023, the largest decline since 1991.

This drop among immigrants from 2022 to 2023 occurred amid a 1.1% increase in the overall real median wage of Canadians over this period. While entry wages decreased across most immigrant categories, the overall decline is partly related to the fact that the proportion of immigrants admitted as principal applicants under the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), who typically have a higher entry wage, reached an all-time high in 2021, but fell below 2019 pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in 2022.

This Daily release explores the economic outcomes of recent immigrants in the 2024 Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB). It outlines variations in the economic outcomes of newcomers by admission category, pre-admission experience and province. The IMDB is the result of a collaboration between Statistics Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and the provinces.

The median entry wage for new immigrants decreases more in 2023 than in 2020, but remains higher than every other year prior to 2021

The median entry wage of immigrants steadily increased from 2010 to 2022, except in 2020 when wages were impacted by the pandemic.

From 2020 to 2021, the real median entry wage of immigrants rose by over one-fifth (+21.2%), increasing from $34,400 to $41,700. It then rose a further 6.7% year over year to $44,500 in 2022. In 2023, the median entry wage of immigrants declined by 10.6% to $39,800 but remained higher than the median entry wage in 2020 ($34,400) and every other year prior to 2021.

This was a relatively large decline, given that the overall real median wage of Canadians increased by 1.1% to $47,650 in 2023.

The decrease in the number of Canadian Experience Class principal applicants admitted in 2022 may contribute to the overall decline of the median entry wage of new immigrants in 2023

In 2023, immigrants from each of the main admission categories saw their median entry wage decline compared with the previous year. Specifically, the median entry wage declined for spouse and dependent economic immigrants (-7.3% year over year to $34,400), for immigrants sponsored by family (-4.1% to $30,300) and for refugees (-1.9% to $25,900).

Economic principal applicants, who are selected for their ability to contribute to Canada's economic development, had the highest median entry wage among the four main admission categories at $51,500 in 2023. While this was a 5.5% decline from the previous year, each of the specific programs within the economic principal applicant stream experienced smaller decreases or even increases in entry wage.

In 2023, CEC principal applicants, who are selected based on their Canadian work experience, remained the admission category with the highest median entry wage. Their median entry wage rose 3.4% to $60,600 in 2023, following a decline in 2022 from its peak in 2021 ($71,000).

In 2023, principal applicants from the skilled worker and skilled trades (-4.4% to $56,000) and provincial/territorial nominee (-3.8% to $47,700) programs saw their entry median wages decrease from a year earlier. Business (-2.4% to $24,900) and caregiver (+4.9% to $38,500) principal applicants had the lowest entry income among economic principal applicants.

The decreases in the median entry wages by admission categories in 2023 were mostly smaller than what was observed for the overall immigrant population (-10.6%). This discrepancy is likely related to changes in the makeup of the immigrant population and their admission categories.

In 2021, IRCC specifically invited express entry candidates, who were more likely to be physically located in Canada and therefore less impacted by pandemic-related border restrictions, to apply for permanent residency. This was done, in part, by increasing the number of immigrants admitted through the CEC program, the category with the highest median entry wage. Specifically, the share of immigrants aged 15 years and older admitted as CEC principal applicants increased from 12% in 2020 to 27% in 2021. This change contributed to the growth of the entry wage of all new immigrants in 2022. With the removal of border restrictions in 2022, CEC principal applicants were less targeted, and their share declined to 5% in that year. This, in addition to the other factors at play during the post-pandemic period, contributed to the overall reduction in the entry wages of new immigrants in 2023.

Among economic principal applicants admitted in 2013, skilled workers and skilled trades principal applicants saw their median wage grow the fastest over the following decade

While median entry wage is a good indicator of the short-term economic outcomes of new immigrants, it is also relevant to consider how their wages evolve over longer periods of time. Immigrants admitted in 2013 saw their real median wage increase by 74.8% over the following decade, rising from $27,400 in 2014 to $47,900 in 2023.

The wage trajectory of economic principal applicants varied between admission categories. In 2014, the median wage of economic principal applicants admitted a year earlier was the highest for the CEC ($64,000), followed by provincial and territorial nominees ($47,000), skilled workers and skilled trades ($31,300), and caregivers ($31,300). Meanwhile, it was the lowest among those from business programs ($19,900).

A decade later, in 2023, CEC principal applicants of the 2013 admission cohort remained the category with the highest median wage, at $92,100 (+43.9%). They were followed by skilled worker and skilled trade (+131.0% to $72,300), provincial/territorial nominee (+40.6% to $66,100) and caregiver (+56.9% to $49,100) principal applicants.

Business program principal applicants continued to have the lowest median wage in 2023, at $27,900 (+40.2%).

Immigrants with pre-admission work experience see their median entry wage decrease in 2023

Pre-admission work experience can help boost entry wages of immigrants upon admission. Immigrants with work permits only (-7.6% to $50,000) and those with both work and study permits (-3.0% to $48,700) prior to admission had the highest entry median wages in 2023, though both were down from a year earlier.

For immigrants with both work and study permits prior to admission, 2023 marked their lowest median entry wage recorded since 2017 ($48,200).

In contrast, in 2023, immigrants with a study permit only prior to admission had a median entry wage of $20,100, up 11.0% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, those without pre-admission experience had an entry wage of $32,600 (+12.4%), while immigrants who had an asylum claim prior to admission had an entry wage of $34,700 (+7.4%). For these three categories, this was the highest median entry wage in a decade.

In 2023, none of the pre-admission experience groups saw their entry median wage decrease as much as what was observed for the overall immigrant population (-10.6%). Again, changes in the cohort of newcomers from 2021 to 2022 may also be a factor. The share of immigrants aged 15 years and older admitted with both a work and a study permit (the pre-admission experience category with one of the highest median entry wages), declined from 39% in 2021 to 22% in 2022. Most of this decline can be attributed to the decrease in CEC principal applicants with work and study pre-admission experience in Canada.

The median entry wage grew faster for immigrants in Quebec and New Brunswick than in other provinces during the decade from 2014 to 2023

The median entry wage of immigrants admitted one year earlier rose by 45.3% over the course of a decade, increasing from $27,400 in 2014 to $39,800 in 2023.

In 2014, immigrants in Quebec ($22,400) and New Brunswick ($23,700) had the lowest median entry wage among the provinces. A decade later, the entry wage of immigrants in these two provinces were among the highest in the country. For example, the entry wage of immigrants in Quebec rose 96.4% over a decade to $44,000 in 2023, while in New Brunswick, the entry wage of immigrants rose 70.5% to $40,400. As a result, in 2023, the median entry wage of immigrants in Quebec was the highest of all provinces, while New Brunswick came third after British Columbia ($43,100).

Immigrants in Alberta ($37,600), Saskatchewan ($37,000) and Newfoundland and Labrador ($36,900) had the highest median entry wage of all provinces in 2014. By 2023, however, the entry wage in Alberta had fallen by 6.4% to $35,200, while in Saskatchewan, the entry wage had decreased 9.2% to $33,600 and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it had fallen 1.6% to $36,300, placing all three provinces below the overall level for Canada ($39,800).

Immigrants in the territories saw their median entry wage increase from $43,100 in 2014 to $56,500 in 2023. Throughout this period, they consistently had a higher median entry wage than immigrants of all the provinces.

A second release, to be published on December 19, 2025, will examine the mobility of immigrants.

“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner.

“I urge you … to act to defend the authority of the legislative branch.
Such action is necessary to ensure we can effectively represent our constituents and the people of Nebraska.”","LINCOLN — A Nebraska lawmaker two times was denied entry to the controversial state-run federal immigration detention facility that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink” — and now is calling on the Legislature’s Executive Committee to step in.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said Monday that she made the four-hour trip to McCook in mid-November to check out the conditions of the place where migrant detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held pending deportation.

She argues that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services violated state law by not allowing her into the converted Work Ethic Camp, and cites a state statute that says Nebraska legislators are entitled to visit any state correctional facility “at any time.”

When Gov. Jim Pillen and Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys announced the agreement with the federal government, Cavanaugh said, they stated that the department would manage the property and it would continue to be considered a state facility.

“The denial of physical entry to a sitting senator is not only unprecedented — it is the latest escalation in a broader pattern of obstruction that undermines the Legislature’s statutory and constitutional oversight obligations,” Cavanaugh said.

The Omaha senator said she routinely conducts unannounced visits to state-run 24-hour facilities “because direct oversight is not optional — it is a core responsibility of my job.”

She said she specifically wanted to visit the McCook ICE detention center, because it involved “people being held in Nebraska without criminal charges and, in many cases, without clear legal recourse.” The immigration court and deportation process is separate from state courts, and immigrants held by ICE often face civil versus criminal charges.

“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner. “There is no scrutiny. There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.”

Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment.

Cavanaugh documented her efforts to gain entry to the former WEC in a letter to State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, and Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee.

She also chronicled five prior legislative attempts to obtain information about the project, describing a pattern of “limited transparency and restricted information.”

Email between Cavanaugh and Jeffreys and a person she described as a warden at the McCook facility offers details of the rejected visits on Nov. 12-13.

According to the email exchange:

Cavanaugh arrived at the facility around 4:20 p.m. Nov. 12, and apparently spoke to Jeffreys via the warden’s cell phone around 4:30 p.m., who told her she had failed to provide notice of her visit.

Said Jeffreys: “You were instructed that no person could arrive unannounced and be given immediate entry to a Nebraska correctional facility or a federal detention center.”

Cavanaugh, in an email around 10 p.m. that night of Nov. 12, emailed the warden and Jeffreys that she would be returning to the facility the next morning.

“Though statute 83-186 (attached) does not require me to provide notice, I am giving you this notice per my conversation with Director Jeffreys on Warden Sommer’s cell phone at approximately 4:30 p.m. today, when Director Jeffreys informed me that I had failed to provide notice of my visit.”

Jeffreys later wrote to Cavanaugh to “clarify the legal position” of the department as to why she was not allowed to enter.

“It is the fundamental nature of corrections, safety protocols and operations, and consistent with Nebraska law, that unannounced visitors of any type cannot be accommodated.”

He said her communication alerting them that she’d be there again Nov. 13 was “short notice” and “again a problem.”

Of Cavanaugh’s legal justification for her visit, Jeffreys said in email that his team “worked to analyze your request, get legal advice and collaborate with our federal partners.”

“We have come to the determination that you will not be allowed to enter the WEC until you have complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protocols related to detention center visits and provided sufficient notice to allow for the safe conduct of a visit.”

He also said that statute 83-186 “does not displace protocols for the security and safety of corrections facilities.” He said his team read that statute “in harmony with the statutory scheme of which it is a part.”

Cavanaugh, in the letter to Hansen and Dorn, said she reviewed the state’s contract with ICE and believes it provides that any “provision of this agreement contrary to applicable statutes … is null and void and shall not necessarily affect the balance of the agreement.”

“This means that the right of access provided in 83-186 invalidates any interpretation that members of the Legislature may be prohibited from accessing the facility.”

Cavanaugh said the documented history demonstrates that legislative leaders “have repeatedly sought access to accurate, timely information” on the project and its implications.

She said the Executive Board oversees all legislative services and employees and hears matters of “general import to the Legislature and its operations as a whole.” She said Jeffreys actions were a “direct disregard” of the Legislature and its constitutional authority.

Isabella County - Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/pung-v-isabella-county/,"Furious, Pung refused to pay that portion of the property taxes, leaving an unpaid tax bill of approximately $2,200.
Pung filed suit, alleging violations of the Takings Clause and the Excessive Fines Clause.
Pung asked the Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Court agreed to do so.
Across the Atlantic, that same protection was written into the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was eventually adopted word-for-word as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.
And in every case to interpret the Excessive Fines Clause since Austin, the Court has expressly reaffirmed this holding.","When Scott Pung passed away in 2004, his property had a special tax exemption for principal residences. Years later, the local tax assessor determined that Scott’s surviving family members who occupied the home should have resubmitted paperwork for the exemption and thus retroactively denied it. Litigation before the Michigan Tax Tribunal proved the tax assessor wrong. But when Scott’s brother Michael Pung, the administrator of his estate, went to pay the family’s taxes in 2012, a town clerk informed him that once again the tax assessor had denied the tax exemption, notwithstanding the decision of the Tax Tribunal.

Furious, Pung refused to pay that portion of the property taxes, leaving an unpaid tax bill of approximately $2,200. That disputed bill was the only unpaid tax in the Pungs’ history. Nonetheless, the county initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property, eventually selling it at auction for $76,000 despite acknowledging its assessed fair market value was $194,400. The county kept the entire profit from the sale.

Pung filed suit, alleging violations of the Takings Clause and the Excessive Fines Clause. Reaching only the Takings Clause issue, the district court held that the county was required to reimburse the Pungs for the difference between the artificially depressed auction sale price and the unpaid tax debt.

On appeal to the Sixth Circuit, Pung asserted that he was due not just the surplus from the auction sale but the full assessed fair market value of his property (minus the tax debt), notwithstanding the fact that the property was sold at auction for much less than its full fair market value. The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument, holding that failure to pay the full fair market value was neither a taking nor a fine within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause. Pung asked the Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Court agreed to do so.

In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court in support of Pung. Our brief focuses on the Excessive Fines Clause, responding to the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that Michigan’s tax foreclosure scheme is categorically exempt from Eighth Amendment scrutiny simply because its main purpose is “to encourage the timely payment of property taxes.” Our brief makes three main points.

First, we explain that the historical roots of the Excessive Fines Clause show that it applies to financial penalties that are not just punitive, but also serve remedial purposes. The Excessive Fines Clause was taken nearly verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which in turn codified Magna Carta’s guarantee that excessive financial payments—then known as “amercements”—would not be extracted. Amercements were neither civil nor criminal in nature. Though they were generally imposed to sanction wrongful (though not necessarily criminal) conduct, they also served remedial purposes—that is, they repaid the costs that the community or the Crown had incurred as a result of the wrongdoing.

During the seventeenth century, the modern-day fine replaced the amercement as the preferred financial sanction. In that same period, despite Magna Carta’s guarantees, the Stuart kings increasingly abused their power to extract financial payments, ultimately leading to the recodification of Magna Carta’s protections in the English Bill of Rights. Across the Atlantic, that same protection was written into the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was eventually adopted word-for-word as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.

As our brief describes, colonial and early American records also make clear that the Founding generation did not draw sharp distinctions between remedial and punitive economic sanctions, and thus would not have viewed the Excessive Fines Clause as applying to only those payments that served exclusively punitive purposes. Indeed, in early America, a wealth of economic sanctions explicitly called “fines” were used for partially, or even primarily, remedial purposes. Further, early statutes expressly, and frequently, stated that fines collected as punishment would go toward these remedial purposes.

Second, our brief explains that under the Supreme Court’s precedents, a remedial sanction falls within the ambit of the Excessive Fines Clause so long as it also serves a partially punitive purpose. The Court made this explicit in Austin v. United States when it rejected the argument that an in rem forfeiture was beyond the scope of the Excessive Fines Clause because it also served remedial purposes and was imposed in a civil—not criminal—proceeding. And in every case to interpret the Excessive Fines Clause since Austin, the Court has expressly reaffirmed this holding. Indeed, just two years ago, two members of the Court underscored the point yet again in a case involving tax foreclosure, Tyler v. Hennepin County.

Finally, our brief argues that the court below erred by misapplying the test for what constitutes a fine under the Eighth Amendment. The court below misconstrued the Supreme Court’s precedents, leading it to conclude that Michigan’s tax foreclosure scheme is categorically exempt from scrutiny under the Excessive Fines Clause because it “does not necessarily punish property owners for failing to pay their property taxes” and because its chief “aim is to encourage the timely payment of property taxes.” Relying on an inapt Michigan Supreme Court decision, the court completely ignored the Supreme Court’s repeated admonition that economic sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose, and so they still constitute fines so long as they serve at least in part as punishment. That is true whether or not they are tied to criminal behavior, and whether or not their main purpose is to encourage the timely payment of property taxes rather than to punish the failure to do so.

To ensure that the Excessive Fines Clause can continue to play its important role in guarding against government abuse and overreach, our brief concludes by asking the Supreme Court to set the record straight about what constitutes a fine within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-12-08 11:57:53.148064

Dec. 10, 2025, is the annual celebration of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

This year’s theme is “Human Rights: Our Every Day Essentials.” It is intended to

be a reminder that our every day experiences depend greatly on the preservation of basic human rights—spending time with family, reading the news, walking freely, drinking clean water, or enjoying a meal … This year the theme also celebrates that the UN Declaration, ratified in Paris in 1948 by the General Assembly, was the first to codify these every day essentials as embedded in universal human rights. The vote in support of this Declaration included a “yes” from the United States.

Today, more than usual, we are experiencing deep challenges to these universal human rights and their “Every Day Essentials” here in Rochester, throughout the US and around the world.

Consequently, not only reminders, but opportunities for reflection and action are needed in our community. We can celebrate that many in our community are already responding to these challenges in diverse ways. More is needed.

A small planning committee for Human Rights Week surrounding Dec. 10 has been planned by an interfaith group emerging from the Greater Rochester Community of Churches, started as Voices of Faith on Immigration. We have been challenged to think more broadly, giving opportunity for reflection and action that includes not only the immigration crisis but extends well beyond it. We are a ‘sanctuary community”—yes, for immigrants and refugees, but also for ALL OF US. These universal human rights are being challenged for All OF US in our every day experiences.

The result of our own group reflections has been to plan a week of human rights opportunities for reflection offered by speakers from many faiths, recognizing actions of others in our community to date, and creating brainstorming opportunities for forward thinking actions to the human rights challenges we face. The calendar of events, some planned by us and some planned by others, in the spirit of universal human rights, is included as invitation to engage with us during this week of reflection and wider conversation about our community values; and, also, to challenge you personally to reflect on how you depend on these universal human rights for your “every day essentials”.

ICE has arrested nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, according to the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project. That’s more than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE agents. The figures don’t include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has also launched large immigration operations in cities.

News10NBC looked into the local numbers. In total, ICE arrested 56 people in Monroe County since Jan. 20. Four were convicted criminals, five had pending criminal charges, and 43 had no current criminal records (labeled: other immigrant violator). Out of those arrested, 26 were Ecuadorian, representing the largest share. All but five of those arrested were males. You can explore the data here.

News10NBC has covered several immigration investigations this year. That includes last September, when people gathered at a home in the Park Avenue neighborhood in support of roofers targeted by an ICE investigation. A man from Ecuador was arrested and, during the protest, someone slashed the tires of a government vehicle.

There was also a traffic stop on Lyell Avenue and Whitney Street in March, where video shows Rochester Police officers helping Border Patrol agents. RPD Chief David Smith said the officers in the video violated city policy by helping the agents to get people outside of the van and handcuff them. A month later, U.S. Border Czar Tom Homan visited Rochester to criticize the sanctuary city policy that limits the ways that RPD can cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Morning Reads

Roberts and Kagan prepare for another showdown on executive power (Joan Biskupic, CNN) — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan are expected to be on opposite sides in Trump v. Slaughter, as they have been in several cases on presidential power over the years, according to CNN. “Since his days as a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan administration, Roberts has argued for vast executive power, including the authority to fire individuals who lead administrative agencies. … Kagan, in contrast, believes the constitutional separation of powers allows Congress to establish and safeguard certain areas of administrative independence.”

After Supreme Court win, GOP rushes to draw more House maps (Patrick Marley, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — On Thursday, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Texas to use its new congressional map in the 2026 elections, “and Republicans across the country took the decision as a sign they could redraw more lines as they seek to retain a fragile majority in the U.S. House next year,” according to The Washington Post. “The next battleground is Indiana,” where the state House approved a new map on Friday, and Florida leaders have also expressed interest in redistricting, although “Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has said the state should wait” until the Supreme Court addresses the future of the Voting Rights Act in Louisiana v. Callais.

Democrats divided on redistricting in wake of Supreme Court’s Texas ruling (Caroline Vakil, The Hill) — As Republicans push forward with redistricting plans after the Supreme Court’s ruling on Texas’ map, Democrats continue to debate whether to pursue similar efforts in blue states, according to The Hill. “While Virginia Democrats are signaling they’ll move forward with redrawing their congressional lines, Democrats in other states have expressed opposition, posing a challenge for those in the party who want to net as many additional seats as possible before the midterms.”

Why Costco, other businesses are suing the Trump admin over tariffs (Rachel Barber, USA Today) — Businesses, like Costco, that have filed lawsuits seeking tariff refunds if the Supreme Court strikes down a large share of Trump’s signature tariffs are taking the risk of upsetting customers who support the president and complicating their relationship with the administration. “There’s so much uncertainty right now that the calculation becomes: Is filing a suit worth the incremental certainty that if this action is taken, we are in a better position?” said Drew DeLong, head of corporate statecraft at Kearney Foresight, to USA Today.

Actually, the Supreme Court Has a Plan (Sarah Isgur, The New York Times)(Paywall) — In a column for The New York Times, Advisory Opinions host and SCOTUSblog editor Sarah Isgur contended that, in Trump v. Slaughter, the court can work to “rebalance the separation of powers in the federal government” if it makes it clear that the president should have control over agencies housed within the executive branch while also reining in “Congress’s bad habit of delegating vast and vague powers to the executive branch.” “The Constitution vests ‘all legislative powers’ in Congress and ‘the executive power’ in the president,” she wrote. “The court is overdue to police those lines and keep the branches separated.”

A Closer Look: Humphrey’s Executor v. United States

A 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, is in the spotlight as the justices hear argument in Trump v. Slaughter this morning. Slaughter is specifically about the president’s authority to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause and more broadly about whether Congress can place limits on the president’s authority to fire the heads of independent, multi-member federal agencies. In considering this case, the court is faced with whether to overrule Humphrey’s Executor and thereby increase the power of the executive branch.

Humphrey’s Executor arose out of a dispute between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and William Humphrey, an FTC commissioner who had been appointed by Roosevelt’s predecessor, President Herbert Hoover, to a seven-year term in 1931. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, he twice asked Humphrey to resign. Humphrey refused, and so, a few months later, Roosevelt removed him from office. Humphrey died just over four months after that as he was fighting his removal, and the executor of his estate kept the battle going by asking the Court of Claims for “Humphrey’s salary from the date of his removal until the date of his death,” as Justice Clarence Thomas explained in a 2020 opinion.

The executor’s effort to recover backpay made it to the Supreme Court in 1935, which considered whether the Federal Trade Commission Act’s removal restrictions – it states that commissioners can only be removed “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” – unlawfully limit the president’s executive power.

The court unanimously held that those removal restrictions “are definite and unambiguous” and that it was, therefore, unlawful for Roosevelt to remove Humphrey from office for reasons other than those listed. The court further held that Congress could limit the president’s authority in this context, because the Federal Trade Commission’s “duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.”

With that memorable description, the court worked to explain why it had diverged from its decision in a 1926 case called Myers v. United States, which said the president could fire a postmaster without getting approval from the Senate, despite a federal law imposing that requirement. The justices drew a distinction between a president’s relationship to the FTC and a president’s relationship to a postmaster, determining that “[a] postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions,” whereas the FTC is more like a judicial or legislative body.

In Slaughter, the Trump administration contends that the FTC has changed significantly over the past 90 years and now exercises much more executive power than “Humphrey’s Executor attributed to the 1935 FTC.” But the administration also argues that Humphrey’s Executor should be overturned altogether, because it places impermissible limits on presidential authority.

We shall see if a majority of the justices agree.

Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Trump’s Challenge to Birthright Citizenship

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments early next year in the challenge to President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship – the guarantee of citizenship to almost everyone born in the United States. The announcement came in a brief list of orders from the justices’ private conference on Friday morning. Read Amy’s analysis to understand what’s at stake in the case.

The court also took up three other cases on Friday. Amy highlighted those disputes in a separate post.

Trump Administration Asks Court to Settle Dispute Over Immigration Judges

For the 32nd time since late January, the Trump administration on Friday came to the Supreme Court seeking emergency relief. In a 26-page filing, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to block a ruling by a federal appeals court that sent a dispute over a policy governing speaking engagements by immigration judges back to a federal trial court. Federal law, Sauer argued, makes clear that the trial court lacks the power to consider the group’s claim, because judges are required to challenge the policy through an administrative process. For more on the case, read Amy’s analysis.

Ronald Mann on FS Credit Opportunities Corporation v. Saba Capital Master Fund

The justices will be treading on familiar ground during argument in FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund, to take place on Wednesday, Dec. 10. Like many cases the court has heard in the last decade, this one asks the justices to consider whether the federal courts should recognize a federal statute as implying a private right of action (that is, providing the ability for private parties to sue) when the words of the statute do not explicitly authorize it. Ronald Mann previewed the case for SCOTUSblog.

But together, everyday people—the demos—can reset norms, rebuild institutions, shift power, and make good on the nation’s potential.","This article concludes NPQ’s series Toward a Third Reconstruction, co-produced with Dēmos. Authors in this series articulate why we need bold, courageous action to bring a Third Reconstruction within reach—and offer strategies for systemic change that can help us get there.

As the nation’s young, limited, and fragile multiracial democracy is tested, fraying under authoritarian executive actions of the Trump administration, the urgency of now makes it difficult to think expansively about the future.

As serial emergencies threaten to keep Black people and people of color perpetually off-balance—be it ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) terrorizing our communities, extrajudicial “disappearings,” de facto martial law, criminalization of racial equity, and more—history offers grounding by contextualizing the current emergencies. These are all part of a cycle of oppression, progress, and backlash that is the story of the United States.

The constructs of race, racism, and othering—catalyzed by White supremacist ideology, xenophobia, and colonialism—do not just keep us from an expansive vision of liberation. They fuel a perpetual cycle of redefining who the United States is for. Each time progress is made toward an inclusive, just society with a promise of liberty and justice for all, there follows a new season of retraction.

The First Reconstruction was a post–Civil War attempt to rebuild the nation, reclaim and more fully realize the ideals of freedom and liberty enshrined by the Constitution, and provide formal citizenship to Black Americans. But as we know, this inclusion was never fully realized and was largely reversed by Jim Crow in the South and racial discrimination in the North.

During Jim Crow, Black people and their allies fought for civil and human rights. Today…we can do no less than our forbearers.

The Second Reconstruction, also known as the modern Civil Rights movement, was a grassroots response to the authoritarian, oppressive governmental rule of Jim Crow. This movement built a new national consensus around racial justice and economic opportunity, made way for new civil rights laws, and created new tools (such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965) to make that vision a reality.

Since the close of the Civil Rights era 60 years ago, additional progress has been made. More prominent from our current vantage, however, is a protracted backlash that has rolled back those gains.

To escape this cycle, activists must both dream and plan. This is a tall order for those of us whose day-to-day lives take place in an increasingly oppressive and hostile world. In this time of pain, it may even seem impossible. But we do, in fact, possess many tools for liberation.

Those who fought before us beckon us to follow in their footsteps. Indeed, amid the most challenging context of slavery, enslaved people and their allies worked for abolition. During Jim Crow, Black people and their allies fought for civil and human rights. Today, as we face the latest antidemocratic, authoritarian regime, we can do no less than our forbearers. We must embrace and advance bold ideas like an expansive, inclusive participatory democracy.

Below, I lay out a Reconstructionist path forward. Advocates must begin by dreaming, by envisioning what radical citizenship could be. This goes beyond what seems possible at a time when we are struggling to simply defend what we thought we had achieved.

Dreaming

In Imagination: A Manifesto, Ruha Benjamin wrote that “radical imagination…isn’t counter to doing the work of changing our material conditions and improving our quality of life. Rather, radical imagination can inspire us to push beyond the constraints of what we think, and are told, is politically possible.”

This underscores that emancipation will only result from creativity—thinking beyond the range of ideas and approaches that we are explicitly and implicitly told are possible choices. We must shake off the constructs that have constrained us and replace them with something bigger, brighter. Something joyous.

Why can’t we believe bigger? Looking back, those who have been marginalized have forged paths of big dreams. Black, Latine, other people of color; young people; people with disabilities; LGBTQ+ people who came before us, all created joyous liberatory movements that insisted on inclusion and, more importantly, liberation.

Their movements challenged those who write the rules, demanding release from their oppressive systems. Today, these groups are growing. To escape minority rule in our country, we must think above and beyond the status quo. We must imagine a truly liberatory society that centers racial justice, one that can stop the cycle of retrenchment in its tracks.

We dream of achieving a world free from want not by way of benevolence by the powerful, but through a shifting of power.

It’s time to imagine a Third Reconstruction that continues the unfinished work of the Reconstructions that came before it, reclaiming and evolving a consensus around racial justice that goes beyond a circumscribed conception of political and civil rights. In this new consensus, all people will be granted radical citizenship.

In his contribution to this series, Peniel Joseph took us back to Dr. King’s “Beloved Community,” a vision of a society that has the things they need to live—affordable housing, freedom from hunger, basic healthcare, income, and safety. But the beloved community can also count on having less tangible, but not less important, things: dignity, agency, compassion, and the spiritual liberation that comes when a chronic fear of wanting for basic needs is eliminated.

The first necessary step toward a Third Reconstruction is ensuring each member of society freedom from want.

We dream of achieving a world free from want not by way of benevolence by the powerful, but through a shifting of power. Where everyday people hold and exercise power to say what their wants are and then to satisfy them.

We dream of a world where the government protects the public good and, even more, supports flourishing communities. We dream of a world where corporations hold less power, where the interests of the wealthy and corporate interests are not permitted to constrain the self-determination of everyday people, where they are not allowed to extract and must instead invest.

We dream of a world where private philanthropy is no longer necessary, because public goods are so expansive that the needs of people, the needs for material and spiritual sustenance, for food and shelter and for joy and frolicking, are met.

As King noted, “Power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose.” Radical citizenship and radical power mean that everyone thrives, not merely survives, that everyone lives in their purpose, and that self-determination is fully realized for everyone.

Allowing ourselves to dream despite the pain is our first step. But how do we live into the dream? This is where planning comes in. Institutions must foster and bolster that dream. They must transform.

There can be no inclusive multiracial democracy without a commitment to rewrite our society’s racist rules.

Transforming Social Norms for Inclusion

Transforming social norms is the most important and most difficult task required to bring about a lasting Reconstruction. Norms undergird policies, institutions, and daily practices. Yet, as evident during this period of retrenchment, they are also oddly ephemeral.

The nation is undergoing a seismic shift in understanding what behavior is appropriate for leaders, government, and individuals in society. This shift is terrifying, but it is also an opportunity. In moments of upheaval and discontent, there is space for new narratives to settle in as truths, and for those truths to take hold as new norms. We must shape our truth definitively and speak it loudly and repeatedly for it to take root in the cracks that have and will continue to emerge.

What is that truth? That truth is unapologetically centered around the imperative for racial justice. In this moment of intensified White supremacy, some shy away from explicit discussion of race and racial justice. But there can be no inclusive multiracial democracy without a commitment to rewrite our society’s racist rules.

This means sharply rejecting White supremacy and the anti-Blackness that animates it. Unless and until we have truly embraced a more expansive vision of who the United States is for, White supremacy’s reign will continue.

Since the nation’s founding, White supremacy has effectively divided people—extracting resources from them while preventing an expectation of shared prosperity from taking root. But escaping the trap of White supremacy lays the foundation for other norm shifts. On this foundation, a culture of collective responsibility that makes the beloved community a reality can be built.

A Third Reconstruction must introduce a social contract that says that all people have—by right of their innate humanity, not false constructs of deservingness—freedom from deprivation and the ability to experience dignity, peace, and joy.

Transforming Institutions

The nation’s institutions—and its bodies of government, learning, and commerce—are entangled in systemic racism, neoliberal ideologies, and other myths. To liberate ourselves, a Third Reconstruction must transform institutions and free them from these constraining frames.

Time and again, the US government has enacted policies that systematically exclude Black people and people of color from even limited democratic rights. The change needed in government institutions requires restructuring so that everyday people—their needs, their priorities, and their wants—are shaping policy decisions. That means getting money out of politics, co-governance strategies, expansive voting rights, and ultimately a more representative and accountable government.

Corporations hold outsized power in US society. A Third Reconstruction must transform the relationship between corporations and government so that those institutions serve citizens and consumers, not the other way around. Unless and until the nation changes who is valued in this economy, inequity will persist.

Building Power for the Demos

We will not realize a multiracial democracy if we do not shift the nexus of power, using what King called “the strength required to bring about social, political, and economic change.”

To generate this strength we must build new forms of economic, political, and grassroots power. These three constituent forms of power reinforce one another. Economic power allows the people—the demos—to meet their basic material needs and fully participate in the political process. Political power means that government institutions are responsive to and representative of the needs of the people and thus ensure people’s economic needs are met. And grassroots power is the saving grace, the check, the balance, when these other forms of power break.

In a 2021 paper entitled “Introducing radical democratic citizenship: from practice to theory,” Zaunseder, Woodman, and Emejulu called for power that is organic, that is reactionary, that is insurrectionary, that we see in the streets and in the press and on the ballot, that is signed in ink on petitions demanding what is needed. This grassroots power holds all other power accountable.

We must understand the past to build a durable Reconstruction. The Third Reconstruction must go far beyond narrow policy prescriptions to pursue an inclusive vision that confers, by right, a set of material and moral benefits to everyone.

For the last 25 years, my organization has held a vision of a just, inclusive multiracial economy and democracy as our North Star. To achieve that vision, movements must dream boldly, plan wisely, and manifest a Third Reconstruction.

To be sure, the United States has long fallen short of its promise. But together, everyday people—the demos—can reset norms, rebuild institutions, shift power, and make good on the nation’s potential.",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Paving_the_Road.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 11:57:33.502484

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup.
They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.
The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.
Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction.","State and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism and protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New Orleans, monitoring message boards around the clock for threats to agents while compiling regular updates on public “sentiment” surrounding the arrests, according to law enforcement records reviewed by the Associated Press.

The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.

“Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” said a briefing circulated early on Sunday to law enforcement officials. Earlier bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants”.

Immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens”. But the law enforcement records detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation.

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup. They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.

“It confirms what we already knew – this was not about public safety, it’s about stoking chaos and fear and terrorizing communities,” said the Louisiana state senator Royce Duplessis, a Democrat who represents New Orleans. “It’s furthering a sick narrative of stereotypes that immigrants are violent.”

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to questions about the intelligence gathering and referred the AP to a prior news release touting “dozens of arrests”. The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.

The DHS has publicly detailed only six arrests stemming from the operation – all people with criminal histories – including a man they vaguely said was convicted of “homicide” and another convicted of sexual assault. The agency, which has several hundred agents on the ground in south-east Louisiana, has said it aims to make at least 5,000 arrests in the region over an operation expected to last up to two months.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families or their neighbors,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.

DHS and Republican leaders have framed the crackdown as targeting the most violent offenders. But the records reviewed by the AP identify only nine of the 38 people arrested in the first days as having criminal histories that rose beyond traffic violations – information the intelligence bulletins warn “should not be distributed to the media”.

The New Orleans city council president, JP Morrell, said the stated goals of the operation to arrest violent offenders did not align with the reality of what is taking place.

“There’s literally no information being given to the city of New Orleans whatsoever,” Morrell said. “If the goal was for them to come here and augment existing law enforcement, to pursue violent criminals or people with extensive criminal histories, why wouldn’t you be more transparent about who you’ve arrested and why?”

Morrell and other officials have said the crackdown appears to be a dragnet focused on people with brown skin, citing viral videos of encounters such as masked agents chasing a 22-year-old US citizen returning home from the grocery store.

Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction. “For some supporters, the videos with sounds of children crying in the background as their parents are placed under arrest, is weighing heavy on their hearts,” one briefing stated.

The records also shed new light on cooperation among state and federal authorities in an operation welcomed by Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Both the FBI and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have stationed agents at the Louisiana State Analytical and Fusion Exchange, an intelligence and data sharing center that is closely following discussions on the online forum Reddit that local residents have used to exchange information about the immigration raids.

One briefing noted that some “have gone so far as to accuse agents of racially profiling Hispanic areas specifically”. Another flagged social media posts suggesting agents “are not keeping with the mission of targeting criminal immigrants only”. And a third pointed out that critics of the raids “bring up past hurricanes and the work done by immigrants” in their aftermath.

“The chatter is slower during the night, mainly just commenting on posts from earlier in the day,” one of the briefings states. “Once daylight arrives and agencies are back out, the chatter and new posts will pick back up.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8bb4bbac12785d74bcac754e57899fce2427de9/642_0_6422_5138/master/6422.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=379a43734a682d8c18906ee715d79a9e",N,,2025-12-08 11:57:42.310628

The university confirms the men were federal immigration agents who detained a student on campus.

A student shared the video with 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS. It shows a man holding a rifle near a residence hall entrance. About a minute later in the video, a second armed man walks through the same parking lot. The footage ends with at least two unmarked SUVs driving away.

In an email to students and staff, the university’s provost said the incident happened around 3 p.m. Saturday in Parking Lot B.

According to Augsburg, ICE agents in an unmarked car tried to detain a student who officials believe was followed and targeted before arriving on campus.

The provost said campus public safety responded, and when an on-call administrator arrived, the agents told them they did not have a judicial warrant. The student was ultimately taken off campus.

A university spokesperson declined an on-camera interview, but said in a statement the agents’ tactics were “unacceptable, dangerous and profoundly disturbing.”

“I’m worried, don’t know if I feel safe here,” Adam Maxmed, a student, said. “I feel like my friends and everyone I know might be taken away one day, and I won’t really know where they went.”

Several students told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS they’re unsure what this means for their safety moving forward.

“It’s unlawful. If they have a warrant, there’s nothing we can do about it, but if they can bust in, just take whoever they want without a signed warrant signed by a judge, that’s worrisome,” Maxmed said.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more information on why the student was detained, and is still waiting for a response.

Augsburg University’s statement is below.

“The Augsburg University community was deeply shaken by an incident that took place on campus on December 6. Without producing a warrant, an armed, masked group of ICE agents targeted an undergraduate student and confronted members of our community directly outside a residence hall. They aimed weapons at witnesses that included staff and students while many more students watched from their windows. These tactics, with the implicit threat of violence, are unacceptable, dangerous, and profoundly disturbing.

“As an urban university, Augsburg has long-standing, professional relationships with local law enforcement, and we are accustomed to partnering closely on public safety issues.

""They just kept banging on the door until they broke it down,"" said Sofia Alvarado, through a translator. Alvarado's husband owns the home and they rent the lower level.

Damage could be seen not only on the front door but also on multiple doors throughout the home on both levels.

Alvarado heard banging and she, along with three other family members on the upper floor, hid in the bathroom, not knowing who was at the door.

Angel Alvarado, Sofia's brother, said ICE agents took his sister, mom, daughter and niece into the kitchen and made them hand over their phones.

""They all were scared, crying... they were pointing with the guns not to move,"" Angel said.

He said all four are U.S. citizens and were able to show their paperwork to ICE eventually.

Sofia said it all started when the couple renting on the lower level was headed home from the grocery store. According to Sofia, the couple was followed home by ICE agents.

Ring camera footage shows ICE agents detaining the man while the woman runs away. Family said she ran into the house and hid with her 7-year-old boy.

Angel showed the bedroom door with a hole through the middle of it. Both Angel and Sofia said ICE agents detained both of the 7-year-olds' parents and that his father has a work permit.

Angel said ICE also detained another man downstairs and a fourth man, a father to two kids with a third child on the way.

His wife, who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, is six months pregnant.

""She said as soon as her husband walked out of the room, she didn't see him again,"" a translator told KARE 11.

She hid with her 7-year-old daughter and 1-and-a-half-year-old boy.

""When she went out, they were pointing their guns at her,"" a translator said.

She said the family is here illegally from Honduras for work and that ICE told her to voluntarily self-deport.

A translator said, ""She said that if you can have someone help her... have her husband come back home because in the state that she is in with two kids and one more on the way, she thinks it's going to be very hard for her.""

She is also now taking care of the 7-year-old boy while they wait to find out what will happen to his parents.

The families at the house claimed ICE entered the home without showing a warrant. KARE 11 has not been able to independently confirm that, but we have reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and are waiting to hear back.

The city of Burnsville put out a statement on Sunday:

We are actively monitoring federal immigration activity in our city. Federal government agents have been present to carry out immigration enforcement operations. We know this has created fear and uncertainty for many in our community.

Burnsville Police do not engage in federal immigration enforcement and are typically not notified of federal operations. Burnsville police officers enforce only state and local laws. Burnsville Police do not check someone's immigration status. Our role is to keep everyone in our community safe. If gatherings or protests occur in response to federal actions, our officers may respond to ensure safety for everyone present.

Over the last week, city staff have been in contact with impacted community leaders and groups to offer support, hear and address their concerns and provide accurate information and resources. That work will continue.

You should never hesitate to call 911 if you witness or are a victim of a crime, regardless of your immigration status.

The United States remains one of about thirty countries, mostly in the Americas, that grant automatic citizenship by birth.
Two landmark Supreme Court cases, United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution.

A study by the Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University’s Population Research Institute found that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the unauthorized population by 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.","The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could determine whether the United States will continue to recognize birthright citizenship, a constitutional protection that has stood for more than 150 years. The justices announced Friday that they will decide whether President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end automatic citizenship for certain children born in the country is constitutional. The directive, called Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, was issued on Trump’s first day of his second term and has been blocked by multiple federal courts.

Under the order, which has not taken effect due to litigation, people born in the United States would not automatically receive citizenship if their parents were in the country temporarily or without legal authorization. The administration argues that the 14th Amendment was intended to apply only to freed slaves and their children, not to undocumented immigrants or people visiting the country. The case poses sweeping implications for Trump’s broader immigration agenda and for the longstanding understanding of what it means to be an American citizen.

The 14th Amendment, enacted in 1868, states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” For nearly 160 years, this clause has been interpreted to guarantee citizenship to nearly all people born on US soil, with exceptions for children of diplomats and foreign military personnel. The United States remains one of about thirty countries, mostly in the Americas, that grant automatic citizenship by birth.

Two landmark Supreme Court cases, United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution. These rulings form the core precedent that federal courts have repeatedly cited while blocking Trump’s attempt to reinterpret the amendment. According to the 9th Circuit, which unanimously ruled the order unconstitutional in July, the directive “violated the plain language of the 14th Amendment.” In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have struck down the order.

Despite this broad judicial rejection, the Supreme Court’s right wing majority ruled in June that “universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.” While that decision did not address birthright citizenship directly, it limited the tools available to lower courts and helped pave the way for this case to reach the justices. The Supreme Court has not yet set a date for oral arguments, but a ruling is expected months from now.

Civil rights groups say the legal question is already settled. “No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” said Cecillia Wang, national legal director at the ACLU, which is leading a nationwide class action challenge to Trump’s order. She added, “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,” and said, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

Other advocates expressed alarm that the Court agreed to hear the case at all. Brett Edkins, managing director of policy and political affairs at Stand Up America, said, “This case is a right-wing fantasy, full stop. That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair.” He added, “Even if the court ultimately rules against Trump, in a laughable display of its supposed independence, the fact that fringe attacks on our most basic rights as citizens are being seriously considered is outrageous and alarming.”

Legal groups emphasized the longevity and clarity of existing constitutional protections. Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, said “it’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” noting that “every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional.” Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund, said, “The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution.” She added, “We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century. Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”

The administration’s argument rests on a narrower reading of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer claims that the amendment was adopted “to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” Sauer argued it is a “mistaken view” that birth on US soil confers citizenship and claimed this interpretation has had “destructive consequences.”

The potential consequences of ending birthright citizenship are substantial. According to data cited in the source material, about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the US in 2016, a 36 percent decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorized immigrant parents. A study by the Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University’s Population Research Institute found that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the unauthorized population by 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075. Such an outcome would create more people without legal status, including those born and raised in the United States, intensifying the very conditions the administration claims to be addressing.

The legal stakes, political consequences, and human impact of this challenge to the 14th Amendment are enormous. The Court’s decision to hear the case signals a willingness to reconsider constitutional guarantees that have guided the country for more than a century and a half. The ruling will determine not only the fate of Trump’s executive order but also the stability of citizenship for millions of Americans, and the durability of one of the Constitution’s most far reaching promises.",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/26182333/faviconmaster.png,N,,2025-12-08 10:58:55.741588

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

Thailand’s military said today that it launched airstrikes along the disputed border with Cambodia in response to Cambodia’s attack yesterday on Thai soldiers. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he would “use necessary means to preserve [Thailand’s] sovereignty.” A spokesperson for Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defence said today that Thailand struck first, claiming they attacked Cambodian troops yesterday afternoon and again this morning. The Thai army said that more than 50,000 people have left areas near the border, while Cambodian Information Minister Neth Pheaktra said that Thai forces killed four Cambodian civilians, adding that tens of thousands of residents had been displaced from several border villages. Jintamas Saksornchai and Sopheng Cheang report for AP News; BBC News reports.

The United Nations today announced that it will halve the amount of money it requests from donor countries in 2026 to help people affected by war and natural disasters. “It’s the cuts [to aid budgets] ultimately that are forcing us into these tough, tough, brutal choices that we’re having to make,” U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher told reporters. “We are overstretched, underfunded, and under attack.” Emma Farge and Olivia Le Poidevin report for Reuters; Nick Cumming-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

Beijing’s Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong summoned journalists from foreign media organizations on Saturday to warn them about coverage of the city’s recent Wang Fuk Court fire, according to the New York Times. The officials told journalists that they would face consequences if they were deemed to have violated the national security law, with one saying: “Do not say you have not been warned.” In recent days, the office issued statements warning “anti-China forces” not to exploit the Wang Fuk Court fire to undermine social stability. The New York Times reports.

Nigeria’s government has secured the release of around 100 schoolchildren who were abducted last month in Niger State, a local broadcaster reported yesterday, and Niger State’s police chief confirmed today. Madina Maishanu and Basillioh Rukanga report for BBC News.

The Africa Corps, a new Russian military unit that has replaced the Wagner mercenary group in Mali, is carrying out abuses, including rapes and beheadings, alongside Mali’s military, dozens of civilians told AP News. Monika Pronczuk and Caitlin Kelly report.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russians accused of war crimes in Ukraine will stay in place even if a blanket amnesty is approved in the U.S.-led peace talks, ICC prosecutors said on Friday. The prosecutors said that a U.N. Security Council resolution would be required to suspend the court-issued warrants, adding “apart from the bracket we mentioned in respect of the Security Council route, we are obligated to observe our statute, which does not give weight to some of those political arrangements.” Anthony Deutsch reports for Reuters.

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held productive talks with Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov and Ukrainian Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Andriy Hnatov on Friday, according to U.S. officials. A White House Official said that “progress was made,” but did not provide any further details. The participants are said to have discussed the developments arising from Witkoff’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier last week. Steve Holland, Humeyra Pamuk, and Andrea Shalal report for Reuters.

Russia unleashed more than 650 drones and 51 missiles on towns and cities across Ukraine in an overnight assault on Friday, according to Ukrainian officials. On Saturday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had “just had a long and substantive phone call” with Witkoff and Kushner, during which they “agreed on the next steps and formats for talks with the United States.” One source told Axios that the territory discussion was difficult, with another source adding that the United States is trying to develop new ideas to bridge the issue. Cassandra Vinograd, Oleksandr Chubko, and Maria Varenikova report for the New York Times; Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

“We are starting a new diplomatic week right now – there will be consultations with European leaders,” Zelenskyy said yesterday in a video address. He is set to meet with British, French and German leaders in London today. Olena Harmash reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Gen. Eyal Zamir, told his troops yesterday in Gaza that “the Yellow Line is a new border line – serving as a forward defensive for our communities and a line of operational activity.” Zamir’s comments come amid uncertainty over how the next phase of the peace plan, requiring Hamas to disarm and Israel to withdraw further from Gaza, will be implemented. James Shotter reports for the Financial Times.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that the second phase of the U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza was close, but still hinged on unresolved issues such as whether a multinational security force would enter Gaza. Netanyahu said that he is set to hold talks with Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the second phase is achieved. Alexander Cornwell reports for Reuters.

“We can talk about freezing or storing or laying down [weapons], with the Palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AP News yesterday. Naim suggested a long-term truce of five or ten years for discussions aimed at the establishment of a Palestinian state to take place, adding that Hamas is “very open minded” about what to do with its weapons. Josef Federman and Samy Magdy report.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Israeli soldiers yesterday shot at three Palestinians who were throwing rocks at cars in the occupied West Bank and killed one of them, the Israeli military said, adding that one other person was “neutralized” and one was arrested. The Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed that one person had been killed and one wounded in the incident. On Saturday, Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian teenager who, the Israeli army says, was driving a car towards them and a bystander at a checkpoint in Hebron. Ali Sawafta and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

A drone attack, allegedly by the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, hit a kindergarten in Sudan’s South Kordofan region, killing 50 people, including 33 children, Sudan’s Doctors’ Network said on Friday. The death toll is expected to be higher, but communication blackouts in the area have made it difficult to report. AP News reports.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Top Democrats yesterday called for the release of a classified video of the U.S. military’s Sept. 2 strikes on an alleged drug vessel, in which two survivors of an initial strike were killed by a follow-up strike. “It seems pretty clear they don’t want to release this video because they don’t want people to see it, because it’s very, very difficult to justify,” Democratic leader of the House Armed Services Committee Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) said yesterday. Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO’s conventional defense capabilities by 2027, Pentagon officials told European diplomats in Washington last week, according to five sources. Pentagon officials indicated that Washington was not satisfied with the steps Europe has taken to boost its defense capabilities, adding that if Europe does not meet the 2027 deadline, the United States may stop participating in some NATO defense coordination mechanisms. Gram Slattery and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

The United States, Israel, and Qatar yesterday held a trilateral meeting in New York to rebuild relations after the Israeli strike in Doha, two sources told Axios. Barak Ravid reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

New Orleans City Council leaders on Friday pushed back against the Homeland Security Department’s “Operation Catahoula Crunch,” calling for DHS to release arrest data, for federal agents to remove their masks and for the department to offer clear due process protections. Mayor-elect Helena Moreno issued five demands, which she says were sent directly to Border Patrol agent Gregory Bovino, who is leading the New Orleans-area operation. Chelsea Brasted reports for Axios.

While immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps in New Orleans are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens,” law enforcement records shared with AP News detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation. The records also show that state and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism of the immigration crackdown, monitoring message boards for threats to agents and compiling data on public sentiment surrounding the arrests. Jim Mustian and Jack Brook report.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to return Faustino Pablo Pablo, a man it deported to Guatemala in violation of an immigration court’s finding that he was likely to face torture there. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday deported around 50 Iranian citizens on a chartered plane, making stops in Egypt and then Kuwait, where the Iranians would transfer onto a different flight to Tehran, according to two Iranian officials. A U.S. official confirmed the flight had taken off yesterday and described it as a routine deportation flight that included nationals from other countries, not just Iran. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A bicameral version of the National Defense Authorization Act, set for a vote as soon as this week, would authorize around $8 billion more for the military than the Trump administration had requested. The legislation would also place new restrictions on reducing troop levels in Europe, standing in contrast to Trump’s new national security strategy published last week. The legislation Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Justice Department from using key evidence in its efforts to seek another indictment against former FBI Director James B. Comey, following an emergency filing on Friday night by Daniel C. Richman arguing that the DOJ had obtained his files in violation of his constitutional rights and should not be allowed to use them in any attempt to re-indict Comey. Alan Feuer reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday granted the DOJ’s request to publicly release grand jury records related to the criminal prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The judge said that the new law requiring the department to disclose nearly all investigative records into Epstein held by the DOJ surpasses the standard regulations prohibiting the public release of grand jury material. Erica Orden reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday rebuked Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) for his “lack of loyalty” as Cuellar announced that he will be running for Congress again as a Democrat just days after Trump pardoned him. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

Trump said on Friday that winning the first-ever FIFA Peace Prize was “truly one of the greatest honors” of his life. “The fact that we could do that, in India, Pakistan, so many different wars that we were able to end, in some cases, a little bit before they started, just right before they started … but we got them done,” Trump said at Washington D.C.’s Kennedy Center. Josephine Walker reports for Axios.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court said on Friday that it will hear arguments on the Trump administration’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship. Justin Jouvenal reports for the Washington Post.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration exceeded its authority in holding migrants designated for deportation at the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The judge rejected the administration’s request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. The judge also denied class certification of the case with respect to the named Plaintiffs’ habeas corpus claim, while certifying a class of “all immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States who have been ordered removed…and who are, or will be, held at the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.” Carol Rosenberg reports for the New York Times.

Advocates summarized in their letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations. The letter comes just weeks after Rep. Veronica Escobar warned that people detained at Ft. Bliss were given foul-tasting drinking water, rotten food, and inadequate healthcare.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Ft. Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility. Numerous detained people told lawyers that officers have engaged in a widespread and unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force.

One detained teenager using the pseudonym “Samuel” told lawyers he was beaten by officers so severely he sustained injuries across his body, lost consciousness, and had to be taken to a hospital in an ambulance. The letter relays Samuel’s account that his right front tooth broke from the force of being slammed to the ground, and as Samuel attests, one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” Samuel went on to say that while he was feeling “dizzy” and was “fighting to remain conscious,” an officer laughed at Samuel for having a chipped tooth after being slammed to the ground and told Samuel he was “like a little girl.” Samuel said that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear is so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

In their letter, the groups also reiterate their calls to immediately halt deportations of people to third countries to which they have no genuine ties. Interviewees said that at Ft. Bliss, the prospect of such removals has taken on a particularly abusive character. People detained attested that officers at Ft. Bliss have beaten detained people and used the threat of violence, criminal charges, and imprisonment in attempts to coerce non-Mexican immigrants held at Ft. Bliss to cross the border into the Mexican desert.

Isaac, a Cuban immigrant held at Ft. Bliss, attested in a sworn declaration that officers told him that he was going to be deported to Mexico. Isaac told lawyers that, “the guards hit my head” and “slammed it against the wall approximately ten times.” He also said that officers grabbed and crushed his testicles between their fingers, and that soon after, officers handcuffed Isaac and approximately 20 other people, placed them on a bus, and drove them to the border, where they were informed they could get off the bus and cross into Mexico. Isaac added that officers told them “If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa.” Isaac is also using a pseudonym to protect his identity.

The letter – which was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Mexico, ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, and Texas Civil Rights Project – also follows widespread media coverage detailing abusive conditions. In September 2025, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Ft. Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

The Trump administration hastily opened the sprawling tent camp in August 2025, despite warnings from members of Congress and advocates that the facility would be a humanitarian disaster. The facility is located on the military base formerly used to intern people of Japanese descent during World War II and currently holds over 2,700 people, making it the country’s largest immigration detention center.

Gray’s Landing resident and plaintiff Mindy King said that since June, chemical agents have drifted into her complex multiple times.
Dooly also said a number of tenants who live on the side of the building facing the ICE facility have received doctor’s notes to move to a unit further from the facility.
He continued, ""There is precedent in other cases where courts have imposed these kinds of injunctions, like, specifically against the use of tear gas.
“The truth is, residents of all types and community members of all types are being impacted by the tear gas and the use of it through ICE,” King said.","The owners and some residents of an apartment complex next to the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility filed a lawsuit against the federal government.

The landlords of the building, Gray's Landing, along with seven of its residents, filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to stop the use of chemical munitions by federal agents near the building.

The nonprofit REACH Community Development owns Gray’s Landing, which houses over 200 low-income seniors, veterans, families, and people with disabilities.

Dan Jacobson, the attorney representing the residents and nonprofit, told KATU News that the lawsuit focuses specifically on federal agents’ use of tear gas, smoke grenades, and other chemical munitions during the ongoing protests outside of the ICE facility, and their impact on residents.

'Unstoppable coughing'

The apartment complex's residents said federal officers have repeatedly used chemical agents over the past six months, with the chemicals often seeping into their homes.

Gray’s Landing resident and plaintiff Mindy King said that since June, chemical agents have drifted into her complex multiple times.

“There was the time where it actually got into the buildings of the entire, this entire Gray’s Landing apartment building and the Matisse,” King said. “I know floors two through six, end to end, were full of tear gas, which meant it did creep into every residents’ home that didn’t have their door sealed.”

The lawsuit states, “with each exposure, Plaintiffs experience physical reactions including difficulty breaking, unstoppable coughing, severe burning in their throats and eyes, dizziness, headaches, and more. Those symptoms do not usually end when the smoke clears.”

Another plaintiff and long-time resident of Gray’s Landing Susan Dooley told KATU News that she was recently diagnosed with mild heart failure, which she attributed to the chemical munitions being deployed on a regular basis.

Dooly also said a number of tenants who live on the side of the building facing the ICE facility have received doctor’s notes to move to a unit further from the facility.

Jacobson said in addition to the physical injuries, the residents have also reported psychological trauma.

“Our plaintiffs have resorted to, you know, putting wet towels under their doors, sealing their doors shut,” Jacobson said. “For one of our Plaintiffs who has two small children, the children have at times asked to sleep in the closet of his room just to feel some sense of safety. These are children under 10 years old.”

Jacobson also pointed out a number of residents are veterans and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in various ways.

“All of these things happening outside every time inevitably triggers that PTSD and is really harrowing, including for some of our plaintiffs,” Jacobson said.

”This has been so traumatic that it’s actually in my nervous system,” King said.

On the necessity of deploying munitions

According to Jacobson, REACH has told him that they’ve taken numerous efforts ahead of legal action to try and mitigate the use chemical agents, including working with the city, and ""ultimately they decided they had to resort to litigation to try and protect their residents.”

Last month, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to the prospect of this lawsuit, saying in part, “DHS is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers.”

In response to that statement, Jacobson said, “there’s video proof of our allegations which we’ll introduce during the course of this case. There’s tons of video showing the deployment of this tear gas at times when there’s no violence going on.”

He went on to say, “The government is saying it’s warranted, but what we’re saying is only when it’s warranted in one particular very narrow circumstances where it’s necessary to prevent against an imminent threat to somebody’s life, not 'it’s warranted because this is just how they want to respond to people yelling loudly,' or because they want to disperse a crowd that’s assembled only in very narrow circumstance.""

He continued, ""There is precedent in other cases where courts have imposed these kinds of injunctions, like, specifically against the use of tear gas. We’re not asking the court to ban the use of these agents where it is truly necessary to protect somebody’s life, but to do it, to create a line that’s really as narrow as possible.”

In addition to asking the court to grant an injunction on federal agents’ use of chemical agents outside the ICE facility, the lawsuit is also asking for a judge to declare the conduct unconstitutional, and to get paid restitution.

“The truth is, residents of all types and community members of all types are being impacted by the tear gas and the use of it through ICE,” King said.",https://abcnews4.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/1320/center/90/4bea7495-a831-4a94-b219-00359c4198ec-SCOTTICEPROTEST_frame_8476.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 11:57:59.411079

The video came days after federal agents carried out a raid in Manhattan, prompting demonstrations near the city's Chinatown neighborhood.

Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on January 1, vowed to protect the city's 3 million immigrants, stating ""We can all stand up to ICE if you know your rights."" Newsweek has reached out to Mamdani's office and ICE for comment.

Why It Matters

The video marks an early indication of how Mamdani plans to navigate tensions between New York City's sanctuary city policies and President Donald Trump administration's federal immigration enforcement operations.

Mamdani, who will become New York City's first Muslim mayor, secured 50.4 percent of the vote and defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in both the Democratic primary and general election. Trump has pledged to crack down on sanctuary cities, vowing to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that refuse compliance with federal immigration actions.

With ICE conducting sweeps in several U.S. cities, the guidance could affect how millions of immigrants in New York respond to federal agents.

What To Know

In the video, Mamdani outlined several key rights available to people encountering ICE agents. He explained that individuals can choose not to speak to federal immigration agents, film them without interfering with their work, and refuse requests to enter private spaces. ICE agents cannot enter homes, schools, or private workplace areas without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to Mamdani.

""ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. If you're being detained, you may always ask, 'Am I free to go?' repeatedly until they answer you,"" Mamdani said in the clip.

The guidance comes one week after demonstrators gathered as ICE attempted to detain people on Canal Street near Chinatown. A similar immigration sweep in the same neighborhood last October also met with protests, indicating ongoing tensions between federal enforcement and community resistance.

Mamdani has been highly critical of ICE, describing it as ""a rogue agency, one that has no interest in laws, no interest in order"" during a June interview. He previously pledged to use mayoral power to stop ICE agents from deporting New York residents and position the city as a model for progressive governance.

However, experts question the practical limits of municipal resistance. Scott Mechkowski, a retired ICE agent who worked for the agency from the mid-1990s until 2019, dismissed Mamdani's stance as campaign strategy, previously telling Newsweek that mayors cannot stop the federal government from executing its mandated duties.

Weeks before posting the video, Mamdani had what was described as a surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting with Trump, whose administration is overseeing the current federal immigration enforcement operations.

What People Are Saying

Zohran Mamdani says in the video: ""New York will always welcome immigrants, and I will fight each and every day to protect, support, and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters.""

Mamdani on resistance against Trump's immigration plans: ""If you want to pursue your promise to create the single largest deportation force in American history, or your promise to persecute and punish your political enemies, then you will have to get through me to do that here in New York City.""

It's been three years since Stattmiller began hosting the weekly Sunday morning coffee meetups. This Sunday, the gathering was hosted outside of Holy Land on Central Avenue, and the coffee was accompanied by a common cause.

""We're trying to fight back,"" Stattmiller said. ""We know the people that work here. These are people that we care about, and they have worked their entire lives to make this work.""

Stattmiller said he's also worried about the economic impacts of slowed foot traffic at neighborhood businesses. ""Sales are down, and that's the whole district. That’s not just one or two businesses. That’s not just Holy Land.""

Meanwhile, in Washington, White House Border Czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the targeting of Somali immigrants in Minnesota. Homan argued that the operations are legal and that ICE agents are not detaining people based solely on their appearance.

“Their appearance alone can’t raise reasonable suspicion,” Homan stated. “It’s articulable facts, a lot of different facts, taking everything into consideration.""

Homan declined to address controversial comments made by President Trump the previous week, when Trump referred to Somali immigrants as ""garbage.""

""Do I think there’s been zero U.S. citizens who have been detained for questioning because reasonable suspicion suggested they may be in the country illegally or may have an issue?

The next three stories follow families who are grappling with the fallout.

On a warm afternoon in late September, Will Lambek walked up to an intercom box outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection station in Richford.

His cell phone had been inundated with calls and texts since Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained nine construction workers during a targeted operation in Hardwick earlier that morning.

Lambek, an organizer with the group Migrant Justice, had come to the CBP station seeking answers about the detainees’ whereabouts.

“I was wondering if maybe they were brought here? Or if you know if they’re at ICE in St. Albans?” Lambek asked the agent through the intercom speaker.

“Sure, no problem, hold on one second,” the agent responded.

If CBP had the answer, they weren’t giving it to Lambek.

“Alright, no comment,” the agent replied. “Have a good day.”

Lambek walked back to the car to resume the search for the immigrant workers, all of whom lived in Caledonia County.

Back in January, it wasn’t at all clear what President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign would mean for immigrants in Vermont. Reality came into clearer focus on April 21, when immigration agents arrested and detained eight people at a dairy farm in Berkshire.

It was, at the time, the largest known immigration raid in Vermont history. It’s since been eclipsed multiple times in communities across the state, including by the Hardwick arrests.

“I think it’s still happening so much in the shadows,” Lambek told Vermont Public. Vermonters, he predicted, “are going to be shocked by the volume” of arrests.

Vermont has seen a bipartisan push over the past decade to protect its growing community of immigrant workers by prohibiting state and local police from collaborating with federal authorities on civil immigration enforcement. But in the past year, an influx of resources at the Department of Homeland Security, and significant changes to its enforcement protocols, have given federal agencies the tools they need to descend on rural Vermont communities and arrest people on their own.

In the last 10 months, federal agents have arrested more than 100 people in Vermont, according to Migrant Justice. Those arrests have upended the lives of those individuals and the families they support, and sent shockwaves through their communities.

Migrant Justice was founded in 2009 to improve working conditions and advance civil rights for Vermont’s immigrant farmworker community. This year, however, much of its work has been devoted to aiding immigrants targeted by a deportation program that’s unlike anything the organization has ever seen.

'The deportation machine on crack'

Rossy is an organizer at Migrant Justice who’s lived and worked in Vermont since 2017. Vermont Public is not using her last name because her immigration status puts her at risk of deportation.

“We’re living in terror,” Rossy said, speaking through an interpreter. “When we hear about an immigration detention happening like this it creates terror in the community and it has this very quick ripple effect where people hear about it and they feel fear. They don’t want to leave their homes. They don’t want to visit family members. They don’t want to go to the store.”

Migrant Justice operates a 24-hour emergency hotline for people to report immigration arrests, and it maintains a database of case files for people arrested and detained in Vermont. A raid of construction workers at a gas station in Jeffersonville in early November pushed this year’s total to more than 100.

Last year, the organization documented fewer than 20 detentions.

Federal immigration authorities have not provided state-specific data on the total number of arrests in Vermont this year.

When people are detained, the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law School is one of the few places they can turn to for legal services in Vermont. Last year the center got four calls from individuals seeking advice or counsel, according to its director, Brett Stokes.

“Fast forward to now, I have simply just lost count of the number of calls that our office has received,” Stokes said.

Stokes and other immigration attorneys weren’t sure what to expect when Trump began his second term, because his campaign rhetoric back in 2016 didn’t translate into major policy shifts during his first term in the White House.

“If you’re trying to split hairs between what like, Trump 1 and Biden looks like, they’re exactly the same,” Stokes said. “There were no quantifiable differences in immigration enforcement policy between those two administrations.”

Stokes said Trump’s second term has ventured into uncharted territory.

“Basically I describe it as, this is the deportation machine on crack,” he said.

Trump officials say the crackdown is necessary to combat what they’ve characterized as “mass unchecked migration” into the United States.

One distinguishing feature of the new administration, according to Stokes, is the abandonment of historical norms that focused immigration enforcement primarily on public safety threats.

“Everyone’s a target now, versus in the past there was some semblance of what I’ll refer to as enforcement guidelines or enforcement priorities,” he said.

The Trump administration has also dramatically increased financial resources available to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, and assumed a far more aggressive posture in federal immigration courts.

Making a life in Vermont

Vermont residents caught up in that wider net have sometimes been sent to out-of-state detention facilities, accused by the federal government of nothing more than a civil immigration offense. They include Jose, who came to the state from Chiapas, Mexico, about a year and a half ago.

Jose — Vermont Public is not using his last name because of his immigration status — works on a farm in Franklin County. Immigration agents showed up at his house in the spring, arrested him, and flew him to a detention center in Texas.

“It was sad at first with the uncertainty, and thinking that we were going to be deported,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.

He was released on bond and came back to Vermont. The federal government’s deportation case against him is still pending. Jose said being locked up for those two weeks changed him. He doesn’t leave his home anymore, and lives in fear of another arrest. But he said the experience has only cemented his resolve to build a more prosperous and secure life for his family in Vermont.

He has a wife and a 13-year-old son in Chiapas whom he hopes to one day bring to the U.S.

“They should know that as a community we’re united,” he said. “And we’re committed to being here and defending our rights and continuing to progress as a community.”

Rossy, the organizer with Migrant Justice, said when she first arrived in Vermont, most immigrants were working on farms. Now they’re also mainstays in the construction and hospitality industries.

The Vermont Department of Labor said it doesn’t have any data on the number of undocumented people in the state’s labor force. Migrant Justice estimates the number of Latin American immigrants working without authorization is somewhere near 3,000.

Trump’s deportation campaign notwithstanding, Rossy said most of them still want to make a life here.

“This isn’t about the fight today. It’s not about the fight tomorrow. It’s for the long term,” Rossy said. “And maybe I’m not going to be the one who benefits from this struggle, but maybe it’s going to be kids, or the next generation after them.”

Rossy said it’s been gratifying to see so many Vermonters protest against ICE, and sign court petitions in support of detained immigrants.

“I think here in the state of Vermont a lot of people do see us and they recognize our fight for human rights,” she said. “We know there are people here who have our backs.”

Then she paused and began to cry.

What’s also become clear over the past 10 months, Rossy continued, is how many people want them gone.

“We also know there are a lot of people who don’t want us here, who are racist, who discriminate against us, who are happy about what’s happening to us,” she said. “So to those people, I want to say that we’re human beings as well and we deserve the same things as everyone else.” ■",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9359f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4850x2546+0+687/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2Feb%2Fb83b6d9746b2b86d747f66c9b8da%2Fmigrant-justice-rally-rossy-vermontpublic-zmcdonald-20250424.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 07:57:11.674750

At issue is whether President Trump can fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, whom Trump appointed in 2018, during his first term, to fill a Democratic seat on the Federal Trade Commission. President Biden appointed Slaughter to a second term, which was supposed to end in 2029.

Instead, in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel informing her that she was being removed from office, effective immediately. She was told her ""continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with [the Trump] Administration's priorities.""

Congress created the FTC in 1914 as a bipartisan, independent agency tasked with protecting the American economy from unfair methods of competition. By law, the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party, and commissioners can only be fired for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.""

Slaughter had been given no such reason for her removal, and so she sued. A lower court declared that Slaughter had been unlawfully removed from the FTC and ordered her back to work. The Trump administration appealed that ruling, and in September, the Supreme Court issued an emergency order removing her from her seat until the merits of her case could be heard. Justices voted 6 to 3 along ideological lines to allow her firing to stand -- for now.

Reconsidering a 90-year-old precedent

Proving that history does repeat itself, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire an FTC commissioner over ideological disagreements. In that case, called Humphrey's Executor, the court unanimously held that while the president has the power to remove purely executive officers for any reason, that unlimited power does not extend to agencies like the FTC, whose duties ""are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.""

Following that 1935 decision, Congress went on to create many more multimember, independent agencies whose members likewise can only be removed for cause. Since January, Trump has also removed Democratic members from some of those agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

In Slaughter's case and others, the Trump administration argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Executor was flawed, due to a misunderstanding of the FTC's functions at the time. The administration maintains that the FTC did in fact exercise executive power then and says those powers have only grown in the decades since.

During Trump's first term, the Supreme Court chipped away at Humphrey's Executor when it permitted Trump to fire the head of another independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the firing was permissible because the CFPB is run by a single director rather than a multimember board. Chief Justice John Roberts described Humphrey's Executor as applying to multimember agencies ""that do not wield substantial executive power.""

On Friday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in line with that guidance. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court said Trump's firings of Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris and National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox were lawful, citing those agencies' ""significant executive powers.""

A clash of views on independent agencies

Slaughter believes that it is vital for the Supreme Court to preserve the independence of bipartisan multimember agencies and allow her to be reinstated.

""Independence allows the decision-making that is done by these boards and commissions to be on the merits, about the facts, and about protecting the interests of the American people,"" she said. ""That is what Americans deserve from their government.""

James M. Burnham, an attorney who has served in both Trump administrations, offered an opposing view.

""I don't think there is such a thing as an independent agency because everything has to be in one of the three branches of government,"" he argued. ""I don't think they've ever been independent because I think the removal protections have been unconstitutional from the beginning.""

The court will continue its deliberation on Humphrey's Executor on Jan. 21 when it considers another case involving Trump's attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

Augsburg University stated that the incident occurred around 4 p.m. and involved ICE agents aiming weapons at witnesses, including staff and students. The university described these actions as ""unacceptable, dangerous, and profoundly disturbing.""

A viewer provided FOX 9 with a video of the incident, noting that someone was detained. However, FOX 9 has not yet independently confirmed this information.

What they're saying:

""The public just can't walk into the school hallways. Well, there's no reason why an ICE officer can do the same and so if they want to get in, they can either get a warrant or they can wait outside. They can't come in the building,"" said David Wilson, managing attorney.

He explained that ICE needs a judicial warrant to enter school buildings.

Wilson also emphasized that if ICE shows up without a judicial warrant, individuals are not obligated to answer questions or provide information.

""ICE is often just probing and trying to find out if someone is there. And so often, people volunteer information when they really don't have to do that,"" said Wilson.

Why you should care:

This incident highlights ongoing concerns about ICE activities in the Twin Cities and raises questions about the rights of schools and individuals when ICE agents are present.

Two types of warrants

Big picture view:

There are potentially two different warrants ICE could show you. They can show you an ICE warrant or a judicial one.

According to Wilson, with the ICE warrant you can’t interfere, but you don’t have to facilitate in finding someone.

""An ice warrant will describe it will have ICE's in notation, saying, this is a notice from ice could be a notice of inspection. It could be an administrative subpoena. A judicial warrant will be signed by a judge. It will have a seal on it, it'll be very clear that a judge has reviewed it, compared to an ice officer signing it over at Fort Snelling,"" said Wilson.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1280/720/12_7_25-augsburg-raw-rb_00.00.00.00.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:01.813288

Over 1 million Latinos live in the Chicago suburbs, and the Latino population of the suburbs has grown more quickly than that of the city over the past 15 years.

West Chicago, Elgin, Waukegan, Aurora … This is ground zero.” I work with the rapid response team in Elgin even though I am fearful.","I’ve been living in the suburbs for over three years. I don’t enjoy driving a lot, but the suburbs help me feel safe. My older sister and I grew up undocumented in South Central Los Angeles, a place I have a lot of love for.

But I also experienced a lot of danger and trauma there, which I know is a result of systemic racism that leaves neighborhoods like mine with fewer resources to go around. Once, I witnessed a drive-by shooting in the middle of the day and had to take cover, then watched the ambulance crew place a dead body in a black bag. I often saw helicopters circle my neighborhood after the sound of gunshots; sometimes, the helicopter shined a spotlight on my block.

Now, the violence and uncertainty I grew up with have followed me to the suburbs of Chicago because of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Immigrants and United States citizens are getting kidnapped and denied due process because of how we look. The systemic racism that made South Central unsafe has done the same to the suburbs. I am part of a larger movement that is trying to organize and fight back.

In my early 20s I moved from L.A. to live with my parents in Portage, Indiana, a suburb of Chicago. It was my first time interacting with white people in my own neighborhood. It was also a culture shock because Portage did not have public transportation; walking around, its neighborhoods felt isolated and lacking the signs of life I was used to. But Portage was calmer than Los Angeles, and I liked that I didn’t have to feel like I was constantly looking over my shoulder. Then, I moved to rural Iowa, where the stars were visible, and there were no people in the streets. Next, I landed in Durham, North Carolina, a little suburban college town where I got used to the sense of safety and quiet.

I currently reside in Naperville, Illinois, about 30 miles west of Chicago, which is home to large Indian and Middle Eastern populations whose cultures and cuisines flourish in the area. And I spend a lot of time in the nearby western suburbs of Elgin and Aurora, which both have large Latino populations and delicious food everywhere. They are where I go to reminisce about the good parts of my childhood, and also where I have met some of the best people in my work in politics.

But they are no longer places where I feel safe. Now, I live in fear of my house getting raided by military vehicles and helicopters. I worry about randomly getting picked up by masked ICE agents at my local Menards or Home Depot because of the color of my skin.

And I am far from alone here in the suburbs. My friend Julio, who is undocumented, moved to Wheaton, Illinois in 2007, when he was 8 years old. Julio sometimes felt like an other in Wheaton, he has explained to me, but he also found support and acceptance in many institutions—including Wheaton College, where he earned his degree—and from his teachers, church, and friends.

“Growing up in the suburbs was peaceful but did not feel safe,” Julio told me recently. “I felt that I had to be vigilant of my actions, the way I talk, where I was, why, and when. I always have to be on top of things here.”

Now, the administration’s violence feels as close as a few minutes away. He narrowly missed ICE at his workplace earlier this fall. Julio plans to move back to Mexico by next year, despite the fact that he is married to a U.S. citizen and has been trying to get his citizenship.

Now, I live in fear of my house getting raided by military vehicles and helicopters. I worry about randomly getting picked up by masked ICE agents at my local Menards or Home Depot because of the color of my skin.

Over 1 million Latinos live in the Chicago suburbs, and the Latino population of the suburbs has grown more quickly than that of the city over the past 15 years. But there are only a handful of organizations that focus on immigrant rights work here, unlike in the city, where communities have organized for years. Organizing in the suburbs poses challenges. Neighborhoods are far apart. Residents vary socioeconomically. For a long time, it wasn’t easy to get people to come together around a common goal.

That’s starting to change. In Elgin, where 55% of the population is Latino, people are taking the attacks personally and fighting back. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem led a raid there in September, and the town has seen U.S. citizens detained, a community college student taken on campus, and violent deportations. I have become involved with Elgin’s rapid response team, an alliance that includes immigration organizations, businesses, and churches.

The Elgin Area Rapid Response team focuses on making sure we hold ICE accountable and responding to the immediate needs of the community, including families of the kidnapped. But I think the alliance can do more than just meeting people’s needs in the moment. This effort can also encourage community members to be proactive and to push for local legislation and leadership that stands up against the Trump administration’s racist policies.

Benjamin is an Elgin community leader and the son of undocumented parents who arrived there in 1972; in 1979, his father was deported back to Guerrero, Mexico. “We need to start a movement,” Ben told me. “I think in the Chicago suburbs for a long time [organizing has] been [about] Chicago, but now it’s changing. It’s here. It’s happening here. West Chicago, Elgin, Waukegan, Aurora … This is ground zero.”

I work with the rapid response team in Elgin even though I am fearful. I know that sitting back and waiting for things to get better is not going to bring safety and peace for myself, Julio, and other immigrants. I want to help create a path to a system that does not profile people like us. A system that helps create a United States that works for everyone, not just wealthy Americans who thrive under white supremacy. This fight is about uplifting our community and ending systemic violence—from the cities to the suburbs and beyond.

They took classes at the local community college, and an art gallery displayed work from 13 prisoners this summer.

For more than two decades, the prison, known as the Work Ethic Camp, was Nebraska’s only state prison geared solely toward rehabilitation. The facility held nonviolent felony offenders who were nearing the end of their sentences and prepared them, with counseling, schooling and job training, to return to the outside world.

That changed this fall, after state officials announced that the Work Ethic Camp would be replaced with a 300-bed, high security Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center to support President Trump’s national crackdown on illegal immigration.

And so a place that had been devoted to second chances now had a very different mission, and a new name to go with it: “The Cornhusker Clink.”

In McCook, a conservative town of about 7,500 that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, some residents have objected. Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison. With its close ties to the community, it was a place that helped Nebraskans get back on their feet.

Other residents said they were in favor of the new ICE facility, viewing McCook as doing its part for the president’s agenda and potentially benefiting from 50 to 60 added jobs. But opponents said they were frustrated by Gov. Jim Pillen’s unilateral decision to change the facility and turn it into a place to detain immigrants. City officials are also worried about the potential strain on resources if hundreds of detainees are transported in and out through the town’s small airport, which has one full-time employee.

“Now when people think of McCook, this is all it is — it’s ICE detention,” said Nate Schneider, the city manager and a registered Republican who said he has voted for both parties over the years. “But for us, it’s a lot more than that. McCook is home. McCook is a place that I want my kids to think is a good place to live. We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.”

The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise. A single fence surrounded only the back buildings where inmates slept.

McCook officials said they were given no advance notice of the state’s decision to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp, nor have they been told that the city can expect any revenue from the ICE agreement with the state, which Mr. Pillen has said will bring in about $14 million annually, after expenses to run the facility.

Thirteen McCook residents and a former state legislator sued the governor, arguing that the facility was designated and funded by the Nebraska Legislature for the purposes of rehabilitating state inmates, and that Mr. Pillen did not have authority to change that. In October, a judge declined to grant the residents an injunction but also declined the governor’s request to dismiss the case, which is proceeding.

“I have no problem with prosecuting immigrants who commit crimes,” said Bruce McDowell, a retired telecommunications technician and a plaintiff in the suit. Mr. McDowell, a Democrat, said he viewed Governor Pillen’s decision to turn the facility over to federal authorities as a political calculation. “He’s trying to curry favor with Donald Trump, and that carries a lot more weight than a few of us down here,” he said.

Mr. Pillen’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the governor has previously said that the facility would benefit the state, calling it “good for Nebraska’s taxpayers” and a way to ensure that Nebraska is “doing all that we can to keep criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

In 1997, the Nebraska Legislature approved the Work Ethic Camp, so named to reflect the facility’s stated philosophy that “positive work ethics can be learned and transferred to other areas of an individual’s life.” Its purpose was to prepare low-level offenders to return to the community and to reduce a perpetual overcrowding problem in Nebraska prisons. The state’s prison system regularly ranks among the nation’s most overcrowded.

The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually. Its programming included vocational and educational courses, as well as classes to contend with substance abuse and domestic violence. McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.

Over 48 cent coffee at Arby’s, where a group of men gather most mornings, residents were divided over whether McCook should have had a say in the decision to convert the facility into an ICE detention center.

“Who are we to say, ‘No, you can’t bring them here, you’ve got to go somewhere else,’” asked Brad Gillen, who owns a carpet cleaning business in McCook and voted for President Trump. “If this is our part we have to do, that’s fine.”

But others took issue with Governor Pillen for choosing to partner with federal authorities without seeking input from the community most affected, McCook.

“He did it to us, not with us,” said Dale Dueland, a semiretired farmer and rancher, who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Mr. Pillen and describes himself as nonpartisan.

“If you’d come before this all happened, most people here would say that what happens in Washington is so far away, it doesn’t affect us,” Mr. Dueland added. “All of a sudden it’s like a wake-up call that what happens in those faraway places can directly affect us here.”

From Washington to McCook

In mid-March, Mr. Pillen and his staff members traveled to the White House to attend one of President Trump’s executive order signing ceremonies. The following week, David Lopez, Mr. Pillen’s chief of staff, exchanged emails with D.H.S. officials, thanking them for meeting with him. He also inquired about how Nebraska might assist in immigration enforcement.

It is not clear exactly how Mr. Pillen and the corrections department landed on offering up the Work Ethic Camp, one of nine state correctional facilities, in the months that followed. But in August, in a joint statement with D.H.S., the governor announced the plan. That was the first time most people in McCook learned that the camp would be repurposed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:13.724420

El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) is the largest prison in the Western Hemisphere with a capacity of 40,000 inmates.1 Construction of the massive 57-acre prison began in March 2022 as part of President Nayib Bukele’s anti-gang crackdown. The facility was built specifically to imprison “Maras,” gang members described as “the most dangerous terrorists who tormented the streets.”1 Under Bukele’s campaign, the government of El Salvador declared a “state of exception,” which permitted the mass arrests of suspected gang members without due process.2

However, in early 2025, CECOT expanded into something else entirely: a destination for hundreds of deported Venezuelans sent from the United States. The transformation happened quickly. Earlier this year, President Bukele offered the United States an unprecedented arrangement: allowing for the transfer of foreign and American prisoners to El Salvador’s mega-prison.2

Bukele’s rationale was primarily financial—the facility was half-empty and needed additional inmates and fees from other countries to sustain its operations.2 Over a single weekend in March 2025, the Trump administration deported approximately 300 Venezuelans with alleged connections to the Tren de Aragua (TdA) or Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gangs to CECOT.2 TdA, a Venezuelan criminal organization, is known for trafficking, extortion, and violent crime across Latin America, while MS-13 originated in Los Angeles and later expanded throughout Central America. The White House framed the deportations as necessary to “protect the safety and security of the American people,” pledging to use “every possible tool” at its disposal.3

The speed and scale of these deportations raised immediate questions about the legality of the process itself. In the Supreme Court case Noem v. Abrego Garcia, the court found that Kilmar Armando Ábrego García had been illegally deported to CECOT, in violation of a withholding order that explicitly forbade sending him to El Salvador due to fear of persecution or torture.4 Specifically, under the U.S. Constitution’s Convention Against Torture, it is prohibited for the government to deport individuals to countries where they face a “clear probability” of torture or inhumane treatment.4

García’s case also drew attention to the use of expedited removal, a process first implemented in 2004 to fast-track deportations of individuals apprehended within two weeks of entry and within 100 miles of the border.5 The policy was later expanded in 2017 to apply to anyone who had entered the country within two years, extending its geographic reach nationwide. Today, expedited removal can be applied throughout the United States, often regardless of time since entry. This allows for the rapid deportation of individuals without pending immigration cases, and sometimes even detaining them directly in court after previous removal orders have been dismissed. However, the policy still requires removal proceedings to consider a detainee’s credible fear of torture or persecution—a safeguard that is often overlooked, as in the case of Garcia.5

Further, the cases of Venezuelan nationals Edicson Quintero Chacón and José Manuel Ramos Bastidas outline the concerns surrounding these deportations. Both men were labeled as members of TdA after being detained during immigration raids in Texas, based solely on unverifiable information.6 For instance, Ramos told reporters that he was detained “simply because of my tattoos. I am not a criminal.”6 Subsequent investigations revealed that neither man had a criminal record or any confirmed ties to organized crime. Their experiences illustrate how flimsy evidence and rushed classification procedures resulted in wrongful imprisonment at CECOT.7

These “oversights,” as described by the White House in Noem v. Abrego Garcia, were not only illegal but also in clear violation of the right to due process and the Convention Against Torture.4 They demonstrate that there was no adequate mechanism to determine whether deportees were actually affiliated with gangs or if sending them to El Salvador would subject them to inhumane treatment.4 Reports from former detainees describe torture in the form of beatings, electric shocks, prolonged solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and medical care, all intended to extract confessions or maintain control over prisoners.8

The reported conditions at CECOT raise serious human rights concerns. Human Rights Watch documented cases of deportees being held incommunicado—denied contact with family members, lawyers, or consular officials for extended periods—and subjected to torture upon arrival.8,9 Their investigation found cells so overcrowded that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor or standing, sometimes in complete darkness, with only thirty minutes per day outside their cells. In one documented case, a young construction worker reported being beaten with batons for an hour upon arrival, then sent to a dark basement cell with 320 detainees, where guards and other prisoners continued to beat him daily, breaking a rib.8 Others described being forced to kneel naked for hours or submerged repeatedly in barrels of ice water until they nearly drowned.8

The organization also documented over 3,300 children, some as young as 12, detained at the facility, many of whom had no gang affiliations, with 66 documented cases of minors subjected to torture and ill-treatment.10 These accounts illustrate the severe overcrowding, torture, and deprivation that exist within the Salvadoran prison system.

These human rights violations demand immediate action and systemic reform. The U.S. deportation process must implement enforceable safeguards to ensure proper hearings and to prevent deportation to countries where individuals may face torture. With over 300 Venezuelans deported in a single weekend, more than 3,300 children detained, prisoners subjected to torture or ill-treatment, numerous cases like Kilmar Armando Ábrego García, in which federal court orders were ignored, and ongoing rapid deportation of individuals, the need for reform is urgent.7,10 Individuals who were wrongly deported must be returned and provided with legal recourse. Families unjustly separated must be reunited, including the immediate release of children falsely accused of gang affiliation. Human rights organizations must continue monitoring and reporting on these practices, and the international community must hold both governments accountable under international human rights law.

Homan contended that Minnesota, particularly Minneapolis, is rife with illegal immigrants and that lawful citizens “have nothing to fear” as ICE’s crackdown in the North Star State kicks into gear.

“There’s a large illegal Somali community there. There’s an illegal alien community there. If you’re a US citizen, you know, you have nothing to fear,” Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.

“…Because they’re [Minneapolis] a sanctuary city, we got to send more resources there to flood the zone. Because it takes a whole team to find somebody in the community.”

President Trump last week raged against the Somali community in Minnesota in response to revelations about a massive $1 billion aid fraud scandal, involving many Somali immigrants.

Minneapolis-St. Paul has the largest Somali population in the country. ICE announced last week that it apprehended over a dozen illegal immigrants during its operations there.

That crackdown came on the heels of Trump publicly raging against the Somali community in Minnesota after the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal that has roiled the state.

Fraudsters set up firms claiming to provide social services that they didn’t actually provide and instead pocketed taxpayer dollars, federal prosecutor said.

Dozens have been indicted, and the scandal has largely centered around the Somali immigrant population.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump seethed during a cabinet meeting last week. “Their country is no good for a reason. Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country.”

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller surmised that law enforcement has only “scratched the very top of the surface of how deep” the fraud scandal goes.

“We believe that the Somali fraud operation in Minnesota is the single greatest theft of taxpayer dollars, through welfare fraud, in American history,” Miller told Fox News’ “Hannity” last week.

“And we believe that what we are going to uncover is going to shock the American people.”

Homan waved off critics who downplayed the illegal immigrant population in Minnesota and stressed that the administration is prioritizing “public safety threats,” but will detain and deport all illegal immigrants that agents come across.

The hardline efforts to enforce immigration law have spurred harsh criticism from the left and even from some Republicans who have felt the approach is too aggressive.

CNN anchor Dana Bash played a clip of a US citizen who was nabbed by immigration officials before they discovered her driver’s license in her car.

“I can’t tell how you many times an illegal alien claimed to be a U.S. citizen. It happens all the time. But it’s getting back to what I just said, reasonable suspicion,” Homan explained.

“As soon as that questioning is over, if they’re a U.S. citizen, they will be released. It takes probable cause to arrest somebody and actually transport and take them into custody.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/comp-tom-homan-defends-ices-116928786.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:17.523121

It is the second such deportation flight after a rare agreement between Washington and Tehran, which do not have diplomatic relations, amid the Trump administration’s extreme push to expel undocumented immigrants.

There are serious concerns from human rights and advocacy organizations about the Iranians who fled to the US and may now be forced to return. The State Department’s latest human rights report, issued under the Trump administration, said there are “significant human rights issues” in Iran.

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran. The first deportation flight was in September.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Iranian Mission to the UN for comment.

ICE declined to confirm reporting by BBC Persian about the deportations, without denying the planned operation, citing “the safety of the flight and its passengers.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a047ee0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+132/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2F26%2Ffeed39d24597a855bb1a17ae8353%2Fcnn-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2ltywdll2luc3rhbmnlcy9jbwl1cwfqndkwmdaxm2i2bm1mbza2zxvn-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2fydgljbguvaw5zdgfuy2vzl2ntaxvwbglpzjawodaynna1ntv5dmg0anu.JPG,N,,2025-12-08 08:57:25.507837

“One of our clients said that she had gone to her oath ceremony because she hadn’t received the cancellation notice in time,” Project Citizenship executive director Gail Breslow told WGBH.

“There is no time frame—nobody knows how long this is going to be,” immigration lawyer Teresa Coles-Davila told The Times.","Immigrants who are one step away from American citizenship have suddenly found themselves in limbo after President Donald Trump ordered a fresh immigration crackdown.

All over the country, the Trump administration has been canceling naturalization ceremonies of people from certain countries in the wake of the murder of a National Guardsman in Washington, D.C., according to reports by WGBH and The New York Times.

Project Citizenship, a nonprofit that works with immigrants in Massachusetts and New England, said that this month alone, 21 clients have received notices about the cancellation of their oath ceremonies, the last step in the lengthy process of becoming a U.S. citizen.

“One of our clients said that she had gone to her oath ceremony because she hadn’t received the cancellation notice in time,” Project Citizenship executive director Gail Breslow told WGBH. “She showed up as scheduled, and when she arrived, officers were asking everyone what country they were from, and if they said a certain country, they were told to step out of line and that their oath ceremonies were canceled.”

“People are devastated and they’re frightened,” she added. “People were plucked out of line. They didn’t cancel the whole ceremony.”

Last month, Trump intensified scrutiny of people from 19 countries deemed to be “of concern” after 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal—an Afghan immigrant granted asylum in April under the current administration—was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guardsmen in D.C., which killed Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and injured Andrew Wolfe, 24.

The countries on that list include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow vowed in a statement after the D.C. shooting to “ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

“Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests,” he said. “American lives come first.”

An internal guidance at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services obtained by CBS News instructed staff to “stop final adjudication on all cases,” including “all form types and making any final decisions (approvals, denials) as well as completing any oath ceremonies.”

USCIS and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday. The Daily Beast has also reached out to the White House for comment.

The order halting naturalization ceremonies has stirred widespread confusion among immigrants and their lawyers, who are hard-pressed to provide answers.

“There is no time frame—nobody knows how long this is going to be,” immigration lawyer Teresa Coles-Davila told The Times. “Literally, no one knows what is happening.”

Rosanna, a student in Texas who was born in Libya and holds Canadian citizenship, told the outlet that she was looking forward to receiving an email setting the date for her oath ceremony but instead got a cancellation notice.

“It’s definitely disappointing. Having come from a third-world country, it’s just never-ending disappointment,” she said. “I definitely feel unwelcome here.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncf1vrP39DBc5GCyozlsLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/09774da3b4c52d385789f6203894b791,N,,2025-12-08 03:56:43.615352

The plane — carrying about 50 Iranian citizens, as well as deportees from Arab countries and Russia — departed from an airport in Mesa, Ariz. and will make stops in Egypt and Kuwait, said the two Iranian officials, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The U.S.-chartered deportation flight for Iranians was the second of its kind, after the first took off in September, after months of negotiations between Tehran and Washington.

Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic relations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and for decades the United States has provided refuge to Iranian dissidents, religious and ethnic minorities; members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community; and others fleeing persecution in their homeland.

But as part of the Trump administration’s pursuit of mass deportations, it reached a deal with Tehran to coordinate the return of Iranian citizens facing deportation — currently estimated at about 2,000 people — and send them on chartered planes to Tehran. In the past, the United States deported Iranians individually on commercial planes.

The identities of Sunday’s deportees and their individual circumstances — including whether they had voluntarily accepted deportation or had been forced onto the plane — were not immediately clear. One of the Iranian officials familiar with the list of Iranians on the flight said they had entered the United States through the southern border, lingered in detention facilities for months and had their asylum requests denied.

The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the flight. A U.S. official, who asked not to be named to discuss the issue, confirmed the flight had taken off on Sunday and described it as a routine deportation flight that included nationals from other countries, not just Iran.

One of the Iranian officials, who has worked closely with American officials on the transfer, said that Arab and Russian nationals would get off the plane when it landed in Cairo and that the Iranians would then travel on to Kuwait, where they would transfer to a chartered Kuwait Airways airplane for the final leg to Tehran.

Mojtaba Shasti Karimi, director of consular services for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, told local news media on Sunday that Iran was expecting to receive about 55 deportees from the United States in the coming days.

Mr. Shasti Karimi said that those in the group had expressed their willingness to return home to Iran because of “the racist and anti-immigration policies,” of the U.S. government and said Tehran had received reports of “inhumane” treatment of Iranians held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

As news reports of the possible flight began to circulate over the weekend, however, an Iranian-American U.S. lawmaker, Representative Yassamin Ansari, Democrat of Arizona, warned on social media that the flight could include “vulnerable individuals who could face persecution” if returned to Iran.

The Trump administration has said it plans to carry out the largest deportation in the country’s history, targeting undocumented immigrants and those who had illegally crossed the U.S. border. The administration has also said that it would severely reduce the number of asylum cases it grants and limit them to white migrants from South Africa or English-speaking Europeans.

Iranians are among the citizens of 19 countries targeted in President Trump’s travel ban. Their — and many others’ — legal pathways to immigration have also been restricted following new limits Mr. Trump announced after the shooting of two National Guards members last month in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, which killed one of the soldiers, is an immigrant from Afghanistan.

The first flight of Iranian deportees departed in September and landed in Tehran in early October, by way of Qatar, and at least eight out of 45 people on the flight said they had resisted deportation, begging to not be sent to Iran because they feared for their lives. Two deportees on the flight to Tehran recounted their ordeals in detail, saying they had been beaten by immigration officials in the United States and in Qatar and dragged onto the plane.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08int-iran-us-flzw/08int-iran-us-flzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 03:56:47.532892

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued one of its most sweeping restrictions on immigration to date, ordering a pause of all immigration applications from nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and 16 other so-called “high risk” countries.

The new directive to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — issued in the wake of the fatal shooting in Washington, D.C., of two National Guardsmen, allegedly by an Afghan man — affects everything from green card applications to citizenship ceremonies for individuals from the 19 countries. The policy also paused all pending asylum claims, regardless of the applicant’s country of origin.

In the statement, Salazar — one of only a few Cuban Americans in Congress — said the new policy amounted to “collective punishment” of “the innocent for the sins of the guilty.”

“Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process,” said Salazar, who has advocated for compassionate immigration policies as Trump pursues his mass-deportation agenda. “That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for. Background checks already exist to stop terrorists and they should.”

Salazar’s strongly worded statement — which also mentioned how thousands of immigrants in South Florida who applied legally and “waited their turn” would be affected — was more critical of the Trump administration than a joint statement released Wednesday by Miami’s two other Republican members of congress, U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Gimenez.

In their statement, the Cuban-American lawmakers blamed former President Joe Biden for the change in immigration policy, describing it as the aftermath of his administration’s “reckless abandonment of border security and its systematic failure to properly vet nearly 10 million people...”

“For four years, our urgent warnings ... about the consequences of the Biden Administration’s grotesquely irresponsible open-border policies and non-existent vetting were ignored,” the joint statement said. “Today, we are unfortunately dealing with the consequences.”

Diaz-Balart and Gimenez called Trump’s immigration efforts part of “protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting.”

Rising concern in Miami

The new DHS policy has created anxiety in South Florida, home to many immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean who are already coping with years-long backlogs for asylum interviews, green cards and naturalization ceremonies, immigration attorneys told the Herald.

Over a million people from Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti lost legal protections when Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole established under the Biden administration were ended earlier this year. Many have sought to remain in the U.S. by applying for asylum, or in the case of Cubans, adjusting their status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows them to become a permanent U.S. resident after being in the country for a year and one day.

South Floridians from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela expecting to become U.S. citizens this week learned instead that their naturalization ceremonies had been canceled after the announcement, according to multiple immigration attorneys.

With the recent announcement, all now find themselves once more in legal limbo.

The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.
In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.

The 176-page report from Humans for Rights Network, includes contributions from 17 refugee and human rights organisations operating in northern France and six in the UK.

It details the use of rubber bullets and teargas by French police, who have been given hundreds of millions of pounds by the UK to secure the UK border, along with testimonies from asylum seekers and professionals including doctors who treat those trying to reach UK.

The report was shared with the Home Office, which did not comment on the content, instead describing the number of small boat crossings as “shameful”.

It follows a report from the Mixed Migration Centre of the Danish Refugee Council, which has found that hardline migration policies are fuelling people smuggling.

Despite the money spent by the UK government to prevent crossings, they remain at a high level.

So far this year, more than 39,000 people have crossed the Channel in dinghies, which is an increase on last year’s total of about 37,000 but not as high as the 2022 record of 46,000.

The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.

“This investigation should seek to establish how UK funding contributed to the increase in violence including the rise in the power of smugglers in response to heightened security and lack of safe routes,” the report states.

It adds: “Reinforced securitisation does not operate as a deterrent but instead makes it increasingly dangerous for people to cross the border.”

According to the report in 2024, the organisation Human Rights Observers documented 28 violent police operations targeting transport networks used by asylum seekers in northern France resulting in at least 44 arrests.

The organisation observed more than 800 evictions of living sites affecting at least 16,365 people.

The French association Utopia 56 found that between March and September 2025, 680 people were affected by police violence in northern France at times when they were not attempting to cross the Channel. In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.

An increase in violence by the people smugglers, who routinely carry guns, is documented in the report, with at least four people shot dead in and around a camp in Dunkirk so far in 2025. One 16-year-old autistic boy had a gun held to his head by smugglers.

“By allowing smuggling networks to decide who is and isn’t allowed to cross, the UK and French governments have handed over the fundamental right of access to asylum to these organised criminal networks,” the report states.

The charity Médecins du Monde said that 88% of the medical treatment it provided was for conditions linked to people’s poor living conditions.

One doctor from a clinic in Calais which treats people waiting to cross the Channel said that fuel burns from dinghy engines were not uncommon, particularly to lower legs and feet, resulting in some people’s feet being “macerated” inside their shoes, particularly when they had to walk long distances after a failed crossing attempt.

Lily MacTaggart from Humans for Rights Network said: “The violence at the UK-France border is endemic, causing acute emotional distress and significant damage to people’s health.

“The UK and France are both responsible for funding this violence, implementing policies which abuse human rights and in some cases have caused death.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The number of small boat crossings is shameful and the British people deserve better.

“France remains a critical partner in securing our borders, and our joint work has already prevented over 21,000 crossing attempts so far this year. Thanks to our landmark deal, people crossing in small boats can now also be detained and removed.”

ICE tried to get Mr. Zheng on a China-bound plane again in October, but again he refused, documents show.","Hundreds of people gathered at a Queens playground on Sunday to protest the federal government’s forced separation of a 6-year-old migrant boy from his father after the two were arrested last month amid President Trump’s deportation crackdown.

The boy, Yuanxin Zheng, is among the youngest migrants to be stripped from a parent by federal immigration authorities in New York City since the crackdown began. He and his father, Fei Zheng, were detained at what they believed was a routine check-in on Nov. 26.

Yuanxin was enrolled at Public School 166 in Astoria at the time, and some of those who came out in the chilly sunshine to join the rally, at the playground on 35th Avenue, had a connection to the school.

Camille Hlavka, who helped organize the event, has a 6-year-old son who attends the school.

“Taking children from their families is not normal,” Ms. Hlavka told the crowd. “It is cruelty. It doesn’t matter if it’s one child, it doesn’t matter if it’s a child you know. This is a human being, and he is being traumatized.”

Addressing the demonstrators, Sam Rasiotis, whose 6-year-old son also attends P.S. 166, condemned the Trump administration’s actions as antithetical to the ideals of a country shaped by waves of immigrants.

“Many of us can trace back our roots several generations, and some of those generations were persecuted and mistreated when they came to this country, to the city,” Mr. Rasiotis, a union organizer, said. “But here we are again. I never thought my son’s generation would face such barbarism.”

Government records show that after Mr. Zheng failed to comply with an order to leave the country, he and his son were separated, in line with a Trump administration tactic meant to pressure undocumented immigrants to follow such orders.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency arrested at least 140 children in the New York City area since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January through mid-October, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. More than 2,600 were arrested nationwide in that time.

Mr. Zheng and Yuanxin were initially taken into custody in April after they entered the United States illegally via Mexico and were discovered by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Dulzura, Calif., according to federal documents. Mr. Zheng told federal agents that he had come to America because he was afraid of being tortured in his native China.

Immigration officials ruled that his fear was not credible, and an immigration judge affirmed the determination. Mr. Zheng does not have a criminal history, according to government records.

He and his son had been in and out of detention at least twice before being taken into custody last month at ICE’s New York City offices at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, according to government records and Mr. Zheng’s lawyer.

The lawyer, Mike Gao, said his client had refused to board an ICE flight to China in September because he feared government retribution there. ICE tried to get Mr. Zheng on a China-bound plane again in October, but again he refused, documents show.

Federal officials want to deport Mr. Zheng and his son together later this month, according to records that indicate the government plans to reunite them for a flight to China.

In a statement last week, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman emphasized that migrant parents had the option of leaving the country with their children and that Mr. Zheng had been “given a lawful order of removal as a family unit.”

As of last week, Mr. Zheng was at an adult detention center in Orange County, N.Y., and Yuanxin was being transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds unaccompanied immigrant children, according to federal documents.

“We understand that Yuanxin is safe, but he is being held somewhere where nobody who knows him or cares about him can see him or give him a hug and make him feel safe,” Devora Fein, a leader of the western Queens chapter of Indivisible, the anti-Trump group that organized the rally, told the crowd. “He is not the only one.”

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who is facing trial on a federal misdemeanor charge after a standoff with immigration agents at 26 Federal Plaza, discussed his own case and how it tied into Yuanxin’s.

“We’re not going to let ICE or Donald Trump or anyone else separate us or divide us from each other,” Mr. Lander, a Democrat, said.

Among those in the crowd was William McKernan, a 17-year-old high school student who lives in Astoria and attended P.S. 166.

“Kids shouldn’t be kidnapped,” he said. “I used to go to 166 and want to show up because I hate seeing this happen in my neighborhood, in my school and in my country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/07/multimedia/07met-child-rally-gkbp/07met-child-rally-gkbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:57:03.433045

Sen. Mark Kelly recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he has read the Justice Department’s classified legal rationale for destroying alleged drug boats and that it should be released.

Not only is the senator right, he has the power to counter the Trump administration’s pernicious secrecy and make the document public himself.

Kelly, like other members of Congress, has broad immunity to expose government lies, thanks to the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which protects him from arrest or inquiry for statements he makes on the floor of the Senate. (The same protection extends to congressional aides.)

He can, and should, follow the historic lead of Sen. Mike Gravel, who in 1971 read the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record.

Kelly should read the Trump administration’s legal justification for killing people without due process into the public record — without delay.

The document’s classified status shouldn’t stop him. In addition to Kelly having legislative immunity, records that are properly classified can still be declassified if their release is in the public interest.

The legal rationale for killing nearly a hundred people without due process meets that definition.

If Kelly truly believes the public deserves to know how the government is sanctioning these strikes, he should read the memo into the Congressional Record. We’re listening.

IRS says it will take 8 months to find an email

I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the IRS in July for a single email from Andrew De Mello, the agency’s acting general counsel, explaining his refusal to turn over taxpayer data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. De Mello, who noted “deficiencies” in ICE’s request to access more than 7 million people’s data in his denial, was fired shortly afterwards.

IRS recently emailed me, five months after I submitted my request, stating that it would need until March 24, 2026, to complete a search for a single email.

Luckily, the email reminded me that I had the right to sue over the delay.

The nearly one-year wait to find, much less review, a single document crystalizes two things:

The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.
“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.” Related","The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging five Wisconsin sheriffs’ practices of holding detainees in their jail for handoffs to ICE.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera. It names sheriff’s offices in Brown, Kenosha, Marathon, Sauk and Walworth counties as respondents.

All five sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers — nonbinding requests that a law enforcement agency assist ICE in taking custody of a person suspected of being in the country illegally by holding an inmate in a jail up to 48 hours past the person’s scheduled release. The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

The lawsuit argues that the detainers qualify as an arrest and that state statutes prohibit law enforcement agencies from making arrests based on ICE’s administrative warrants.

While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.

The sheriff’s offices have differing relationships with ICE. Brown and Sauk counties, for instance, also contract with ICE to hold immigrant detainees in their jails, meaning a person could remain in the same jail after entering ICE custody. Kenosha County has no such contract, but it does participate in a federal grant program that partially reimburses local law enforcement agencies for incarceration costs in exchange for data on undocumented inmates.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July of this year. Nearly 40% of those arrested were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case. Only one of those arrests took place in the Milwaukee County House of Corrections. ICE agents have arrested at least four people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse since April.

In its initial petition, Voces de la Frontera urged the Supreme Court to immediately take up the case as a statewide concern. The court’s order, published on Wednesday afternoon, allows the plaintiffs to skip the lower courts entirely.

Liberal justices have a 4-3 majority on the court. At least four unnamed justices voted to immediately accept the case. Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley, both conservatives, dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who often votes with conservatives, discussed the process in an opinion that did not specify his vote.

“When this court grants review in a case, we almost always let our grant order proceed without comment or dissent,” he wrote, later adding: “Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference.”

Voces de la Frontera has 30 days to file a brief in the case. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.

“We are reviewing the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order and evaluating our next steps in this litigation,” Milwaukee attorney Sam Hall, who is representing all five sheriffs, wrote in an email Wednesday evening. “We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.”

The Maine Human Rights Commission added a sixth district, Maine School Administrative District 52 in Turner, after its board voted 5-4 to adopt a policy mirroring an executive order signed earlier this year by President Donald Trump, the Portland Press Herald reported Friday. The policy asserts that Title IX requires schools to separate sports by ""biological sex.""

Superintendent Cari Medd warned that the district’s legal counsel might not defend the board’s decision, a concern also echoed in other districts facing litigation.

The commission is asking the court to block all six districts’ policies, require their repeal, and mandate new policies that comply with the Maine Human Rights Act.

In November, the commission filed a suit in Kennebec County Superior Court against five school districts — MSAD 70 in Hodgdon, RSU 24 in Sullivan, RSU 73 in Livermore Falls, the Baileyville School Department, and the Richmond School Department. The commission argued their newly adopted policies prevent transgender students from using restrooms or participating in sports teams aligned with their gender identity — a violation of the Maine Human Rights Act.

The complaint notes that Richmond approved a policy in October requiring students to use facilities and participate in sports based on ""biological sex."" Commission Executive Director Kit Thomson Crossman told NEWS CENTER Maine it was ""the first time in recent memory"" the agency initiated legal action without an underlying individual complaint, citing a rapid increase in districts adopting policies that conflict with state law.

LGBTQ+ advocates praised the legal action and said it sends a message that the state intends to protect transgender students.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) condemned the Trump administration as she alleged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers released an ""attack dog"" on one of her constituents.

Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home in Vancouver on Nov. 14, Murray said, before he was ""violently attacked and dragged away.""

The senator said Toledo-Martinez was attacked despite not resisting arrest or attempting to flee. His wife and two young children, ages two and three, witnessed the attack.

A good friend of Toledo-Martinez watched the situation unfold outside of their apartment complex.

""They sicced the dog on him; had him on the ground, hitting him,"" John Williams Sr. said.

KATU News reached out to the man's attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), awaiting response.

Sen. Murray criticized the broader deportation policies under former President Donald Trump, stating, ""Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.""

She continued, ""I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.""

Neighbors of Toledo-Martinez said his detainment has rocked the community.

""Me and my wife the other night, we were sitting on the couch, and we were shocked and awed, almost in tears just seeing, you know, a neighbor of ours being attacked, you know? Just lured outside against his own will,"" Pierce Stevens said.

Murray emphasized for Toledo-Martinez to be released from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, citing a lack of criminal convictions and urgent medical needs.

According to Toledo-Martinez's attorney, ICE agents lured him out of his home under false pretenses, leading to the attack. His attorney discussed the case with Don Lemon on his YouTube channel on Dec. 5.

""[ICE agents] lied to him, lured him outside, and then sicced a dog on him for no reason,"" Stevens said.

He went on to say, ""It's just not right; sickening, honestly. At the end of the day, these guys should be trained properly. You shouldn't have to lie or manipulate.""

'Or he's gonna get bit again'

A video taken by Toledo-Martinez's wife, shared via Sen. Murray, showed a man wearing a construction high-visibility vest while arresting Toledo-Martinez.

Another man wearing a badge around his neck is seen holding back a large dog. Someone is heard saying ""you need to back up...or he's gonna get bit again.""

The man in the vest is also heard saying, ""we are federal agents from Homeland Security,"" and that they will take Toledo-Martinez to be seen ""for medical attention"" at the ICE facility in Portland, after his wife asked if they will take him to a hospital.

Toledo-Martinez's attorney stated that the officers involved in his arrest did not wear body cameras.

After being mauled, Toledo-Martinez was denied medical care for hours, Murray and his attorney said, eventually receiving stitches and medication at a hospital. However, he reported difficulties in obtaining adequate medical care during his detention.

Toledo-Martinez, who is undocumented, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 and is married to a U.S. citizen with three U.S.-born children.

Williams Sr. told KATU News he's been driving Toledo-Martinez's family back and forth from Vancouver to the ICE facility in Tacoma, continuing to fight for his release.

""It's hard on the kids to watch them break down,"" Williams Sr. said. ""When I go see him there with the kids, I have to sit right outside to get out of there, because I can't stand to see his kids breaking down like that. They're strong.""

Sen. Murray urged for his release. ""Every one of us must speak out against these kinds of human rights abuses,"" she said.

""A lot of people don't know the full story of what's going on right now, and there's a lot of innocent people being taken advantage of and not given their rights,"" Stevens said.

""He don't really deserve to be there,"" Williams Sr. said. ""They have some people that may need to be there, but he's not one of them. I promise he's not one.""

This comes after another incident in Vancouver in which the family of a different man were seeking answers as his leg was allegedly ran over while being detained by ICE agents on Thursday.

“I watched many of my colleagues go from making fun of him, making fun of how he talks, making fun of me constantly for supporting him, to when he won the primary in 2024, they all started – excuse my language, Lesley – kissing his ass,” Greene, a Georgia Republican, said in a clip of an interview that is set to air on Sunday on CBS’s 60 Minutes program.

Referring to Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan, Greene told the 60 Minutes correspondent that those Republicans at that point “decided to put on a Maga hat for the first time”.

Greene was once a staunch Trump ally who has split with the president and is leaving Congress in January. Trump has called her a “traitor” and attacked her online, prompting what she says is a wave of threats against her.

In posts on Sunday on X, Greene said she has reported hundreds of threats to the US Capitol police. She added that first those threats came from those who opposed Trump on the US’s political left. But then, she said, threats were aimed at her and her son when she opposed Trump on his handling of files pertaining to the prosecution of the president’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.

Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died by suicide while jailed on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019, during Trump’s first presidency.

“All of the death threats came from the ‘left’ until I stood with the Epstein Survivors, woman who were raped as teenagers, abused, and trafficked by rich powerful men – and that’s when President Trump turned on me and called me a ‘traitor’ and then new death threats and harassments came from the ‘right’ or somewhere,” Greene wrote on X. “I sent these assassination threats on my son to President Trump in which he responded with harsh accusatory replies and zero sympathy.”

Wade’s case is emblematic of a rising number of non-US citizen military veterans swept up by ICE under Trump’s immigration policies.
The Trump administration rescinded the ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.
Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation.
A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.","The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the Trump administration says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.

“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”

Wade, a grandfather and US army veteran, was arrested for driving without a license in September and was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with carrying out Trump’s “mass deportation” program, local outlet KENS5 reported. He has been in ICE detention since.

Wade’s case is emblematic of a rising number of non-US citizen military veterans swept up by ICE under Trump’s immigration policies. The Biden administration had previously issued an ICE directive that helped protect non-citizen veterans and also issued an executive order that later created an initiative to help return deported veterans and their families.

The Trump administration rescinded the ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.

Non-citizens are eligible to join the US military. Wade, 65, came to the US from Jamaica at 15 years old, eventually joined the army and earned commendations for wartime service as well as good conduct, as KENS5 reported.

He later received multiple college degrees and worked multiple jobs throughout his time in the US. He was working at a cafe when he was detained by ICE, KENS5 reports.

Wade was being held inside the Stewart detention center, an immigration jail in Lumpkin, Georgia. The facility, one of the largest in the country, is run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

For years, Stewart has faced grave accusations of rights abuses, including allegations of medical neglect. There have also been a series of deaths at the facility.

One of the most recent deaths was a suicide in June. That was the third suicide at Stewart in recent years.

Wade’s six children told KENS5 they have not been able to visit their father as often as they would like.

“Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,” one of Wade’s daughters told the outlet. “He doesn’t deserve this, what he’s experiencing right now.”

Wade’s family has been seeking assistance with their legal fight against his deportation on the GoFundMe platform.

“We are looking to minimize financial catastrophe during his absence,” the family’s GoFundMe says.

Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation. In September, multiple House representatives launched a congressional investigation into the detention and deportation of non-citizen veterans.

Those members of Congress wrote a letter to top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, demanding more information on the number of veterans swept up by immigration agents.

A congressional letter from June estimated that 10,000 veterans or more have been deported. A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.

The Guardian recently revealed that a number of US veterans may be swept up further by immigration officials, as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to hand over to the Trump administration internal data of its non-citizen workforce.

This second edition, updated to reflect the darkening reality of a second Trump administration, is both historical document and moral reckoning—a book that doesn’t just inform but demands we reconsider what American values actually mean in practice.

What distinguishes Towle’s work is her deliberate centering of women as the moral backbone of border resistance. The Angry Tías & Abuelas of the Rio Grande Valley emerge as the book’s beating heart—aunties and grandmothers who transformed familial care into radical political action.

Susan Law, Cindy Candia, Elizabeth “Lizee” Cavazos, Madeleine Sandefur, Joyce the archivist—these women become Towle’s guides through the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in their communities. They are not passive observers but active agents of welcome, their work simultaneously ordinary and heroic.

Towle’s genius lies in recognizing that these women’s stories have been systematically excluded from mainstream immigration discourse. While politicians thunder about “border security” and cable news fixates on chaos narratives, the Tías quietly do the unglamorous work: crossing into Matamoros to serve asylum seekers living in tents, documenting abuses inside detention centers, tracking down children stolen from their mothers.

They operate within what Towle calls the “100-mile law enforcement zone”—a constitutional gray area encircling the entire United States where rights supposedly guaranteed to all simply evaporate.

The author introduces us to Jodi, an attorney who witnesses seven mothers testify about children torn from their arms, then discovers 280 more women detained at Port Isabel, all separated from their children.

We meet Jennifer Harbury, who connects contemporary border violence to decades of US intervention in Central America. Through Towle’s empathetic reporting, these women’s labor—intellectual, emotional, physical—becomes visible in ways policy debates never allow.

Towle herself, a white woman educator and writer, navigates her own privilege thoughtfully. She positions herself as witness and amplifier rather than savior, acknowledging the ease with which her blue passport allows border crossings while asylum seekers face detention, deportation, and death. Her journey from Brownsville to Tijuana becomes a geography lesson in American hypocrisy, mapping the “Border Industrial Complex” that profits from human suffering.

The book doesn’t shy from institutional critique. Towle meticulously documents how “prevention through deterrence”—a forty-year-old strategy that has never stopped migration but has killed thousands—remains the bedrock of US policy. She traces the detention-to-deportation pipeline from Reagan-era Haitian asylum denials through Obama-era detention expansion to Trump’s family separation spectacle. Yet amid this systemic cruelty, the women activists refuse despair. They create what Towle calls “a handbook for a more humane world.”

Crossing the Line is also a devastating exposé of gendered violence. Mothers who fled rape and persecution only to have their children seized by US officials. Women detained in brutal conditions, denied due process, then deported back to danger. Towle gives particular attention to Cameroonian asylum seekers—teachers, lawyers, entrepreneurs fleeing civil war—who endured seventeen-month average detentions before ICE deported them in defiance of international law. Their testimonies, recorded in the scorching summer of 2022, chronicle abuses so routine that investigators struggle to keep pace.

The prose is urgent without being preachy, informed without being academic. Towle writes with a journalist’s precision and a humanist’s heart, rendering complex immigration policy comprehensible while never losing sight of individual human cost. Her metaphor of walls as a “second equator” cleaving rich from poor, white from Brown, safety from violence, crystallizes how border enforcement has become global apartheid.

If the book has a weakness, it’s that Towle’s earnestness occasionally overwhelms her narrative—the reader wants to spend more time with the Tías themselves, to hear their voices unmediated. But this minor critique hardly diminishes the work’s power.

Crossing the Line stands as essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how ordinary people maintain moral clarity when their government abandons it. Sarah Towle has created more than reportage; she’s built a monument to the often thankless, frequently invisible work of women who refuse to let cruelty be normalized. In documenting their resistance, she offers us a choice: Will we fly the tattered flag of American ideals alongside them, or let it fall entirely?","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qvK!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e0b884-d8c2-4aeb-8f58-30dbc4987345_1600x1200.webp",N,,2025-12-07 15:57:24.042554

Conclusion Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence.","1. Introduction

The Second Circuit’s summary order in Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi, No. 24‑1441 (2d Cir. Dec. 5, 2025), though expressly non‑precedential, offers an important illustration of two recurring themes in immigration litigation:

The decisive consequences of abandoning dispositive issues on appeal, particularly in asylum and CAT cases; and

The court’s growing willingness to call out, and potentially discipline, immigration counsel for misstatements of the record and governing law.

The case involves an Ecuadorian mother and her minor daughter seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Their claims rested on alleged past abuse by a former co‑worker and, secondarily, on their status as indigenous persons from Ecuador. An Immigration Judge (IJ) rejected their claims on credibility and “pattern or practice” grounds; the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, finding that key issues had been waived. At the Second Circuit, petitioners again failed to challenge these dispositive findings and presented a brief that, in the panel’s view, mischaracterized both the record and the CAT standard.

The court denied the petition for review, found the abandoned issues dispositive of all forms of relief, and, notably, referred counsel to the court’s Grievance Panel. While the order does not create new binding precedent, it sharply reinforces existing doctrine on appellate abandonment and underscores the professional obligations of attorneys practicing before federal courts in immigration matters.

2. Factual and Procedural Background

2.1 Parties and Claims

Petitioners, Nusta Rocio Medina‑Sarango and her minor daughter, are natives and citizens of Ecuador. The record, as summarized by the panel, indicates that:

Their protection claims were grounded primarily in Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a former co‑worker in Ecuador.

They also relied on their indigenous identity but did not demonstrate individualized targeting based on that identity or a broader pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador.

They sought three forms of relief:

Asylum, based on a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground;

Withholding of removal, which imposes a higher standard of proof than asylum; and

Protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which requires a showing of likely torture with government involvement or acquiescence, but no nexus to a protected ground.

2.2 Proceedings Before the Immigration Judge

The IJ (Judge Reid) denied all relief by decision dated September 28, 2022. Two points of the IJ’s decision—critical to the Second Circuit’s ultimate ruling—stood out:

Adverse credibility finding. The IJ found that Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a co‑worker were not credible. Given that the daughter’s claims were derivative of the mother’s and rested on the same factual narrative, this credibility determination effectively undermined the factual predicate for all claims.

No proof of individual or group targeting as indigenous persons. Although the IJ accepted that petitioners are indigenous, he held that:

They did not credibly establish that they, personally, would be singled out for harm on that basis; and

The evidence failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador that would independently support a well‑founded fear claim.

The IJ also:

Found that petitioners did not meet the standard for asylum; and under well‑settled law, failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily meant they did not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

Denied CAT relief, both because the underlying factual narrative was not credible and because the legal standard for government involvement/acquiescence was not satisfied.

Contrary to petitioners’ later appellate assertions, the IJ did not find that they had abandoned any of their claims for failure to timely submit evidence. The IJ accepted all proffered evidence, including untimely submissions.

2.3 BIA Appeal

On April 29, 2024, the BIA:

Affirmed the IJ’s decision, adopting the IJ’s reasoning with respect to:

The adverse credibility determination;

The failure to establish individualized targeting or a pattern or practice of persecution based on indigenous identity; and

The denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.

Found waiver: The BIA specifically held that petitioners’ brief to the Board had waived review of:

The IJ’s adverse credibility finding; and

The IJ’s conclusion that this adverse credibility determination was dispositive of all requested relief.

Thus, by the time the case reached the Second Circuit, there were at least two layers of unchallenged or waived findings: the IJ’s adverse credibility judgment and the BIA’s determination that it had been waived on administrative appeal.

2.4 Petition for Review to the Second Circuit

Petitioners, represented by attorney Michael Borja, then sought review in the Second Circuit. Their brief, however:

Did not address or contest:

The adverse credibility determination;

The IJ’s “no pattern or practice” finding; or

The BIA’s ruling that challenges to the adverse credibility finding had been waived.

Mischaracterized the IJ’s decision, asserting—incorrectly—that the IJ denied withholding of removal because the petitioners allegedly abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing evidence.

Advanced an incorrect view of the CAT standard, arguing that petitioners did not need to show that the Ecuadorian government condoned or acquiesced in the harm by a private actor, notwithstanding the contrary language of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

The panel explicitly notes that these same misstatements of law and record had appeared in other briefs filed by the same counsel, a fact that becomes significant for the disciplinary referral.

3. Summary of the Court’s Order

The Second Circuit (Judges Newman, Sullivan, and Nathan) denied the petition for review. The key holdings can be summarized as follows:

Scope of review. The court reviewed the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA.” This means it considered the IJ’s reasoning together with the BIA’s additional findings, a standard practice in cases where the BIA adopts and supplements an IJ decision.

Standards re‑stated but not substantively applied. The panel recited the usual legal standards for:

Asylum and “well‑founded fear” (including past persecution and pattern or practice routes);

Withholding of removal and its higher “clear probability” burden; and

CAT relief and its distinct torture and state‑action requirements.

However, the court did not engage deeply with these standards in relation to the facts, because the petition was resolved on procedural grounds—abandonment of issues.

Abandonment of dispositive issues. The court found that petitioners had abandoned, on appeal, all dispositive grounds for denial:

They did not challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding.

They did not challenge the IJ’s rejection of their pattern or practice claim regarding indigenous people in Ecuador.

They did not challenge the BIA’s determination that the adverse credibility issue was waived.

Citing Debique v. Garland, the court held that claims not adequately raised in an appellant’s brief are deemed abandoned. Because the unchallenged findings were dispositive of asylum, withholding, and CAT, the abandonment was determinative.

Knock‑on effect for withholding and CAT. Relying on Lecaj v. Holder, the court reiterated that a failure to establish a well‑founded fear of persecution for asylum purposes necessarily precludes meeting the more demanding standards for withholding of removal and CAT. Accordingly, once asylum fell, the others followed.

Criticism of counsel and referral to Grievance Panel.

The court identified “defects in the briefing” by petitioners’ counsel:

Misstatement that the IJ denied withholding because petitioners allegedly abandoned asylum by late evidence submission—contradicted by the record.

Misdescription of the CAT standard, asserting that government condonation or acquiescence was not required, contrary to the regulation.

Failure to acknowledge the adverse credibility finding when arguing CAT relief.

The order explicitly notes that such misstatements have been made in “other briefs filed by Mr. Borja,” and directs that a copy of the order be forwarded to the court’s Grievance Panel.

The petition was therefore denied, all pending motions and applications were denied, and any stays of removal were vacated.

4. Detailed Analysis

4.1 Standards of Review and Substantive Legal Framework

4.1.1 Standard of Review

The court begins with standard appellate review principles in immigration cases:

Factual findings (including adverse credibility findings) are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B), factual findings “are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.” This is a highly deferential standard toward the agency.

Questions of law and the application of law to fact are reviewed de novo, see Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2018).

The panel reviews the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA,” per Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This means that if the BIA adopts the IJ’s reasoning but adds its own analysis, both are considered part of the agency’s decision under review.

4.1.2 Substantive Standards for Asylum and Withholding

The order rehearses familiar principles:

Asylum requires a showing that the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of “persecution or a well‑founded fear of future persecution” on account of a protected ground: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523, 528 (2d Cir. 2022).

A well‑founded fear has:

a subjective component (the applicant actually fears harm), and

an objective component (the fear is reasonable in light of the evidence).

See Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2021).

Past persecution triggers a presumption of a well‑founded fear of future persecution, shifting the burden to the government to rebut that presumption. Liang, 10 F.4th at 112.

Persecution must be inflicted either by the government or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 2015).

An applicant can meet the future‑persecution requirement either by:

Showing she will be singled out individually for persecution, or

Proving a pattern or practice of persecution against a group of persons similarly situated to her. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii); § 1208.16(b)(2); Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2013).

For withholding of removal, the applicant must show a “clear probability of persecution,” meaning it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted if removed. See Pinel‑Gomez, 52 F.4th at 528. Because this standard is more stringent than the well‑founded fear standard for asylum, an applicant who fails to qualify for asylum on the merits necessarily cannot qualify for statutory withholding. Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 2018).

4.1.3 CAT Protection

Protection under the Convention Against Torture is distinct from asylum and withholding in two main respects:

There is no requirement of a nexus to a protected ground (race, religion, etc.). See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 76.

The applicant must show it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed, and that the torture would be:

“by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.”

8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Thus, for CAT relief, the central issues are (1) whether the harm rises to the level of “torture” and (2) whether there is sufficient governmental involvement (or deliberate inaction) to meet the state‑action requirement.

4.2 Precedents Cited and Their Role

The panel’s order is heavily grounded in prior Second Circuit immigration and appellate practice decisions:

Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268 (2d Cir. 2005).

This case establishes the standard that the Court of Appeals will review the IJ’s decision as supplemented by the BIA’s reasoning when the BIA adopts but supplements the IJ’s analysis. In Medina‑Sarango, the court explicitly follows this structure, clarifying that both tiers of agency reasoning are in play.

Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67 (2d Cir. 2018).

This decision is cited for the bifurcated standard of review (substantial evidence for facts, de novo for law), and for the principle that CAT relief does not require a nexus to a protected ground, a point the panel reiterates.

Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523 (2d Cir. 2022).

Used to restate the statutory definition of a refugee and the “clear probability” standard for withholding.

Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106 (2d Cir. 2021).

Cited for the subjective–objective articulation of the well‑founded fear standard and the presumption triggered by past persecution.

Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540 (2d Cir. 2015).

Supports the requirement that persecution either be by government actors or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control, reinforcing that private disputes without such a failure of state protection generally do not suffice.

Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23 (2d Cir. 2018).

Confirms the hierarchy of burdens: failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily implies failure to meet the more demanding withholding standard. The panel in Medina‑Sarango uses this as part of the chain that disposes of withholding once asylum has fallen.

Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2013).

Invoked for the “pattern or practice” methodology and the related deference to agency factual findings about country conditions.

Debique v. Garland, 58 F.4th 676 (2d Cir. 2023).

This is the key authority on abandonment of arguments. It holds that:

“We consider abandoned any claims not adequately presented in the appellant’s brief, and an appellant’s failure to make legal or factual arguments constitutes abandonment.”

In Medina‑Sarango, the panel uses Debique to deem petitioners’ challenges to the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, and the BIA’s waiver determination abandoned.

Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010).

This case provides the doctrinal link for the “all or nothing” effect once asylum fails:

an applicant who fails to establish a well‑founded fear of harm rising to the level of persecution for asylum “necessarily” fails to meet the higher burdens for withholding of removal and CAT relief.

The Medina‑Sarango court cites this to explain why the abandonment of dispositive asylum issues is equally fatal to withholding and CAT.

None of these precedents are novel; rather, the order applies them in a straightforward manner. What is distinctive about this case is not the legal standard but the procedural route to affirmance and the court’s explicit disciplinary concerns.

4.3 The Court’s Legal Reasoning in Medina‑Sarango

4.3.1 Adverse Credibility and Pattern/Practice Findings as Dispositive

The IJ’s core determinations were:

Petitioners’ story of abuse by a former co‑worker was not credible.

They did not show either:

a likelihood of individualized harm on account of their indigenous identity, or

a pattern or practice of persecution of indigenous persons in Ecuador sufficient to substitute for individualized proof.

These determinations are critical because:

Without credible testimony, the factual foundation of all claims is gravely weakened. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), the applicant’s testimony can be sufficient but only if it is “credible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts.” Here, it was found not credible.

The alternative “pattern or practice” route, which can sometimes mitigate weak individualized evidence, was explicitly rejected by the IJ. Petitioners therefore lacked both prongs: no credible individualized persecution and no group‑level persecution.

The BIA accepted these findings and further found that the adverse credibility issue was waived because petitioners did not properly raise it in their appeal to the Board.

4.3.2 Abandonment Before the Second Circuit

The petitioners’ brief to the Second Circuit did not:

Challenge or even mention the IJ’s adverse credibility finding;

Address the IJ’s conclusion that there was no pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous persons in Ecuador; or

Challenge the BIA’s finding that petitioners had waived any challenge to the adverse credibility determination.

Under Debique v. Garland, these omissions are fatal. Courts of appeals treat issues that are not adequately briefed as abandoned. It is not enough to gesture generally toward a claim; the appellant must make substantive legal or factual arguments addressing the disputed rulings.

The panel thus concludes that:

“These issues have thus been abandoned. … And that abandonment is dispositive of all relief.”

In other words:

Because the adverse credibility finding and the “no pattern/practice” finding were both dispositive at the agency level, failing to challenge them on petition for review leaves nothing for the court to overturn.

Even if petitioners had correctly stated the legal standards for asylum or CAT, the unchallenged factual findings would still require denial.

4.3.3 Collateral Consequences for Withholding and CAT

Having found that asylum fails due to abandonment of vital issues, the court relies on Lecaj and Wei Sun to dispose of withholding and CAT:

Withholding of removal demands a higher standard (“more likely than not”) than asylum (“well‑founded fear”). If petitioners cannot meet the lighter standard, they cannot meet the heavier one.

CAT relief, though conceptually distinct, also requires a “more likely than not” finding of torture and is often decided under a comparable or higher factual threshold. Moreover, where the alleged persecution is disbelieved, courts generally reject CAT claims unless there is strong independent corroborative evidence—which petitioners here did not show, and which they did not argue around the adverse credibility finding.

The panel succinctly invokes Lecaj to state that a failure to show a well‑founded fear “necessarily” implies a failure to satisfy the higher burdens for withholding and CAT. Strictly speaking, CAT analysis is sometimes treated as analytically distinct; but in practice, where the underlying narrative is rejected and there is no serious independent showing of likely torture by or with government acquiescence, the result is the same.

4.4 Treatment of Counsel’s Briefing and Referral to the Grievance Panel

4.4.1 Misstatement of the Record

The panel devotes a separate paragraph to identifying defects in the petitioners’ brief authored by attorney Michael Borja. First, it calls out a misstatement of the record:

The brief claimed that the IJ denied withholding of removal because he found that petitioners had “abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing all evidence.”

The court corrects this, noting that:

The IJ “accepted all proffered evidence (including evidence that was untimely), and did not find that any of Petitioners’ claims were abandoned.”

The court cites to the Certified Administrative Record (CAR at 82–84) to confirm this.

Mischaracterizing what the IJ did—especially when the record clearly contradicts counsel’s assertions—implicates the duty of candor to the tribunal.

4.4.2 Misstatement of CAT Law

Second, the panel addresses misstatements concerning CAT:

The brief argued that petitioners met their burden for CAT by showing that the Ecuadorian government “exacerbated” their problems, without acknowledging that the IJ had found their account of past events not credible.

More importantly, the brief contended that petitioners were not required to show that the Ecuadorian government “condoned or acquiesced” to their harm by a private actor.

The court flatly rejects this assertion as contrary to the CAT regulation’s explicit language requiring that torture occur “by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Presenting such a statement—ignoring directly applicable regulatory text already quoted in countless CAT decisions—raises serious concerns about competence and candor.

4.4.3 Pattern of Misconduct and Referral

Perhaps most striking is the panel’s observation:

“We note that the same misstatements of the record and the law have been advanced in other briefs filed by Mr. Borja.”

This signal—that the court has seen this behavior repeatedly—justifies escalation. The order concludes with:

“A copy of this order will be forwarded to the Grievance Panel.”

In the Second Circuit, the Grievance Panel deals with potential attorney misconduct, encompassing:

Misrepresentations to the court;

Repeatedly deficient or frivolous filings; and

Violation of professional responsibility obligations.

While the order does not specify what sanctions or remedial measures might follow, the referral itself underscores that:

The court is tracking patterns of misrepresentation or incompetence among immigration practitioners.

Repeated, documented misstatements of law and record can trigger disciplinary proceedings, including possible censure, suspension from practice before the court, or other sanctions.

5. Clarifying Key Legal and Procedural Concepts

5.1 Adverse Credibility Determination

An adverse credibility determination occurs when an immigration judge finds that the applicant’s testimony cannot be relied upon, often due to:

Internal inconsistencies;

Inconsistencies with other evidence;

Plausibility concerns; or

Non‑responsive or evasive answers.

Because asylum and CAT cases frequently turn on the applicant’s testimony, an adverse credibility finding usually has profound effects:

It means the applicant’s story of persecution or torture is not accepted as fact.

To succeed, the applicant would then need strong independent corroborating evidence sufficient to carry the burden without relying on the discredited testimony—rare in practice.

On judicial review, such findings are highly deferentially reviewed under the “any reasonable adjudicator” standard. In Medina‑Sarango, the petitioners did not even attempt to challenge the adverse credibility finding at the Second Circuit stage, rendering it unassailable.

5.2 Pattern or Practice of Persecution

A pattern or practice claim allows an applicant to obtain asylum or withholding not because she is personally singled out, but because:

She belongs to a particular group (e.g., a specific ethnic, religious, or political group), and

There is systematic, pervasive persecution of that group in her home country.

To succeed, the applicant must generally provide:

Country‑conditions evidence (e.g., U.S. State Department reports, NGO reports, news articles);

Expert testimony where available; and

A showing that the harm rises to the level of persecution and is widespread or systemic.

In Medina‑Sarango, the IJ found that:

While petitioners are indigenous, the evidence did not show that indigenous persons in Ecuador face persecution rather than mere discrimination or hardship; and

Therefore, there was no “pattern or practice” of persecution sufficient to satisfy the regulation.

Petitioners’ failure to challenge this finding on appeal rendered the pattern/practice avenue closed.

5.3 Abandonment of Issues on Appeal

In appellate practice, abandonment (sometimes termed “waiver” or “forfeiture” in specific contexts) refers to the principle that:

Issues not adequately raised and argued in an appellant’s opening brief are treated as abandoned and will not be considered.

“Adequately raised” means providing at least a basic legal and factual argument, with citation to authority and the record—mere conclusory assertions or passing references are usually insufficient.

Debique v. Garland crystallizes this for immigration cases in the Second Circuit. In Medina‑Sarango, abandonment occurred at both:

The BIA level (failure to challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding, resulting in “waiver” before the Board); and

The Circuit level (failure to challenge the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, or the BIA’s waiver ruling).

Once issues have been abandoned in this way, the court generally will not rescue the appellant by raising them sua sponte.

5.4 Grievance Panel Referral

Most federal courts of appeals, including the Second Circuit, maintain a Grievance Panel or similar body to oversee attorney conduct. Referral to such a panel typically occurs when:

An attorney repeatedly files deficient briefs;

There are concerns about unprofessional conduct or incompetence; or

The attorney is suspected of violating duties of candor, honesty, or other ethical norms.

Consequences can range from:

Private admonitions;

Requirements to complete continuing legal education or mentoring;

Public reprimands; or

Suspension or disbarment from practice before the court.

In immigration practice, where vulnerable noncitizens often depend entirely on their attorneys to articulate complex claims, disciplinary oversight is especially significant.

6. Likely Impact and Practical Implications

6.1 No Formal Precedential Effect, but Strong Persuasive Signaling

The order is explicitly labeled a “Summary Order” with no precedential effect under Second Circuit Local Rule 32.1.1. It may be cited in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1, but it does not create binding circuit law. Nonetheless, it is:

A clear application of existing precedent (Debique, Lecaj, etc.) to a typical asylum/CAT scenario; and

A strong signal of the court’s intolerance for:

Inadequate briefing that omits dispositive issues; and

Systematic misstatements of law and record in immigration appeals.

6.2 Guidance for Immigration Practitioners

The order sends several practical messages to immigration counsel:

Always directly address adverse credibility findings.

If an IJ has found the client not credible, the BIA appeal and any petition for review must grapple with that finding: explain why it is erroneous under the substantial‑evidence standard, point to record inconsistencies in the IJ’s analysis, and marshal corroborating evidence. Ignoring it is effectively conceding the case.

Do not ignore “pattern or practice” and other alternative grounds.

When an IJ denies relief on multiple independent grounds (e.g., credibility and lack of pattern/practice), each ground generally must be challenged on appeal; failure to do so leaves that ground as an independent basis for denial.

Be scrupulously accurate about the record.

Claims that the IJ found abandonment or refused evidence must be firmly grounded in the transcript or written decision. The court will not tolerate misrepresentations that are contradicted by straightforward citations to the Certified Administrative Record.

Know and apply the correct CAT standard.

CAT requires government involvement—whether through direct perpetration, instigation, consent, or acquiescence. Arguing the opposite invites correction and undermines counsel’s credibility.

Understand that repeated errors can lead to discipline.

When the court notes that similar misstatements have been made “in other briefs filed by” the same attorney and refers the matter to a Grievance Panel, it signals that patterns of poor practice in immigration appeals are under active scrutiny.

6.3 Consequences for Noncitizens

From the perspective of noncitizen litigants:

The case illustrates how procedural missteps by counsel—especially failure to brief critical issues—can foreclose substantive review of their claims.

Even potentially meritorious arguments (for example, if the credibility finding were arguably flawed) cannot be resurrected if they are not properly raised at each administrative and judicial stage.

It highlights the importance of:

Retaining competent, specialized immigration appellate counsel; and

Understanding that appeal success often hinges as much on procedural rigor as on underlying facts.

7. Conclusion

Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence. Instead, it reinforces established doctrine in two crucial respects:

Abandonment of dispositive issues. Under Debique and related cases, petitioners who fail to challenge key adverse findings—here, credibility and lack of pattern/practice—effectively concede defeat. The court will not reach the merits of underlying claims when no argument is made addressing the actual reasons the agency denied relief.

Counsel’s duty of candor and competence. The court’s explicit identification of misstatements in the brief, combined with the referral of counsel to the Grievance Panel for similar recurring errors, sends a clear message: immigration counsel must accurately represent both the record and the governing law, and must present fully developed arguments on all dispositive points.

In a system where the stakes for noncitizens are extraordinarily high—potential detention, removal, and return to possible harm—the quality of advocacy can decisively shape outcomes. Medina‑Sarango stands as a cautionary illustration: even where substantive law and standards are well settled, failures in briefing and professional responsibility can, by themselves, terminate a case and trigger disciplinary scrutiny.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 16:57:30.418991

Video captured last month shows Wilmer Toledo-Martinez on the ground, a dog being held back by DHS agents.

Before the video started, his attorney said Toledo-Martinez was attacked by the dog.

Photos show the extent of his injuries — gashes on his arm and side.

The video was taken by his wife, a U.S. citizen and mother to their three young children.

Neighbor John Williams Sr. recalled the incident.

“His wife was screaming; the kids in the car were screaming,” Williams said. “I’m glad his 7-year-old daughter wasn’t here. The 2- and 3-year-olds were here. We were trying to ask, 'What’s going on?' and they are telling her to ‘Get back, get back, or we’re gonna sic the dog on you.’”

Toledo-Martinez himself is undocumented after being brought to the U.S. when he was 15.

According to his attorney, a federal agent lured Toledo-Martinez out of his home under false pretenses, posing as a construction worker who claimed to have hit Wilmer’s car and needed him to step outside to verify.

“He backed in his car because this is my garage, and the truck just pulled up right here and scraped the front right here.” Williams said.

Williams said Toledo-Martinez is loved in the community and a real asset.

“It’s just sad,” Williams said. “This young man works, he takes care of his family, he’s very great in the community. He tries to help any and everybody.”

He said he was in disbelief at what he was seeing.

“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life close up with no one, and it hurts. It really hurts, especially happening to a young man like that — a good, honest, young man.” Williams said.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington is calling for Toledo-Martinez’s immediate release from the Tacoma U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, writing:

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.
He also said there was a “weaponization” of the justice system in his case, adding that while he was indicted, he was not, in fact, convicted.
I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air.
The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.","President Donald Trump has scolded a Texas lawmaker's ""lack of LOYALTY"" for announcing he will seek election again as a Democrat only days after the president issued a “full and unconditional” pardon in his favor.

“Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be ‘running’ for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas…as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison—And probably still do,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday morning.

Trump added: “Oh well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

Why It Matters

The pardoning of Cuellar and his wife was Trump’s third act of clemency this week, after commuting the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was facing a seven-year prison sentence for fraud, and scrapping a 45-year-old sentence for former President of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.

But Cuellar’s pardon particularly played into Trump’s rhetoric of a “weaponized” justice system under Joe Biden's administration, with the president calling the Cuellars’ indictment a ""witch hunt”—the same term he had used for the cases against himself.

Trump was convicted by an unanimous jury in New York last year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election. But in January, a judge sentenced him to an “unconditional discharge”—which means that he won’t face any jail time, fines or probation for it. The conviction, however, stands.

What To Know

Cuellar and his wife Imelda were indicted last year in a federal bribery and conspiracy case for allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and an unnamed Mexican bank.

According to Trump, however, Cuellar—a moderate Democrat representing an area on the Texas-Mexico border—was unfairly targeted by then-president Biden for the congressman’s criticism of his administration’s immigration policies.

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.

“One of the clearest examples of this was when Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders, and the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe,'” he added.

Cuellar has always said he and his wife as innocent to the federal charges.

Trump said on Sunday that he has never met Cuellar or his wife in person, but decided to pardon the couple after receiving a “beautiful letter” from their daughters.

The letter, dated November 12, 2025, and posted on Truth Social on Sunday, shows that the Cuellars’ daughters did appeal to Trump to show “mercy and compassion to our parents,” they wrote, “either by dismissing this case or granting a full and unconditional pardon.”

In the document, Catherine Ann and Christina Alexandra Cuellar described their parents as “two of the kindest, most selfless people we know,” and said that their father’s “independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began”

The pair said that their father had “never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from the policies of the previous administration.”

In an appeal that would have resonated with the president, they talked of the Trump family's “own challenges” with the justice system, which they compared to theirs. They then speak of meeting Trump at a White House picnic—despite his later saying he has never spoken to them—and being told “personally” that he thought Cuellar was “a good man.”

In an interview with CNN, Cuellar said he thanked the president for the pardon and trusted his judgment on it. He also said there was a “weaponization” of the justice system in his case, adding that while he was indicted, he was not, in fact, convicted.

What People Are Saying

Henry Cuellar told reporters after the pardon, as reported by Politico: “It came as a surprise. I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air. Nothing has changed, and we’re going to be ready to win reelection again.”

President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday: “I signed the papers, and said to people in the Oval Office that I just did a very good, perhaps life saving, thing. God was very happy with me that day! THEN IT HAPPENED!!!…Such a lack of LOYALTY, something that Texas Voters, and Henry’s daughters, will not like. Oh’ well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

What Happens Next

Cuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and then as the Texas Secretary of State in 2001—always as a Democrat.

The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.

Lair,,,,,https://idahofreedom.org/sanctuary-schools-illegal-immigrations-toll-on-public-education/,"According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.
Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education.
Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded.
It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection.
It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”","In October 2025, a law enforcement operation at a horse track in Wilder, Idaho, turned into the state’s largest immigration raid, resulting in the arrest of 105 suspected adult illegal aliens. Subsequently, the day following the raid, nearly 20% of students in the Wilder School District were reported absent. This incident reveals how mass immigration is transforming Idaho’s rural communities and simultaneously raises another interesting question: why are the citizens of Idaho subsidizing the education of foreign nationals, let alone illegal aliens?

In 1982, the United States Supreme Court, in Plyler v. Doe, struck down a Texas statute that withheld state funds for the education of children who were not ""legally admitted"" into the United States and authorized local school districts to deny enrollment to illegal aliens. It also struck down an independent school district’s policy that charged illegal aliens an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student to compensate for lost state funding. The Court determined that the denial of a free public education to illegal aliens “is utterly incompatible with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”

The majority's opinion in Plyler holds that states lack any “compelling government interest” to deny enrollment to illegal aliens or charge them tuition for attending public school, but the numbers tell a different story. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.

Mind you, the Office of Performance Evaluations released a report in March 2025 estimating there is a $82.2 million funding gap in special education. All the while, Idaho’s school choice program is drastically underfunded and currently only covers a fraction of the existing private school population. If Idaho weren’t compelled to spend hundreds of millions on educating foreigners, we would have more resources to adequately fund educational programs for our children.

Beyond this financial burden, there is an even more compelling reason to oppose the Plyler decision on principle. Our nation’s tradition of self-government is predicated on the understanding of society as a social compact, whereby, in the words of John Adams, “the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.” This underlying philosophy is evidenced in the preamble of our own Idaho Constitution, which states that “We, the people of the State of Idaho, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare do establish this Constitution.” The functions of government are legitimate because we have consented to this mutual association to promote our joint happiness. Our system of public, free common schools was established only for the people of Idaho’s “common welfare” — the legitimate benefactors of the social compact and no one else.

In other words, access to a free education is a privilege of citizenship. By eviscerating the distinction between citizen and alien, Plyler v. Doe undermines the very foundation of our republican government. It is one thing to compel a man to pay for the education of his neighbor with whom, as countrymen, he shares a common destiny and on whose wisdom and virtue the security of his liberties depends; it is another to compel the people of Idaho to pay for the education of foreigners whom we have never consented to live among us. The former derives from our duties as citizens; the latter is nothing short of theft.

Our forefathers recognized that the people are only obligated to submit to controversial judicial decisions on matters that are “fully settled.” In response to the infamous Dred Scott decision, Abraham Lincoln laid out a framework for distinguishing settled from unsettled legal precedents. Among the criteria he lists are whether the decision was unanimous, without any apparent partisan bias, in accordance with legal public expectation, or repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as good precedent.

By this standard, Plyler is ripe for a legal challenge. The decision was narrowly decided on a 5-4 split of the justices. In his dissent, Chief Justice Burger took the majority to task for employing an “unabashedly result-oriented approach” based on its own “standards of desirable social policy.” Moreover, he observed that the majority's “unique confluence of theories and rationales” was so contrary to any known theory of “principled constitutional adjudication” that he expected it to establish “little beyond the results in these particular cases.” In short, the Chief Justice concluded that the Court’s decision was so egregiously political and contrary to legal public expectation that it did not warrant any meaningful consideration for future cases on questions pertaining to the proper application of equal protection.

Plyler represents a stark deviation from our nation’s legal tradition on the rights and privileges of immigrants. In 1923, the Supreme Court in Terrace v. Thompson upheld a Washington state law prohibiting aliens who were ineligible to become citizens from owning or leasing land, affirming that the Equal Protection Clause did not supercede a state’s “wide discretion in determining its own public policy and what measures are necessary for its own protection and properly to promote the safety, peace, and good order of its people.” Certainly, if a state may interfere in the private business contracts of resident aliens to lease farm land, it can require illegal aliens to reimburse the state for educating their unlawfully present children.

Plyler is also inconsistent with the rest of our immigration law. Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education. However, that same student would be entitled to a free education were he to enter the United States illegally. Even more ridiculous is that while it is unlawful to charge tuition to an illegal alien, Idaho would be entirely within its rights to charge tuition to an American citizen from Pullman, WA, for attending a public school in Moscow.

Beyond these considerations, the landscape of K-12 education has changed drastically in the four decades since Plyler was decided in 1982. Among the most significant developments is the growth of charter schools, which now account for nearly 8% of the nation’s K-12 student population. Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded. However, unlike traditional common schools, charters are only theoretically open to every student. Many charter schools use a lottery system to determine eligibility for a finite number of seats. Given that enrollment in these schools is zero-sum, it is justifiable that enrollment should be reserved for American citizens.

Moreover, many states have begun implementing universal school choice programs. It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection. Even if the Court is unwilling to reconsider its major holding, it should at least clarify how its precedent applies to these new sets of facts.

Recently, several states — including Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Texas — have sought to challenge the precedent of Plyler. Unfortunately, none of these efforts has yet survived the legislative process. This upcoming legislative session, however, Idaho has the opportunity to lead out in restoring the integrity of our social compact.

In 2025, Rep. Dale Hawkins and Rep. Steve Tanner introduced House Bill 382 (H382), which would have required school districts to collect and report the immigration status and nationality of every enrolled student in Idaho's public education system. A 2026 version of H382 deserves to be reintroduced and will be essential to gaining a full and accurate picture of the burden illegal immigration imposes on our public institutions. The Legislature should also consider taking bolder action and directly challenging the main holding of Plyler.

Idaho not only has an interest but an obligation to press this issue. Just as the federal government is endowed with the authority to defend the rights of American citizens against abusive state power, so too do the states have the right to defend their reserved sovereign authority against an unjust encroachment by the federal government. As expressed by James Madison, the architect of our Constitution, whenever the federal government engages in a “deliberate, palpable and dangerous” exercise of powers beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states “have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.”

For too long, the people of Idaho have been burdened without their consent with the expense of supporting an alien population by order of judicial fiat. It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”",https://idahofreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Article-Headers-2025-12-06T163229.040.png,N,,2025-12-07 14:56:34.601082

The data, which includes ICE arrests from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, shows that nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records have been swept up in immigration operations that the president and his top officials have said would target murderers, rapists and gang members.

“It contradicts what the administration has been saying about people who are convicted criminals and that they are going after the worst of the worst,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The figures provide the most revealing look to date into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They were shared by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project, which obtained them through a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The data is compiled by an internal ICE office that handles arrest, detention and deportation data. The administration stopped regularly posting detailed information on ICE arrests in January.

For arrestees with criminal histories, the data doesn’t distinguish between those with a history of minor offenses and those who have committed more serious crimes, like rape and murder, whom the administration has said it is targeting.

And the figures do not include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has launched aggressive immigration operations in several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina. Border Patrol sweeps are currently underway in New Orleans.

Border Patrol and ICE are both under the Department of Homeland Security but they are two different agencies with two different missions. Border Patrol agents typically operate along the southern and northern borders, but recently hundreds have been sent into the interior of the United States to track down undocumented immigrants.

“That is the black box that we know nothing about,” Ruiz Soto said. “How many arrests is Border Patrol doing? How many of those are leading to removals and under what conditions?”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE field offices have been under intense pressure to ramp up arrests.

In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin arresting at least 3,000 migrants per day, NBC News previously reported.

But the new data shows that ICE is still falling well short of those targets.

ICE agents have made an average daily total of 824 arrests since Jan. 20, according to the data. Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

The data also reveals that about 90% of the people ICE arrested through mid-October were male. Mexican nationals accounted for the largest share of the overall arrests, with about 85,000, followed by nationals of Guatemala at 31,000 and Honduras at 24,000.

More than 60% of those who were arrested were between the ages of 25 and 45.

“Now we’re really feeling that pain in the workforce,” said George Carrillo, chief executive officer of the Hispanic Construction Council.

Carrillo praised the Trump administration for its efforts to secure the border but said the ongoing enforcement operations are having a significant impact on companies that employ migrant workers.

“Now even the most conservative Republicans are feeling it and understanding that, hey, something different has to be done because now it is affecting their businesses,” he said. “And they’re worried about this strategy.”

It’s not clear from the data how many of those who were arrested were deported, but 22,959 are listed under the category of “voluntary departure,” meaning they left the United States of their own accord.
