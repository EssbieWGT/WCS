Condemnation of the lack of transparency in this case was forthcoming from the usual quarters.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, in a letter to the acting director of ICE, demanded a “full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between these agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement.”

Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the arrest. Separately, Mayor Mark Dion, once a sheriff, expressed his concerns (“Why are federal agents able to escape that basic responsibility that democratic policing expects?”).

The chair of the school board, Sarah Lentz, said in a statement that the board’s role was “to provide free, appropriate education to every student, regardless of the identities that they hold, and this interrupted that and created substantial harm within our community. And it is not welcome.”

This is all well and good. It’s also not nearly enough.

If Maine wishes to send a clear message, to move the needle at all, it needs to assume a united front against the cavalier maneuvers of ICE. Since Donald Trump took office, immigration arrests have more than doubled in Maine and 37 other states.

So far, the collective response has been incoherent.

Consider that the aggrieved city council that issued a formal statement raising concerns about dignity, public trust and community safety is the same city council that, just weeks prior, signed a federal grant agreement for upgrades at Portland International Jetport that mandates cooperation with ICE. Assessing the contract and the national legal picture, lawyers for the city said they don’t expect Portland will be required to work with the agency.

The obvious difficulty with this expectation is that, given the secrecy that shrouds the work of an emboldened and lavishly financed ICE, we may never be able to establish exactly where cooperation with its crackdown begins and ends. Dion had to take extra steps to reassure concerned residents because the decision to sign the contract was made in executive session, behind closed doors.

At a naturalization ceremony in Portland last Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills declined to comment on the public school detention. The tension of this time, however, cannot be lost on her. A reporter noted the governor appeared to be fighting back tears as she observed: “It always a very emotional and inspiring ceremony.”

Mills is well able to swim against the tide and the governor should be doing so, wherever possible, on the subject of ICE and its practices. Pushing for the governor to sign into law LD 1971 (a bill passed by the House and the Senate in June), the terms of which Mills ultimately found too broad, an August letter writer expressed his impatience.

“This is a strategy that aims to inspire fear in immigrants and in the American population at large. It’s putting boots on the ground in every state, in an unprecedented show of force that belies the stated purpose of getting immigration under control,” read the letter. “Where is the governor’s ‘I’ll see you in court’ resolve that Mainers need and deserve in these fraught times?”

Writing in May on the subject of local police departments’ contracts with ICE — popular nationally but, so far, unpopular here in Maine — this editorial board commended the towns of Wells, Winthrop and Monmouth for withdrawing or pausing their departments’ undertakings to accept work that ICE delegates.

“The upside for ICE, here, is crystal clear,” we wrote. “The potential benefit to our local authorities is murky, at best, and best avoided as a result.”

We see now that there may be “upsides” in the absence of a clear and firm approach to ICE that insists on transparency and other run-of-the-mill terms and conditions.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.
“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said.
“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said.
“We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem.","TORONTO — Canadians in several major cities demonstrated Saturday against elements of the Liberal government’s agenda, including Prime Minister Mark Carney’s support for new fossil fuel projects and expected public service cuts.

Hundreds who took part in “Draw the Line” protests in Toronto marched from downtown to the provincial legislature building, carrying signs that included messages advocating full immigration status for all, ending trade with Israel, Indigenous rights and a revolution against billionaires.

Some signs featured images of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan in December.

Speakers prior to the march included environmentalist David Suzuki, Grassy Narrows First Nation member Chrissy Isaacs, and others.

Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, accused Carney’s government of “enriching billionaires” while Canada is on “the brink of a climate collapse.”

“We are here to say that whether it is climate, or economic justice, whether it’s Palestine or right here at home, we are facing a joint agenda and we will push back against it,” Hussan told the crowd.

Speaking to reporters, Suzuki criticized Carney’s focus on creating jobs over addressing the climate crisis.

“He’s putting the economy above the atmosphere that gives us air to breathe, that gives us weather, climate, and the seasons. That’s crazy,” Suzuki said.

“Indigenous people tell us all the time the Earth is our mother. She gives birth to us. She nurtures us. She has got to be our highest priority,” Suzuki said, adding that climate change should be a larger priority than creating jobs.

The protests, which occurred ahead of the federal government tabling its budget on Nov. 4, also included marches in Ottawa, Edmonton and Montreal.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but Carney has repealed the consumer carbon price and paused the Liberals’ electric vehicle mandate.

Currently, Canada’s emissions are about only 8.5 per cent below what they were in 2005, and Carney and his ministers have refused in recent weeks to say whether Canada is still committed to its 2030 and 2035 targets, though the government says it is still focused on hitting net-zero by 2050.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.

George Westel, who was at the Toronto protest and represented a group called Stop 413 East End Toronto, said everyone in Ontario is at risk of being hurt by the climate crisis.

“Climate change is affecting migrant workers, it’s affecting Indigenous people,” he said after the group reached Queen’s Park. “This province is called a place to grow, and we are losing that place to growth.”

Hundreds of activists gathered on Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill in Ottawa to create a giant mural with washable paint. The 65 metre-long mural read “People peace planet not profit” and featured symbols of a moose, fish, a person holding a feather, butterflies and watermelon, representing the issues the activists stand for.

“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said. “We are refusing to let the government continue down a path of climate destruction, militarism, and scapegoating of migrants. The people demand peace, justice, and a livable future.”

Meanwhile other activists took part in a march from the Hill to the U.S. Embassy and ending at the Human Rights Monument on Elgin Street.

Ottawa Police said two people were arrested for mischief and had Wellington Road closed for the majority of the afternoon for the clean up of paint.

“Despite clashes with police and two activists being detained, spirits remained high, and a human barrier formed to allow the painting to continue,” organizers said in a statement.

The road reopened shortly after 5 p.m.

In Vancouver, hundreds of protesters listened to speeches outside a downtown library before marching several blocks.

Mark Hancock, national president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told the crowd that many people feel a sense of urgency on issues including skyrocketing housing and food costs.

“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said. “We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem. They’re not taking away our housing. They’re not jacking up the cost of living in this country. They’re just trying to make it like you and I and everybody else in this country.”

Carney said earlier this month that the government plans to return immigration rates to “sustainable levels,” which includes reducing the number of non-permanent residents to less than five per cent of the total population.

He said that adjusting the temporary foreign worker program to target specific sectors and needs in specific regions, as well as improving immigration policies, was tied to easing the strain on housing, public infrastructure and social services.

Many protesters in B.C. objected to the federal government fast-tracking liquefied natural gas expansion projects in B.C., which Vancouver resident Robert Hornsey said would result in the depletion of groundwater.

“The LNG is a boondoggle. What you need to do is invest in renewable energy, wind, air, solar, tidal and thermal,” Hornsey said. “B.C. has a massive geothermal reservoir that it has not used or exploited.”

Another event attendee, Ann Grant, was holding her handmade big pink balloon printed with Carney’s face that read “killing the planet.”

In some cases, refugees are being deported to countries where they’ve never lived, they say.

It’s not immediately clear how many members from Fresno’s Southeast Asian community have been detained at ICE check-ins and deported since President Donald Trump launched what he says will be the largest deportation campaign in history. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to request for comment on this story.

Many of these individuals are refugees with minor criminal records from years ago that could subject them to deportation, advocates say. But they weren’t deported earlier because, as refugees, the countries they were born in don’t recognize their citizenship. Some were born in refugee camps and are considered stateless. Or, the U.S. didn’t have an agreement in place to deport them to their home countries. In lieu of deportation, they were required to have regular check-ins with ICE.

While these check-ins were a longstanding practice, now, some are of these people are being detained and forced to return to countries they and their families were forced to flee due to political persecution, war and genocide.

Fresno has a large Southeast Asian community, from countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It’s also home to the second largest concentrations of Hmong people nationwide, many descendants of U.S. allies during the Vietnam War.

“A lot of them are refugees or children of these veterans (and) have committed a senseless crime when they were teenagers,” said Pao Yang, president and CEO of The Fresno Center. “And then now you’re sending these children of these veterans that fought with the U.S. back to a country that they were fighting against with you.”

During the first Trump administration, the government tried to put pressure on Southeast Asian countries to receive people with deportation orders to those countries. Those efforts have ramped up this year during Trump’s second term, said Tilman Jacobs, an immigrants rights supervising attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, the nation’s oldest Asian American civil rights advocacy group.

“These communities are being impacted in a way that we haven’t seen before,” Jacobs said. Individuals have been deported from ICE check-ins in Fresno, he said, though he didn’t have an estimate on how many had been detained.

Yang, the Fresno Center CEO, said he also knows of “many” Fresno clients that have been detained and transferred to the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in McFarland, where they are held as they await next steps in their immigration cases.

As of late August, Christine Barker, executive director of the refugee-serving nonprofit, Fresno Immigrant and Refugee Ministries, knew of at least five individuals of Laotian or Cambodian descent being detained at their ICE check-ins in Fresno.

“I also know from some of their family members, when they got to [the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in] McFarland, they were like, ‘there’s a lot of Asian people here,” she said.

While California’s Southeast Asian communities have experienced more sporadic immigration enforcement, other states such as Michigan and Minnesota have seen more high-profile enforcement activity. More than 150 Southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to an Aug. 18 report in the Minnesota Reformer.

Jacobs said the practice of detaining people at ICE check-ins was more common during the first five or six months of the administration, but he hasn’t seen as much of it recently in California.

“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to continue happening,” he said. “It’s definitely a real risk. But I also don’t want to overstate it.”

Hmong people are an ethnic group originating from China and that have their own language and culture. Because of decades of persecution by the Chinese government over their cultural and spiritual practices, the Hmong have constantly migrated to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. In the early 1960s, the CIA recruited Hmong people to help fight against North Vietnam and the communist party in Laos, known as the Pathet Lao. The operation, also known as The Secret War, lasted from 1962 to 1975. When the Pathet Lao took over Laos’s governance, thousands of Hmong and Laotian people sought refuge in the United States in 1975.

Barker said what’s happening to these refugees is a violation of human rights.

“When you’re a refugee, the world is supposed to protect you from ever having to return to the country you fled,” she said. “These are uncles, these are grandpas, these are old, old convictions from the 80s and the 90s.”

Deported to Laos, Cambodia

Families, lawyers and nonprofits are scrambling to support individuals that have been deported to countries such as Laos and Cambodia.

Thao Ha, runs Collective Freedom, an organization that supports “justice-impacted” individuals from Southeast Asian communities. In recent months, her organization has had to pivot to provide support on the ground in Laos and is helping families track down their deported loved ones.

“We didn’t think they were going to go this hard, this fast, or at all,” she said. The community had assumptions that people couldn’t get deported to Laos, or that only a few here and there would be deported, Ha said.

Laos doesn’t have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S., according to the Asian Law Caucus. But the Trump administration has pressured Laos to accept deportees — including people who were not born in the country and whose parents fled the country — by threatening to withhold business and tourist visas to Lao citizens.

When people are deported to Laos, they are detained upon entry in Laos for multiple weeks, advocates say. Those with a local sponsor are released more quickly. Those who don’t have a sponsor will be detained longer until the government can process them.

Ha said there’s no official repatriation process in Laos, meaning there’s little infrastructure to help people with housing, work, or cultural adjustment.

“There’s not an agency, so to speak,” Ha said. “We’re just trying to rapid response and mutual aid at this point.” Several groups have “popped up” to try to fill the gaps, but none are formal non-governmental organizations.

The “number one challenge” for people with their loved ones being deported to Laos is that they don’t have family there, Ha said. “If they don’t have family and don’t have a sponsor, where do they go? What do they do? Are they just roaming the streets?”

For some deported to Laos, especially those born in refugee camps, they have no relationship to the country, language skills or community knowledge. “For Hmong folks who grew up in the U.S., they may never learn Lao,” Barker said.

Barker also said there used to be programs to help people from the Khmer Indigenous ethnic group acculturate in Cambodia.

“Those programs disappeared when USAID was gutted,” she said.

Fleeing war, genocide, persecution

Jacobs of the Asian Law Caucus said his organization works with Southeast Asian refugees who are facing pending deportation, oftentimes from very old convictions.

“Many of the people that we work with have consistently followed all of those terms with their release and continue to do so,” Jacobs said. “And I know that there is a lot of anxiety right now around these check-ins.”

Many of the organization’s clients were fleeing civil war, genocide and persecution and carry memories of trauma associated with the unfamiliar country, he said.

“In many cases, there are countries that don’t really want to receive people who left so long ago, and what a lot of them are facing in real terms, is statelessness where they’re not recognized as citizens of those countries,” he said.

For example, he said, Hmong people in Laos are given some kind of residency status, but they are not citizens. And this sense of not belonging can have lingering legal, emotional and psychological impact.

Yang said many in the Southeast Asian immigrant community are quiet and scared because many come from a country where the government targets people. Earlier this year, there was a rush of people seeking legal services, but now, especially after the start of the June immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, he’s noticed a “huge drop” in people seeking assistance.

“We have a lot of folks, even legal resident aliens, that are in hiding, that are afraid,” he said.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/b5fn6g/picture312166297/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_IMG_JRW_HMONG_NEW_YE_2_1_MQCJB0FL_L347915631,N,,2025-09-21 15:56:53.537061

""Masked secret police are not making anyone safer; instead they're creating an environment of lawlessness and fear that puts federal agents, local law enforcement, and civilians in danger.""","SACRAMENTO - California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed five bills Saturday attempting to thwart President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda, including a ban on local and federal officers wearing masks to conceal their identities.

The bills mark the latest chapter in what's become a tense fight over immigration enforcement in California, a state home to more than 10 million immigrants as well as industries and communities that depend on them.

""Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said Saturday afternoon at a Los Angeles signing ceremony in which he condemned secrecy by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ""ICE unmasked. What are you afraid of? You're going to go out and do an enforcement? Provide an ID.""

In the nine months since Trump took office, his administration has targeted California's sanctuary protections that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts, sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles to quell immigration protests, and carried out aggressive raids in immigrant-heavy communities. An immigrant farmworker died in one of those raids as he tried to escape the chaos.

Two federal judges have imposed limits on federal immigration agents' tactics and ability to profile Latino residents, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned one of those orders, clearing the way for ICE officers to target people in Southern California who look Latino or are speaking Spanish. Trump's crackdown has also ensnared U.S. citizens, some of whom have seen their property destroyed during immigration stops or been detained in immigration facilities when officers did not believe they were citizens or were unable to immediately prove their citizenship. In many cases the federal agents have worn face coverings that conceal their identity.

Newsom also signed new laws that seek to limit immigration enforcement work in hospitals and schools. In a statement announcing the new laws, Newsom excoriated Trump's immigration tactics, calling out the president and his top aide on immigration policy, Stephen Miller.

""Public safety depends on trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve - but Trump and Miller have shattered that trust and spread fear across America,"" Newsom wrote. ""California is putting an end to it and making sure schools and hospitals remain what they should be: places of care, not chaos.""

The bills approved Saturday include two measures that require federal and local officials, including immigration agents, to identify themselves. One measure, Senate Bill 627, prevents police from covering their faces on the job, with some exceptions. It applies to local law enforcement officers, out-of-state police officers and federal law enforcement officers - but not state police.

The Department of Homeland Security urged Newsom to veto SB627, arguing its officers need masks to protect them from ""being doxed."" The term ""doxed"" typically refers to people's sensitive personal information being released online, but DHS appeared to use it to mean when immigration officers' identities are made public, something that is routine for government employees.

Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, released a scathing response denouncing the idea that federal agents cannot effectively police without concealing their identities.

""Law enforcement can do their jobs without wearing ski masks, and if you think you need to wear a ski mask while patrolling and making arrests, you may want to consider a different line of work,"" wrote Wiener, the author of the new law. ""Masked secret police are not making anyone safer; instead they're creating an environment of lawlessness and fear that puts federal agents, local law enforcement, and civilians in danger.""

Much of the criticism of the bill focused not on whether wearing masks was good for policing, but whether the state has the ability to create rules guiding how federal officers perform their work within the state.

""States do not have the authority to second-guess the efficacy of federal policies, including masking,"" David Mastagni, an attorney representing the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella group of police unions, told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill.

The mask ban will take effect Jan. 1.

The other bill, SB805 by Sen. Sasha Pérez, D-Alhambra (Los Angeles County), requires law enforcement officers working in California to display identification with their name or badge number, with exceptions for undercover work and protective gear. It also limits when bounty hunters can help with immigration enforcement. SB805 takes effect immediately.

Newsom also signed these new laws, which take effect immediately:

• Senate Bill 98, by Pérez, which requires schools to tell parents and guardians when immigration officers are present on campus.

• Assembly Bill 49, by Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi, D-Rolling Hills Estates (Los Angeles County), which requires school officials to deny access to federal immigration authorities unless they have valid identification and a judicial warrant or court order. It takes effect immediately.

• Senate Bill 81, by Sen. Jesse Arreguín, D-Berkeley, which classifies immigration status and place of birth as ""private information"" that health care providers can't share with immigration enforcement. The bill also prohibits any person from accessing nonpublic areas of hospitals and doctors' offices for the purposes of immigration enforcement - except when required by federal or state law.

""Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today. You're welcome, America,"" Newsom's press office posted Saturday on X in reference to the homeland security secretary. The post prompted acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli to respond: ""We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials.

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.","A new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas goes into effect Sunday, but it will not be applied to existing holders of valid visas re-entering the country, a White House official tells Axios.

Why it matters: President Trump's executive order, as written, gave some lawyers the impression the fee would kick in immediately for existing holders — prompting panicked advice to clients to get back to the U.S. Saturday, or else.

Catch up quick: Friday night, Trump signed an order requiring an H-1B holder, or their corporate sponsor, to pay an annual $100,000 fee for their visa.

For the biggest H-1B employers — tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and outsourcing companies like Cognizant — that could potentially mean a new fee burden in excess of $1 billion a year.

The intrigue: The rules kick in at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday, but as written, some lawyers argued it appeared the fee would apply to anyone with an H-1B, even those whose visa was already approved, but who happen to be outside of the United States for some reason.

Some tech companies reportedly told their H-1B employees to get back to the U.S. by Saturday and not leave thereafter.

""I hate to say this, but if you are an H-1B worker outside the U.S. who already has an H-1B visa, the safest approach is re-entering before Sunday,"" immigration lawyer Douglas Russo said in a widely commented post on LinkedIn late Friday.

Yes, but: That is not the case, the White House official tells Axios.

The fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing holders or renewals, the official said.

It will first apply in the upcoming lottery cycle for new applicants, the official added.

Of note: Saturday afternoon, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow issued a memo confirming the fee order only applies to petitions not yet filed.

""The proclamation does not apply to aliens who: are the beneficiaries of petitions that were filed prior to the effective date of the proclamation, are the beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, or are in possession of validly issued H-1B non-immigrant visas,"" the memo says.

The big picture: While Trump's crackdown on border crossings has gotten the lion's share of attention, the fight over H-1B visas for highly skilled workers has been in many ways an equally contentious part of his immigration policy.

Traditional MAGA allies like Steve Bannon say U.S. employers are using H-1Bs to bring in tech workers to take American jobs at a fraction of the cost.

Newer Trump allies from Silicon Valley, on the other hand, say H-1Bs are crucial for bringing the world's best talent to America.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages. It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.

“The clarifications mean that foreign nationals who currently have a pending or approved H-1B petition or a valid H-1B visa should not be subject to the newly-announced H-1B entry restrictions,” according to Fragomen.
Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom.
Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation.
For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers.","Trump officials will face lawsuits over a proclamation that uses selective economic claims to justify a travel ban on H-1B visa holders. The presidential proclamation, issued on September 19, 2025, will impose a likely prohibitive $100,000 fee on the entry of individuals with new H-1B visas. An administration clarification, or “walk-back” after criticism, provided more details on who can enter the United States without paying the fee. If the $100,000 fee survives court challenges, it will change how many companies access talent, since an H-1B visa is often the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work long term in America. After surveying the impact and examining what is coming from the administration on immigration policy, many employers are expected to respond by increasing offshoring and hiring more people outside the United States, the opposite of what the proclamation aims to accomplish.

The presidential proclamation bans the entry of individuals on H-1B visas “except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000.” The proclamation contains no information on how an employer can obtain a “national interest” waiver to sidestep paying the $100,000 fee. The restriction lasts for 12 months but will likely endure throughout the Trump administration.

According to Customs and Border Protection, “The Proclamation applies prospectively to petitions that have not been filed. It does not impact aliens who are beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, any petitions filed prior to 12:01 AM ET on September 21, 2025, or aliens in possession of validly issued H-1B nonimmigrants visas.” (USCIS issued a memo with similar language.)

“The clarifications mean that foreign nationals who currently have a pending or approved H-1B petition or a valid H-1B visa should not be subject to the newly-announced H-1B entry restrictions,” according to Fragomen. “They should be able to enter the United States from abroad on or after September 21, 2025, provided that they possess a valid, approved H-1B petition and H-1B visa (if required).” The law firm notes that “those with a pending H-1B petition should not be impacted by the proclamation.” However, foreign nationals with an H-1B petition filed on or after September 21, 2025, “are subject to the new entry restrictions.” The firm notes, “Guidance on petitions subject to the restrictions, on payment of the new H-1B fee, and on applying for a national interest exception to the restrictions are anticipated in the coming days.”

An employer who petitions for an individual, such as an F-1 student, who changes to H-1B status without leaving the United States should not have to pay the $100,000 fee. However, the two agency memos released over the weekend are not crystal clear on this. The CBP memo says the fee only applies to people outside the US, but the USCIS memo does not say that, and USCIS adjudicates H-1B petitions, notes Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel. The weekend memos clarify that current H-1B employees who did not pay the fee can still travel. But since this is an evolving situation, employers should seek legal advice and watch for agency guidance before individuals travel.

If the H-1B travel ban remains in place, cap-exempt organizations, such as universities, would have to pay the $100,000 fee to hire new professors or researchers if they are outside the country and a petition has not already been filed for them. The $100,000 fee, on top of other government fees, attorney costs and salary requirements, will act as a prohibition on hiring individuals outside the country in H-1B status for nearly all employers.

Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation

After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom. Attorneys believe they have a strong case but may have to contend with a Supreme Court that has often deferred to the president on immigration policy.

Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation. “I want to say it’s nuts that the proclamation cites 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) as authority, when that provision only gives the president authority to prevent entry, and gives the president no authority with respect to petition approval or visa issuance,” said Morrison. “This is fresh on my mind as I won an injunction on this issue just a month ago.” The case was Thein v. Trump, which focused on whether Trump’s travel ban can prevent the State Department from issuing visas to Diversity Visa lottery winners.

“8 U.S.C.1185(a) doesn’t make this proclamation lawful either,” said Morrison, “because it only gives the president authority to prescribe reasonable rules for foreigners to depart or enter the U.S. It’s clear from this proclamation they’re making rules about how petitions are approved and how visas are issued. Also, I don’t think this proclamation can survive a nondelegation challenge.” Nondelegation refers to the constitutional issue whereby Congress cannot give away its legislative authority.

Immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta is less confident a lawsuit will succeed. “While the proclamation is so blatantly unlawful that it rewrites parts of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act), I am not as sanguine of a successful challenge to the proclamation after the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s travel ban under INA 221(f) in Trump v. Hawaii,” he said in an interview. “The H-1B proclamation has also been issued pursuant to INA 221(f).”

“The proclamation rehashes many of the objections to the H-1B visa category that have become outdated and seem to cast IT firms of Indian heritage in an unfavorable light,” said Mehta. “H-1B workers are no longer cheap labor and provide great value to U.S. companies, which in turn create more jobs for U.S. workers. H-1B workers are mostly paid six figure salaries. The rules also ensure that H-1B workers are paid the higher of the prevailing or actual wage.”

Mehta said a court may not challenge the president’s rationale behind the proclamation, but a court could evaluate whether imposing the $100,000 fee rewrites H-1B law or only supplants it. “To me, it is a complete rewrite of the law, and so a court should be able to distinguish this proclamation from Trump v. Hawaii,” he said. “The president cannot wholesale re-write laws enacted by Congress, and decide the sort of immigrant he prefers over another based on personal whim and prejudice.”

On October 1, 2020, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s June 2020 proclamation that suspended the entry of foreign nationals on H-1B, L-1, H-2B and most J-1 temporary visas. Judge White ruled the president does not possess a monarch’s power to cast aside immigration laws passed by Congress. The order in NAM v. DHS prevented the State Department and Department of Homeland Security from “engaging in any action that results in the non-processing or non-issuance of applications or petitions for visas in the H, J, and L categories which, but for Proclamation 10052, would be eligible for processing and issuance.”

At a September 11, 2020, hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Paul Hughes of McDermott Will & Schulte, counsel for the plaintiffs, framed the issues: If Congress delegated unlimited authority to the president under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)), the law is unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of authority by Congress. If the authority is not unlimited, then there are limits to the president’s authority based on rational standards and court precedents.

Judge White cited an amicus curiae brief from law professors that all past presidents “had issued such Proclamations with the basic understanding that ‘exercises of authority under § 1182(f) must connect to the United States’ relations with foreign powers.’ As the Court examines this Proclamation in the immigration context aimed to address purely domestic considerations, the amicus suggest that ‘[g]iven this lack of pedigree on past practice, this Court should scale back deference that it affords the current proclamation.’”

“There must be some measure of constraint on Presidential authority in the domestic sphere in order not to render the executive an entirely monarchical power in the immigration context, an area within clear legislative prerogative,” according to Judge White. In a footnote, Judge White expressed skepticism that the ban on the entry of visa holders banned under the proclamation would end. The ban ended after Joe Biden took office.

Proclamation Makes Selective Immigration Claims To Justify H-1B Travel Ban

The H-1B proclamation makes only a limited attempt to justify the extraordinary action of banning the entry of an entire visa category of highly skilled individuals. “The Trump administration makes highly selective claims that ignore a large body of economic research on the benefits of admitting H-1B visa holders to justify its presidential proclamation imposing a travel ban on H-1B visa holders whose employers do not pay a prohibitive $100,000 penalty,” concluded a National Foundation for American Policy analysis.

“The presidential proclamation’s omissions, cherry picking and obfuscation of data indicate the administration decided on the policy details in the proclamation and later attempted to find material to support the policy rather than engage in a legitimate analysis that culminated in banning the entry of H-1B visa holders, absent a $100,000 fee,” according to the NFAP report.

The proclamation argues that an increasing unemployment rate in technology fields justifies the H-1B travel ban, despite the unemployment rate declining in these fields. “The unemployment rate for computer and mathematical occupations dropped from 3.4% to 3.0% between August 2024 and August 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,” notes the NFAP analysis. “The unemployment rate for architecture and engineering occupations fell from 1.7% to 1.4% between August 2024 and August 2025. Those numbers represent a decline in the unemployment rate in percentage terms of 11.8% for individuals in computer and mathematical occupations and a drop of 17.6% for professionals in architecture and engineering.”

The proclamation ignores the overall unemployment rate in these fields over the past 12 months but cites data on the unemployment rates among college graduates aged 22 to 27 from 2023—without noting the data were from 2023. The fourth table in a group of tables released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York divides the population of college graduates aged 22 to 27 in a survey into 72 college majors, resulting in much smaller sample sizes, which creates volatility and less reliability in the results. For example, although the proclamation cites a 7.5% unemployment rate for recent college graduates in computer engineering, it does not note the figure is from 2023 or that in 2022 the survey showed the unemployment rate in computer engineering was only 2.5%. Other fields, such as agricultural economics, also showed wild fluctuations from year to year. The NFAP analysis notes that it is unlikely the numbers in the survey are a strong indicator of career prospects in particular fields.

The proclamation ignores the significant job creation that has benefited U.S. workers in technology fields over the past few decades. “The number of U.S.-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024,” according to an NFAP analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The proclamation implies that U.S. college students would be better off majoring in art history than in computer fields due to H-1B visa holders. There is no evidence to support such a conclusion.

A 2021 NFAP study by Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida and a former research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, found, “Median earnings of college graduates with a computer-related major are 35% higher than other STEM majors and fully 83% higher than non-STEM majors, according to data on U.S.-born college graduates from the American Community Survey for the period 2009 to 2019.”

The proclamation ignores almost entirely the vast number of studies produced on H-1B visa holders. The NFAP analysis cites more than a dozen to illustrate the point.

For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates.”

A study by economists Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber and Angie Marek Zeitlin found that denying entry to H-1B visa holders due to the H-1B annual limits inhibited job growth for U.S.-born professionals. “The number of jobs for U.S.-born workers in computer-related industries would have grown at least 55% faster between 2005-2006 and 2009-2010, if not for the denial of so many applications in the recent H-1B visa lotteries,” concluded the economists.

In a study particularly relevant to the new H-1B proclamation, research by Britta Glennon, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that new restrictions on H-1B visas are likely to push jobs out of the United States: “[A]ny policies that are motivated by concerns about the loss of native jobs should consider that policies aimed at reducing immigration have the unintended consequence of encouraging firms to offshore jobs abroad.”

More Immigration And H-1B Visa Restrictions On The Horizon

Trump officials appear unlikely to slow their pace after issuing the travel ban on H-1B visas. The proclamation calls for reviving the Trump administration’s efforts in 2020 to publish a Department of Labor rule to inflate the required salary for H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants. The 2020 measure mandated minimum salaries so far above the market wage for a foreign national’s experience level that analysts concluded Trump officials intended to price H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants out of the U.S. labor market. Unlike the proclamation, such a rule would apply to individuals inside the United States, not just those seeking entry.

Trump officials are likely to continue their efforts to dismantle the current immigrant talent pipeline by, among other things, making it more difficult for international students to obtain H-1B status. The effort will include finalizing the recently proposed rule to require fixed periods of admission for students, rulemaking to curtail or eliminate, in practice, Optional Practical Training and STEM OPT, a new H-1B selection process expected to disadvantage international students and an H-1B rule that will likely introduce new restrictions for companies.

If employers did not have enough to worry about, the Department of Labor announced a new immigration effort on September 19, 2025. “The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the launch of Project Firewall, an H-1B enforcement initiative that will safeguard the rights, wages, and job opportunities of highly skilled American workers by ensuring employers prioritize qualified Americans when hiring workers and holding employers accountable if they abuse the H-1B visa process,” according to a news release.

The Secretary of Labor promises to “personally certify the initiation of investigations for the first time” in the Labor Department’s history. The DOL release on the new immigration action notes, “As authorized by federal law, the department will conduct investigations of employers through Project Firewall to maximize H-1B program compliance.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68cfa474a8f75b8570b1fd1f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1688,950,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-09-21 12:56:38.048856

The use of solitary confinement in U.S. detention facilities has been on the rise since Trump’s second presidential term.

According to a report published by the NGO Physicians for Human Rights, thousands of migrants have been placed in solitary confinement since the Biden administration took office in 2021, and in recent months this practice has multiplied despite risks to detainees’ mental health.

The report also found that during the first three months of 2025, vulnerable people were held in isolation for periods more than twice as long as when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) first began publishing statistics — that is, 38 consecutive days in early 2025 compared with 14 days in late 2021.

The agency defines vulnerable people as pregnant, breastfeeding, or elderly individuals; those suffering from serious mental disorders or illnesses; people at risk of harm because of their identity; or victims of rape or sexual abuse.

Solitary confinement is defined as placing a person in a small cell for 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact. ICE claims it does not use “solitary confinement” in its detention centers. The agency avoids the term “solitary confinement” and instead uses terms such as segregation, separate housing, or Special Management Units. The study says migrants held in such cells were placed in administrative segregation.

According to the report, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention centers across the United States over a 14-month period from April 2024 to May 2025. Similarly, in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was more than six times higher than at the end of the previous U.S. administration.

The report also cites a study showing that solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate and an unprecedented number of migrants are being kept in isolation. It warns that, due to a recent increase in congressional funding approved to expand migrant detention centers, widespread and prolonged use of solitary confinement is likely to worsen.

The United Nations considers solitary confinement of 15 days or more to be torture. Katherine Piller, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement that agency records from late in the Biden administration — amid increasing attacks by the Trump administration on migrants — show that ICE has exposed people to these torturous conditions, causing devastating physical and psychological harm.

Experts say prolonged isolation can cause paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression — all of which can lead to suicide.",https://www.mizanonline.ir/files/en/news/2025/9/21/12478_250.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:56:47.062982

And there have been at least five ICE missions to Africa on military jets, though if the last two are any indication, they are getting increasingly harder to spot.","Two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa this month on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft.

One of the jets was later identified in a lawsuit in U.S. federal court as carrying 14 Nigerian and Gambian nationals to a prison camp in Ghana. They have since been returned to their countries of origin, Ghana said, despite all having credible fears of persecution or torture. The other jet secretly landed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali, according to communications from the flight deck obtained by Rolling Stone. Representatives for the governments of these countries did not respond to emails asking if this jet also included third-country nationals.

The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by President Donald Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

“The administration is using military secrecy to cover for what is basically a law enforcement/immigration enforcement function,” an activist flight tracker who goes by JJ in DC told Rolling Stone. “If this is being done in our interest, we have a right to know where these deportation flights are going.”

While it is legal for military aircraft to turn off their transponders, this is generally reserved for combat and surveillance missions, JJ in DC, who is a military veteran, said. Military flights also cost much more to operate than charter carriers, as much as $28,500 an hour, according to Reuters.

The Air Force and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide a statement prior to publication. This story will be updated if any of them do.

Both secret trips were on Air Force C-17 Globemasters. The first one left McChord Field near Tacoma, Wash., on the evening of Sept. 4, stopping at the ICE-detention hub city of Alexandria, La., and the U.S. military outpost at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — which Trump has converted into an ICE facility holding what he has baselessly claimed are “the worst of the worst” deportees. The flight landed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a likely fuel stop, the next afternoon.

Editor’s picks

These flights were conducted without the standard transponder signal, called Automatic Dependent Signal-Broadcast, or ADS-B, which transmits constant information about a flight, including registration, location, speed, and altitude, to any receiver within range. The C-17 used an alternative signal transmitting its registration but no location or other flight data — though flight-tracking websites could still approximate its location through a kind of triangulation.

It is unclear when exactly the C-17 left St. Croix, because by then it was using another type of signal even harder to detect, in which an aircraft transmits its location via data link only when requested by a specific partner, like an air base. Different flight-tracking websites were able to capture different fragments of the C-17’s trajectory — a single blip over the Atlantic Ocean on the night of Sept. 5 and part of a descent toward Accra, Ghana’s capital, the next morning.

Hours later, a brief signal showed it landing in Cape Verde, probably for crew rest, before returning home. Its ADS-B transponder began transmitting again on Sept 10. Two days later, a lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court alleged the flight held 14 men — 13 from Nigeria and one from The Gambia — who had all been granted protections from removal to their countries of origin for fear of persecution or torture. They were loaded onto the cargo jet in the middle of the night with no advance warning, they alleged, and were only told where they were going when the plane was in the air. One Nigerian man said that after he asked to speak to his lawyers, he was “straitjacketed for several hours” — seeming to refer to the WRAP device ICE uses on immigrants who resist transport, which has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years alleging use of the device has caused permanent injury and even death by asphyxiation.

Once in Ghana, the men said they were sent to an “abysmal” open-air prison camp and told they would be returned to their countries of origin — something the U.S. government had been barred from doing. Though Judge Tanya Chutkan called the Trump administration’s actions “disingenuous,” she ultimately ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to stop it. On Tuesday, Ghana said all of the men had been returned to their home countries, though attorneys told the Associated Press four were still in the Ghana prison.

Human rights groups say this amounts to chain refoulement — the forcible expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they are vulnerable to return to countries where they face persecution — and violates both domestic and international law.

“What is alarming today is the emerging pattern of shadowy deportations of people who have not had access to a court or any meaningful form of due process — removals that bear the hallmarks of forced disappearances under international law,” says Rebecca Sharpless, a University of Miami law professor who studies ICE flights.

Accepting third-country nationals “should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration,” Ghanaian foreign minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said Monday. “Our decision is grounded purely on humanitarian principle and Pan-African empathy.”

The second C-17 trip began like the first one — Alexandria, Gitmo, St. Croix, no ADS-B transponder but still trackable — before becoming even harder to detect when it left St. Croix. One flight-tracking website captured a few blips as it headed toward the western coast of Africa in the small hours of Sept. 10, and two blips over Senegal later that evening. The other flight-tracking website didn’t capture anything at all, which one activist described as “very weird.”

Two of the flight deck transmissions Rolling Stone obtained, which are not available on flight-tracking websites, show the pilots planning to land at Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, Liberia, and Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone that morning, with a third transmission showing an intended stop in Mali’s capital of Bamako in the early afternoon. The final stop in Senegal was likely for crew rest.

Two other military aircraft are known to have done ICE missions without broadcasting transponder signals: the jets that carried third-country nationals from a U.S. base in Djibouti to South Sudan and Eswatini in July.

That same month, Trump held a bizarre “Africa summit” at the White House, gathering five of the continent’s 50-plus leaders around a conference table, where he extolled their “very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people” and fished for compliments from his fellow heads of state. (“A tremendous golfer.” “Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.”) And, Trump said, they were making progress on third-country agreements.

Since then, ICE flights to Africa are surging. A new ICE charter, Paradigm Jet Management, has entered the picture, running at least eight deportation trips to and from the continent in the last six weeks.

The ban, which comes into effect on 1 January 2026, is part of a series of bills that aims to protect residents from what Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has called ""secret police"" roaming the streets.

US Attorney Bill Essayli, a Trump appointee, said California ""has no jurisdiction over the federal government"", adding the law has ""no effect on our operations"" and agents ""will continue to protect their identities"".

The ban is in response to federal agents wearing masks during Los Angeles immigration raids.

The law makes exceptions for undercover agents, masks used to protect against disease or wildfires, and tactical gear.

President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement as a priority in his second term.

In June, a series of federal immigration raids in LA sparked violent protests against the Trump administration and ICE.

Trump deployed 700 US Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to the country's second-largest city in reaction to the unrest.

California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, wrote the bill in response.

""No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,"" he said. ""California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.""

The legislation comes after the Supreme Court ruled that immigration enforcement stops in LA could continue for the time being without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the US legally.

That ruling allows officers to question and detain people based solely on their race, language or job while a legal challenge to recent immigration raids works its way through the courts.

As well as the ban on face coverings, a new bill also requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number.

Other bills signed by Newsom on Saturday prohibit school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.

Families will also need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools.

Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.

Non-public areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are also off-limits to officers who do not have judicial warrants or court orders.

""Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said.

In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called California's new legislation ""despicable"" and a ""flagrant attempt to endanger our officers"".

She said the officers at ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies ""put their lives on the line every day"" to do their jobs.

""Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization.""

New Americans, a division of Samaritas, is one of Michigan's largest refugee resettlement services with offices in Grand Rapids and Battle Creek. The organization supports individuals and families from arrival through long-term integration. Director Chris Cavanaugh has collaborated with refugees wanting to come to Michigan for more than 20 years, and he has heard that some former refugees who have settled in the area are concerned about their status based on changing immigration policies instituted by President Donald Trump's administration.

“The refugee system has traditionally worked to help (immigrants) who face persecution,” Cavanaugh said. “I’ve heard from some (employees) that they’ve had clients express concerns about their status.”

Cavanaugh added that he hasn’t heard of any refugees his agency has worked with skip work or school because of deportation concerns. But Michigan Immigration Rights Center Director Susan Reed has gone out of her way to assure clients that they still have rights, especially if they are naturalized citizens. Reed oversees the nonprofit legal resource center that supports immigration communities. Michigan Immigration Right Center has five locations in the state, including Battle Creek.

“There are so many people who contact us each week who think the (federal government) can to whatever they want to them,” Reed said.

Among the administration policies enacted this year is an increase in Temporary Protected Status (TPS) terminations, Reed said. TPS is a humanitarian program created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990 that grants immigrants temporary status to work in the U.S., usually for a period of six to 18 months.

With TPS and other protections reduced or eliminated, local immigrants are concerned about enrolling their children in community programs or visiting federally qualified health centers for medical care because of the implied threat of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents being onsite.

Reed has been in the immigration law field for more than 20 years. She said there have been 451 changes to immigration policy since Jan. 20, and that the pace and number of changes have been overwhelming to her.

“Just think how hard that is for (clients),” Reed said. “It’s very frightening. Every time there is significant ICE (enforcement) activity in a neighborhood, everyone hears about it.”

The Battle Creek area and other west Michigan communities have experienced a growth in refugees and immigrants from such countries as Burma and the Demmocractic Republic of Congo in recent years as people native to those countries have come to the U.S. to escape political and socioeconomic persecution.

“We’re hoping to see the flow of immigrants increase,” Cavanaugh said. “There are a lot of (refugees and immigrants) who are trying to reunite with their families in U.S.

Refugees are people who cannot return to their home country because of persecution or a realistic fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Refugees are admitted into the country through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program after screening by U.S. agencies. The U.S. Department of State manages that program.

Being a refugee is a protected status under humanitarian law. Refugees must apply for a green card, which signifies the approval of permanent residents, one year after entering the U.S. according to the USCIS website.

Family- and employment-based immigrants enter as permanent residents, but many immigrants have no automatic path to U.S. residency.

“There should not be status issues for refugees unless they have committed a crime,” Cavanaugh said.

Other refugees and immigrants have come to the Battle Creek area from countries like Cuba, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia.

One challenge Cavanaugh has experienced is that the country’s humanitarian parole program has been impacted by status changes coming from federal agencies. Nationally, this has resulted in some immigrants losing their employment authorization and protected status.

Humanitarian parole is an immigration tool used to allow immigrants who don’t otherwise qualify for a visa to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or because their entry provides a significant public benefit. Rather than a residency step, it’s an emergency permission granted for a limited time, according to the USCIS website.

Actions like changing the status of the humanitarian parole program is one reason why Cavanaugh believes local refugees and immigrants may be concerned for their status.

“Many of these people came here just so they could work in the U.S.,” he said. “If they aren’t eligible, that’s a big challenge.”","https://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/PDEM/86078840007-20200302-t-000000-z-777382664-rc-2-dbf-9-yg-1-kt-rtrmadp-3-usaimmigration.JPG?crop=3034,1708,x0,y157&width=3034&height=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-21 11:59:13.744846

Birmingham immigration attorney Brett Pouncey told statewide news outlet AL.com that numerous communities are also working with ICE to set up license-checking ""roadblocks"" – citing reports from his own clients.

Russellville community organizer Evelyn Servin told the outlet that police should not be working with the feds, and claimed people in her area may be racially profiled and detained.

Throughout the summer, ICE also made two dozen arrests in Baldwin County, home of the famed white-sand ""Redneck Riviera"" beach towns.

Arrests were made at sites in Loxley – along Interstate 10 north of Orange Beach – and Spanish Fort, which lies on the other end of the George Wallace Tunnel from Mobile.

The operations led one immigration advocate in that region to suggest immigrants write phone numbers on their bodies to be able to contact family in case they are detained by ICE, according to AL.com.

Local advocates have also condemned ICE agents for wearing masks, failing to identify themselves, and not using body cameras — actions that starkly contrast with Chicago Police Department policy.
As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people.","PARK RIDGE, Ill. -- It was 3:30 a.m. when 10 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers gathered in a parking lot in the Chicago suburbs for a briefing about a suspect they were hoping to arrest. They went over a description of the person, made sure their radios were on the same channel and discussed where the closest hospital was in case something went wrong.

“Let's plan on not being there,” said one of the officers, before they climbed into their vehicles and headed out.

Across the city and surrounding suburbs, other teams were fanning out in support of “ Operation Midway Blitz.” It has unleashed President Donald Trump's mass deportations agenda on a city and state that has had some of the strongest laws preventing local officials from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

ICE launched the operation on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by the Republican president. They say there has been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents, although a military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize.

The Associated Press went on a ride-along with ICE in a Chicago suburb — much of the recent focus — to see how that operation is unfolding.

A voice came over the radio: “He got into the car. I'm not sure if that's the target.”

Someone matching the description of the man that ICE was searching for walked out of the house, got into a car and drove away from the tree-lined street. Unsure whether this was their target, the officers followed. A few minutes later, with the car approaching the freeway, the voice over the radio said: “He's got the physical description. We just can't see the face good.”

“Do it,” said Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Agents in multiple vehicles soon overtook the car and boxed it in. After talking to the man, they realized he was not the person being sought for but that he was in the United States illegally, so they took him into custody.

Eventually, a little after dawn broke on the one- and two-story brick houses, the man they were looking for came out of the house and got into a car. ICE officers closed in. The man got out of the car and was arrested. ICE said both men were in the country illegally and had criminal records.

Charles called it a “successful operation.”

“There was no safety issues on the part of our officers, nor the individuals that we arrested. And it went smoothly,” he said.

Activists and critics of ICE say that's increasingly not the norm in immigration operations.

They point to videos showing ICE agents smashing windows to apprehend suspects, a chaotic showdown outside a popular Italian restaurant in San Diego, and arrests like that of a Tufts University student in March by masked agents outside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, as neighbors watched.

Charles said ICE is using an “appropriate” amount of force and that agents are responding to suspects who increasingly are not following commands.

There has been “an uptick in people that are not compliant,” he said, blaming inflammatory rhetoric from activists who, he said, are encouraging people to resist.

Alderman Andre Vasquez, who chairs the Chicago City Council's committee on immigrant and refugee rights, strenuously objected to that description, faulting ICE for any escalation.

“We’re not here to cause chaos. The president is,” Vasquez. He accused immigration enforcement agents of trying to provoke activists into overreacting in order to justify calling in a greater use of force such as National Guard troops. “ICE does not belong here.”

Chicago was already on edge when a shooting Sept. 12 heightened tensions even more.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant who tried to evade arrest in a Chicago suburb by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them. The department said the officer felt his life was threatened and had opened fire, killing the man.

Charles said he could not comment because there is an open investigation. But he said he met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate.

The officer was not wearing a body camera, Charles said.

Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., has demanded “a full, factual accounting” of the shooting. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the death and said Mexico is demanding a thorough investigation.

“These tactics have led to the loss of life of one of our community members,” said Democratic state Rep. Norma Hernandez.

In another use of force incident under “Midway Blitz” that has drawn criticism, a U.S. citizen was detained by immigration agents alongside his father and hit by a stun gun three times Tuesday in suburban Des Plaines, the man’s lawyer said.

Local advocates have also condemned ICE agents for wearing masks, failing to identify themselves, and not using body cameras — actions that starkly contrast with Chicago Police Department policy.

Charles said there is no timeline for the ICE-led operation in the Chicago area to end. As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people. Charles said 50% to 60% of those are targeted arrests, meaning they are people whom immigration enforcers are specifically trying to find.

He pushed back on criticism that ICE randomly targets people, saying agents weren't “going out to Home Depot parking lots” to make indiscriminate arrests.

Charles said ICE has brought in more than 200 officers from around the country for the operation.

He said that for too long, cities such as Chicago that limited cooperation with ICE had allowed immigrants, especially those with criminal records, to remain in the country illegally. It was time to act, he said.

“It was time to hit Chicago.”

Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, respectively, who were freed on Friday, were pictured smiling and looking to be in good health as they arrived at Heathrow Airport.

The couple walked out of the arrivals area accompanied by their daughter and British special representative to Afghanistan Richard Lindsay.

The couple had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and ran an education and training organization in the country’s central province of Bamiyan, choosing to remain in the country after the Taliban seized power.

They had been held for nearly eight months following their arrest as they traveled to their home in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan, in February. They had been held in a maximum security prison, and faced long periods of separation.

Their plight underlined the concerns of the West over the actions of the Taliban since they overthrew the country’s US-backed government in a 2021 lightning offensive.

Analysts say the move by the Taliban, which was facilitated by Qatar, could be part of a broader effort to gain international recognition.

Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalize relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist.

It remains unclear what, if anything, the Taliban had been promised for the Reynolds’ release. However, Afghanistan’s list of needs is long.

The Western aid money that flowed into it after the 2001 US-led invasion has been severely cut as needs continue to mount, particularly after a magnitude 6 quake on Aug. 31. Its economy remains on shaky ground.

But Western nations remain hesitant to provide money to the Taliban government, citing their restrictions on women and personal freedoms.

‘Bewildered’ with arrest

After their return, Peter Reynolds told The Times that the and his wife had “begun to think that we would never be released, or that we were even being held until we were executed.”

“We are bewildered as to why any of this happened and are very happy that this ordeal is over,” he said.

Barbie said the toughest thing about the affair was “seeing my 80-year-old husband struggling to get into the back of a police truck with his hands and ankles chained.”

Their family has spoken of their “immense joy” on hearing that the Reynolds were released, and there were emotional scenes when they arrived in Doha on a flight from Kabul to be met by their daughter.

“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy and international cooperation,” their four children said in a joint statement on Friday.

“While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”

Qatar played a key role in helping to free the couple after mounting fears about their health.

During their arrest last February, the couple were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, UN experts have said.

The couple married in Kabul in 1970 and have spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programs for women and children. They also became Afghan citizens.

The Taliban authorities have not explained why the pair were detained.

‘We are Afghan citizens’

Speaking at Kabul airport on Friday before they left, Barbie Reynolds said the couple had been treated well.

“We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,” she added.

Their son, Jonathan, echoed to the BBC that his parents were hoping to return to the country they love.

“They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they’ve been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact,” he said.

In July, independent UN human rights experts called on the Taliban government to free the couple, warning that they risked “irreparable harm or even death” as their health deteriorated.

Their family had made repeated pleas for their release, citing their failing health.

Taliban foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on Friday the couple “had violated the laws of Afghanistan” and were released from custody “following the judicial process.”

Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the “long-awaited news will come as a huge relief” to the family.

The British government advises against traveling to Afghanistan, warning that its ability to offer consular assistance is “extremely limited.”

Russia is the only country to have officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed a strict version of Islamic law and been accused of sweeping rights violations.

Dozens of foreign nationals have been arrested since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US-led NATO forces.

WASHINGTON: At one of his final rallies before the 2024 election, then-candidate Donald Trump warned that Black Americans were losing their jobs in droves and that things would get even worse if he did not return to the White House.

“You should demand that they give you the numbers of how many Black people are going to lose their job,” Trump said. “The African American population, they’re getting fired at numbers that we have never seen before.”

But with Trump back in office since January, an already fragile financial situation for Black Americans has worsened. Upset by inflation and affordability issues, Black voters had shifted modestly toward the Republican last year on the promise that he could boost the economy by stopping border crossings and challenging foreign factories with tariffs. Yet a recent spate of economic data instead shows a widening racial wealth gap.

Black unemployment has climbed from 6.2 percent to 7.5 percent so far in 2025, the highest level since October 2021. Black homeownership has fallen to the lowest level since 2021, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. Earlier this month, the Census Bureau said the median Black household income fell 3.3 percent last year to $56,020, which is roughly $36,000 less than what a white household earns and evidence of a bad situation becoming worse.

That creates a major political risk for the president as well as an economic danger for the nation because job losses for Black Americans have historically foreshadowed a wider set of layoffs across other groups.

“Black Americans are often the canary in the coal mine,” said Angela Hanks, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Labor Department who is now at The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank.

The Trump White House stressed that some of these downward trends, such as a relative decline in Black wealth, began under Democratic President Joe Biden. It emphasized that the “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies pushed by Democrats failed to deliver economic gains.

“Despite his lunatic obsession with DEI, Joe Biden’s disastrous economic agenda reduced the Black share of household wealth by nearly 25 percent,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. “His inflationary policies caused interest rate hikes that froze Americans out of homeownership, and his open borders policies flooded the country with tens of millions of illegals who drove down wages.”

Some Black voters see Trump’s policies as doing more to hurt than help

Some Black voters who stayed on the sidelines in 2024 feel they need to be more engaged politically.

Josh Garrett, a 30-year-old salesperson in Florida, said he could not find a candidate last year with whom he agreed. He is frustrated by Trump’s layoffs of federal workers and sees a government more geared toward billionaires than the middle class.

“I don’t understand how you could be for the American people and have Americans lose their jobs when they have families, have bills,” Garrett said.

While the financial outlook for Black Americans is deteriorating, the net worth of white households is largely holding steady or increasing, largely due to stock market performance.

Hanks notes that the “chaotic effects” of Trump’s tariffs and spending cuts are hitting more vulnerable populations right now but that the damage could soon spread beyond.

Black leaders see Trump’s policies as discriminatory based on race

The federal layoffs appear to have disproportionately hit Black Americans because they make up a meaningful share of the government workforce. The administration maintains that its income tax cuts, tariffs and deportations of immigrants who are in the United States illegally will help Black Americans, but there is little evidence so far in the data of that.

At the same time, Trump has said that he would like to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, New Orleans, Baltimore and Memphis, Tennessee — cities led by Black mayors. The president has called for redrawing congressional districts to favor Republicans, which could dilute the ability of Black voters to shape elections. He has sought to diminish the legacy of slavery and segregation from the Smithsonian museums.

“The message that they are sending is very clear: In these places, these people are incapable of governing themselves,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said. “They are incapable of helping to solve their own issues. And make no mistake about it, it’s partly due to how we look.”

The Democrat warned that the mounting economic challenges could contribute to crime in the future, reversing progress that cities have made in recent years to lower homicide rates.

Trump might not be able to afford alienating Black voters

Black Americans are the dominant core of the Democratic base, though Trump has improved his standing with them. In 2024, Trump won 16 percent of Black voters, doubling his 2020 share, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of the electorate. One of the key differences appeared to be frustration over inflation and affordability.

Roughly one-third of Black voters (36 percent) in the 2024 presidential election said the economy and jobs was the most important issue facing the country, up from 11 percent in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic was the top issue.

In a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about half of Black adults (52 percent) said the amount of money they get paid was a “major” source of stress in their life right now, slightly higher than for US adults overall (43 percent) and significantly higher than for white adults (37 percent).

When it comes to incomes, some associated with the conservative movement suggest that Black households are more vulnerable because fewer of them are in married families, which generally tend to have higher incomes.

Delano Squires, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the “connection between family structure and financial stability is one that is fairly consistent across time.”

The immediate political reality is that Trump had a mandate to improve the economy for the middle class, including Black voters. But many of those voters now see an administration more focused on deporting immigrants and expanding its own grip on power, possibly threatening Republicans’ chances of holding onto the House and key Senate seats in next year’s elections.

“We’re in a new era,” said Alexsis Rodgers, political director at the Black to the Future Action Fund. “There are people who obviously believed his promises, that Trump was going to do something about the cost of eggs, the cost of housing. They’ve seen the focus instead is on ICE raids and downsizing the government.”

WASHINGTON: A month after an Alaskan summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump still seems surprised that his gambit did not pay off with peace in Ukraine.

“He’s let me down,” Trump said this week. “He really let me down.”

There has been no more progress in the Middle East, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is beginning a new offensive in Gaza City and lashing out across the region.

“They have to be very, very careful,” Trump said after Israel targeted Hamas inside Qatar, a US ally that has been hosting diplomatic negotiations.

Trump’s disappointment and frustration is much different from the confidence and dominance he tries to project on the international stage, especially as he trumpets his diplomatic efforts and campaigns for the Nobel Peace Prize. Asked about his goals for the upcoming UN General Assembly, the president said “world peace.” But the most high-profile conflicts appear to be escalating instead of winding down.

“This whole last nine months of peace efforts was just a merry-go-round,” said Max Bergmann, a State Department official under Democratic President Barack Obama who now works at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Bold gestures, but reaching peace deals is hard

Although Trump prizes bold gestures — a stealth bomber strike in Iran, a sweeping tariff announcement — solving a global jigsaw puzzle is a far bigger struggle.

The fundamental truth, Bergmann said, is “trying to reach peace agreements is very hard,” and that Trump has not surrounded himself with experienced diplomats and foreign policy experts.

“It’s like if you were to tell me, ‘Go do a hotel deal,’” Bergmann said. “It would be a terrible deal. I would lose a lot of money.”

In Trump’s defense, the White House has pointed to comments from European leaders who have praised his efforts working to forge peace agreements. Trump often notes that he hires “only the best people.”

Matt Kroenig, a senior policy adviser at the Pentagon during Trump’s first term, said the president’s brashness can get results, such as when he demanded increased defense spending from European allies.

Trump, however, can end up spinning his wheels on more challenging issues and eventually give up, such as when he tried to persuade Kim Jong Un to end North Korea’s nuclear program.

When it comes to making peace in Ukraine and Gaza, Kroenig wondered, “At what point does he say, ‘This is too hard, let’s move on to other issues.’”

Foreign policy is usually a team sport for presidential administrations, requiring extensive coordination among agencies through the National Security Council. But Trump has dramatically slashed the council’s staff, and Marco Rubio serves as both secretary of state and national security adviser.

“It’s one person setting the strategy and everyone else is waiting to see,” Kroenig said.

Mideast is increasingly in turmoil

In the Middle East, Trump is getting caught in the middle of an increasingly combustible situation. He has visited Arab nations, including Qatar, this year to strengthen ties, and he has backed Israel’s military operations in Gaza and Iran.

But now Israel, emboldened by its battlefield success, is striking more widely throughout the region, including the recent attack targeting Hamas officials in Qatar. That jeopardized negotiations that the United States has been trying to push along and rattled Arab leaders’ faith in Trump’s ability to influence, let alone rein in, Netanyahu.

Some of them now view Israel, not Iran, as their primary security threat, according to three Arab diplomats familiar with conversations at the last summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Doha. It’s a noticeable shift after Israel and Arab nations grew closer during Trump’s first term, when the Republican president championed the Abraham Accords. The diplomats were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

US officials have tried to assuage doubts by pointing to Trump’s expressions of displeasure with Netanyahu’s latest moves, to recent meetings held with Qatar’s prime minister and to discussions of enhanced security arrangements.

During next week’s annual high-level gathering at the General Assembly, Rubio and Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff can expect to hear a chorus of criticism, with Arab nations seeking a more fundamental shift in how the US approaches the region.

For example, the US has tried to ensure that Israel has a military edge over its Arab neighbors. But now that Israel has attacked Qatar with US-supplied weapons — a strike that Qatar was unable to counter with its own US-supplied defenses — Arab diplomats are considering demanding stronger support.

Such a move would likely be politically untenable, at least for now, with support for Israel strong among Republicans who control Congress.

Trump’s equivocal approach to Putin

In Europe, Trump has frustrated his critics with his equivocal approach to Putin, sometimes suggesting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is just as responsible for the war that Moscow started with its 2022 invasion.

Trump recently insisted that his meeting with Putin “accomplished a lot,” but “it takes two to tango.”

“You know those are two people, Zelensky and Putin, that hate each other,” he said.

Fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over have been heightened by recent Russian military incursions into the airspace of NATO members Poland and Estonia. After three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian airspace on Friday, Trump said it could signal “big trouble.”

During a news conference in the United Kingdom on his state visit, Trump said he was dedicated to stopping the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Then he turned philosophical.

“You never know in war. You know, war is a different thing,” he said. “Things happen that are very opposite of what you thought.”

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump calls him a “communist.” His critics say he wants to defund the police. Zohran Mamdani insists he’s just a guy trying to make New York City more affordable.

Mamdani ‘s meteoritic rise to become the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor has put his past and present policy positions under close scrutiny. If elected, he would be the city’s first Muslim and Indian American mayor. He’d be the city’s most liberal mayor in generations.

But as he tries to broaden his support ahead of the November election, the state lawmaker has shifted more to the center on certain issues — while distancing himself from other potentially damaging political stances.

Mamdani’s opponents — two Democrats, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, and a Republican, Curtis Sliwa — have cast themselves as moderate alternatives to the 33-year-old.

Some top New York Democrats, including US Sen. Chuck Schumer, have been slow to endorse Mamdani. A few, including the state Democratic Party chair and some suburban members of Congress, have said they won’t back him. But more notable names have thrown their weight behind him in recent days, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s top two legislative leaders.

Here’s where he actually stands:

He’s a democratic socialist, not a communist

While Trump and other opponents keep calling Mamdani a communist, he identifies as something different: a democratic socialist. He believes government should play a role in reducing economic disparity, but he doesn’t advocate for a communist system where property is collectively owned.

Mamdani does favor raising taxes on the wealthy to fund proposals he argues would make the city more affordable. That includes free bus service, universal child care, and his signature issue: a freeze on rent increases for the city’s 1 million rent-regulated apartments. Opponents say a rent freeze would harm landlords, who have also been hit hard by inflation.

Perhaps nowhere has the “communist” label come up more than in relation to Mamdani’s proposal to set up a pilot program for city-run grocery stores. Billionaire John Catsimatidis, who owns grocery chains Gristedes and D’Agostino Supermarkets, said the program would “drag us down a path toward the bread lines of the old Soviet Union.”

In an interview with The Bulwark, Mamdani framed his proposal for five stores that would sell products at wholesale prices as a modest experiment. He said if it doesn’t work, “C’est la vie, then the idea was wrong.”

He has also faced criticism over comments he made on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” in which he said that in an economically just world, “I don’t think that we should have billionaires.” But Mamdani said that as mayor, he would be happy to work with billionaires to solve the city’s problems.

He no longer supports defunding the police

After the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in 2020, Mamdani was among a number of New York Democrats who advocated slashing the police department’s budget, and who frequently railed against police brutality.

In one social media post, Mamdani called the department “racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety.” In another, Mamdani wrote, “Defund this rogue agency” on a post sharing video of NYPD pummeling a man who had argued with a police officer.

During his mayoral campaign, Mamdani has distanced himself from these prior calls to reduce department funding, saying they don’t represent his current agenda. Mamdani said he would maintain the NYPD’s staffing levels but also create a new “Department of Community Safety” that would deploy mental health care teams, rather than armed officers, to handle certain emergency calls involving people in psychiatric crisis.

And he has softened his overall rhetoric around law enforcement. In a recent New York Times interview, he answered “yes” when asked if he owed officers an apology for calling the department racist, saying his 2020 comments were made “at the height of frustration.”

Mamdani’s opponents have been skeptical of his shift. Adams, a former police captain, says Mamdani changed his position on law enforcement because voters wouldn’t support defunding the department. Cuomo has said Mamdani is flip-flopping and hasn’t given voters a clear picture of who he really is.

He’s criticized Israel and defended Palestinian civil rights

Mamdani is a vocal defender of Palestinian civil rights and has accused the Israeli government of committing a genocide in Gaza.

He supports an economic boycott of Israel and has promised that if Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited New York City he would honor a warrant from the International Criminal Court and have Netanyahu arrested for war crimes. The US is not a member of the court and Israel denies it is engaging in genocide or war crimes.

Mamdani has repeatedly condemned the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, calling the militant group’s slaughter of 1,200 “deplorable.” He has also said he believes Israel has a right to exist, though without a hierarchy that favors Jewish citizens over others.

That hasn’t assuaged critics who characterize such condemnations of Israeli policy as antisemitic.

Before the primary, Mamdani was asked whether he would disavow the phrase “globalize the intifada,” a slogan some see as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. At the time, Mamdani described it as reflecting “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.”

But Mamdani — who has not employed the phrase during his campaign — now says he would discourage others from using the slogan.

Is he connected to DSA

Mamdani is a member of the New York City and national chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, an activist group that advocates for a universal health care system, immigrants’ rights, tuition-free higher education, nationwide rent regulation, a 32-hour workweek, and getting rid of mandatory jail time for some types of crimes, among other issues.

Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa have all heaped scorn on Mamdani for his association with the group. Mamdani says he is running on his own, distinct platform — not DSA’s — and that being part of a group doesn’t mean you agree with all of its goals.

Asked by reporters about his previous support for decriminalizing prostitution, Mamdani didn’t give a direct answer but said: “What I want to do is look at the ways in which the previous administration addressed this issue,” referring to former Mayor Bill de Blasio, under whom arrests for related charges decreased.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/09/20/4641600-155659464.jpg?itok=ucgzMLXI,N,,2025-09-21 12:00:00.253205

Brad Thomson, a spokesperson for the National Lawyers Guild, confirmed that 10 protesters were arrested, but he could not say whether any of them had been charged.

Protesters were arrested during Friday’s demonstration after they clashed with federal immigration agents who fired pepper balls and launched tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

“Our legal observers witnessed federal agents using indiscriminate violence against demonstrators,” Thomson said. “Numerous people suffered physical injuries, including people who required treatment at the hospital.”

ICE did not respond to a request for information on the arrests.

Representatives of the National Lawyers Guild attended Friday’s protest to offer legal support to demonstrators in need of representation.

The protest began about 6 a.m. and the crowd was quickly met with a strong show of force by ICE and officers with Customs and Border Patrol until the crowd dispersed about 10 p.m.

People gathered outside the facility to protest the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” and the treatment of detainees inside the facility.

A small group of protesters gathered outside the facility Saturday afternoon to continue showing their support for immigrants. As night fell, the crowd had grown to about 40 people, protesting under light rain.

There was little visible presence of ICE officers. As some officers went in and out of the facility, demonstrators jeered and shouted expletives at them. Some vehicles carried detainees.

Protesters who got too close to the facility’s gated parking lot were asked to step back by agents inside. Other protesters engaged with a counter-protester in front of the facility waving an American flag and chanting “USA.”

One woman, who asked not to be named out of the fear for her safety, showed up to the facility Saturday for her first time wanting to help after she witnessed ICE arrest a man Monday in Belmont Cragin.

She left the ICE detention facility later in the evening after having helped secure the release of a detainee.

Shortly after she arrived, she noticed a man on the phone with the family of his co-worker, who was detained inside. He was holding paperwork and struggling to gain ICE officers’ attention, hoping to show them the documentation proving his co-worker was a U.S. citizen.

The woman took the documentation and repeatedly pleaded with ICE officers each time they opened the facility’s gate to allow vehicles through. Eventually, she caught the attention of one officer who took the paperwork and gave the woman a number to call within a few hours.

Several hours later, she was informed that ICE was releasing the man based on the information provided, and he left the facility shortly thereafter with his co-worker.

Naval Station Great Lakes

Nearly 200 protesters also gathered Saturday near the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago, which is being used as a staging area for federal agents as the Trump administration ramps up immigration arrests and threatens to send the National Guard to the city. Demonstrators held signs reading “Welcome the stranger” and “ICE out” and speakers spoke on behalf of immigrants in the Chicago area and across the country.

Democrats are working to protect health care programs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — As a possible federal shutdown looms, the Democratic leaders of Congress are demanding a meeting with President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to what they call “your decision” to shutter government offices if no action is taken by the end-of-the month deadline.

Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Donald Trump's insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve health care programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

""We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,"" the two New York Democrats wrote.

“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they said. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.”

Trump, in an exchange with reporters on Saturday evening, suggested that he remains open to a potential meeting but was dismissive of the Democratic leadership.

“I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” he said.

Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.

The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted health care funds also failed.

It all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expires. Trump's first term in office saw a monthlong shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-2019.

Trump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in a closure.

Republicans have insisted they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, turning it back on Democrats.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.

While the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold that means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.

Democrats are working to protect health care programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax break and spending cut bill enacted earlier this year.

Republicans have said the Democrats' demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.

Another, set to take effect in January, bans local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed five bills Saturday designed to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies, a package of legislation he described as a defense of the state’s values of diversity and inclusion.

“There’s a word you’ve never heard uttered from the President of the United States’ lips, certainly not Stephen Miller,” Newsom said during the signing ceremony in downtown Los Angeles. “That’s pluralism. We practice pluralism. It’s a deep point of pride. Those values are under assault.”

According to Newsom’s office, the bills were drafted in response to federal immigration crackdowns launched after President Trump took office and were accelerated after the administration backed aggressive ICE operations.

Several of the new laws focus on public schools. One requires staff to notify students and parents when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are confirmed to be on campus. Another prohibits federal officers from entering a school without a judicial warrant and blocks schools from sharing students’ personal information.

Other measures extend protections beyond schools. One law requires federal agents, who may not be wearing official uniforms, to display some form of badge or identification. Another, set to take effect in January, bans local, state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the legislative package a necessary safeguard. “All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from our own federal government,” Bass said at the event.

Federal officials immediately pushed back. Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement that “the State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” adding, “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress. I’ve directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations. Our agents will continue to protect their identities.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, echoed that criticism, saying in a separate statement that “sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers.”

The political fight is not limited to Washington. The Save America movement announced Saturday that it is launching mobile “Liberty” vans staffed with trained professionals to document and film ICE raids across California.

Supporters of the legislation framed the measures as a reaffirmation of California’s role as a counterweight to federal policy. “Because America’s promise of opportunity, dignity and justice must not be surrendered to fear and hate,” said California State Assemblymember Fabian Nuñez.

Most of the new laws take effect immediately, except for the mask ban, which will begin in January.

Gavin Newsom signed a package of legislation today that would restrict the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration.

Newsom signed five bills at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, alongside LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, Mayor Karen Bass, County Supervisor Hilda Solis, Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance, state Sen. Lena Gonzalez, D-Long Beach, and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.

“We’re here in Los Angeles, the most diverse city in the most diverse state, California, in the world’s most diverse democracy. It is a point of pride. … At our best we don’t tolerate that diversity, at our best we celebrate that diversity,” Newsom said.

“…Our status is unique … it’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. And it’s under assault by this administration,” the governor continued.

“There’s a word that you’ve never heard uttered from the president of the United States’ lips, and certainly not (White House Deputy Chief of Staff) Stephen Miller, and that’s pluralism. We practice pluralism. It’s a deep point of pride. Those values are under assault, to a degree we could have never imagined.”

The bills include SB627, a ban on law enforcement agents wearing masks, SB805, a requirement that they visibly display identification, and a prohibition against bail fugitive recovery agents from using their position for immigration enforcement.

Two of the bills are specifically focused on public schools: SB98 requires K-12 schools and higher education institutions to notify parents, students and staff when immigration enforcement is confirmed on campus, and AB49 requires enforcement officers to obtain a valid judicial warrant and meet other requirements before entering a school or facility. It also prevents school officials from collecting immigration information and prohibits them from disclosing pupil or family information to immigration authorities without a warrant or court order.

Newsom also signed SB81, which restricts health-care facilities from sharing patient information or granting access to immigration enforcement.

Four of the bills go into effect immediately, while the masking law goes into effect in January.

“The fact that we need bills to protect people’s rights of privacy from information sharing, masking of federal agents — if they are federal agents — protecting kids so that they can come to school … all of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from our own federal government,” Bass said. “That is profound.”

“… But what I’m so proud of in our city is that and we have legislative resistance, we have resistance from local government and state government, and we have resistance on the streets,” the mayor added.

U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli pushed back on the mask ban.

“The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” he posted on X. “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress. I’ve directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations. Our agents will continue to protect their identities.”

Carvalho noted that the LAUSD has already taken steps to prepare for immigration enforcement affecting students, including sending students home with information packets with tips for dealing with questioning from federal agents and establishing “zones of protection” for safe passage to and from campuses.

“There are no sidewalks for immigrant children and sidewalks for everybody else. Everybody walks the same sidewalk of hope and opportunity to our school,” he said.

California Democrats have assailed the raids, which began in the Southland in June. They’ve accused agents of targeting people based on their race, and of detaining people without due process. They also say the raids have failed to live up to the administration’s promise to target those undocumented immigrants suspected of committing violent crimes.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security have released the alleged criminal histories of many of the detained immigrants.

And appearing on Friday night’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” in Los Angeles, White House border czar Tom Homan said even those in the United States illegally who don’t commit other crimes create a backlog in the immigration system, delaying the process for thousands who are waiting their turn to come here legally.

“Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” Homan said. “If you send a message that there’s no consequences and you want to reward illegal behavior, (it’s) not going to stop.”

“… If you want to be a part of the greatest nation on Earth, there’s a right way and a wrong way to do it,” he continued. “The ones who are here illegally cheated the system. They moved themselves to the front of the line and they overwhelmed the immigration court system back nine, 10 years, which means that people who are really trying to come here the right way are sitting in the back of the bus.”

Asked for a comment on Saturday’s signing ceremony, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson sent the following reply to City News Service:

“Did Newscum explain why he issued a threat to (Homeland Security) Secretary Noem on the same weekend of Charlie Kirk’s funeral, who was just assassinated in a disgusting act of political violence? Was that post from Newscum or the deranged leftists running his account?”

A post issued on the X account of Newsom’s press office a few hours before Saturday’s ceremony read: “Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today. You’re welcome, America.”

That post drew the following response from Essayli:

“We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials. I’ve referred this matter to @SecretService and requested a full threat assessment.”

In response, Newsom’s office reposted that statement from Essayli alongside the following tweet from Trump posted on March 10, 2020, during that year’s Democratic presidential primaries: “Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!”",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/56bf5c94ec0b0a180596d9dee106369c-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 08:56:45.316396

Alarms are flashing on Capitol Hill after the Senate rejected a seven-week continuing resolution (CR) that passed the House on a largely party-line vote, leaving leaders on both sides of the aisle at a stalemate over how to avoid a shutdown.

“We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,” the Democratic leaders wrote in the letter.

Schumer and Jeffries pointedly criticized Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for adjourning the House and Senate for a week despite the failure to reach a funding deal.

“At your direction, Republican congressional leaders have repeatedly and publicly refused to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government open,” the lawmakers continued. “Notwithstanding the fact that the partisan Republican spending bill has been defeated, the GOP majorities in the House and Senate have skipped town abdicated their responsibility to fund the government.”

The Democratic leaders have demanded that Republicans address the expiration of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies before the end of October and to restore nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding that was cut under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.

“We will not support a dirty spending bill that continues the Republican assault on healthcare, which includes devastating Medicaid and Medicare cuts; skyrocketing premiums, co-pays, and deductibles; the refusal to extend the Affordable Crae Act tax credits; unprecedented attacks on medical research and the public health system; the suppression of vaccine availability; and the forced closure of hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health clinics nationwide,” they wrote.

The massive tax and spending bill did not make significant cuts to Medicare benefits, but Democrats argue the law will affect Medicare’s long-term solvency because it added an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt, putting more pressure on the federal government’s ability to pay out future benefits.

The law also narrows who is eligible for Medicare enrollment, limiting the criteria to include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants but excluding other lawfully present immigrants.

Schumer and Jeffries said Republicans would bear responsibility for a shutdown because they have refused to negotiate with Democrats.

“With the Sept. 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,” the added in the letter to Trump.

They argued that the president now has an “obligation to meet with us directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open.”

Trump on Friday sounded pessimistic about keeping the government open without interruption and suggested the Democratic demands are excessive.

“We’ll continue to talk to the Democrats, but I think you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time,” he told reporters. “And we’ll take care of the military. We’ll take care of Social Security. We’ll take care of the things we have to take care of.

“A lot of the things Democrats fight for … will not be able to be paid,” the president added. “So, we’ll watch and see how we do with that.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/schumerchuck_jeffrieshakeem_072225gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-21 05:57:26.707099

The White House response The government denies an increase in the use of isolation for migrants detained by ICE.
ICE’s National Detention Standards state that “such isolation may be ordered for security reasons or for the orderly operation of the facility.”","The use of isolation in detention centers is on the rise under the second Trump administration. According to a report published by the nonprofit organization Physicians for Human Rights, thousands of immigrants have been placed in solitary confinement since the Biden administration took office in 2021, and in recent months the practice has multiplied, despite the risks to the mental health of detainees. It was also found that during the first three months of 2025, vulnerable individuals were held in isolation for periods of more than twice as long as when ICE first began publishing statistics: 38 consecutive days in early 2025 compared to 14 days in late 2021. The agency defines as “vulnerable” those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or elderly; who suffer from serious mental disorders or illnesses; who are at risk of harm due to their identity; or who are victims of sexual assault or abuse.

Solitary confinement is the practice of placing a person in a small cell without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day. ICE maintains that it does not use solitary confinement in its detention centers, but reports the number of people it keeps in “segregation.”

In detention centers, the agency avoids using the term “solitary confinement” and instead uses euphemisms such as “segregation,” “segregated housing,” or “Special Management Units.” The study says that immigrants locked in such cells had been placed in “administrative segregation.”

According to the report, in 14 months from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention centers across the country. Similarly, in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the monthly increase in the use of isolation was more than six times higher than at the end of the previous administration.

The report also cites a study that found that solitary confinement in immigration detention has grown at an “alarming rate,” with an unprecedented number of immigrants being held in isolation. It also suggests that, due to the recent increase in funding approved by Congress to expand immigration detention centers, the widespread and prolonged use of solitary confinement is likely to worsen.

The UN considers solitary confinement of 15 days or more to be torture. Dr. Katherine Peeler, co-author of the study, said in a statement: “During the final months of the Biden administration and amid the Trump administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants, ICE’s own records show that the agency has subjected people to these torturous conditions — which cause devastating physical and psychological health harms.” According to experts, prolonged isolation can cause paranoia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression, all of which can lead to suicide.

The White House response

The government denies an increase in the use of isolation for migrants detained by ICE. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told McClatchy News in an email that ICE facilities have “the highest standards.” “They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.” Deputy Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, wrote the same media outlet that “any allegation that ICE is ‘weaponizing’ solitary confinement against illegal aliens is DISGUSTING and FALSE.” “These types of smears peddled by the media are leading to a 1000 percent increase in assault against our brave law enforcement,” she said without offering evidence. “Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,” she added.

In another statement, McLaughlin assured that ICE prioritizes the safety of individuals in custody and that detainees are placed in disciplinary segregation ”only after they are found guilty by a disciplinary hearing panel.” She also said that any detainee scheduled for removal, release, or transfer will be placed in administrative isolation for 24 hours. ICE’s National Detention Standards state that “such isolation may be ordered for security reasons or for the orderly operation of the facility.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/R2OSMFU7VFAD3JF3ZCUP425YEI.jpg?auth=8449241a4ddde276b0d78227a414ed5967e99b0b6d89068d1e279279829c3c37&width=1200,N,,2025-09-21 02:56:52.350643

A total of 179 people face charges of illegal entry, while another 154 individuals face charges of felony reentry after removal. Most have felony convictions for narcotics, violent crime, immigration crimes and more. An additional 21 people have been charged with human smuggling, while the remaining six have been charged with firearms offenses, assaults on federal officers and other immigration crimes.

One of those charged is Penitas resident Diego Masiel Torres, who allegedly impeded federal law enforcement during an Aug. 27 consensual worksite enforcement operation in Harlingen. Court documents allege Torres tried to pull an officer away from apprehending an illegal alien. If convicted, he faces up to eight years in federal prison.

“The Southern District of Texas is committed to fully enforcing our country’s immigration laws, and anyone who tries to stop a federal agent from carrying out this mission will be held accountable before a judge and jury,” said Ganjei. “So, the message is simple. Don’t end up on the wrong end of a federal indictment – keep your hands to yourself.”

Among those charged this week are Gonzalo Alvarado-Cortez and Enedino Nieves-Tomas, both Mexican nationals. According to court documents, authorities discovered Alvarado-Cortez near Edinburg after his March 2019 removal and Nieves-Tomas near Roma after his October 2023 removal. Both men have prior convictions for illegal reentry and face up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.

Charges also allege Jose Manuel Lopez-Hernandez and Marcos Joel Castro-Lopez, both Mexican nationals, were found near Alamo after removals in July 2024 and February 2012, respectively. Lopez-Hernandez has a prior conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, while Castro-Lopez has a prior conviction for aggravated sexual assault, according to court documents.

In Houston, Mexican national Manuel Albert Aragon-Hernandez, 39, was sentenced to 44 months in federal prison for illegally reentering the country. Aragon-Hernandez, who has multiple prior felony convictions including theft and drug possession, was first removed in 2010 and returned illegally three times. Authorities discovered him again during a traffic stop for speeding and found methamphetamine and marijuana in his vehicle. At sentencing, the court also heard evidence that he fired a weapon while intoxicated.

Also sentenced this week was Mexican national Fidel Ramirez-Mancilla, 39, who received 15 months for illegal reentry. He has a prior conviction for aggravated felony of assault with the intent to commit mayhem, rape, sodomy or oral copulation. He was removed from the United States in 2011, but authorities encountered him again May 19.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – Homeland Security Investigations, ICE – Enforcement and Removal Operations, Border Patrol, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces and Project Safe Neighborhood.

,Litigation,2025-09-21 02:21:04+00:00,Raw Story,This shocking ruling put the racism of Trump's Supreme Court on public display - Raw Story,"Bill Blum, Common Dreams, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.rawstory.com/supreme-court-2674010499/,"Like most shadow docket rulings, the Perdomo order is bare-bones, comprising a single paragraph that fails to explain the court’s rationale for its decision.
According to Georgetown University law professor and shadow docket scholar Steve Vladeck, the first Trump administration sought emergency relief 41 times.
During its recently completed 2024-25 term, the court’s shadow docket exploded to more than 100 cases, fueled by the second Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab.
Not surprisingly given those extraordinary numbers, US immigration officers have prioritized immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area.
Far from being polite and respectful, Sotomayor continued, Operation At Large has sparked “panic and fear” across Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.","In what may be its most reactionary ruling since Plessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court decided on Sept. 8 to allow the Trump administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to resume overt racial profiling in immigration raids in Los Angeles. The raids, which began in June under the title of Operation At Large, have resulted in some 5,000 arrests.

The order was handed down in the case of Noem v. Perdomo on the court’s emergency, or “shadow,” docket, which consists of cases decided on an expedited basis — without comprehensive briefing and without oral arguments — outside of the normal “merits docket.” The order lifts a lower-court injunction that had barred the administration from detaining suspected undocumented immigrants based solely on their ethnicity, language, geographic location, and occupations.

Like most shadow docket rulings, the Perdomo order is bare-bones, comprising a single paragraph that fails to explain the court’s rationale for its decision. Nonetheless, it sends a clear message: If you are Latino, you’d better start carrying your identification papers with you — and they had better be in order. Otherwise, you will be subject to detention, and you might just find yourself on a deportation flight to El Salvador, South Sudan, or Uganda.

The Perdomo litigation originated with a lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of immigration advocacy organizations and five individuals, including two US citizens who contend they were detained by ICE during Operation At Large in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

On July 11, Los Angeles District Court Judge Maame E. Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order against the administration, finding that a “mountain of evidence” supported the plaintiffs’ claims that “roving patrols” of masked federal agents were conducting indiscriminate and sometimes violent dragnet-style immigration raids of workplaces and communities.

The court’s quick overturning of Frimpong’s TRO comes as no surprise. Although the court has a long history of entertaining emergency appeals that bypass the normal appeals process — such as last-minute requests for stays of execution in death penalty cases — no president has relied on the shadow docket more than Donald Trump.

According to Georgetown University law professor and shadow docket scholar Steve Vladeck, the first Trump administration sought emergency relief 41 times. By comparison, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations filed a combined total of eight emergency relief requests over a 16-year period while the Biden administration filed 19 applications across four years.

During its recently completed 2024-25 term, the court’s shadow docket exploded to more than 100 cases, fueled by the second Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab.

In addition to Perdomo, the court has issued pro-Trump shadow docket orders permitting noncitizens to be deported to third-party countries with histories of egregious human rights violations; barring transgender people from serving in the military; withholding $65 million in teacher training grants to states that include diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in their operations and curriculums; and endorsing the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to Social Security Administration records, to cite just a few instances.

And while shadow docket decisions are technically “interim” in nature — operating to remand cases to the lower courts for additional proceedings and leaving space for a possible return to the Supreme Court — they have enduring practical consequences. Unless and until the Supreme Court takes up the Perdomo case again, ICE will be free to ramp up its roving masked raids in Los Angeles and other cities like Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. There are no longer any safe zones.

Of the high court’s six Republican ideologues, only Brett Kavanaugh explained his reasoning in Perdomo.

In a poorly crafted opinion filled with misstatements of fact and law, Kavanaugh cited provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act and a 1975 Supreme Court case (United States v. Brignoni-Ponce) that authorize immigration agents to briefly detain and question individuals if they have a “reasonable suspicion” (less than probable cause but more than a hunch) that the person being questioned is an alien illegally in the country.

From there, however, Kavanaugh dropped the proverbial ball by remarking, without any citations to the trial court’s evidentiary record:

The Government estimates that at least 15 million people are in the United States illegally. Many millions illegally entered (or illegally overstayed) just in the last few years.

Illegal immigration is especially pronounced in the Los Angeles area, among other locales in the United States. About 10% of the people in the Los Angeles region are illegally in the United States — meaning about 2 million illegal immigrants out of a total population of 20 million.

Not surprisingly given those extraordinary numbers, US immigration officers have prioritized immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a US citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.

Given what he took for granted as the outsized illegal alien population in greater Los Angeles, Kavanaugh reasoned that it is “common sense” (his words, trust me) for ICE agents to detain any Latinos who fit the government’s criteria of suspicion based on their race, language, or employment in low wage jobs.

In a blistering 21-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by fellow Democrats Elena Kaga and Ketanji Brown Jackson, took Kavanaugh to school, instructing the former Yale frat boy that the reasonable suspicion standard requires:

“… an individualized suspicion that a particular citizen was engaged in a particular crime” beyond just a “demographic profile...”

The Fourth Amendment thus prohibits exactly what the Government is attempting to do here: seize individuals based solely on a set of facts that ‘describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent’ people… As the District Court correctly held, the four factors [the administration relies on] — apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, location, and type of work — are no more indicative of illegal presence in the country than of legal presence.

Sotomayor also educated Kavanaugh on the harsh on-the-ground realities of Operation At Large, noting several examples from the trial court record of violence and intimidation. In the LA suburb of Glendale, for instance:

…nearly a dozen masked agents with guns “jumped out of… cars” at a Home Depot, and began “chasing and tackl[ing] Latino day laborers without “identify[ing] themselves as ICE or police, ask[ing] questions, or say[ing] anything else… In downtown Los Angeles, agents “jumped out of a van, rushed up to [a tamale vendor], surrounded him, and handled him violently,” all “[w]ithout asking… any questions.

In still another Home Depot encounter drawn from the evidentiary record, masked agents wearing bulletproof vests got out of a car and tear-gassed a crowd that had gathered to witness a raid. Far from being polite and respectful, Sotomayor continued, Operation At Large has sparked “panic and fear” across Los Angeles and its surrounding areas.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area,” she observed, “have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

The Fourth Amendment, she reminded her Republican colleagues, “protects every individual’s constitutional right to be free from arbitrary interference by law officers.” Sadly, she concluded, after the Perdomo ruling, “that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little.”

As a Supreme Court justice constrained by the need for collegiality on the bench, Sotomayor stopped short of denouncing Kavanaugh and the court’s Republicans as enablers of racism.

“ICE will engage with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures against you,” Lyons wrote in his follow-up letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Rob Bonta received similar warnings, the outlet reported.

Raoul initially responded to Lyons on Sept. 12, arguing that the federal government lacks the legal authority to demand state or local law enforcement to adhere to ICE detainers.

“Responding to an ICE detainer based on erroneous information could subject Illinois law enforcement agencies to liability for ICE’s mistakes,” Raoul’s letter read, the outlet reported.

“And unfortunately, the number of erroneous detentions by ICE continues to grow at an alarming pace.”

ICE has conducted large-scale enforcement operations in several major US cities, including the Big Apple, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as part of President Trump’s directive on illegal immigration.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday ripped each state’s defiance, warning that releasing murderers, rapists, and pedophiles onto the streets will put residents in danger.

“These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities – threatening the American people’s lives and wellbeing,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

“ICE detainers ask for something very simple: To notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are released from jail or prison, to ensure that they go into ICE custody before they are released back onto our streets.

“These sanctuary state politicians should do the right thing and side with law-abiding Americans over criminal illegal aliens.”

Demonstrators took their protest to the streets as local faith leaders, community groups and regular people demonstrated against increased immigration enforcement. Their target was Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, the base of operations for ICE agents.

""That we will not be silent, not only will we not be silent, we will not back down,"" said Rev. Dr. Beth Johnson with Unitarian Church of Hinsdale, Illinois.

The Saturday afternoon prayer march began with clergy gathering for a interfaith action nearby in North Chicago. The group is demanding President Donald Trump's federal immigration agents leave Illinois.

""It is horrific... not only that we are not only allowing these sorts of organizations to come into our communities and to take route in places like this, it is a indication of how this has seeped into the culture itself,"" said Rev. Will Esty with North Shore Unitarian Church.

Inspired by the biblical story about how the walls of a heavily-fortified city Jericho came tumbling down through God's intervention, marchers encircled the entrance to the military base seven times, hoping to bring an end to what they call a campaign of fear mongering and the terrorizing of immigrant communities.

""The biggest lawbreaker here in the country right now is ICE in the Border Patrol, we give them impunity,"" said Pastor Craig Mousin with Wellington United Church in Christ.

What To Know The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.

The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant the administration's emergency request to strip protections from Venezuelan migrants.","President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Venezuela on Saturday via Truth Social, demanding the country ""immediately accept"" what he described as prisoners and individuals from mental institutions who were allegedly sent to the United States.

Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Saturday for comment.

Why It Matters

This coordinated approach represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy.

Concurrently, the administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday for an emergency order to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants currently under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

The Justice Department's filing seeks to overturn a federal judge's ruling that blocked the administration's termination of these protections.

The outcome could determine the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans currently living in the U.S., while potentially establishing precedent for how the administration handles protected immigrant populations from other countries. The administration has already moved to end TPS protections for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who received protection during former President Joe Biden's administration.

What To Know

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that found the administration wrongly ended TPS for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold Chen's ruling while the case continues. In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary in 18-month increments. Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela's TPS"" status.

Trump's latest Truth Social post claimed that ""thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed"" by individuals he characterized as coming from Venezuelan prisons and mental institutions.

The president's post provided no specific evidence or data to support these claims about harm caused by Venezuelan migrants in the U.S.

However, states like Texas and Georgia have recently begun sharing data on illegal immigrant crime in their regions, showing non-citizens are committing crimes at a lower rate than their American-born counterparts.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump on Truth Social: ""We want Venezuela to immediately accept all of the prisoners, and people from mental institutions, which includes the Worst in the World Insane Asylums, that Venezuelan 'Leadership' has forced into the United States of America. Thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed, by these 'Monsters.' GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT NOW, OR THE PRICE YOU PAY WILL BE INCALCULABLE!""

Adelys Ferro, co-founder and executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told Newsweek on August 29: ""We, more than 8 million Venezuelans, just didn't leave the country just because it's fun, it's because we had no choice...Venezuelans with TPS are not a threat to the United States.""

What Happens Next?

The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant the administration's emergency request to strip protections from Venezuelan migrants.

Venezuelan leadership has yet to respond to Trump's demands.

A federal court temporarily blocked Noem’s decision on the basis that it may have been racially biased and likely violated the law.","Trump administration officials asked the United States Supreme Court to pause federal Judge Edward Chen’s order stating that it broke the law by taking away temporary protections for Venezuelan immigrants. Chen, earlier this month, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not follow the law when she ended the immigrants’ Temporary Protected Status, calling the move “arbitrary and capricious.”

The Washington Post reported that the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to put a hold on a part of the order about Venezuelans as federal officials appeal the case. The administration said this would affect more than 300,000 people. While the case also touches on Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, that is going to expire within months so the DOJ did not ask about that section of the order.

In Chen’s ruling, he mentioned a May Supreme Court order that allowed federal officials to eliminate the temporary protections for the Venezuelans, the Post said. Chen wrote that order only concerned the “preliminary relief ordered by this Court in postponing agency action,” and that did not stop him from “from adjudicating the case on the merits.”

The Justice Department, meanwhile, argued in its petition to the Supreme Court Friday that Chen’s actions are an “example of the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

“So long as the district court’s order is in effect, the Secretary must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest,’” the Justice Department wrote.

What is Temporary Protected Status?

Temporary Protected Status is a program meant to assist those who come from countries deemed to be in crisis. The Homeland Security Secretary can designate a place for TPS over “conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country’s nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately.”

After she became part of the Trump administration in January, Noem attempted to remove TPS protections for Venezuelans and Haitians, which were put in place by former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who served under the Biden administration.

A group called the National TPS Alliance and 11 individuals sued the federal government.

“We are a majority-minority state, California.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Saturday signed a first of its kind bill banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing masks while conducting operations in the state of California.

Newsom said ICE agents would no longer be “hidden from accountability” arguing masks prevent “transparency” for citizens and hinder “oversight.”

“That’s Trump’s America but that’s not the America we’ve grown up in. And so we are pushing back,” the governor said during remarks at a local high school.

Newsom said many residents are living in fear as the Trump administration cracks down on communities of illegal immigrants. Twenty-seven percent of Californians are foreign-born.

An increased presence of federal immigration officers has ramped up in the city of Los Angeles where protests broke out against the Trump administration’s deportation policies earlier this year.

Hundreds of National Guard soldiers and Marines were deployed to the city in an effort to quell the explosive outbreak of demonstrations without Newsom’s approval.

Local residents caught in the crossfire of dueling leaders both in the state and from the White House in Washington.

After days of outrage over a series of sweeping ICE raids, authorities confirmed one individual died during a chaotic raid on a California farm.

The Department of Homeland Security said 5,000 illegal immigrants in Los Angeles were arrested from June to August.

“ LA rioters would not stop DHS or slow us down. Our law enforcement will continue to enforce the law,” Department of Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem said in a statement on the large number of arrests.

“And anyone who lays a hand on a law enforcement officer, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she continued.

Newsom said Saturday said the Trump administration’s immigration measures need to change to reflect the country’s ideals.

“We are a majority-minority state, California. At our best, we don’t tolerate that diversity. At our best, we celebrate that diversity. We’re a universal state…” the governor said.

“Our status is unique in the United States of America. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. And it’s under assault by this administration.”

Newsom’s office also took aim at Noem in its announcing of the legislation, which drew a backlash from the administration.

The ACLU asked US Magistrate Judge Benjamin Cheesbro for the emergency 4 p.m. hearing and a temporary restraining order after the Board of Immigration Appeals earlier on Friday reopened Guevara’s 13-year old removal case – improperly, the ACLU contends — so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can deport him to El Salvador.

The ACLU called on the judge to order Guevara’s release from ICE detention and ensure he is not deported. Magistrate Judge Benjamin Cheesbro has given ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and Attorney General Pam Bondi until Oct. 3 to respond to Guevara’s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order.

“Mr. Guevara should not even be in immigration detention, but the government has kept him there for months because of his crucial reporting on law enforcement activity,” said one of his lawyers, ACLU senior staff attorney Scarlet Kim in a statement.

“The fact that he may now be put on a plane to El Salvador, a country he fled out of fear, at any moment, despite a clear path to becoming a permanent resident is despicable,” Kim added.

Guevara has been jailed at the Folkston ICE Processing Center since June 18, even though the Salvadoran national is authorized to work in the United States while his green card application is pending.

The emergency hearing was for the habeas petition that Guevara filed on Aug. 21 challenging his ongoing detention. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Georgia, accuses ICE of retaliatory detention to silence his reporting, violating his First Amendment rights. It demands his immediate release.

Guevara ended up in ICE custody on June 18, after Dekalb County police arrested him June 14 while livestreaming a “No Kings” protest for his Spanish-language news outlet MG News. Dekalb later dropped the misdemeanor obstruction charges. Even so, the DeKalb Sheriff’s Office handed him over to ICE.

A federal immigration judge granted Guevara bond on July 1, but the Department of Homeland Security appealed.

Board of Immigration Appeals reopens old case

In a surprise development, the Board of Immigration Appeals on Friday dismissed DHS’s appeal of the bond order, saying it was moot because the appeals board had just granted the government’s motion to reopen his removal case from over a decade ago.

According to the Sept. 20 ruling, authored by Appellate Immigration Judge Marcos Gemoets, there is an outstanding removal order against Guevara from the 2012 case, because an immigration judge at that time had ordered Guevara to be deported and the Board of Immigration Appeals had dismissed his appeal.

However, the ACLU says Gemoets’ ruling incorrectly misstates that an immigration judge ordered Guevara’s deportation in 2012. Rather, the judge granted Guevara voluntary departure – and the government subsequently administratively closed the removal case. Since then, it has allowed him to live and work in the United States for over a decade, while his green card application is pending.

The Board of Immigration Appeals also denied Guevara’s demand to send the reopened removal proceeding back to the immigration judge to decide his green card application. He is eligible for a green card through his son, a US citizen, according to the ACLU.",https://atlantaciviccircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1906.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 20:56:57.826070

The department said it is putting all three states on notice because the states have not cooperated with the requests, when ICE asked local jails and prisons to alert the agency if they are releasing an undocumented individuals so they can take them into custody.

DHS said detainer compliance is necessary to prevent undocumented criminals from re-entering communities.

CBS News Chicago obtained a letter sent by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to DHS, which said the federal government does not have the legal authority to force state or local law enforcement to comply with such detainer requests.

Senior Homeland Security officials told CBS News they will tap the Department of Justice to sue states and attempt to block federal funding.

""Based on our current Supreme Court precedent, the state of Illinois stands on a strong footing,"" Arthur Acevedo said.

Acevedo is with the University of Illinois-Chicago Law School, and said the Constitution's 10th Amendment protects Illinois' policies like the Trust Act, which prohibits local cooperation on things like ICE detainers.

""It cannot order state officials or state officers to pursue or enact a federal program. So basically, whenever the federal government wants to do something, they need to put in their own staff,"" Acevedo said.

When it comes to the threat of blocking federal funding, Acevedo said the Trump Administration is facing an uphill battle. While he said legal precedent may favor states like Illinois in preventing federal funding from being cut, he expects the administration to test the limits of its power.

""The Trump administration has been successful in the eight months that they've been in office in getting the Supreme Court to at least to agree with them on an emergency basis.

Federal agents in April tried to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools, saying they wanted to conduct welfare checks on students they said were undocumented.
Another bill bars immigration agents from entering hospitals without a warrant.","Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed legislation on Saturday that would prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state, a direct response to President Trump’s deportation crackdown in the Los Angeles region.

The new law is believed to be the first such ban in the nation, though it is likely to be challenged in court before it can go into effect in January because it is unclear whether California can enforce such restrictions on federal law enforcement. The bill also applies to local law enforcement.

In recent months, videos have spread across social media showing masked and armed immigration agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California, drawing protests and criticism in the state.

Democratic leaders and immigration activists have suggested that agents have acted with impunity, knowing that their identities were cloaked and that it would be harder to hold them accountable.

“The impact of these policies all across this city, our state and nation are terrifying. It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie — unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,” Mr. Newsom said at a signing event on Saturday afternoon at a Los Angeles high school. “This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we’ve allowed to happen in this country.”

It is extremely rare for police officers to wear masks in democratic nations. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began wearing balaclavas and neck gaiters this year, in what might have been the first example of American law enforcement officers wearing masks.

Before this year, state and local leaders had been passing more laws moving in the direction of greater transparency, such as requiring officers to wear body cameras at all times to record footage that could be used in court and seen by the public.

But this week, Department of Homeland Security officials urged Mr. Newsom to veto the bill, which they said would increase harassment and assaults on officers.

“Comparing them to ‘secret police’ — likening them to the Gestapo — is despicable,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. “Once again, sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers.”

California’s law was opposed by numerous law enforcement agencies, who argued that officers must have the choice to cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retaliation. Limiting the ways officers can keep themselves safe will make it harder to recruit people to work in law enforcement, they said.

But a number of Democratic-led states have proposed restricting masking by immigration agents. Lawmakers have introduced such bills in New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, among other states, though California is believed to be the only state where such a law has been passed and signed.

California’s measure would bar law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, such as ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters, that shield their identities. It does not apply to medical masks, clear plastic face shields, respirators, eye protection or other safety devices.

Any violation of the law would be a misdemeanor.

Legal experts agreed that California can require local officers to unmask on the job. But it’s a trickier question when it comes to federal agents operating in the state.

A state can’t directly regulate the federal government, but it can require that federal agents follow general state laws, such as requiring officers to follow speed limits or abide by stop signs, as long as doing so does not interfere with their ability to do their job.

Aya Gruber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California, said that the mask law was likely to be immediately challenged along jurisdictional lines, and that the federal government would most likely seek an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect.

“It will definitely be challenged — 100 percent,” Ms. Gruber said, adding that she expected it to eventually be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. “I don’t foresee this particular iteration of the Supreme Court taking the state’s side on this one, so this may be more of a symbolic piece of legislation.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, wrote a letter last week that urged Mr. Newsom to sign the legislation, which Mr. Chemerinsky said he believed was constitutional because it does not limit the federal government’s authority to perform its duties. Mr. Chemerinsky, a well-known constitutional scholar, said that even if a federal challenge was forthcoming, the state needed to make a forceful declaration against what he said was a practice intended to “terrorize” people.

“It’s important that the state take a stand,” Mr. Chemerinsky said in an interview. “It’s obviously not a slam dunk because there are arguments on both sides, but that’s often the case with the law.”

Brian R. Marvel, the president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, which represents over 87,000 public safety officers, said he was outraged by the passage of the law.

He said in a statement that he believed that California did not have the authority to regulate federal agents, so it would ultimately apply only to local law enforcement officers, which he called a “troubling betrayal that California’s local law enforcement community will not soon forget.” He said that limiting face coverings and opening officers up to prosecution would most likely hurt recruitment and drive officers from the state.

“This bill makes local officers collateral damage. It is a political stunt by all parties involved, plain and simple,” he said. “This bill will have a chilling effect on our profession.”

Mr. Newsom on Saturday signed four other bills aimed at restricting ICE activity in California.

One bill prevents immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant. Another requires schools and higher education institutions to notify parents when immigration enforcement is on campus.

Federal agents in April tried to enter two Los Angeles elementary schools, saying they wanted to conduct welfare checks on students they said were undocumented. The Los Angeles Unified School District did not allow the agents to enter, and school officials were outraged that students could be vulnerable to raids.

Another bill bars immigration agents from entering hospitals without a warrant. Undocumented immigrants are allowed to receive emergency care at hospitals under federal law, and California leaders fear that the threat of enforcement may deter people from seeking medical attention.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/20/multimedia/20nat-ice-bills-hfo-vpgf/20nat-ice-bills-hfo-vpgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 18:57:11.326355

THE United States, a country regarded by countless people as the “land of dreams”, has long prided itself on the ideals of freedom and equality.

However, the reality is far more complex and brutal than these slogans.

This self-proclaimed “nation of immigrants” with “E Pluribus Unum” inscribed on its national emblem is showing an unfriendly attitude towards immigrants.

Xenophobic sentiment at government and social levels, and deep-rooted racial discrimination, are constantly tearing apart the so-called “myth of American human rights”.

In 2022, Irina Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian woman, fled the war and travelled to the US in search of peace and safety.

However, last month, she was fatally stabbed three times in the back by an unknown homeless man in North Carolina.

Surveillance footage showed Irina clutching her throat in horror and crying for help from the surrounding passengers, but no one came to her aid.

The incident sent shocking waves to Ukraine and once again put the safety issue of American society in the spotlight.

A refugee who fled the war ultimately died from random violence in a peaceful country, which is undoubtedly a great irony.

Many political leaders have lobbied for the death penalty for the murderer on social media.

However, the deep-seated problems behind this incident cannot be solved simply by severely punishing the murderer.

It exposes the fragility of public safety in the US, the spread of social indifference and the disregard for the value of immigrants’ lives.

When a country cannot guarantee the basic safety of a young woman seeking asylum, it is difficult for it to be regarded as a defender of human rights.

When social indifference becomes the norm and fear replaces empathy, the so-called “American Dream” becomes a carefully packaged illusion.

In recent years, US government policies towards immigrants have far exceeded the scope of what it has termed “strict management” and have evolved into systematic and institutionalised exclusion and punishment.

The zero-tolerance policy implemented by the US has led to the separation of a large number of immigrant families, becoming a humanitarian disaster widely condemned by the international community.

According to a United Nations report, the US is the country that detains the largest number of immigrant children in the world.

In 2019 alone, more than 5 500 children were forcibly separated from their parents and detained at centres with poor conditions.

These children lacked basic food, medical and hygiene guarantees, and their physical and mental health was reported to have been severely damaged.

Shockingly, the US is the only UN member state in the world that is not a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which also gives insights into its position on human rights protection.

Additionally, since January, the deportation of immigrants has not slowed down but has accelerated.

Thousands have been forcibly repatriated.

Many immigrants have been arrested, shackled and exposed to inhumane treatment.

Recently, over 450 South Korean immigrants experienced this before their deportation.

The inhumane law-enforcement approach not only violates the basic human rights of immigrants but tells the story of a government which regards immigrants as “threats” rather than “human beings”.

Xenophobic sentiment in American society not only exists at the policy level but is also now deeply rooted in public consciousness.

This sentiment is manifesting itself in the form of racism, with frequent discrimination and violent incidents targeting ethnic minorities such as Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans.

In recent years, hate crimes against Asians have increased sharply.

From the 91-year-old Asian man being maliciously pushed down in Chinatown to the killing of six Asian women in the Atlanta spa shootings in 2021.

Such incidents reveal the systemic hostility American society is cultivating towards ethnic minorities.

The hatred is not accidental, but the result of long-term racial prejudice and political incitement.

However, xenophobia is not alien in the US.

Since the first group of African slaves were brought to Virginia in 1619, the US has systematically implemented a system of racial slavery for more than two centuries.

Millions of people were traded as commodities and driven like livestock.

Their flesh, blood and lives laid the foundation for the country’s early economy, yet received no humane treatment.

From the Chinese Exclusion Act in the 19th century to the immigration quota system in the 20th century, the exclusion of “the other” can be traced as part of American politics and society.

In 2017, the first Donald Trump administration signed what became known as the “Muslim Ban”. The ban prohibited citizens from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US and even suspended the refugee resettlement program.

From slums of Lagos, Nigeria, refugee camps of Nairobi, Kenya, and in the villages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where war is yet to end, many young people once regarded the US as a land of hope to escape poverty and war.

Many have grown up listening to the propaganda of the “free world” and have dreamt setting foot on that land one day to create a new life with their own hands.

However, when Irina’s tragedy was reported globally, many Africans fell silent: if a white, educated woman from a European war-torn area could not be guaranteed safety, what would they, with darker skin, encounter there?

These foreign populations engage in high-intensity, low-security jobs in construction, agriculture and the service industry.

They pay taxes but find it difficult to enjoy the same social welfare.

They become political bargaining chips in politicians’ campaigns and victims of policy swings. When there is a labour shortage, they are “indispensable contributors”; when there is an economic crisis, they become “burdens to be deported”.

From family separations at the border to hate crimes in cities, from law-enforcement violence to political exclusion, and then to tragedies like Irina’s, immigrants and ethnic minorities in the US will always struggle to obtain real safety and dignity.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Trump’s insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve healthcare programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

The New York Democrats’ remarks come after the House passed a spending bill Friday to avoid a shutdown but the Senate remained stalemated.

“We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,” Schumer and Jeffries wrote.

“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they continued. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.”

A Trump administration official, who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, was dismissive of the Democrats’ demand.

Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.

The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted healthcare funds also failed.

It all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expire. Trump’s first term in office saw a monthlong shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-19.

Trump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in the event of a closure.

Republicans have contended that they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, blaming Democrats.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.

While the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold, which means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.

Democrats are working to protect healthcare programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ massive spending and tax cut bill enacted in July.

Republicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/430b99d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5782x3036+0+409/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2F39%2Fd895863c41d1833b5012578accce%2F145ea5f4be654b7c8bfbaaab2068aaad.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 17:56:51.820906

MADRID — If I were an immigrant (and no one is safe from becoming one; no one is immune to ruin, crisis, dictatorship; no one is safe from having to pack their bags and start their life over in the middle of nowhere), I think condescending charity would offend me almost as much as racism and xenophobia.

With a racist at least you know where you stand, but those who defend immigration with the argument that they help fund their pensions or will wipe their asses when they are old are convinced they are being kind and understanding. It is much more difficult to point out to them their egotistical arrogance, classism, and enslaving conformity than it is to denounce racists — who can be dismissed with no more than a couple of insults and a healthy dose of contempt.

The idea that immigrants are necessary because they do our dirty work is so widespread, and expressed with such gusto, that it needs to be carefully dissected to reveal its profoundly discriminatory and violent nature. Let’s try.

Immigrants fleeing poverty and arriving in wealthy societies are employed in the hardest, dirtiest, most degrading, and most undesirable jobs. It is an injustice they endure, like so many others. No one crosses an ocean out of a calling for servitude. No one is born with the dream of scrubbing toilets.

They resign themselves to it, bearing the hardship in the hope that it will be temporary. They console themselves with thoughts of what they are saving, the education their children might receive so they won’t have to clean toilets, or the bullets and hunger they are avoiding while scrubbing with a scouring pad. But that is not their mission. No immigrant thinks: how lucky I am to compensate for the falling birth rate and the overproduction of graduates in these rich societies that lack the human resources to polish the toilet bowl. They simply imagine ways to stop scrubbing aforementioned bowl, or to prevent their children from having to scrub it when they grow up.

It is like defending slavery by pointing to the pyramids.

Just like millions of Spaniards did when they had to scrub toilets in Munich, Zurich, Paris, Buenos Aires, and Havana.

Defending immigrants by talking about pension funds or the shortage of construction workers is like defending slavery by pointing to the pyramids. “We need slaves,” the free Egyptians would say, “because we’re not going to start stacking stones ourselves. Without slaves, there would be no pyramids.“

Human rights over convenience

It is striking that so many self-proclaimed progressives and democrats sing these odes to slavery without pausing to consider the grotesque nature of their arguments, which erode the very foundations of human rights. According to them, immigrants are not worthy of attention or care simply because they are human beings: Their value, instead, lies in their usefulness, in tasks like cleaning cars meticulously or ferrying children to swimming lessons.

The only progressive approach to migration is a humanitarian one. Exoduses have been a constant since the existence of rich and poor societies. The most daring or desperate people from the latter seek to improve their lives in the former. Countries of immigrants shaped by internal migratory flows such as Spain should be clear about this.

If we genuinely sympathize with the plight of the Earth’s outcasts and starving populations, we must demand that our leaders uphold the human rights charter they are obliged to enforce. The first step is to tackle the humanitarian crisis: to provide shelter and dignity to those fleeing hunger, and to do so because they are human beings who need care that any European state can easily provide. Excuses about saturation, lack of infrastructure, or limited resources are petty and untenable when weighed against per capita GDP and general budgets.

Inequality, not culture, threatens stability

The next step is to give substance and meaning to the idea of citizenship. Before we were inundated with hyper-patriotic and racist rhetoric, the European Union was an experiment in transcendent citizenship extending beyond the constraints of the nation-state. For instance, allowing EU citizens to run for mayor in cities where they reside — and to vote there, even as foreigners — enabled citizenship to move beyond rhetoric and into everyday politics. Progress in this area has been timid, and there is no reason to expect that, in the future, citizenship will become a universal condition that guarantees rights anywhere in the world, regardless of where one was born. But we must never lose sight of the idea.

Without formal equality, liberal democracy ceases to exist.

In the meantime, those concerned about the issue of migration must stop focusing on pensions and birth rates, the temptation to empathize with the borderline racist fears of “lifelong” locals bothered by a bar run by Chinese proprietors. The arrival of immigrants produces inequality, not cultural disruption. Rich societies are destabilized not by new customs or new languages that are incorporated into everyday life, but by the percentage of the population that lacks citizenship rights, which begins to be incompatible with democracy.The solution is clear: grant them those rights. Without formal equality, without individuals equal before the law, liberal democracy collapses or morphs into plutocracy or census democracy.

This is what happens in small, very wealthy countries. In Switzerland, for example, more than 30% of the population cannot participate in democracy: they cannot vote, run for office, or enter the public forum. This perverts civil liberties and reduces deliberative democracy to a system resembling the Athens of Pericles: only a few are citizens. The rest are metics and slaves.

This division must be avoided, urgently, for both moral and practical reasons, to protect an already weak and fractured democracy. To honor human rights and the notion of citizenship, immigrants arriving in Europe must be assimilated into the general population as quickly as possible. This is precisely what neither racists nor those fretting over who will change their diapers in nursing homes want. The former, because of their stupidity and backwardness. The latter because they fear that citizens equal to them will choose (as they and their own children chose) more comfortable and better-paid jobs. And here the so-called good Samaritans fail: They say, immigrants, yes — but only to clean toilets.

We progressives must say: immigrants, yes, like us. Equal and free.",https://worldcrunch.com/assets/uploads/2025/09/immigrants-1-lede-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 19:58:02.512360

The Trump admin is set to appeal that ruling and will surely try to find ways around or through the bills Newsom signed today.","“Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today,” exclaimed Gavin Newsom‘s press office X feed this morning, calling out the South Park–parodied Homeland Security Secretary by name. “You’re welcome, America.”

The taunting post came just a few hours before the California Governor Saturday put pen to paper on Senate Bills 627, a.k.a. the “No Secret Police Act” and 805 a.k.a The “No Vigilantes Act” in a public ceremony in LA.

“ICE, unmask, what are you afraid of?” said Gov. Newsom in Sat, surrounded by Mayor Karen Bass, LA County Supervisor (and ex-Labor Secretary) Hilda Solis, LASUD Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho and others. “This is not about the pronoun police, this is about the secret police,” Newsom added, quoting The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart.

Among the dangers of the newly enlarged ICE is that they are becoming a private police force, the term limited Newson stated, “that it appears to many of us have sworn an oath to Donald Trump, not the Constitution …this is not America.”

Even with a bill in Congress and similar actions in other states, the California legislation is the first in the nation put into law the unmasking and identifying of ICE agents and others. “It’s the hunting of Latinos in Los Angeles, it is the hunting of Haitians in Florida,” Mayor Bass bluntly said Saturday of the stakes before Newsom signed the bills. “As Angelenos we will never allow this to be normalized.”

Unsurprisingly, as some wonder how the new laws can be actively enforced, the Trump administration is opposed to the measures. “Once again, sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said on September 16 of the recent enacted masking policy when it started to become clear that Gov. Newsom was likely to sign the bills into law.

The signing of SB 627, 805 and three other related bills Saturday by the Trump-trolling Newsom (who was full of his now usual swipes at the former Apprentice host and top aide Stephen Miller today) comes against the additional backdrop of a redistricting campaign to prevent Trump from rigging the 2026 midterms and increased attacks from the White House and the FCC on free speech and the First Amendment — which the governor highlighted online today too.

With a number of Trump payoffs and ring kissing having already occurred, and promises of more to come from Trump himself and FCC chair Brendan Carr, those attacks directly hit one of Hollywood most powerful corporations once again this week. On Sept. 17, Disney suddenly announced Jimmy Kimmel‘s long-running and MAGA-critical Live! would be “preempted indefinitely” after remarks the host made a couple of days before about the MAGA response to the Sept. 10 fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk sent Carr and affiliate owners blood boiling.

As Disney endure the fallout, the newly signed SB 627 would ban local, state and federal law enforcement from covering their faces during operations, including immigration raids. Expecting court challenges, the law takes effect on January 1, 2026 with more provisions taking place later.

SB 805, which goes into effect immediately, requires all local, state and federal law enforcement, like ICE, operating in the Golden State to be identifiable with a name or badge number, whether they are in uniform or not. Passed by a strong majority in Sacramento along with SB 627 earlier this month, SB 805 also bans bounty hunters from participating in any and all immigration related activity in California and permits police to demand to see ID from anyone they believe is cosplaying at being local, state or federal law enforcement.

Reminiscent in more ways than one of the yellow masked police in HBO and Damon Lindelof’s Emmy-winning dystopian Watchmen, the masked ICE agents and seemingly bonus-paid surrogates were unleashed on LA earlier this summer as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Originally promised to be targeted at those with criminal records, the policy turned into snatching people off the street, out of cars and churches, and from Home Depot parking lots indiscriminately with a number of U.S. citizens and children being abducted in the process.

Now spreading to other blue states and cities, the LA abductions saw heavy protests in DTLA and Trump federalizing the state’s National Guard and hundreds of Marines to clamp down. Though the military presence in LA has dimmed, the intense ICE raids returned as the conservative majority Supreme Court on Sept. 8 halted a temporary restraining order stopping people being spotlighted for their race, skin color (Brown and Black), language or location (like waiting at a bus stop).

Just before SCOTUS stepped in, after numerous setbacks, Gov. Newsom and state AG Robert Bonta had a belated victory in the battle for LA on Sept. 2, when a federal judge ruled the Trump administration actively violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of the military to execute domestic law.

The Trump admin is set to appeal that ruling and will surely try to find ways around or through the bills Newsom signed today.

BTW – as talks continue between much-reviled Disney brass and Kimmel’s team over a possible return by the host, Damon Lindelof has said he will not work for any Disney-owned entity until the later-nighter is back on air. Other top talent has expressed similar sentiments, some publicly, some privately.

On the other hand, the acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli calls Newsom’s Noem-taunting tweet a “direct or implicit threat” and is pursuing it with the Secret Service:

That's why it's important that those around President Trump should remind him that we are in a moment where we just lost a political figure like Charlie Kirk.","President Donald Trump criticized U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and her native country of Somalia in the wake of a failed attempt by her colleagues to censure her in the House this week.

Four Republicans joined Democrats Wednesday to table that resolution, which would have also removed her from committees. U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, brought it forward because of an interview Omar did in response to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last week and reposts she made on social media.

The four-term congresswoman, who represents Minneapolis and some close suburbs, said in a note to constituents that the measure mischaracterized her words and her views.

""I have never supported political violence, and I have always spoken out against it. Attempts to twist my words into something they are not are deeply harmful not just to me, but to our ability to have honest debates in Congress,"" she said in an email about a town hall event.

Mr. Trump on Thursday said she is ""terrible"" and should be impeached. He also slammed Somalia, which Omar fled as a child before coming to the U.S. as a refugee. She later became an American citizen and first ran for Congress in 2018.

""How are they doing? How's their government? Do they have a president? Do they have a council? Do they have anything? Do they have police? I love these people that come from a place with nothing. Nothing, no anything. And then they tell us how to run our country,"" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""I think if she got censured, that's great. If she got impeached, that's even better.""

Omar's office declined to comment on Mr. Trump's remarks or his posts on social media.

In one post he said, ""what scum we have in our country, telling us what to do and how to do it"" after criticizing Somalia as a country plagued by poverty, civil war and corruption.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota, who himself emigrated to the U.S. from Somalia in the early 1990s, said many Somali Minnesotans supported President Trump this past election. The president won 12% of the vote in Minneapolis, a Democratic stronghold, but nearly double that figure in some heavily East African precincts, according to an analysis by the Minnesota Star Tribune.

Hussein called Mr. Trump's remarks ""a political statement,"" but said they've also caused alarm. ""Anytime something like this happens, we as a community are on guard, partially because we have seen political violence that took the life of Charlie Kirk, that took the life of [Rep.] Melissa Hortman, that took the life of many others, and we're seeing those threats,"" he explained. ""And so that's why we are a lot more alarmed when these things are publicly played out.""

Omar has faced threats in the past. Two years ago, a man in Florida was convicted and sentenced for sending an email threatening to kill her.

""Anything can happen, anytime. That's why it's important that those around President Trump should remind him that we are in a moment where we just lost a political figure like Charlie Kirk. We can't be in this moment of continuous contention that rises to a point where individuals may kill,"" Hussein said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/16/77e0dfe8-bc62-4a63-8e19-a21e2a8b4d7a/thumbnail/1200x630/4d83b2b132893990a0eea649a2294b71/yt-thumb-021625.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 18:56:57.991943

Asked for comment about MSNBC's exclusive reporting, the White House, the Justice Department and the FBI dismissed the investigation as politically motivated and baseless.
Several FBI and Justice Department officials believed Homan’s acceptance of the cash provided strong evidence that they should continue to pursue after Homan took public office.","In an undercover operation last year, the FBI recorded Tom Homan, now the White House border czar, accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help the agents — who were posing as business executives — win government contracts in a second Trump administration, according to multiple people familiar with the probe and internal documents reviewed by MSNBC.

The FBI and the Justice Department planned to wait to see whether Homan would deliver on his alleged promise once he became the nation’s top immigration official. But the case indefinitely stalled soon after Donald Trump became president again in January, according to six sources familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, Trump appointees officially closed the investigation, after FBI Director Kash Patel requested a status update on the case, two of the people said.

It’s unclear what reasons FBI and Justice Department officials gave for shutting down the investigation. But a Trump Justice Department appointee called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025 and no further investigative steps were taken, the sources say.

On Sept. 20, 2024, with hidden cameras recording the scene at a meeting spot in Texas, Homan accepted $50,000 in bills, according to an internal summary of the case and sources.

The federal investigation was launched in western Texas in the summer of 2024 after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election, according to an internal Justice Department summary of the probe reviewed by MSNBC and people familiar with the case. The U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas, working with the FBI, asked the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section to join its ongoing probe “into the Border Czar and former Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan and others based on evidence of payment from FBI undercover agents in exchange for facilitating future contracts related to border enforcement.”

Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement early in Trump’s first term, openly claimed during the 2024 campaign that he would play a prominent role in carrying out Trump’s promised mass deportations.

Asked for comment about MSNBC's exclusive reporting, the White House, the Justice Department and the FBI dismissed the investigation as politically motivated and baseless.

In a statement provided to MSNBC, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said, “This matter originated under the previous administration and was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The Department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.”

White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson slammed the probe as a ""blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using it’s resources to target President Trump’s allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country.""

""Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,"" she added on behalf of Homan, a senior White House employee.

Homan did not reply to requests for comment.

Undercover FBI agents posing as contractors communicated and met several times last summer with a business colleague who introduced them to Homan, and with Homan himself, who indicated he would facilitate securing contracts for them in exchange for money once he was in office, according to documents and the people familiar with the case.

On Sept. 20, 2024, with hidden cameras recording the scene at a meeting spot in Texas, Homan accepted $50,000 in bills, according to an internal summary of the case and sources.

FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors took no further investigative steps in the final months of 2024, the people said, and expected to keep monitoring Homan to determine if he landed an official role and would make good on steering contracts in a future Trump administration.

When special agents in Texas began probing the subject’s claim that Homan was soliciting bribes, the White House border czar, 63, was president and owner of a private consulting business that said it could help companies in the border security industry win government contracts. Homan often accompanied Trump on the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, and for months before the presidential election publicly touted that he expected to oversee implementation of Trump’s immigration policies.

“Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen,” Homan said at the National Conservatism Conference in July 2024.

Several FBI and Justice officials believed that they had a strong criminal case against Homan for conspiracy to commit bribery based on recording him accepting cash and his apparent promise to assist with contracts, according to four people familiar with the probe. Homan could have been charged with a crime then, legal experts say, but his case was unusual: He was not a public official, and Trump was not president at the time he accepted money in the FBI’s undercover sting, so his actions didn’t clearly fit under a standard bribery charge.

Top officials privately debated the possible charges given Homan’s status at the time, people familiar with the case said. But several concluded it would be better for the investigation to continue to monitor his actions once he was back in public office. According to a document reviewed by MSNBC, Justice officials were eyeing four potential criminal charges in his case: conspiracy, bribery and two kinds of fraud.

MSNBC asked legal experts about a hypothetical situation similar to the Homan probe. They said a person who promises to influence federal contracts when they become a public official can’t be charged under the federal bribery statutes until they are named or appointed to such a post. If the person did get the administration job and then reaffirmed his promise or communicated in some way about his plan to deliver on his agreement, investigators could make a strong bribery case.

It is still a crime, however, for anyone to seek money to improperly influence federal contracts, the legal experts said, whether they are a public official or not, and whether they ever delivered on their promise or not. People in this category could be charged with conspiracy or fraud, they say.

“If someone who is not yet a public official, but expects to be, takes bribes in exchange for agreeing to take official acts after they are appointed, they can’t be charged with bribery,” said Randall Eliason, the former chief of public corruption prosecutions in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. and former white-collar law professor. “But they can be charged with conspiracy to commit bribery. In a conspiracy charge, the crime is the agreement to commit a criminal act in the future.”

On Nov. 11, 2024, President Trump announced he would make Homan his border czar, a White House adviser role, which — unlike the job of director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — did not require Senate confirmation or an extensive FBI background check.

Several FBI and Justice Department officials believed Homan’s acceptance of the cash provided strong evidence that they should continue to pursue after Homan took public office. The Public Integrity Section, a squad of seasoned public corruption prosecutors typically assigned to sensitive cases involving elected and other high-profile figures, agreed to join the case in late November 2024, according to documents reviewed by MSNBC.

Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, however, in either late January or February 2025, former acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove was briefed on the case and told Justice Department officials he did not support the investigation, according to two people familiar with the case.

Around the same time, the Public Integrity Section was battling with Bove over his demand that they dismiss a bribery case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The section’s supervisors, who would resign one by one in February rather than agree to dismiss the Adams case, had assigned a top supervisor to help oversee the Homan case with federal prosecutors in the Western District of Texas, where the investigation began, two people said.

Homan had spent three decades in federal border protection and immigration enforcement. A former police officer from upstate New York, Homan had started work as a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and later was promoted to several supervisory jobs. In 2013, President Barack Obama elevated Homan to serve as head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch.

When Trump was first elected president in 2017, he appointed Homan as acting head of ICE. In that role, Homan pushed the controversial “zero-tolerance” policy for immigrants seeking to cross the border, resulting in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents and family members.

Homan’s nomination to become the permanent ICE director stalled in the Senate amid widespread criticism over the administration’s family-separations policies and Senate Democrats’ opposition to his confirmation. After his lengthy career in government service, Homan announced in April 2018 he would retire.

Homan then launched his consulting firm, Homeland Strategic Consulting. Its website boasted of its work with the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Justice and others: “We have a proven track record of opening doors and bringing successful relationships to our clients, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts to private companies.”

During the Biden administration, as Trump prepared to run again for president, Homan remained close to Trump and his advisers, working as a Fox News contributor and with the Heritage Foundation, as well as contributing to Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Trump’s second term.

When Homan became Trump’s top border official in 2025, his consulting work and financial ties to border security and immigration-related contractors spurred questions from Democrats in Congress about his potential conflicts of interest.

Many expected Homan, a trusted Trump ally, to serve if Trump were re-elected in 2024. In a December 2023 interview on the slain conservative activist’s eponymous podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show,” Homan promised he’d be pushing a robust removal of immigrants when Trump was re-elected.

“We’re going to have the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen,” Homan told Benny Johnson, a right-wing commentator and host on the show. “And I’m not going apologize for it.”

After Trump was elected a second time in 2024, amid questions about Homan’s financial relationships with clients who sought work related to the border, Homan said he had no conflict and would take steps to prevent one. He said he was shutting down his consulting business and would remove himself from discussions of specific contracts to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.

“As Border Czar, you are uniquely positioned to help your former business client reap a huge windfall from the Trump Administration’s spending on immigration enforcement,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter last month asking for documents and communications with another firm Homan worked for, Geo Group, a major immigration detention contractor. Raskin was joined by Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, in pressing for answers about Homan’s potential conflicts.

Asked about a hypothetical situation of a person promising help with contracts once they get into public office, Eliason said federal law makes it a crime to strike a corrupt agreement to help influence government contracts and decisions, no matter the identity of the person or whether they succeed. He said a person who is not a public official yet but promises to exert influence improperly when they get the job — and accepts or solicits money to do so — can be charged with conspiracy.

Eliason pointed to the Reagan-era bribery scandal involving the now-defunct defense contractor Wedtech. Eugene Wallach, a lawyer and friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was convicted of conspiracy to commit crimes by taking substantial payments from Wedtech while promising to influence contracts once he landed a high-level Justice Department job under Meese. (A higher court later overturned Wallach’s conviction due to a faulty jury instruction.)

“The defendant is agreeing that he will commit the crime of bribery once he is appointed to be a public official,” Eliason added. “That agreement itself is the conspiracy crime, and the fact that it never actually took place is not a defense. That would be true if he were never even appointed to anything at all.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250610-tom-homan-ew-608p-556b24.jpg",N,,2025-09-20 18:57:03.013341

Pramila Jayapal from Washington's 7th Congressional District hosted a ""shadow hearing"" — an unofficial congressional hearing held by the minority party — about the impact of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

Rep. Maxine Dexter was among the lawmakers present, and Portlander Mimi Lettunich was among the witnesses who testified about the experiences. Lettunich recalled what happened to her friend, Jackie Merlos, after a trip up to the U.S.-Canadian border.

Lettunich has been a caregiver to Merlos's four young children two months after that fateful visit.

Merlos, originally from Honduras, was visiting her sister, a Canadian citizen, at Peace Arch Park on June 28. Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained Merlos as the sisters were saying goodbye, Lettunich told lawmakers.

According to a CBP spokesperson, ""Merlos was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Peace Arch Park attempting to smuggle illegal aliens into the U.S. on June 28. Removal proceedings have been initiated, and she is now in ICE custody."" Earlier this summer, they told KGW, ""Initially, the children remained with the mother — at her request — in Border Patrol custody.""

Two weeks after their disappearance, Lettunich, with the assistance of Congresswoman Maxine Dexter, said they located Merlos and her U.S.-born children in Washington state.

Dexter recalled walking into the CBP building in an attempt to free the Merlos children and connect the family with legal counsel while detained.

""When I was able to see Jackie and the children, it was exactly as described: it felt like a zoo. They didn’t know who I was when I walked in. Jackie was kneeling with the four children, praying. She looked up, asked not to be interrupted, and kept praying. I cannot describe the impression it left on me — four small children in what was probably a 10-by-10 cell, behind soundproof glass, with a gray cement bench they were kneeling on, thin mats on the floor, and a toilet in the corner. It is absolutely insane that this is what we have done to this family ... the fact that [Trump has] traumatized them for an entire lifetime,” she said Thursday.

Lettunich, who was able to retrieve the children mid-July, shared with lawmakers some of what they told her.

""Agents interrogated the children without Jackie,"" she said. ""They were asked, 'Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have any relatives? Did they have a father?' Shortly after, ICE took their dad. The children believe it was their fault.""

On the car ride back to Portland, Lettunich said the kids gave her a coloring book with a message from her friend.

The package of bills Newsom signed included: Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.
Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order.
Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.","Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to check the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in California, including measures that limit their access on schools and force them to identify themselves in public.

The new laws echo the “resistance” measures California adopted during the first administration, when it passed a so-called sanctuary law to limit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents, among other policies.

President Trump promised a historic deportation effort and assault on sanctuary-style policies when he took office for the second time. His administration criticized the state’s new immigration laws even before Newsom signed them.

The Department of Homeland Security earlier this week called on Newsom to veto the mask bill — one of the more contentious pieces of immigration legislation — calling it “despicable.”

“Once again sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a Sept. 16 press release.

California may struggle to enforce the new laws, some of which have already raised constitutional questions around the state’s role in federal operations, but lawmakers maintain that they are legally defensible.

California political consultant Mike Madrid said in signing the laws Newsom is showing that he can stand up and fight, whether or not he has a chance of winning.

“In this moment, when there are very few cards to play for state governments and state legislatures, California has done what no other state has done: establish itself as the tip of the spear on resisting a lot of these efforts that are an affront to its values,” said Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.

“99% of this is the purview of the federal government. So a lot of it is just symbolic, but symbolism matters. It’s both politically astute but also morally right,” he said.

The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.

Senate Bill 627 widely prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties.

Senate Bill 805 requires that law enforcement officers identify themselves while conducting their duties, with some exceptions.

Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order.

Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.

California Democrats began drafting immigration-related bills almost as soon Trump took office in January. Those efforts accelerated after the Trump administration launched aggressive immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles, which led to weeks of protests and a subsequent National Guard deployment.

“All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from their own federal government. That is profound,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference with Newsom and other Democratic leaders.

Will the laws make a difference?

Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.

In 2018, for instance, California passed a law to restrict immigration arrests at superior court buildings. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from detaining people at those courts this year.

“The federal government is going to continue doing what it’s doing, in one form or another,” he said. “I do think the legislation gives some hope and optimism to communities that feel under fire, vulnerable and basically hated by the federal government.”

Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center, remains hopeful that the package of bills will ensure safety for people attending school and accessing health care.

“With most laws, there has to be really vigorous monitoring, both by the state as well as by advocates to ensure that it’s truly being implemented and followed,” she said.

California police opposed mask ban

The most controversial bill in the package was Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener’s proposal to widely ban federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The law, also known as the “No Secret Police Act,” does not apply to certain forms of face coverings, such as face shields, and it exempts some officers, including those who are undercover. Officers who violate the law will face an infraction or misdemeanor.

Wiener and Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez and Aisha Wahab championed the legislation after seeing footage of masked and unidentifiable agents carrying out operations.

“ICE’s recklessness creates chaos as agents run around with what are effectively ski masks and no identification, grabbing people, throwing them in unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them,” Wiener of San Francisco said at a legislative hearing in August. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust.”

California’s law enforcement groups widely opposed the bill, arguing it will largely apply to local police, rather than federal agents, because the federal government is likely to sue on constitutional grounds.

“It’s using an emotionally charged issue on a federal level to pass a bill that will only affect local peace officers,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions. “You’re upset with the feds, but you’re going to punish us.”

Other law enforcement experts echoed those concerns, arguing that it’s illegal to interfere with federal operations.

“California cops are not going to enforce this law,” said Ed Obayashi, a longtime California police officer who now is a special prosecutor and policy adviser to the Modoc County Sheriff’s Office. “You cannot regulate lawful federal conduct, whether the Legislature likes it or not.”

The law allows officers to be sued personally for “tortious conduct,” including if they assault or falsely arrest someone while masked.

“Private enforcement could be the avenue where enforcement is the likeliest,” said Johnson.

The bill caused hours of contentious debate on the Senate and Assembly floors, with many Republicans calling it misguided.

“My immigrant family is not afraid” of ramped-up immigration enforcement, Fresno Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa said, “because we did not break the law.”

But Democrats were animated because just days before, the U.S. Supreme Court had sided with the Trump administration and ICE for conducting roving sweeps through Los Angeles, apparently catching bystander day laborers or anyone who appeared Latino in their dragnet. The bill, they said, was their way of pushing back.

“We need a full front defense for the violence that is coming from this regime,” said Hector Pereyra, policy manager for the nonprofit Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which co-sponsored the mask bill and another bill to protect the private data of street vendors. “We have to respond with a united front of strength and aggressiveness, not of passiveness.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f4695da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3436x1804+0+387/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F3436x2577%20359%200%2Fresize%2F3436x2577%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd8%2F39%2Fced0413e408cb66756f021211839%2Fap24120126400719-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 16:56:43.107762

Markowitz said Californians need to know what’s at stake as the regents discuss how to negotiate with the Trump administration.","University of California faculty groups are escalating their pushback against the federal government’s efforts to reshape higher education, demanding access this week to a settlement proposed by the Trump administration that they say is part of an effort to exert control over universities.

In August, the Trump administration moved to freeze hundreds of UCLA research grants totaling roughly $500 million over allegations that the school ignored antisemitism on campus. Federal officials said universities, including UCLA, Columbia and Harvard, have fallen into a “decades-long woke-capture” spearheaded by Democrats.

The administration’s proposed settlement agreement in exchange for releasing those funds includes a $1.2 billion fine — the largest the Trump administration has requested from a university so far. According to reports from the Los Angeles Times and others, it was also accompanied by nonmonetary demands that would radically remake the university “in a conservative image.”

While national news outlets say they have viewed the administration’s lengthy list of demands and reported on their broad strokes, faculty members say the UC Board of Regents is refusing to share the document, hampering their ability to fight the proposed changes.

This week, in addition to suing the Trump administration over the proposed settlement, UCLA’s faculty association and the Council of University of California Faculty Associations sued the regents for declining a public records request for Trump’s demand letter.

“We feel this is essential for us to understand what our working conditions will be like over the next few years,” said Anna Markowitz, the president of the UCLA faculty association’s executive board.

According to media reports, the proposed settlement demands that UCLA bar health care workers from offering some gender-affirming care at its hospitals, exclude transgender women from athletics and “single sex housing” and rescind records and recognitions previously awarded to transgender women in “female-only events.”

The faculty groups believe the list also calls for UCLA to revise its free expression policies and includes demands to end race and ethnicity-based scholarships, which Markowitz said help California students who might not otherwise be able to access the prestigious institution. Additionally, they said, it demands that the school alert the federal government of “disciplinary actions involving student visa holders,” among other things.

The Board of Regents, walking a thin line to try to recover the half a billion dollars in frozen research grants, told the faculty groups last month that it would not release the letter, citing pending litigation, Federal Privacy Act and other state public records exemptions.

But the faculty groups say that withholding the document violates their right to information under California’s Constitution. They say it’s unfair for the university system to call on them and other UC staff to oppose it without knowing its demands.

“The UCLA Faculty Association and the Council of University Faculty Associations … are also mobilizing in response to the Trump administration’s demands, though their efforts to do so are being hampered by the University’s refusal to disclose the requested document,” their lawsuit against the regents reads.

Alameda County Superior Court Judge Rebekah Evenson instructed the regents on Friday to present any evidence showing that producing a copy of the letter could incur damages, and to identify whether other universities that have engaged in similar negotiations with the Trump administration have released such documents.

She plans to schedule a hearing on the matter in October, according to Markowitz.

Although Markowitz said the faculty groups appreciate news reports outlining the proposed settlement demands, she said it’s important that faculty members see the document for themselves to flag specific language that could have a significant impact on their ability to teach.

“The devil is in the details, and understanding what the specific language is and what the specific requests are would give us a much better sense of to what level the federal government wants to be interfering with UC operations,” she said.

She also believes the settlement demands are relevant to all Californians, since a deal could have wide-ranging effects across the university system’s 10 campuses in the future.

The suit warns that UCLA is just the latest to be affected by a pattern the Trump administration is using to exert power over higher education.

“The Trump administration has developed a strategy to reverse what it calls ‘the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions,’” it reads. “It conditions the restoration of grant funds on both monetary payments and — critically — sweeping concessions on policies related to admissions, financial aid, free expression, faculty hiring, and inclusivity.”

Universities across the country, including UC Berkeley, are under ongoing investigations for alleged antisemitism, the Trump administration announced in March. It sent letters to 60 universities notifying schools of the probe, and last week, UC Berkeley handed over personal information for about 160 students and employees accused of antisemitism that the government subpoenaed in the spring.

Markowitz said Californians need to know what’s at stake as the regents discuss how to negotiate with the Trump administration.

“The regents have only ever talked about one demand, which is the $1.2 billion settlement … but they’re actually asking for a lot more,” she continued. “Whatever else they’re asking for is actually really important to the character and the mission of the UC and to the public of California, and we want to know what other factors might be involved as our administration tries to figure out a path forward.”

We continue to urge the government to act on the recommendations published in this year’s Independent Monitoring Board report and reconsider closing this detention centre. The issues raised because of its isolated location, the poor mobile phone signal and the high numbers of women released on bail, as they should never have been detained, mean Derwentside IRC should be closed.”

Former MEP and women’s rights campaigner, Julie Ward, said:

“In a world riven with conflict it is no surprise that vulnerable and desperate people are seeking sanctuary. We would all do the same if we were in their shoes. More than fifty per cent of people on the move across the world are women and children. They face violence at every stage of their journeys and when they finally arrive in Europe where they hope to find safety they are faced with appalling levels of racism and institutional violence.

Our colonial past is largely to blame for the poverty and inequality that drives conflict. We pride ourselves on being a generous open country but right wing politicians and their media mates are whipping up anti-migrant sentiment resulting in new levels of racism reminiscent of the Enoch Powell era or 1930s Germany. It’s time to dial down the rhetoric and remember that we all came from somewhere else. Kindness and compassion should be our watchwords.

I believe that such a decision to ignore the Supreme Court would be more difficult and costly to Trump than many assume.
Beyond their rightfully held constitutional authority, the Supreme Court also enjoys the advantage of controlling the timing of its rulings.
The costs of defying the Supreme Court in one instance could have ripple effects, leading to a cascading of other rulings against the administration that would make such a move particularly costly.
Trump’s decision to defy the Supreme Court is hardly a foregone conclusion, even for him.","The odds are, in the coming months, the Supreme Court will issue a ruling that limits Donald Trump’s unilateral assertions of power. Perhaps the court will strike down the president’s radical and unprecedented imposition of tariffs without congressional involvement or his denial of birthright citizenship to individuals born in the U.S.

Although it is impossible to know how such a situation will play out, a certain fatalism is now germinating. Political observers and even unnamed administration officials wonder in private what will happen if Trump simply defies the court, asserting his executive power and thumbing his nose at the rule of law and the constitutional system.

I believe that such a decision to ignore the Supreme Court would be more difficult and costly to Trump than many assume.

A court decision that delivers a clear, unified rebuke to the president by full court or 7-2 supermajority would marshal the authority of the U.S. Constitution. Another defiant president crumbled in 1974 when a unanimous decision instructed President Nixon to turn over the damning White House tapes or invite the revolt of his own party and much of the country.

And the court’s decision will have even more force if it deals with a situation where Trump blatantly contradicts the Constitution, as with his denial of the 14th Amendment’s granting of citizenship to “all persons born” in the United States.

Beyond their rightfully held constitutional authority, the Supreme Court also enjoys the advantage of controlling the timing of its rulings. Trump’s approach will likely be affected if the court issues a ruling during a period of political vulnerability, such as in the runup to the 2026 elections. If congressional Republicans are scrambling to win reelection in a bad year for their party, the White House may choose to avoid a constitutional crisis that forces Republican candidates to take a side.

Although congressional Republicans’ loyalty to the president has held so far, such a scenario would tempt lawmakers to protect themselves by announcing, “I’m going to tell the president that he’s wrong.”

Trump’s presumption that he has the power to impose his will may also be misplaced in certain cases. Trump ordered his administration to quickly cancel nearly nine out of 10 USAID programs. Unprecedented but straightforward and easy to do. But the president lacks comparable tools to tame the Federal Reserve Bank and its governors.

The Fed’s independence dulls Trump’s scheme to steer its interest rate policy and replace a governor with an ally. The Fed’s operations are anchored in 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and their networks of privately owned commercial banks. Its funding is derived from the bank’s operations in capital markets and is independent of Congress and the president. Trump’s favorite weapon of cutting budgets to compel obedience won’t work with the Fed if he pushed back on a potential Supreme Court decision that ruled against his firing of a Fed governor.

Then there is the matter of the remainder of the judiciary. How will it respond if Trump disregarded a clear order? In ordinary times, the federal legal system privileges the administration and its actions. But if the president spurned the Supreme Court of the United States, the judicial system would become even less inclined to trust the administration and its lawyers and give them the benefit of the doubt in other cases.

The costs of defying the Supreme Court in one instance could have ripple effects, leading to a cascading of other rulings against the administration that would make such a move particularly costly.

Trump would also be reliant on the people in his administration to carry out his decision. Causing an unprecedented constitutional crisis will pose a question of great historic import: will officials decide to obey the court or the president? Resting in the balance are their current jobs and the historic consequences of spurning the rule of law. Trump’s actions in his first term provoked resignations of protest from the Department of Justice and internal dissension among senior officials.

And make no mistake, the consequences of defying the court would be drastic. After all, the national and international economy and world leaders have always assumed that the United State is a nation of laws. But Trump’s repudiation of the rule of law would set off a constitutional crisis in the U.S., rattle investor confidence in the dollar, and trigger a sharp sell-off in the Stock Market. Although there is no precedent for constitutional defiance, markets did fall by 10 percent in the two days after high tariffs were imposed in April 2025.

Trump’s decision to defy the Supreme Court is hardly a foregone conclusion, even for him. The reality is that the stakes for Trump — and the country — of flouting the rule of law are enormous and may bring about the president’s political downfall.

Because to make a court change its case law is extremely difficult.","“In the past I was accused of sacrilege,” he told The Times. “I am used to that. And, as you can see nowadays, governments do complain [about the ECHR], and then it’s a great scandal: ‘They dare to complain! How dare they?’”

His intervention comes as the question of overreach by the ECHR has never been higher on the political agenda across Europe. In Britain, judicial challenges based on cases before the court in Strasbourg have threatened to sink Sir Keir Starmer’s one-in, one-out agreement with France to return illegal migrants who crossed the Channel in small boats.

In May an open letter drafted by Italy and Denmark and signed by Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland said the ECHR had “limited our ability to make political decisions in our own democracies” by creating barriers to fighting illegal migration. Bossuyt writes in the diplomatic document shared by De Wever: “Governments should not be intimidated by the reproach that criticising some judgments puts the rule of law in danger.”

A wider grouping of countries, including France and Germany, according to diplomatic sources, is also engaged in finding ways to stop the derailing of the deportation of failed asylum seekers or those who have committed crimes. Bossuyt describes the practice as “judicial activism”.

“I’ve been told that it is not only the nine governments that take a critical view but many more others, including the UK, who is not a member state any more of the EU,” Bossuyt said.

He makes a distinction between ordinary judicial cases and international courts making rulings that have “a very general scope and consequences, particularly as is the case with the judgments of the court in Strasbourg”.

He said: “Then the problem is not the government that is violating the principle of separation of powers, but it is the court that is violating that principle. Because it’s up to the legislators to legislate and not up to the court.”

It is states that are the “ultimate masters” of the treaties they are party to, Bossuyt said, and “governments are their representatives”. He said: “We must never lose sight of the fact that it is states that ratify conventions.”

Bossuyt reserves particular criticism for the case law surrounding article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: the “prohibition of torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment”.

Article 3 case law is being used in British challenges to deportation of migrants to France on the grounds their safety will be endangered. “Britain is considered responsible for what will happen to these people sent to this horrible country called France,” joked Bossuyt of Belgium’s neighbour. “In my opinion, that is going too far.”

In one case an Afghan fugitive wanted on French rape charges is claiming that prison cells in some French prisons might be too small, violating his rights under the convention, based on case law that “slopping out” chamber pots in Scottish prisons breached article 3. “There is case law in that direction which would make any extradition impossible to many, many countries,” Bossuyt said. “So I think that’s not the way — that’s overreaching by the court in my opinion.”

He added: “It is wrong to have judicial cases over transfers of asylum seekers between parties to the European convention such as from Britain to France or between EU countries, such as to Greece.”

The Belgian jurist, a former chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights and professor of international law, makes the case that article 3 has gone beyond “a negative prohibition on a state not to torture someone”, which he argues should be absolute, to a “positive obligation to provide decent reception services to asylum seekers”.

“If also the obligation to have decent services is considered absolute then we are indirectly responsible for what may happen in other states,” he said. “I think there, the court is going too far.”

In his paper, first reported by the Brussels website Euractiv, he suggests the law goes beyond “what was originally intended by the prohibition of torture”. He writes: “A lack of decent reception for asylum seekers is clearly not of the same order as whipping. In none of the EU member states there is a real risk that asylum seekers will be whipped.”

While some challenges are understandable, he says, there should not be a “required jurisdictional intervention, with suspentive effect, in a case where we are sending someone from one EU country to another EU country”. That includes Britain, he says, which is a state party to the convention. “If you send someone from the one state party to the other state party it is still under the control of the ECHR. That is the case if you send someone from Britain to France.”

Bossuyt suggests that governments should appoint better candidates to the bench of the court in an attempt to reform it. “National judges known for their judicial restraint should be given preference over academics,” he said, adding that the latter group were known by their writings to be in favour of “activist interpretations”.

He called on governments to intervene collectively in cases being heard at the court to make “judges aware of the importance” attached to “the issues at stake”.

• Juliet Samuel: The ECHR wasn’t meant to be used like this

Amending the convention is more difficult, he said, but it has been done with a protocol, number 15, in 2013 to give a greater “margin of appreciation”. This, he said, gave more national flexibility to prevent confrontations between governments and the court. “It is very difficult to get consensus, very difficult to get, obviously, all those ratifications, all these approvals by parliaments. I would not rule it totally out.”

Bossuyt, author of Right to Asylum: Between Demagogy and Hypocrisy, published by Hart Oxford this year, remains optimistic that the court can be changed. “Fifteen years ago, I was a very, very lonely voice. The mood is changing. That’s quite clear. But it’s very difficult. Because to make a court change its case law is extremely difficult.

“I think there is a possibility, at least, to have the court being more cautious. And I would say, to a certain extent, over the last years, the court is already somewhat more cautious than it was 15 years ago.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F6515f9e9-566a-447e-90a7-11ebc0079c60.jpg?crop=2674%2C1504%2C281%2C230&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-20 15:57:09.400991

President Trump’s proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications and renewals, set to become effective September 21, 2025.

Immigration attorneys across the U.S. worked overnight to prepare multiple lawsuits challenging the order, calling the fee excessive, unlawful, and tantamount to a ban.

Corporate legal teams scrambled to track H-1B employees and advised against international travel, fearing liability for the steep new reentry fee.

With 72% of H-1Bs held by Indians, the order disproportionately affects Indian professionals and IT outsourcing firms that rely heavily on the program.

Critics argue the proclamation bypasses Congress and established rulemaking procedures, making it vulnerable to challenge as arbitrary and beyond executive authority.

DHS may waive the fee for individuals, companies, or industries deemed critical to U.S. interests, but the process remains unclear.

Tech leaders warn the measure could cripple Silicon Valley’s talent pipeline, while policy experts say it risks a talent drain and undermines U.S. competitiveness in STEM fields.

It was a night of absolute mayhem for the H-1B visa community in the United States. Across the country, immigration attorneys from New York to California spent Friday burning the midnight oil, drafting lawsuits to challenge the executive order as early as Monday morning. Immigration lawyers’ mailing lists lit up overnight with urgent alerts, and corporate legal teams were scrambling to track their H-1B employees, making sure no one was traveling or exposed to the sudden $100,000 fee that corporations would have to pay for their re-entry into the U.S.

As news spread, attorneys quickly began scouting for plaintiffs to mount a legal challenge, while H-1B forums and social media groups buzzed with questions about the executive order’s murky clauses.

RELATED: Trump administration finally targets H-1B, set to impose $100,000 for coveted visas (September 19, 2025)

By attaching a $100,000 fee to both new and renewed H-1B visas, President Trump has delivered what critics describe as an unprecedented body blow to America’s immigration system.

Immigration attorney and founder of the Visa Code, Gnanamookhan Senthurjothi, says his phone hasn’t stopped ringing. His firm, like countless others, has been deluged with panicked calls from past and present visa holders desperate for direction. His counsel: “We strongly recommend that current H-1B visa holders avoid international travel outside the United States until further clarity is provided. If you are currently outside the U.S. on an H-1B visa, please make every effort to return before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 20, 2025, to avoid possible entry restrictions under the new proclamation effective September 21, 2025.”

But as soon as attorneys began issuing advisories urging H-1B visa holders abroad to return before Sunday, Indian nationals quickly realized the near impossibility of doing so. With India 10 hours ahead of the U.S. and most direct flights from major Indian cities taking at least 14 hours, the timing made it unfeasible for many to get back in time.

Members of H-1B community groups, however, began circulating a quick jugaad. One message floating through desi networks read, “People who are coming before September 21st, as it is the nearest port of entry.” The note referred to Abu Dhabi’s Zayed International Airport (AUH), where U.S.-bound travelers can complete American immigration and customs checks before boarding. This “preclearance” process applies to those already holding valid U.S. visas or eligible under the Visa Waiver Program.

Meanwhile, people in the H-1B compliance industry told The American Bazaar that on Friday, several passengers bound for India were asked to de-board their flights after employers advised against travel, fearing liability for the steep new reentry fee.

Sethurjothi also advises, “H-1B applicants outside the U.S. with scheduled visa interviews should proceed with their appointments as planned. There is no need to panic or cancel your visa interview at this time. H-1B visa holders outside the U.S. who are unable to re-enter should avoid traveling to the U.S. on B-1 visas unless there is a genuine and urgent reason for such travel.”

Policy experts and people in immigration circles also point to uncertainties in the order. Immigration consultant Netra Chavan strongly feels that the rule will soon be put on hold once lawsuits are filed, but she highlights its slightly ambiguous nature.

She says, “While the H-1B proclamation introduces a $100,000 payment for certain visa petitions. Interestingly, the text doesn’t call it a ‘fee’; instead, it begins with a long-winded monologue on wages and prevailing wage levels. This has caused some confusion: Is this rule about improving wages for the worker or an employer cost? The answer appears to be that it’s an employer payment, not compensation to the employee. The proclamation ties it to H-1B petition approval but also discusses wage levels, which makes the language ambiguous.”

Sethurjothi agrees. “The White House is expected to issue FAQs soon to provide further insights and clarify ambiguities in the proclamation. A careful review of these FAQs will be essential to fully understand how the restrictions and exemptions will be implemented,” he says. Experts also point out that there is currently no clarity on how this fee is to be paid.

Why the $100,000 fee stands on unsteady legal ground

The sudden $100,000 H-1B fee appears to bypass established procedures entirely, unlike previous immigration fee adjustments that followed a defined legal and regulatory process.

Chavan raises a pertinent point, saying, “The Premium Processing fee increases (from $1,500 to $2,500 (in 2020) to $2,805 (in 2024)) followed a clear legal path: Congress authorized the changes through the USCIS Stabilization Act and gave DHS authority to make periodic adjustments for inflation by publishing rules in the Federal Register. By contrast, the proposed $100,000 H-1B fee is not tied to any statutory authority or any cost recovery and would come by presidential proclamation, making it far more vulnerable to legal challenge as arbitrary, excessive, and possibly beyond executive power. In reality, the ‘fee’ if it’s a fee (ambiguity stays) is unfair, excessive, and more like a ban than a real fee, which could make it unlawful.”

The Department of Homeland Security has indicated that the $100,000 H-1B fee may be waived in cases where employing foreign workers is deemed essential to the national interest and poses no risk to U.S. security or welfare. Does this clause offer a light at the end of the tunnel for visa holders?

Attorney Senthurjothi explains, “This exemption can apply to individuals, companies, or entire industries but require formal DHS determination. The process for applying for these exemptions is not yet announced but is expected to be like previous national interest exceptions issued during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In order to preserve American workers, the $100,000 H-1B fee declaration encourages employers to hire U.S. citizens and talks about pay raises in STEM and technology-related sectors. Chavan says, “The approach may improve compliance with labor and national security regulations and increase entry-level employment prospects for U.S. graduates by improving regulatory monitoring and discouraging fraudulent operations.” But there remain significant cons to the order, as Chavan adds, “Employers may be reluctant to prolong or renew visas, which could lead to employment insecurity, and dependent children may ‘age out’ before their parents receive green cards. The charge may cause a talent drain that would reduce American competitiveness in STEM fields by encouraging skilled people to migrate to nations with less complicated immigration laws.”",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/H-1B-crackdown.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 16:57:11.420515

President Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.

""We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have relied on the program to hire foreign workers.

The plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.

The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.

Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,"" a White House aide said.

Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.

""The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,"" Anderson told CBS News.

Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.

President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.

The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March study from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.

Trenton Gerads, a member of the Moorhead Human Rights Commission, shared his discontent with the board’s lack of action during its Wednesday, Sept. 17, meeting.

“I think as a commission and even as a city leadership group, there isn’t a true direction of what we should be doing, where we should be going,” Gerads said. “I volunteered to be part of this commission because I’m passionate about human rights — I want to see action.”

The commission has taken little action in the last couple of years.

Instead, Human Rights Commission meetings have served as a platform for different cultural organizations and community services to present on their work. Recent presentations included an immigration lawyer, the Indigenous Association and CASA, a Latino cultural organization.

In 2024, the Human Rights Commission unanimously voted to pass a resolution asking for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. That resolution was passed up to the Moorhead City Council, where it was narrowly approved.

The commission also gives out awards throughout the year, including the Moorhead Human Rights Award and the Destiny Holiday Community Champion Award.

In the past, the commission was involved in activities in Moorhead like Pride in the Park, Juneteenth celebrations and Pangea, a cultural diversity celebration.

The seven-member volunteer commission, as it exists today, was formed in 2017. The board was reformed after a two-year hiatus due to declining membership and low attendance at meetings.

The commission’s purpose is outlined in a 2017 ordinance:

“The purpose of the commission is to secure for all persons, whether residents or visitors, equal opportunity in education, employment, housing, public accommodations, and public services, and full participation for all Moorhead citizens in the affairs of this community.”

The duties of the board, as outlined by the rules of practice and procedure, include hosting an annual fair housing event, giving human rights recognitions and advising the mayor, Moorhead City Council and city manager on human rights issues and policies to “provide for full and equal opportunity in the community.”

The rules say people can bring human rights complaints to the Moorhead Human Rights Commission, but they will be referred to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.

Moorhead Governmental Affairs Director Lisa Bode said the Moorhead Human Rights Commission first met in 1990, when the Minnesota Department of Human Rights was encouraging cities to form human rights commissions.

In early years, the board focused on embracing cultural diversity, Bode said. It also adopted sexual orientation as a protected class in the city before the state of Minnesota.

""That was leadership at the time,"" Bode said.

The role of the Human Rights Commission is a policy matter for the city, and the Moorhead City Council has not discussed modifying the commission, she said.

During Wednesday’s meeting, Gerads said he wants to see more action out of the board.

“Frankly, I’m getting a little tired that every time I come to a meeting the only thing we really have action on is our minutes,” Gerads said.

He suggested the commission could educate community members about what human rights infringements look like. Member Anna Rajesh agreed.

“I feel like there’s plenty that we should be doing, and that many people’s human rights may be being violated, because they might not know that these are my human rights and that I should be standing up for myself for that,” Rajesh said.

Members suggested ways the board could reach more people. Evett Ellis said the Moorhead Human Rights Commission could have a regular presence in different community spaces. Moorhead City Council member Sebastian McDougall proposed collaborating with the Fargo Human Rights Commission.

Board chair Jenifer Cannon suggested the board set aside time during the next meeting to continue the discussion.

WASHINGTON – Today the Department of Homeland Security, via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), followed up on instructions that it sent last week to attorneys general of the states of California, Illinois, and New York to confirm whether they will protect the American people and cooperate with ICE to detain criminal illegal aliens, or whether they will allow thousands of criminal illegal aliens back into American communities.

On September 10th, 2025, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons instructed relevant state officials to respond within two days to indicate whether they intended to honor thousands of ICE detainers on criminal illegal aliens within their jurisdictions or whether they would continue to place their states in danger.

These detainers request that these jurisdictions notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are to be released from jail or prison to ensure the safe transfer of portable criminal illegal aliens into ICE custody. Failure to honor these detainers has led to numerous illegal alien murderers, rapists, and pedophiles being released back into California, New York, and Illinois communities.

ICE received responses from Illinois and New York that underscored their refusal to honor ICE detainers. California did not respond.

Yesterday, ICE sent follow-up letters to these jurisdictions, letting them know that while ICE would prefer to work in cooperation with them, ICE will engage with the Department of Justice and other Federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures to end their inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction of the apprehension and removal of criminal illegal aliens. The Illinois Attorney Gerneral's office refused to accept the letter.

“These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities — threatening the American people’s lives and wellbeing,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE detainers ask for something very simple: To notify ICE when criminal illegal aliens are released from jail or prison, to ensure that they go into ICE custody before they are released back onto our streets. These sanctuary state politicians should do the right thing and side with law-abiding Americans over criminal illegal aliens.”

The Trump Administration has consistently targeted the worst of the worst illegal alien criminals across the country. However, open border politicians in states like California, Illinois, and New York endanger their fellow citizens by refusing to honor ICE detainers against criminal illegal aliens endangering not just their own residents, but all Americans.

Over the years, these and other sanctuary state policies have impeded the Federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and have enabled thousands of violent criminals to prowl our neighbors, directly threatening innocent American citizens.

Despite that resistance from sanctuary politicians across the country, DHS has so far arrested more than 400,000 illegal aliens – 70% of whom arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.

Below are just a handful of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who were RELEASED back on the streets because of these reckless sanctuary policies:

H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill.
This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.
Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.
First lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation that will require a $100,000 annual visa fee for highly-skilled foreign workers and rolled out a $1 million “gold card” visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals, moves that face near-certain legal challenges amid widespread criticism he is sidestepping Congress.

If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.

H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.

Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said “all big companies” are on board.

Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.

Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because “it’s just not economic anymore.”

“If you’re going to train people, you’re going to train Americans.” Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. ""If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.”

Trump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.

The “Trump Platinum Card” will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card.

Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.

Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it “the next best thing” to abolishing the visas altogether.

Doug Rand, a senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the proposed fee increase was “ludicrously lawless.”

“This isn’t real policy — it’s fan service for immigration restrictionists,” Rand said. “Trump gets his headlines, and inflicts a jolt of panic, and doesn’t care whether this survives first contact with the courts.”

Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval.

Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.

Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.

As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.

First lady Melania Trump, the former Melania Knauss, was granted an H-1B work visa in October 1996 to work as a model. She was born in Slovenia.

In 2024, lottery bids for the visas plunged nearly 40%, which authorities said was due to success against people who were “gaming the system” by submitting multiple, sometimes dubious, applications to unfairly increase chances of being selected.

Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.

Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery “included some steps in the right direction,” it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.

The 38-year-old city resident was one of three activists arrested by police on Friday, Sept. 12 after allegedly refusing to leave the front steps of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office on District Avenue in Burlington. Lawton-Sticklor, Nathan Philips of Auburndale, and Eleanor Reid of Hanover, New Hampshire, were scheduled to be arraigned in Woburn District Court on Friday but Reid’s arraignment was continued to March 12 and Philips and Lawton-Sticklor are both scheduled for an Oct. 24 pre-trial appearance.

It was Lawton-Sticklor’s first time at the Burlington ICE facility, the site of ongoing large-scale protests that have been taking place regularly for some time, gatherings she said are “such a testament to how horrid the place is.” She disclosed that she has heard reports of “hundreds” of people being kept overnight at the facility “even up to 20 days,” including children.

“Young people, kids taken…have shared their experiences,” she said. “It’s a zoning violation. That building is not designed to hold people overnight.”

She and the other two people were trying to deliver baskets of food — sandwiches, granola bars, fruit, and other snacks — to the immigrants at the Burlington field office after hearing reports of detainees not receiving adequate nutrition and sleeping and living in poor and unsanitary conditions.

“It’s sad that we are at a point where it is acceptable to withhold and food and other basic necessities for people while they are being detained,” Lawton-Sticklor said earlier this week.

When asked what moved her and Philips and Reid to bring baskets of food in the hopes that they would get to the immigrants inside the building, she stated “knowing people are hungry.”

“It’s a simple solution,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “If people are having food withheld from them and the state and government is not going to do anything, community members can.”

What transpired that Friday morning according to her is that they arrived at the facility and went up to the door and knocked. When a security guard came out, they told him they were there to visit people and had food for them. The guard told them they weren’t allowing visitation and do not accept food or donations.

“We said we were happy to wait if they wanted to check with a supervisor,” Lawton-Sticklor said.

So, they sat down on the steps, “careful not to block the door,” and patiently waited.

During the 90 minutes they were there they saw four or five people who went into and came out of the building for immigration appointments.

“We also saw several transport vans and ICE vehicles going in and out of the parking lot,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “It was unclear if there were people in them.”

Some time later, activity picked up.

“Several federal agents interacted with us. One lost his temper and started recording us with his phone,” Lawton-Sticklor said, adding that another federal agent told the media gathered there “to (obscenity) off.”

She reported that the first federal agent who came out — whom she believes it was Homeland Security Investigator Sarette named in the police report, although she is “not 100% sure” because he did not introduce himself — was the one who “yelled at us and recorded us and told us to leave.”

“We were already sitting down on the steps, and he grabbed the baskets of food out of [Nathan’s] hands and dumped them on the ground across the parking lot,” Lawton-Sticklor said. “He grabbed one of my arms to move me and then tried to grab me under my arm, [but] he was not successful in not moving me. It was hurting so I lifted my arms to alleviate the pressure.”

No public information on Sarette exists as government agent at the Burlington facility according to an online search. Lawton-Sticklor then said that another federal agent who took his place “was much more calm and regulated.”

“They kept repeating that they can’t accept outside food and we said we would be happy to leave once we were let in to see if our community members were ok,” she said. “We emphasized that the food was sealed and in single-size packaging to account for food safety, but they were adamant that they didn’t want anyone coming in or giving anyone outside food. At no point did they tell us no one was there.”

The Burlington police were then called. Lawton-Sticklor said there were two police officers “next to us the whole time” and she estimates four other police officers were also present.

“They tried to bargain with us,” she said. “They wanted us to move across the parking lot to the grassy area where other people have gathered. We let them know we would be happy to leave of our own volition and that it wasn’t our intention to stay, we just wanted to deliver the food. They declined to help us get access and eventually they let us know we were under arrest for trespassing.”

They were handcuffed and brought to the Burlington Police Station and later released on the condition they stay away from the Burlington office.

One piece of good news that came out of Burlington is that Honduras immigrant Blanca Martinez, who has been at the center of the protests there that have drawn hundreds of people weekly, was granted a one-year stay from removal following a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment on Sept. 16, four days after the trio was arrested.

About 500 people came to support Martinez at the immigration office in Burlington, including Massachusetts state Rep. Manny Cruz, Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo from her hometown, and Bishop Julia Whitworth of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. The outcome was a huge relief for the protesters who have been backing her and Martinez herself, who had previously received denials on appeal in her asylum case.

Lawton-Sticklor called the support for Martinez “a testament to people showing up.”

“The more people who are showing up for their community members, the harder it is for them to take advantage of people,” she said.

She stated that there has been “a big community effort, even from public officials, to get inside the building in Burlington that is rented to Homeland Security by the landlord who owns it but “they have been denied.”

Lawton-Sticklor also said that the police report detailing their exchange with ICE agents that day “is inaccurate.”

“The ICE officer who roughed me up, he reported he had interacted with my male friend and tried to escort him off the property and he initially went limp and that’s just not true,” she said. “Police said arrest was our ultimate goal, which is not true. Our goal was to get in there and give food to people and if we had been able to do that, we would have left.”

When speaking on Wednesday, she said her back and shoulder were still a bit sore from the encounter.

“I’m feeling a little bit better, but the activity definitely wrenched my back.”

What is harder to put into words is the feeling of despondence in light of what happened.

“I was just sad thinking about the people that are in there not knowing that we were outside trying to get to them and bring them food and how much we love them and care for them — and that their human rights should be respected,” she said.",https://www.lowellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sen-l-nastasiaICEarrest09192025-01.jpg?w=1024&h=1334,N,,2025-09-20 15:57:30.231598

In June, six Republican lawmakers led by state Sen. Suzette Martinez Valladares (R-Santa Clarita) sent Trump a letter urging him to ease up on the raids and get to work on immigration reform.
… But we need a work permit process” that serves the needs of employers and workers, Ochoa Bogh said.
So it’s not entirely surprising that a bipartisan congressional immigration reform bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, was introduced in July by a Florida Republican and a Texas Democrat.
“I said to them, ‘You can’t keep your eyes closed and say this is what it should be, when there are certain realities we have to navigate.” So what are the chances of progress on immigration reform?","When I wrote last week about how immigration raids are targeting far more laborers than criminals, and whacking the California economy at a cost to all of us, I was surprised by the number of readers who wrote to say it’s high time for immigration reform.

The cynic in me had an immediate response, which essentially was, yeah, sure.

Bipartisan attempts failed in 2006 and 2014, so there’s a fat chance of getting anywhere in this political climate.

But the more I thought about it, nobody has done more to make clear how badly we need to rewrite federal immigration law than guess who.

President Trump.

Raids, the threat of more raids, and the promise to deport 3,000 people a day, are sabotaging Trump’s economic agenda and eroding his support among Latinos. Restaurants have suffered, construction has slowed and fruit has rotted on vines as the promised crackdown on violent offenders — which would have had much more public support — instead turned into a heartless, destructive and costly eradication.

I wouldn’t bet a nickel on Trump or his congressional lackeys to publicly admit to any of that. But there have been signs that the emperor is beginning to soften hard-line positions on deportations of working immigrants and student visas, sending his MAGA posse into convulsions.

“His heart isn’t in the nativist purge the way the rest of his administration’s heart is into it,” the Cato Institute’s director of immigration studies, David J. Bier, told the New York Times. Despite the tough talk, Bier said, Trump has “always had a soft spot for the economic needs from a business perspective.”

So too, apparently, do some California GOP legislators.

In June, six Republican lawmakers led by state Sen. Suzette Martinez Valladares (R-Santa Clarita) sent Trump a letter urging him to ease up on the raids and get to work on immigration reform.

“Focus deportations on criminals,” Martinez Valladares wrote, “and support legal immigration and visa policies that will build a strong economy, secure our borders and protect our communities.”

Then in July, a bipartisan group of California lawmakers led by State Sen. Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh (R-Yucaipa), followed suit.

Ochoa Bogh urged “immediate federal action … to issue expedited work permits to the millions of undocumented immigrants who are considered essential workers, such as farmworkers who provide critical services. These workers support many industries that keep our country afloat and, regardless of immigration status, we must not overlook the value of their economic, academic, and cultural contributions to the United States.”

Ochoa Bogh told me she heard from constituents in agriculture and hospitality who complained about the impact of raids. She said her aunt, a citizen, “is afraid to go out and carries a passport with her now because she’s afraid they might stop her.”

The senator said she blames both Democrats and Republicans for the failure to deliver sensible immigration reform over the years, and she told me her own family experience guides her thinking on what could be a way forward.

Her grandfather was a Mexican guest worker in the Bracero Program of the 1940s, ‘50s and ‘60s, ended up being sponsored for legal status, and eventually moved his entire family north. Since then, children and grandchildren have gone to school, worked, prospered and contributed.

If Trump were to respond to her letter and visit her district, Ochoa Bogh said, “I would absolutely have him visit my family.”

Her relatives include restaurateurs, the owners of a tailoring business, a county employee and a priest.

“We don’t want undocumented people in our country. … But we need a work permit process” that serves the needs of employers and workers, Ochoa Bogh said.

Public opinion polls reflect similar attitudes. Views are mixed, largely along party lines, but a Pew study in June found 42% approval and 47% disapproval of Trump’s overall approach on immigration.

A July Gallup poll found increasing support for immigration in general, with 85% in favor of a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors, and 60% support among Republicans for legal status of all undocumented people if certain requirements are met.

So it’s not entirely surprising that a bipartisan congressional immigration reform bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, was introduced in July by a Florida Republican and a Texas Democrat. It would allow legal status for those who have lived in the U.S. for five years, are working and paying taxes, and have no criminal record.

Victor Narro, project director at the UCLA Labor Center, isn’t optimistic, given political realities. But he’s been advocating for immigration reform for decades and said “we need to continue the fight because there will be a time of reckoning” in which the U.S. will “have to rely on immigrant workers to assure economic survival.”

“Germany had to resort to guest worker programs when birth rates declined,” said Kevin Johnson, a former UC Davis law school dean. “We may be begging for workers from other nations in the not too distant future.”

“No side wants to give the other a victory, but there have got to be ways to close that gap,” said Hiroshi Motomura, a UCLA immigration scholar whose new book, “Borders and Belonging: Toward A Fair Immigration Policy,” examines the history and causes of immigration, as well as the complexities of arguments for and against.

“Practically and politically, there’s potential” for reform, Motomura said, and he sees a better chance for rational conversations at the local level than in the heat of national debate. “You’re more likely to hear stories of mixed families … and that kind of thing humanizes the situation instead of turning it into a lot of abstract statistics.”

Ochoa Bogh told me that when she wrote her letter to Trump, the feedback from constituents included both support and criticism. She said she met with her critics, who told her she should be focused on jobs for citizens rather than for undocumented immigrants.

She said she told them she is all for “American people doing American jobs.” But “we have a workforce shortage in the state in various industries,” and a U.S.-born population that is not stepping up to do certain kinds of work.

“I said to them, ‘You can’t keep your eyes closed and say this is what it should be, when there are certain realities we have to navigate.”

So what are the chances of progress on immigration reform?

Not great at the moment.

Emergency dispatch data reviewed by The Times show a major decrease in LAPD calls for service in June, during the weeks when sweeps by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies were met by large street protests in downtown Los Angeles.

In a city where roughly a third of the population is foreign-born, the steep decline in calls adds to long-standing concerns from advocates that aggressive immigration enforcement leads to domestic abuse and other crimes going unreported because victims fear triggering deportations.

In the two weeks after June 6, when the immigration raids kicked off, LAPD calls for service fell 28% compared with the same period last year — an average of roughly 1,200 fewer calls per day.

LAPD officers responded to roughly 44,000 calls for service in that two-week span — versus nearly 61,000 calls during the same days in June 2024.

The calls include reports of serious crimes, such as home break-ins and domestic disputes, along with instances when the public has sought help with noisy neighbors, loud parties and other routine matters.

The data analyzed by The Times do not include all 911 calls — only LAPD calls for service, which are typically registered when a squad car is dispatched. Though multiple people may call 911 in connection with a single incident, in most cases only one LAPD call for service is recorded.

The decrease was especially noticeable for LAPD calls responding to suspected domestic violence and other incidents related to family disputes, which fell this year by 7% and 16%, respectively, after the ICE activity increased. Although family-related calls later began to creep back to 2024 levels, those for domestic incidents kept declining.

National experts said the findings reflect a crisis of public confidence that has followed other controversial incidents. Similar downturns in calls to local police occurred during the first Trump administration, after the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and following the fatal shooting six years earlier of Michael Brown, a Black 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Mo.

It’s hardly surprising that the same thing could happen even in a city where the police force is majority Latino and whose leaders have reaffirmed the city as a sanctuary for immigrants, said Vida Johnson, an associate law professor at Georgetown University.

“You’re going to see fear of law enforcement that is going to last generations,” Johnson said. “And that has the biggest impact on women, because women often are more likely to be victimized, and then more afraid to call for help than men.”

At least some of the decline during the initial two-week period can be explained in part by LAPD going on citywide tactical alert, which allowed the department to have more officers and resources at the ready to deploy to the front lines of the protests. During that time, the department prioritized responding to serious crimes such as shootings and robberies, leading to many other less urgent calls going unanswered.

But that doesn’t explain why calls for service remained down after the department returned to its normal operations. While police call levels began to rise again later in June and early July, they still remained down roughly 5% from the same period in 2024.

The decrease in calls was less pronounced in the nine police districts in South L.A., the San Fernando Valley and the Eastside where Latinos make up the majority of residents, but the data show a persistent dip in domestic violence calls in those areas that remained in the weeks after the immigration enforcement campaign began.

Police calls for service have been on a slow decline for years, a phenomenon that has coincided with a drop in overall crime. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell and other leaders have tried to emphasize in public remarks that local cops are not allowed to enforce civil immigration laws and only work with federal agents to arrest criminal suspects or quell unrest that threatens public safety.

But Carlos Montes, a longtime organizer with the Boyle Heights-based immigrant advocacy group Centro Community Service Organization, said the sight of LAPD officers standing alongside the feds during recent operations has ensured that even more Angelenos will think twice about calling the police for help.

“In general, in the neighborhood we don’t want to call the cops because they’re not going to solve anything or they’re going to arrest someone, or beat someone or shoot someone,” he said.

LAPD Assistant Chief German Hurtado, the department’s immigration coordinator, acknowledged that it has been a struggle to reassure the public it’s safe to call the police.

“Police are also the most visible form of government, and right now people are not trusting the government,” Hurtado said in an interview last month. “People [are] scared to be deported, and that’s totally understandable. That’s something that we’re going to have to deal with and figure out a way to heal with the community.”

In response to what he called “negative publicity” around the LAPD’s actions in recent weeks, he said the department was stepping up its outreach efforts in various immigrant neighborhoods, with a series of planned listening sessions and other events aimed at educating the public.

The department recently launched a citizens academy for Spanish speakers, and senior lead officers have been out meeting with faith and community leaders trying to get them to reinforce the message that police need victims to cooperate in order to solve crimes.

Marielle Coronel, 24, co-owner of a boxing gym in Sylmar, said she worries about being profiled while being out and about, which has also made her think twice about calling police.

Even though she believes that at least some police officers are trying to help, she said the last few months have been unnerving. She recalled how her parents recently gave her a version of “the talk” that many parents of color have with their children about how to deal with police. Their fears have grown to include unidentified masked men posing as ICE agents, Coronel said.

Her parents insisted that she start carrying her passport with her everywhere she goes and that she not lower her window to anyone unless they clearly identify themselves. Tending to her gym’s front desk one recent afternoon, she said she has taken the advice to heart.

“Even if I am a U.S. citizen, you just don’t know,” she said. “We don’t feel like we have backup from the government.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0a2e85/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3113x1634+0+229/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2F7e%2F2b719a9645048ee28635dae65ba9%2Fimmigration-raids-los-angeles-61557.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:57:33.470394

Donald Trump and his closest allies have periodically threatened immigrant rights activists and nonprofits, including those that distribute food and water to migrants or provide immigrants with legal services, with arrest. But their rhetoric has been heightened in the days following the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk this month.

Over the last week, JD Vance described civil rights groups as a “domestic terror movement”, while Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide and the architect of the US president’s mass deportation agenda, vowed that the administration would hold nonprofits, including immigrant-rights and police-reform organizations, “criminally liable” for what he baselessly described as “coordinated attacks” on Ice agents.

And on Tuesday, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) followed up with a warning: “Anyone – regardless of immigration status – who assaults an Ice officer will face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meanwhile, has expanded its definition of “threats” to include the filming Ice operations.

For Brandon Lee, communications director of the immigrant rights non-profit the Illinois Coalition For Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) the threats represented “yet another moment where the Trump administration is attempting to curtail speech, curtail organizing, to scare our people”.

“This is another example of the atmosphere of fear that the administration is trying to create,” said Lee.

Advocates and activists told the Guardian that they are advising staff and volunteers to practice caution while assisting immigrants and filming raids, while also maintaining that they will not “comply in advance” and give up their first amendment rights to document immigration enforcement.

ICIRR, which organizes teams to observe raids and help the families of those affected access legal aid and other resources, has always “been operating within the boundaries of the law”, Lee said.

“In our rapid-response teams, our role is not to intervene in Ice operations. Our team members are aware of their rights to film in public spaces, to share information,” he said. The organization tends to send out volunteers in pairs or groups, and advises them to maintain a distance from officers.

Lee said the latest rhetoric from the Trump administration felt “heightened”, but added groups like his have been dealing with these threats for months. “It’s not as if these tactics are different from what they’ve been threatening throughout the year so far,” said Lee. “It’s not the first time they’ve threatened to go after nonprofits. It’s not the first time that they’ve threatened to go after charitable foundations.”

Federal agents have already, increasingly, been arresting elected officials, protestors and bystanders at immigration raids and detention centers. In New York on Thursday, federal agents and local police arrested a total of at least 71 people – including Democratic lawmakers and activists – who were protesting at a federal building where Ice has been detaining immigrants. Lawmakers had requested access to Ice detention cells and were arrested by federal officers inside the building, while another group had attempted to block the garage doors typically used by Ice to move vans carrying detained immigrants, and the New York Police Department made arrests.

On Friday, federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse a group of about 100 protesters, including two Democratic candidates for Congress, during a series of early morning clashes outside an Ice building on the outskirts of Chicago, and people were apprehended.

The arrests were part of a pattern of aggressive tactics used against protesters and lawmakers seeking to shed light on conditions inside Ice facilities and demonstrate against the agency’s raids.

In May, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting or impeding federal agents as they arrested the Newark mayor Ras Baraka, who was there with a group of lawmakers trying to observe a detention center. In legal filings, McIver has said the indictment overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and notes that McIver’s actions were part of her authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman.

Several charges against protestors have ultimately been dropped or proved to have been exaggerated. A Guardian review of cases brought against anti-Ice protesters in Los Angeles this summer found that several charges were based on false or misleading statements from law enforcement.

This week, a jury found Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester in Los Angeles, not guilty of assaulting a border agent, after footage from a witness – and published by the Guardian – showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito, whereas there was no footage of Ramos-Brito assaulting the officer.

“We’re in an environment and you see a level of aggressiveness [from Ice and other federal agencies] that perhaps you haven’t seen before,” said Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, a group that advocates for immigrant workers in the city.

And, Gudino said, he expects Ice and the DHS could ramp up arrests of advocates and activists. “The unfortunate assassination of this individual, we feel, is only going to compound the challenges that we’ve been experiencing,” he said. “We’re seeing officials, however opportunistically, are blaming immigrants and advocates for the murder of Charlie Kirk.”

But many immigrant rights and civil rights groups said that at least for now, they are planning to work as normal.

“We’ll continue to serve. We’ll continue to follow. And we’ll continue to do the best that we can under the circumstances. And, you know, we can only hope that, you know, justice and fairness will prevail,” said Melissa L Marantes, executive director of the Orlando Center for Justice, which provides legal aid for immigrants and their families.

That resilience chimed in Texas.

“What gives me a little bit of hope is that – at least in the nonprofit social justice and immigrant justice movement here in Texas – I think we’re tougher than big corporate media and big law,” said Dustin Rynders, legal director, Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit that advocates for a legal advocacy organization. “We’re all fighters.”

And for some groups, particularly those who organized during Trump’s first time in office, the crackdown feels all too familiar.

Project South, an advocacy group based in Atlanta, has for decades helped mobilize communities in the south to push for policy changes, organize protests and provide legal support. In 2020, the group represented an Ice nurse whistleblower who said immigrant women detained at an immigration jail in Georgia were being subjected to non-consensual gynecological procedures, including hysterectomies.

Project South has learned from its experiences from that period, said Azadeh Shahshahani, the legal and advocacy director for the group. Back in 2017, Project South and other groups were surveilled by Ice after they sought to raise awareness about a suicide at a Georgia detention center.

“Instead of cowering in fear, we will continue to organize our communities and protect and defend each other,” Shahshahani added.

This shocking disregard for American workers and their role in our nation's future is unpatriotic.","A new proposal by Senator Jim Banks aims to restructure the H-1B visa system, drastically raising wage requirements and limiting alternatives companies use to hire foreign workers.

The legislation, titled the American Tech Workforce Act, was introduced this week.

Why It Matters

The bill targets what Banks, an Indiana Republican, and other critics call corporate exploitation of immigration loopholes, particularly in the tech industry. An H-1B visa is a temporary, employment-based visa that allows U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialty fields such as technology, engineering and medicine.

Republicans remain split over the H-1B visa program. While some argue that it displaces American workers and is open to abuse, others view it as a tool to fill labor gaps in sectors such as technology. Opponents frequently emphasize the program's potential effects on U.S. employment.

What To Know

The proposal would increase the wage floor for H-1B visa recipients from $60,000 to $150,000, eliminate the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, and replace the current lottery-based selection process with a highest-bidder system.

Banks argued that the current framework enables large tech corporations to undercut U.S. wages by importing foreign workers en masse.

""Corporations rigged the system to flood the country with cheap foreign labor and drive down wages,"" Banks said in a statement to Breitbart News. ""This bill puts American workers first.""

The American Tech Workforce Act includes three main reforms. First, it increases the minimum required salary for H-1B visa holders from $60,000 to $150,000, which may disincentivize companies to look abroad for talent.

The bill would also eliminate the OPT program, which allows foreign graduates to work in the U.S. for up to three years post-graduation.

Thirdly, the bill replaces the current lottery system with a model awarding visas to the highest-bidding employers, adding a cost-based filter to discourage misuse.

Banks hopes that the changes are essential to address what he calls ""domestic outsourcing.

What People Are Saying

Senator Jim Banks, while serving in the House, in 2022: ""Big Tech is setting aside some of the most lucrative and valuable career opportunities in America and giving them exclusively to foreign guest workers.

""They're cutting out Americans to save a few bucks. It's domestic outsourcing. This shocking disregard for American workers and their role in our nation's future is unpatriotic. We must fix Big Tech's incentives, so they begin putting Americans first.""

What Happens Next

The legislation will now enter committee review in the Senate, where it is expected to face significant scrutiny from business advocacy groups and immigration reform opponents.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2725938/jim-banks.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 11:57:29.326502

Calderon and his family had already gathered evidence about the gang killing of a relative in their home country, Honduras. They had filed an asylum claim and were scheduled to appear in immigration court for a final hearing in August, he said.

Calderon hoped that if he got a lawyer, he could win release on bond. And maybe, just maybe, he and his wife could win their asylum case and stay in Michigan with their 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter, both of whom were included in the same asylum case.

Calderon waited inside the lockup while his wife and sister talked with immigration lawyers. As weeks passed, his hopes began to fade.

Two immigration law firms refused to represent Calderon, saying they didn't have the resources to take on his case, his sister Esther Calderon later told Law360.

A third law firm was willing to represent Calderon — if the family made an immediate payment of $12,000 — no installments, all the money up front, she said.

The family couldn't afford to pay.

""I started to get more depressed,"" Ricardo Calderon told Law360 in a Spanish-language interview. ""Because my time was running out, and I didn't have an answer, if they were going to help me, and all that.""

As of late July, Calderon had been locked up for weeks, still had no lawyer, and said he had been attacked by gang members inside the detention center. He was facing a deportation order and had no apparent way to fight it.

""So we are just, you know, waiting for a miracle,"" his sister wrote in a July 24 text message to Law360.

As the Trump administration follows through on campaign promises to arrest and deport millions, immigrants are increasingly finding that hiring a lawyer is impossible.

New policies are making immigration cases far harder to win — and far more expensive for lawyers to handle, especially when the clients are already locked up in detention.

Immigration lawyers across the country are overwhelmed with demand. Some immigration lawyers told Law360 that they are routinely turning down clients.

The lawyers also spoke of the mental strain of fighting a government that's bent on deporting as many people as possible.

The increasing inability to find legal representation is a problem not only for immigrants, but also for their U.S. citizen children, who may be detained and expelled along with them, and for other U.S. citizens or authorized immigrants who are swept up in immigration arrests.

The difficulty of hiring a lawyer goes hand in hand with other Trump administration actions against immigrants, including summary arrests of immigrants showing up for court dates and new restrictions that make it harder for immigration judges to grant relief.

The result of these and other federal actions is the same: Immigrants lose.

Under President Donald Trump, more and more immigrants have little to no access to due process — no real chance to prove in court that they deserve asylum protection or another form of immigration relief.

In some cases, they may have no chance to prove that they are an authorized immigrant or a U.S. citizen that the government has arrested by mistake.

Critics like Timothy Snyder, a historian of European dictatorships and mass killings, say the Trump administration's attacks on immigrant due process harm everyone and move the nation closer to authoritarian government.

His argument: If immigrants don't have due process, then no one is safe.

""It is due process, and due process alone, that allows you to demonstrate that you are a citizen,"" Snyder wrote in a blog post earlier this year.

""Without it, the masked men in the black vans can simply claim that you are a foreign terrorist and disappear you.""

Photos of a Corpse

Calderon said the story of his family's emigration to the U.S. began in 2021 in Honduras.

A gang that was active in the area began pressuring family members to join, including his wife's cousin, 29-year-old Cristian Mauricio Meza, who was living with their family.

Calderon said that when the family refused the gang's recruitment efforts, the gang retaliated against the relative.

""So they came and took him from the house where we were living,"" Calderon said. ""And then about two days later, he was found dead.""

His body was in horrific condition. ""They shot him 14 times,"" Calderon said. ""They knifed him and burned him. He was bound hand and foot.""

The gang made threats. ""They told us that we would be next.""

Law360 was unable to verify the account of the killing through news media coverage in Honduras, and Calderon said he no longer had access to documents related to the killing.

However, Honduras has struggled for years with widespread violence and extortion by organized crime groups. The violence, corruption and poverty have prompted many Hondurans to flee.

Calderon and his wife left for the United States with their young son and daughter in October 2021.

After a lengthy journey across Guatemala and Mexico, they finally walked into an official border crossing point at Calexico, California, and requested asylum, Calderon said.

The family's decision to present themselves to border officials and request asylum was a common one.

Border officials often told migrants to appear for a future immigration court date in the U.S. interior, and let them go.

Released from custody, Calderon, his wife and their children took a plane to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Calderon's wife's sister had settled.

Ricardo Calderon went to work as a roofer. After initial immigration court dates in 2023 and 2024, the family's final asylum hearing was set for August 2025 in Detroit, he said.

Calderon and his wife had gathered evidence to support their asylum claim, including details of the killing of his wife's relative.

""We had photos of him, what he looked like when they discovered his body,"" Ricardo Calderon said. ""We had his death certificate. We had some audio recordings that we received in Mexico from the same gang.""

Immigrants from Central America often lose their asylum cases. One key factor: U.S. asylum law mainly protects people who face oppression from a government, not from a private actor like a gang.

Still, immigration law was changing all the time. Smart attorneys could help clients craft a case that could sometimes win, despite the narrow asylum rules.

That is, if the immigrants could get an attorney. For Ricardo Calderon and his wife, it was proving difficult.

The exact details are unclear, but Calderon's sister in Memphis, Tennessee, shared messages with Law360 that suggest the family's initial asylum application was filed by the nonprofit Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.

But Ricardo Calderon said the family never managed to hire an attorney who could offer them full representation in immigration court.

""No, we didn't have one because the numbers that we called, they didn't answer — and there were some who told us they couldn't take our case, and others who don't take asylum cases,"" he said.

Ricardo Calderon would never make it to the August court date. His June arrest would throw the couple's plans into turmoil.

Slimy Beans in a For-Profit Prison

It's unclear why the authorities arrested Calderon. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't make an official available for an interview.

But the Trump administration is arresting and detaining thousands of people in the U.S. interior.

The president has painted this as a necessary step, portraying immigrants as bloodthirsty criminals, but the data doesn't back up his claims. Researchers from the federal National Institute of Justice and the libertarian Cato Institute have concluded that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens do. That's true even when the immigrants are in the country illegally.

As of this month, about 59,000 people were being held in ICE detention, and 71% of them had no criminal conviction, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC, which collects and publishes government records.

Calderon and his sister said he has no criminal record. Law360 searched federal and Michigan databases and found no criminal records that matched Calderon's name and date of birth.

After the men surrounded Calderon's vehicle on the morning of June 19, he was brought to an immigration office in Detroit.

He said he was asked to sign a document to accept deportation back to Honduras.

""I told them I wasn't going to sign a deportation agreement, that I wanted to see a judge,"" he recalled.

He said he was transferred to North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, a small town about a 200-mile drive from Ann Arbor.

The prison had been closed until recently, but days before Calderon's arrival, as the Trump administration expanded immigration detention, it was reopened as an immigration lockup run by a private company, the Geo Group Inc.

Calderon said conditions were grim.

""They give you beans with corn. The beans are canned, but all slimy — in bad condition. The first two weeks I was there, I lost weight because the food wasn't good.""

""I lived a very ugly experience there.""

Lawyers Start Saying No

With Calderon locked up, his wife in Ann Arbor and sister Esther Calderon, who lives in Memphis, began calling lawyers.

Esther Calderon shared text messages that appear to show that the family consulted again with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, a nonprofit legal resource center.

Susan Reed, director of the center, told Law360 she can't talk about the Calderon case.

But she said Trump administration budget cuts have cost the nonprofit organization a $375,000 federal grant to run a help desk at the Detroit Immigration Court. A big federal grant to represent unaccompanied children is at risk, too. The instability has prompted dozens of staffers to quit, she said.

Under Trump, the statewide organization has lost roughly half its lawyers — from about 50 attorneys in January to just 27 lawyers now, she said — and it's lost several nonattorney support staffers, too.

Every day, five to 10 people call the organization's free hotline for immigration detainees in Michigan, she said.

And most of those detainees are receiving bad news. Though the nonprofit still offers free legal advice, the organization stopped offering full representation in new detention cases around Sept. 10, Reed said.

""We just really understood we did not have capacity to take new cases.""

She said detention cases are ""incredibly difficult.""

""The detention facilities are far away. People are moved around from facility to facility. Clients don't have access to their paperwork or documents.""

She said the experience of being locked up often leads immigrants to accept deportation. ""And that's something that immigration enforcement authorities understand — that detained people very, very often simply give up.""

She said the situation puts a big emotional strain on the staff.

""And you have to say no to a lot of callers who desperately need our help,"" she said. ""Because there's just no way to sustain and serve people well at a certain point when you're beyond your capacity.""

Unable to find a lawyer through the nonprofit, Ricardo Calderon's wife contacted Farah Al-khersan, a solo immigration lawyer in Ann Arbor.

A paralegal replied in a Spanish-language email.

""Unfortunately, our office lacks the capacity to take on a case like this one, which requires many months in court,"" the email reads in part.

In an interview with Law360, Al-khersan said she can't talk in detail about what happened in Calderon's case due to attorney-client privilege.

But she said detained clients usually need her to prepare a written motion for release on bond and to do the work under ""a huge time crunch.""

It can take days to gather the necessary documents from the detainee's friends and family, such as any marriage certificates, birth certificates of any children, and details about how the family would pay the bond amount.

And Trump has taken steps that restrict judges from releasing immigrants on bond, making the bond request process all but hopeless, Al-khersan said.

Once a judge denies bond, it only gets worse. Immigrants have to wait months in prison for a hearing. Most don't want to do it and accept deportation, she said.

Several times a week, families of detained immigrants contact her office, she said. She almost always turns them down.

""In the last few weeks, I haven't taken a single detained case,"" Al-khersan said.

She's the only attorney in her law firm, and she sees rejecting these cases as a matter of self-preservation. She said she wants to focus on other cases where her help could make a real difference.

""If I could take every case, I would. But I have to prioritize my resources, just to conserve my own sanity and emotional toll that we're all experiencing as removal defense attorneys.""

$150 For an Initial Consultation

The Calderon family contacted another Michigan firm, Immigration Law PLLC, and spoke with a nonlawyer staffer.

""They were asking us to pay $12,000 before they could even start looking at paperwork and all that,"" Esther Calderon said.

For the 27-year-old, who works as an administrator in a health clinic, the financial terms were impossible.

""Because $12,000 is not something that I can just give out, not even on a credit card,"" she said.

The initial consultation alone cost $150, according to a photo of a receipt that she shared with Law360.

The principal of Immigration Law PLLC, attorney Brad Thomson, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Esther Calderon said she regretted that she couldn't help the older brother she'd grown up with in Honduras, part of a big family raised by a single mother.

""I have always felt that I need to look out for him, and he always looks out for me.""

Far Fewer Immigrants Have Attorneys Today

Calderon's wife and sister told him the bad news about the immigration law firms. ""At that point, I began to lose all hope of going free,"" he said.

The stories of immigration lawyers refusing to represent clients might surprise Americans who grew up watching TV shows and movies that depict police officers reading Miranda rights to someone they have arrested: ""You have the right to remain silent ... You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.""

But this right applies in criminal cases. In deportation proceedings, the immigrant generally has no right to a free lawyer. Immigrants must either find a lawyer who's willing to work for free or at a big discount, or gather enough money to hire an attorney for pay.

Without a lawyer, immigrants usually find themselves in an impossible situation: facing off against a trained government attorney who argues for their deportation.

Even children sometimes have to face government lawyers alone. Without lawyers, immigrants almost always lose.

Today, the overwhelming majority of immigrants in deportation proceedings are appearing without a lawyer, according to data from TRAC.

One factor: not enough lawyers. At the start of this year, the American Immigration Lawyers Association counted only about 17,000 members in the U.S.

Even before Trump took office, there were too few immigration attorneys to handle an influx of new immigrants that had swelled the immigration court backlog to 3.3 million cases, TRAC wrote in a January 2024 report.

""Five years ago, noncitizens had found attorneys in 65% of all pending cases in the court's backlog. Today, this proportion has dropped to just 30%,"" the center wrote.

By the 2025 fiscal year, that proportion had dropped even further, to about 23%, meaning that fewer than one in four immigrants now has a lawyer.

It's Happening Everywhere

Stories like the Calderon family's struggle to hire a lawyer are increasingly common, said Jeff Joseph, a Denver immigration lawyer and president of the board of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

""You have this perfect storm of more demand for services, less able and willing attorneys able to do it, and the cost of providing legal services has also gone up,"" he said.

In addition to the Trump administration's funding cuts to legal aid nonprofits, the federal government is also placing far more immigrants in detention, he said.

The administration has also made it much more difficult for lawyers to represent immigrants who have been detained, Joseph said.

""In the past, if somebody gets arrested and detained, you have a minute to meet with them, figure out why they're being detained, prepare a bond motion and get it before a judge,"" he said.

""Now you don't have a minute anymore. People are getting arrested. They're being moved around from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Attorneys are having to basically follow their clients with habeas corpus motions as they're being moved around from state to state.""

The cost difference is dramatic, he said.

""If you had me estimate, I'd say it's probably three times more expensive to defend an immigration case now than it was under Trump 1.0,"" Joseph said.

And the government won't settle cases through negotiations, he said.

""In every single case, there's no settlement, there's no negotiation,"" Joseph said. ""Every case is going to full-scale war.""

In the long term, Joseph said, the solution is to train more immigration lawyers by encouraging law schools to learn the specialty, and to deregulate some elements of immigration law practice to allow more clients to access resources. In the short term, lawyers are fighting the government in court.

In Memphis, another immigration attorney, solo practitioner Andrew Rankin, said demand for his services is heavier than he's ever seen, and he's likewise rejecting clients. ""It's saturated. I have to turn away one out of every two people that call me.""

""Dead serious. Because I have to manage by my moral code and my ethical code, how much I can take at once.""

Unseen Attackers

Calderon said his first immigration court hearing inside the detention center came on June 27.

In Michigan, detention center hearings usually are held by immigration judges assigned to the Detroit Immigration Court, who often appear by video, said Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for the immigration court system.

Calderon said he told the judge he didn't have a lawyer. He asked the judge if he could leave detention, maybe with a bond or with an ankle monitor.

""Then the prosecutor told the judge no. And then the judge told me he couldn't do it,"" Calderon said.

A few days later, he said, he was sitting outside in a patio area in the detention center when people approached.

""They came up to where I was sitting and then I felt a blow in my back. And when I tried to turn around and look, I felt another blow and I fell over.""

He said he covered his face to protect himself, and he still doesn't know exactly who attacked him or why.

But based on what another detainee said, he believes the unseen attackers were Venezuelan gang members.

Law360 asked private prison company Geo Group to respond to Calderon's statements about bad food and the attack by other detainees.

Company spokesperson Christopher V. Ferreira referred questions to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE didn't respond to requests for comment.

Calderon said he wasn't seriously injured in the attack, but the incident rattled him. He didn't want to be locked up anymore.

On July 16, Calderon arrived for another appearance before the judge at the immigration court within the lockup.

""Then he told me if I wanted to wait for my next court date, I would have to wait there, detained,"" Calderon recalled.

""Or I could ask for my deportation.""

""Because of what had happened to me inside, I didn't want to stay in detention, because of that fear.""

He accepted deportation. An online database confirms that on July 16, he was ordered removed from the United States.

He said he never got a chance to present the evidence from his asylum case: the photos of the corpse, the death certificate, the threatening messages.

He recalled that on the day that he was ordered deported, he was one of 10 detainees appearing before the judge. He said none had a lawyer.

Flying Back in Chains

Calderon's deportation wouldn't take place for several more days. He said he was transferred to Virginia, then Louisiana, where a deportation plane took him to Honduras on July 28.

""To tell the truth, I was crying as I came back. I was crying as I came back because I couldn't believe I was returning once again to the place that I had left, knowing that they [the Honduran gang members] were going to hurt me.""

""So I didn't know what I was going to do. And what's more, I was coming in chains. I came with feet and hands handcuffed, in chains.""

""So I came sad because I had left my family behind, and I didn't know where I was going and where I would stay.""

One of his wife's relatives picked him up from an airport in Honduras and took him to her home.

He recalled all of this — his family's journey to the U.S., his arrest, detention and deportation — during an audio interview from Honduras via WhatsApp.

Calderon said that during the weeks he was locked up in immigration detention, he told his son and daughter in phone calls that he was away working.

Now, he finally told them the truth.

""When I got here to Honduras, I told them to forgive me for not telling them, but now I'm in Honduras.""

""And they started to cry, and told me they wanted to come here with me.""

Around the same time, his wife was packing up his clothes and other belongings to send to him. ""And the boy and the girl said that they could fit in the box too, and that we should send them here, that they wanted to be with me.""

In an Aug. 5 interview — his ninth day back in Honduras — he said he was hiding inside the house, for fear of being spotted by the gang members that had threatened him.

Calderon and his wife hadn't yet decided what to do. They were considering bringing her and the children back to Honduras, then finding a safer place to live somewhere else in the country, he said.

Law360 isn't publishing his city within Honduras in order to protect his safety.

In subsequent text messages in August and September, Calderon declined followup interviews, saying he was busy working.

In the Aug. 5 interview, he said his effort to stay in the United States might have turned out differently if he had a lawyer.

""I say it would have been good. Because the last lawyer who advised my wife said that I could have won my case. Because we had a good asylum claim.""

He sees the situation as fundamentally unfair.

""It's an injustice that they're doing,"" he said.

U.S. District Judge P. Casey Pitts granted a temporary restraining order that requires Columbian asylum-seeker Ligia Garcia to be released from detention at San Francisco’s Immigration Court, where she was held after a Thursday arrest following her immigration hearing.

The American Civil Liberties Union says that the 54-year-old Garcia spent over 24 hours in ICE custody, and reportedly suffers from high blood pressure and is hard of hearing in one ear.

Garcia is one of the four named plaintiffs in an ACLU class action filed Thursday who were either arrested or nearly arrested after an immigration hearing, and is one of two plaintiffs that remain in ICE custody.

Pitts, a Joe Biden appointee, determined that Garcia’s Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated by her detention and her release will have minimal impact on the government.

“Because Ms. Garcia has resided in the United States for 18 months — certainly long enough to ‘begin to develop … ties’ and become ‘a part of our population’ — the Fifth Amendment’s due process protections apply to that liberty interest,” Pitt wrote.

Pitt’s order also prevents her re-arrest and detention, “without first providing her with a pre-detention bond hearing before an immigration judge at which the government establishes by clear and convincing evidence that her detention is necessary to prevent her flight or to protect the public,” the judge said.

However, Pitts did deny another named plaintiff, Yulisa Alvarado Ambrocio, a temporary restraining order because she is not currently detained. The ACLU said in its complaint that intervening attorneys negotiated with ICE agents against her arrest, because she is currently breastfeeding an infant.

During that negotiation, ICE agents reportedly required Alvardo Ambrocio to check in every six months and did not guarantee she wouldn’t be arrested at her next hearing on October 16.

According to the ACLU, one plaintiff, Martin Hernandez-Torres, is currently still detained, and has been since Wednesday — well over the 12-hour limit ICE waived in June, “without making changes to its operational procedures and practices necessary for longer-term incarceration consistent with constitutional requirements, such as providing people with a place to sleep, access to hygiene products, or access to prescribed medication,” the ACLU claims in its Thursday suit.

Hernandez-Torres and Garcia seek to represent a class of people “who are or will be subjected to inhumane and punitive conditions at 630 Sansome and ICE’s arbitrary and capricious policy permitting the detention of immigrants in temporary holding rooms for up to 72 hours,” the ACLU says.

“Arresting people when they come to court is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes, not a constitutional democracy. It undermines the very foundation of our legal system. The plaintiffs in this case include community members who are following the law by coming to court, only to be arrested. Coupled with the horrific conditions at 630 Sansome, these policies represent a profound breakdown of the rule of law,” Nisha Kashyap, Racial Justice Program Director for Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, said in a Thursday statement.

The ACLU is joined in filing the suit by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco and CARECEN, an immigrant legal services center.

The Thursday complaint follows an Aug. 1 petition for writ of habeas corpus filed for named plaintiff Carmen Aracely Pablo Sequen, who was similarly detained by ICE but released after a day.

The defendants of the case — including Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi, among other San Francisco ICE officials — must show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued in favor of the plaintiffs at the next hearing on September 30 in San Jose.

The town hall, which was at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, was coordinated by several elected officials representing the Lafayette area, including state Sen. Brach Myers, state representatives Annie Spell and Josh Carlson, and Lafayette city councilwoman Liz Webb Hebert.

The elected officials were asked about whether they supported several immigration proposals in the Louisiana legislature, including HB 436, which would limit non-legal residents from certain legal remedies in car crashes.

“If someone is not of legal status, they are not legally driving around, in the field of insurance it's a hard argument to say that that person should be awarded damages the same way that a person who has legal status is,” Spell said.

Carlson echoed the statement saying, “If you’re not in the country legally, and you hit someone, then I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that you don't have the right to recover.”

These comments drew pushback from attendees.

“Any human being in this country and in this state has human dignity,” said Brooke Arceneaux, one of several community members in attendance to challenge statements made by the legislators on the topic. Arceneaux went on to compare the legislation to alleged human rights violations at an immigration detention center in Basile.

“At the Basile detention facility there are documented cases of abuse from the warden… he sexually abused them, allegedly. Just because someone isn't a legal citizen of Louisiana, do they have no rights?”

Spell pushed back.

“I see sexual assault as very different from a car accident,"" she said. ""In statute, if a sexual act occurs to any human being, legal status or not, there's prosecution.”

This led to a tense exchange between Spell and an attendee that ultimately segued into the town hall’s abrupt end.

“You're denigrating them (non-legal residents) by calling them an economic issue… We're talking about human beings here… and what rights and responsibilities we have towards them as a society. We're asking you for your opinion on that, and what we're hearing back is talk about insurance,” the attendee said.

Spell responded: “The bills that were addressed were specifically regarding access to services and so I was speaking to that.”

Car insurance was also a focus of discussion.

One attendee, who was involved in an automobile crash with an uninsured driver earlier this year, asked about the possibility of requiring insurance agents to to let policyholders know about the existence of Collision Deductible Waivers (CDW) that can be added onto their policy whenever significant changes are made to the plan. CDW's are waivers in which automobile insurers will cover deductibles in cases where the party at fault is uninsured.

“I was called to public service to solve problems like this,"" said Myers, who serves on the Senate Insurance Committee. ""When I hear from you that that’s an issue, to me that’s an issue now that we’re going to solve.""

On the question of lowering auto insurance rates, Hebert touted various LCG policies aimed at reducing the number of crashes, which she said will lead to lower rates.

“We ran a campaign at various intersections within my district,"" she said. ""We’re installing more and more flashing speedometers. These are effective ways of slowing people down.”

The legislators were also asked about gerrymandering in the state in light of the ongoing Supreme Court case over Louisiana’s current congressional district map, which features two majority-minority districts, and whether the current map in their view is gerrymandering along racial lines.

“Where the Constitution provides guidance, where the Supreme Court provides guidance, that’s the guidance we need to follow,"" Myers said.

In addition to questions and public comments, the legislators used the opportunity to tout several recent changes to the structure of the Louisiana government, as well as promote an upcoming constitutional amendment on the ballot in April, which will allow $2 billion across multiple trust funds to be used for teacher pay raises.

”This is a way to take money that’s generated very little each year for education, and say, ‘let’s pay off debt, let’s free up money at the state an local level, and higher ed, and lay our teach $2,000-$2,500 more a year',"" Carlson said.

The town hall comes as the Louisiana state legislature is currently in between sessions, and could possibly meet for a special session. All four elected officials are eligible for reelection in the 2027 state general election.

The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that the administration wrongly ended Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden's presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration's emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rY40ukO9Gqx1M8azzmgSHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/fb5e9dfec30b1ab1b7894b35026c4c8f,N,,2025-09-20 09:58:50.403864

Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.
“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in.
I don't know what to do.’” The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney.
The advocates are also calling on New York State legislators to go into special session to pass the New York for All Act, prohibiting local law officials across the state from colluding with immigration officials.","The immigration raid at a Cato protein bar factory more than two weeks ago continues to have ripple effects through the community. About 50 advocates and allies gathered in Fulton Friday to share how dozens of families have been traumatized by the sudden removal of family members by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE agents. Advocates are calling the raid a human rights violation.

“We had a lot of folks who were detained, missing for one to two weeks, could not make phone calls to lawyers or their family members,” said Marc Alessi. He’s an organizer with the Syracuse Immigrant and Refugee Defense Network.

“A few individuals, we didn't even know where they were being held or what state they were being held in. They were shuffled between three or four different border patrol locations to make it harder for them to contact lawyers and families.”

He said they still don’t know the whereabouts of six of the 69 people detained or deported.

Jessica Maxwell is director of the Workers Center of Central New York, and said they continue to hear stories of intimidation and threats the workers faced inside the plant. This includes not only undocumented workers, but those with valid working papers.

“This is really sending shockwaves so that now we are having people call saying, I thought I was safe, but now I don't know,” Maxwell said. “’I have my working papers, but now I'm not sure that's enough. I don't know what to do.’”

The workers said ICE agents ignored their papers and pleas to speak to an attorney. One of them was an adult son who was deported to Guatemala. Melina Ivanchikova is an organizer with Finger Lakes Rapid Response, which jumps into action during urgent immigration situations. She reads a message from the son’s mother.

“’In our household now, we have only one wage earner supporting nine people now that they took my son,”’ the mother said in her letter. ‘“We have two newborns and are going through a lot. We feel fear. Every day we are asking, what is going to happen tomorrow?’”

The family has been in Central New York for nine years. Finger Lakes Rapid Response has launched an online fundraising campaign.

Ana Mendez is Western New York Regional Coordinator for Rural and Migrant Ministry, which is tied to many of the families impacted by the raid.

“We have sat with families who are afraid to open the door when someone knocks. We have heard children crying at night, asking when mama or papa is coming home,” Mendez said. “We have seen families forced to choose between buying food and paying legal fees. And we have witnessed a deep fear and humiliation caused when people are treated as disposable rather than as human beings. This is not about politics. This is about humanity.”

Jessica Maxwell with the Workers Center said they shouldn’t be the only ones speaking out.

“If you're an employer with immigrant workers, then it is your responsibility to take action,” she said. “There should be dozens of employers standing here calling out these abuses and calling for permanent pathways for their workers.”

Nutrition Bar Confectioners is running at a fraction of its capacity after losing so many workers.

The groups also called on local and state elected officials to take action. They want Oswego County lawmakers to pass a no-collusion resolution to prohibit the county sheriff and probation department from supporting immigration-related actions. They were involved in the Cato raid.

The advocates are also calling on New York State legislators to go into special session to pass the New York for All Act, prohibiting local law officials across the state from colluding with immigration officials. There’s no indication yet that lawmakers are ready to act on either bill.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e38a01b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5e%2F2d%2Fd1d1a4524e2b82da6e1479b36deb%2Fimmigration-rally-signs.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 07:56:56.859510

The protest is part of steady pushback against an immigration enforcement surge focused on Chicago and surrounding communities, which has put more federal agents on the streets charged with delivering on President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations. The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that almost 550 people have been arrested as part of an operation that launched just under two weeks ago.

Friday’s protest included dozens of people carrying American flags and signs with the words “Hands off Chicago.” Some participants tried to block a car from exiting the facility’s yard and were met with federal officers who deployed chemical agents that released white clouds that drove the protesters back, according to videos taken outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago.

The Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, which provided legal observers for Friday’s protest, said at least 10 people were arrested by federal agents. They also reported that some people were injured and required hospitalization, according to Brad Thomson, an attorney with the guild.

“Our legal observers saw less-lethal force such as pepper balls and tear gas used indiscriminately against demonstrators, legal observers, and the media,” he said late Friday in an email to The Associated Press.

Earlier in the day, ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin had said in a statement to the AP that three people were taken into custody.

The Broadview site is a two-story building that has been used to temporarily hold immigrants before they’re detained or deported. Its windows have been covered with wood boards for weeks. Protesters have regularly gathered there, including Catholic nuns who pray during vigils.

Friday’s protest drew advocates, residents and Democratic officials or politicians — several of whom were among the protest crowd affected by the officers’ response.

Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate who has joined protesters on several days, told the AP that she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas Friday as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car.

Abughazaleh said officers dragged one of her friends away before others picked her up and threw her on the pavement. Abughazaleh said agents then used tear gas and pepper balls, causing her eyes to run and her throat to burn.

“Protesters were completely peaceful,” she said. “We had no weapons, just signs and songs. We were afraid and angry.”

ICE officials, meanwhile, described the protesters as “rioters” and accused them of assaulting law enforcement, slashing car tires and blocking the entrance of the facility.

Demonstrators gathered outside the building again on Friday evening. Video posted online showed protesters falling back when white smoke filled the air and officers in gas masks exited a gate.

McLaughlin said local police refused to answer multiple calls for assistance from federal law enforcement. The Broadview Police Department did not immediately respond to messages Friday.

Activists and local leaders lately have stepped up pushback to the surge of immigration agents in the Chicago area, aiming to deter agents, warn residents and keep attention on a man killed by an immigration officer last week.

Authorities said agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who had entered the country illegally. They said Silverio Villegas Gonzalez evaded arrest and dragged an officer with his vehicle. The government said the officer fired because he feared for his life.

“They want us to be afraid,” Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Democrat, said in reference to the Trump administration. “They want us to just kind of go into our little corners and not do anything. ... We’re not going to let that happen.”

Experts are concerned that a smaller population could lead to a reduced workforce, higher living costs and a shortage of elder care.

States with aging populations and declining birth rates, like Ohio, may be among the first to feel the negative impacts.

The Trump administration's immigration crackdowns and"" One Big Beautiful Bill"" are driving the United States toward a smaller and slower-growing population, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is projecting.

The prediction has population experts concerned for the nation's economic future, as fewer people in the U.S. means a smaller workforce, as well as higher costs of living and a shortage of elder care.

If the CBO's predictions become true, some experts warn that Ohio would be among the first to feel the impact, as a state with an aging population, dropping birth rates and a declining number of working age people.

""What is disappointing is how counterproductive this all is,"" said Reanne Frank, a professor of sociology at Ohio State University, who specializes in immigration and social demography. ""It frustrates me to no end that these demographic facts were not given more attention during the last presidential election.""

What the numbers show

Due to federal actions and new immigration policy, deaths are expected to exceed births in the U.S. starting in 2031, in part because of fewer immigrants having children in the U.S. due to deportations and detentions. The country's population is expected to grow from 350 million to 367 million by 2055, according to the report.

It's a rapid turnaround from their January report, which gave the U.S. until 2033 before deaths would start exceeding births and predicted the population would grow from its current 350 million to 372 million by 2055.

In the short term, at least 290,000 immigrants are expected to be ""removed"" from the U.S. and 30,000 are expected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023 saw the lowest birth rate in U.S. history, with approximately 1.62 births per woman on record. That’s well below the 2.1 replacement rate needed to maintain the population. Despite that, immigration was expected to help the country's economy stave off any economic or labor issues, according to Michael Betz, an associate professor in Ohio State University’s Department of Human Sciences.

Immigrants typically come to the U.S. to work, meaning they're of working age and likely family-building age, which contributes not just to the economy but also the birth rate — an overlooked benefit of immigration, Frank said.

The CBO acknowledges that these projections could change again as quickly as they did from January, due to legislative or administrative decisions.

Where does Ohio stand?

Roughly 5.5% of Ohio's population is made up of immigrants, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. That's far behind the country's 15.4%, though Columbus is at nearly 10%.

Ohio has a population decline problem, according to sociology experts and state officials. A report issued by the Ohio Department of Development in 2023 projects that the state's population will fall by about 675,000 people by 2050, and the lowest number of births on record in Ohio was in 2023.

Betz warned that conversations around immigration crackdowns often put focus on illegal immigration without considering what could be considered ""high skill"" immigration, which he calls ""America's superpower.""

""If it becomes such a hostile environment for all immigrants, then those high-skilled immigrants are less likely to come to the United States,"" he said, adding that the U.S. risks those immigrants taking their talents elsewhere.

""The real issue here is that immigration has once again become highly politicized,"" Frank noted. ""It does not bode well for our country's projected demographic trajectory, as the CBO update shows.""","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/11/NCOD/84142312007-ice-out-protest-ac-026.JPG?crop=4499,2531,x0,y234&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-20 06:56:33.588505

In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.","Washington — The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states this week, warning California, New York, and Illinois in letters obtained by CBS News that refusal to honor immigration detainers could trigger federal legal action.

In letters dated Sept. 10, Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons ordered the attorneys general of the three states to declare within two days whether they would comply with ""thousands of ICE detainers"" lodged against individuals in state custody, according to DHS. Immigration detainers are formal requests by ICE asking local jails and prisons to notify the agency before releasing an individual, and to hold them briefly so federal agents can take undocumented migrants into federal custody.

According to DHS, Illinois and New York formally declined to cooperate. California did not respond. On Sept. 18, Lyons sent follow-up letters obtained by CBS News accusing each state of obstructing immigration enforcement and vowing to enlist the Department of Justice in response. Senior DHS officials tell CBS News the department will tap the DOJ to sue states, blocking future federal funding.

In his follow-up letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Lyons wrote that the state's refusal ""will result in thousands of criminal aliens being released into Illinois communities,"" adding that ""ICE will engage with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures against you.""

Lyons wrote in his letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, ""I take this lack of response to mean that you will continue refusing to honor ICE detainers, resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into California communities.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James received a similar warning after two aides to Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed the state would not expand cooperation, according to DHS.

CBS News has reached out to all three attorney general's offices for comment.

In a statement to CBS News, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote, ""These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities — threatening the American people's lives and wellbeing.""

A DHS spokesperson tells CBS News that the agency has arrested roughly 400,000 undocumented immigrants since the start of the Trump administration, and 70% of those arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.

Among those released by state authorities include undocumented migrants charged with sex crimes on minors, multiple assaults on police officers with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, as well as those with drug trafficking and weapons charges, a DHS spokesperson said.

Federal regulation dictates that immigration detainers instruct local jails and prisons to hold someone for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE can take custody. Historically, federal courts have ruled that these detainers are requests, with some local and state authorities outlawing compliance. Some courts have also found that holding people without a judge's warrant can raise constitutional challenges, citing the Fourth Amendment's protections against unlawful detention.

California, New York, and Illinois have each passed laws limiting compliance with ICE detainers.

California law bars local police from honoring detainers, except for individuals convicted of select serious crimes, while New York law restricts cooperation, requiring judicial warrants rather than administrative detainers to detain undocumented migrants. The New York attorney general's office advises local police departments not to honor ICE detainers unless they are accompanied by warrants issued by judges. Illinois' TRUST Act also prohibits state and local law enforcement from detaining individuals without a judicial warrant.

Supporters of city- and state-level ""sanctuary"" laws typically argue the policies lead to greater trust between local police and residents whose immigration status may make them reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement or report crimes.

But the Trump administration argues ""sanctuary"" policies make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented migrants, prompting the federal agency to send more law enforcement agents into American communities to conduct arrests on the streets. Those operations have drawn protests in major cities like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in recent months, leading to some clashes with ICE and several arrests.

In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.

In his warnings to state attorneys general, Lyons underscored that ICE prefers cooperation but will not allow what he calls ""inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction"" to continue, though he fell short of specifying exactly how the Justice Department will pursue lawsuits or other federal action in the coming weeks.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/21/b8c25668-886b-42b3-a0a4-a72f3ed11e5c/thumbnail/1200x630/36dea2c6a614e46988a9036708eea032/gettyimages-2215060401.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 09:59:03.778651

The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working.","On September 6, after months of litigation against the Trump administration, a federal judge ruled that Venezuelan immigrants could renew their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States. However, after the ruling was handed down, only about 20 people gathered to celebrate outside the Arepazo restaurant in Doral, Florida — a focal point of the largest Venezuelan enclave in the country.

“Under normal circumstances, you would have seen 2,000 people here at Arepazo. When [former Venezuela president Hugo] Chávez died [in 2013], 2,500 came and blocked the streets. This shows that people — despite the judge’s decision — aren’t so sure. They say, ‘I’d rather stay home; I’m not going to risk being caught by the police and thrown out of the country.’ There’s fear,” says José Antonio Colina, president of Venezuelans Persecuted in Political Exile (VEPPEX). He speaks with EL PAÍS while sipping coffee at the restaurant, the only one in the area with a statue of Simón Bolívar.

In recent months, the Venezuelan diaspora has seen how the government they once supported appears to have abandoned them. The Trump administration has tried to strip them of Temporary Protected Status and has canceled humanitarian immigration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands to live and work legally in the country. U.S. authorities are detaining asylum seekers in immigration courts, while the official narrative associating Venezuelans with the Tren de Aragua criminal organization is stigmatizing them.

At the same time, President Trump has gone on a war footing against the Nicolás Maduro regime: he has sent warships to the edge of Venezuelan territorial waters and has raised tensions with Caracas to their highest point in years. In the current context, Venezuelans in the United States are presented simultaneously as victims of Chavismo — the political movement that has governed Venezuela since Chávez’s rise to the presidency in 1999 — and as criminals on American soil.

In Doral — a city that’s about 25 miles northwest of Miami — one in three people is of Venezuelan origin. And Trump’s immigration policy has been a tough pill to swallow. The majority of voters in the young city are affiliated with the Republican Party, according to figures from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office.

Many residents sponsored relatives under the Biden administration’s programs. Some beneficiaries have had to leave the country, or are hiding for fear of arrest. Others have been in the U.S. for decades and have been politically active against Maduro’s regime, which would expose them to a serious risk of persecution or retaliation if deported. And all watch in bewilderment as the Trump administration deploys destroyers to combat drug trafficking off the coast of Venezuela — a country that it deems as being safe to return to.

“It’s completely traumatic. It’s one thing to search for undocumented immigrants and another thing to place people in a situation in which they’re not in the country legally,” Colina says. “They’re not seeing us as a community affected by political problems, but as a number of migrants who could be deported to fulfill an electoral promise. The Venezuelan community that voted for Trump voted to remove Maduro from power, not to remove Venezuelans from the United States.”

TPS allows people from countries facing exceptional circumstances — such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises — to live and work legally in the United States. It must be renewed every 18 months. Some 250,000 Venezuelans received TPS in 2021 — including Colina — after years of advocacy to protect those who had fled the Maduro regime and were unable to return, while their asylum cases trickled through immigration courts.

Another 350,000 Venezuelans were granted protection in 2023, when the United States concluded that “extraordinary conditions” persisted in Venezuela and redesignated the country’s citizens as being eligible for TPS. Before leaving office, former president Joe Biden extended TPS until 2026, but in January of 2025, the Trump administration reversed this measure. Immigrant rights groups sued, sparking a legal battle against the government.

Federal Judge Edward Chen blocked the measure this past March. Subsequently, in May, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The court said the government had the authority to terminate TPS, but didn’t suspend the litigation or Chen’s case. In early September, Chen ruled that the government’s move to eliminate TPS was unlawful.

DHS Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin argued in an email to EL PAÍS that TPS “was never intended as a de-facto amnesty program” and that “the Biden administration exploited TPS programs to allow poorly-vetted migrants to gain entry into the country, from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers.” Paradoxically, however, the State Department warns its citizens against traveling to Venezuela due to the “high risk” of insecurity, such as arbitrary detentions, terrorism, and kidnappings, as well as civil unrest and crime.

Johanna is a Venezuelan citizen who came to the U.S. in 2021. She asks that EL PAÍS not reveal her identity, for fear of retaliation from immigration authorities. She tells this newspaper that she has experienced the unrest surrounding TPS in court with anguish. And, even though she applied for the extension, she has lost faith in the system. “We’ll have to see if the government will respect the judge’s decision,” she sighs. She says that, in Doral — where she works as a waitress in a restaurant — there’s a lot of fear. When she drives with her eight-year-old son, the boy looks out the window looking for police officers to warn her, for fear of being stopped.

Following the judge’s ruling, many rushed to renew their TPS before the deadline expired on Wednesday, September 10. However, the website wasn’t allowing the process, causing confusion and panic. On Friday, September 12, the same federal judge ruled that the renewal service must be reestablished.

Judge Chen’s recent decisions have taken many by surprise. “Lots of people have already left the country,” Isamar Torres points out, because they were disappointed or pessimistic. A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral. She believes the government is trying to “clean up” what the previous administration did.

“They want to find every person — regardless of nationality — and remove them. Their problem is that Venezuelans have TPS, meaning that they cannot be deported,” Torres adds. Many of those who entered through the land border “weren’t given due process, because so many people were transiting.” Thus, she affirms, “many criminals entered. Because it’s no secret that Nicolás Maduro’s regime opened all the prisons.” She repeats an argument that Trump has made numerous times, without evidence.

Torres indicates that most of the TPS renewals that her business has put together recently are “from 2021, from people who have been here for many years.” Some have multiple ongoing immigration processes, including asylum applications, so they “waited until the last minute” to renew their TPS. However, some have chosen to leave the U.S.

On Wednesday, September 10, she met a client who had a ticket to return to Venezuela that Friday. “He says he’s afraid and prefers to leave before being deported. He’s a decent person; he paid his taxes on time every year he’s been here. He’s never even had a fine,” Torres says.

That’s what 22-year-old Bárbara Reyes did, returning to Venezuela on April 7, 2025, the same day her TPS expired. Her aunt — a resident of Doral — had sponsored her under the humanitarian parole program. The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working. But she wasn’t able to study.

“I was trying to process the paperwork to study, but it seemed more and more difficult without permanent residency,” she tells EL PAÍS by phone from Caracas. She wanted to enroll at Miami Dade College, but because of her status, she couldn’t receive the in-state discount, which Florida discontinued in March of this year. “With the pressure of Trump coming and starting with the ‘I’m going to kick everyone out’ speech, I said, ‘I don’t want to give all I’ve got to one place just so they can kick me out.’”

Colina says that “criminals came in through the border, but so did good people,” including activists he knows who were imprisoned in Venezuela, as well as former officials “who refused to repress [the population].”

“But unfortunately,” he adds, “this administration doesn’t differentiate between the two. It seems that, in some ways, [for them], Venezuela is politically unstable, but in others, it isn’t.”

The Department of Homeland Security argues that it’s not in the national interest to keep these people in the country, claiming that conditions in Venezuela have improved enough for them to return. But in recent weeks, U.S. ships, warplanes and a nuclear submarine have positioned themselves near the coast of the Caribbean nation, generating tensions. This has led Nicolás Maduro’s regime to mobilize its troops in response.

Colina says that there’s hope among the public that “if they’re removing TPS and are in this operational deployment in the Caribbean, it’s because [the U.S. government] is going to remove Nicolás Maduro from power.” However, while it seems like a “somewhat excessive” deployment to combat drug trafficking, it doesn’t seem sufficient “for an invasion.” Reports indicate that there are currently about 4,500 U.S. troops in the Caribbean.

He finds it contradictory that the government wants to remove TPS under these conditions. “Maduro is still there,” he notes. He also doesn’t believe there’s a plan in place, nor a political opposition that’s ready for a transition of power. “It’s not just about removing TPS and removing Maduro. What about the transition?” he wonders.

Mariana Torrellas — the owner of a jewelry business in Doral — sponsored two relatives under the Humanitarian Parole program. She and her husband arrived in the US 10 years ago with their two children. They’re very grateful for the stability they enjoy. She’s Catholic and joined a foundation called Virgen de Coromoto to help the community.

After the social unrest that began in Venezuela in 2014 — which left dozens dead and thousands injured and detained — she saw her fellow Venezuelans arrive, fleeing with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “We helped them with food, furniture and temporary accommodation while they settled in, because there were people sleeping in the Walmart parking lot,” she recalls. She says that her country has always been supportive and welcoming of immigrants, regardless of where they come from. An estimated seven million Venezuelans have left their country as a result of the crisis.

DHS said in an email that those “whose TPS or parole status has expired — or who are otherwise in the country illegally — should take advantage of the CBP Home self-deportation process,” which supposedly gives migrants a free ticket and $1,000.

Torrellas says it’s not that simple. She knows some folks who have returned to Venezuela — especially young people, including the relatives she sponsored — but there are others who don’t have that option. “Especially families with children,” she emphasizes.

Helene Villalonga — president of the Multicultural Association of Activists, Voice and Expression (AMAVEX) — says that the recent court ruling has been “a respite” for thousands of families who “have lived in uncertainty for years.” However, she vows that they will “continue fighting for a permanent solution.”

“TPS is a relief,” she acknowledges, “but it’s not the final goal: we need a path to residency.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WHWGL7GXYVC4ZFYJLNMIAZZXCA.jpg?auth=5404abbc5b9560b4f815d3e342efad7921aa6c4780e175fd76cd5a918dc02d7e&width=1200,N,,2025-09-20 11:57:53.105966

President Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.

""We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have relied on the program to hire foreign workers.

The plan was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.

The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.

Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

""This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,"" a White House aide said.

Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.

""The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,"" Anderson told CBS News.

Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.

President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.

The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March study from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.

“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” he told reporters at the White House.

H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills – such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers – to work in the US, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.

Administration officials said the change to the H-1B programme would ensure that companies would only sponsor workers with the most rarefied skill sets.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.

However, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.

The programme has come under increased scrutiny from the Trump administration amid a wider crackdown on immigration, which the US president has tied to boosting domestic labour.

As part of that campaign, the Trump administration has also sought to introduce more restrictive policies on international students studying in the US, including requiring access to social media accounts and a ban on foreign travellers from several countries.

‘Taxing away innovation edge’

The Trump administration has previously considered changing the H-1B visa rules to favour higher-paying employers, essentially doing away with the lottery system.

Supporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.

Lutnick said on Friday that “all the big companies are on board” with $100,000 a year for H-1B visas.

“We’ve spoken to them,” he said.

He added that the visa would cost $100,000 a year for each of the three years of its duration, but that the details were “still being considered”.

Trump’s move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, said Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

Some analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US’s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China.

“In the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the US risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,” said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.

Others questioned the legality of the new fees.

“Congress has only authorized the government to set fees to recover the cost of adjudicating an application,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director of the American Immigration Council, wrote on Blue Sky.

Under the current system, entering the lottery for the visa requires a small fee and, if approved, subsequent fees could amount to several thousand dollars.

This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas, with more than 10,000 awarded. The company was followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Bridge Contracts Still Require Justification: Agencies often use bridge contracts to maintain continuity, but they still must comply with FAR rules.","In GovCIO, LLC v. United States, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Nos. 25-809 & 25-913 (August 18, 2025), in one of the first cases to test the impact of a Trump Administration Executive Order on federal procurement, GovCIO and 22nd Century Technologies challenged the IRS’s sole-source bridge contract to Iron Mountain for scanning and digitizing incoming tax filings. The agency had bypassed competition, invoking an “urgent and compelling need” based on Executive Order 14,247, which mandated digital payments and a shift away from paper-based systems by late 2025.

The plaintiffs argued that the agency’s justification was flawed, lacked support in the administrative record, and used the executive order to sidestep full and open competition in violation of procurement law. The Court agreed in part, holding that the Limited Sources Justification (LSJ) failed to adequately explain the link between the executive order and the agency’s urgency claim which is a key legal requirement under FAR 8.405-6.

The Decision

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims sustained the protest, ruling that:

Standing Upheld for Both Protesters: The government and intervenor argued that GovCIO and 22nd Century lacked standing because they had not submitted proposals or demonstrated immediate harm. The Court rejected those arguments, holding that both firms showed they could have competed and were prejudiced by the lack of competition. The Court held that this satisfied both Article III and statutory standing requirements.

Executive Order Did Not Justify the Urgency: While the IRS claimed that the executive order necessitated fast-track digitization, the Court found the LSJ did not actually explain how the mandate for digital payments created an urgent and compelling need for a noncompetitive bridge contract to scan incoming tax documents. The agency’s counsel attempted to explain the connection during litigation, but the Court refused to accept post hoc rationales, citing the well-established rule that agency decisions must be justified in the record, not in briefing.

Digitization Mandate Was Already Underway: The Court noted that the IRS had been pursuing digitization for years through pilot programs and prior initiatives well before the executive order. Therefore, the government could not credibly claim that the executive order suddenly created urgency that would justify a sole-source award.

Remand Without Injunction: Although the Court found the LSJ legally deficient, it declined to enjoin the award. Instead, it remanded the procurement to the IRS for 30 days to either supplement the justification or issue a new decision. The Court noted that halting work on the digitization project would be disruptive and expensive, and a brief remand provided a less drastic, more appropriate remedy.

Key Takeaways for Contractors

Executive Orders Don’t Override Competition Requirements: Even a presidential mandate must be clearly linked to a specific procurement decision if the agency intends to invoke an urgent and compelling need to skip competition. That reasoning must appear in the contemporaneous record.

Post Hoc Justifications Don’t Count: Arguments from agency counsel, no matter how compelling, cannot substitute for what’s missing in the administrative record. Agencies must connect the dots at the time of award.

Standing Is Broader Than You Think: Even if you didn’t submit a proposal, you can have standing if you show that you were prepared to compete but were denied the opportunity due to a flawed procurement strategy.

Remand Without Vacatur Can Be a Win: The Court’s refusal to vacate the award doesn’t diminish the protest’s impact. By identifying legal deficiencies and ordering a remand, the Court forced the agency to revisit its justification and provide transparency.

Bridge Contracts Still Require Justification: Agencies often use bridge contracts to maintain continuity, but they still must comply with FAR rules.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had more than 5,000 approvals each.
The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on Bluesky: “the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas.
H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.","Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, dealing a potentially major blow to the US tech industry, which relies heavily on workers from India and China.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said at a Friday press briefing that “all the big companies” had been briefed on the new fee.

“A hundred-thousand dollars a year for H-1B visas, and all of the big companies are on board. We’ve spoken to them,” Lutnick said at an Oval Office event with the US president.

“If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,” he said.

Trump’s threat to crack down on H-1B visas has become a major flashpoint with the tech industry, which contributed millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. The tech industry relies, more than any other sector of the US economy, on H-1B visa holders. Roughly two-thirds of jobs secured through the H-1B program are computer-related, government figures show, but employers also use the visa to bring in engineers, educators and healthcare workers.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon had more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had more than 5,000 approvals each. The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.

Critics of the program, including many US technology workers, argue that it allows firms to suppress wages and sideline Americans who could do the jobs. Supporters, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, say it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive. Musk, himself a naturalized US citizen born in South Africa, once held an H-1B visa.

Adding new fees “creates disincentive to attract the world’s smartest talent to the US”, Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, wrote on X. “If the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.”

The new fee could significantly push up costs for companies, particularly smaller tech firms and startups.

“Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they are going to depart and the company is going to hire an American,” Lutnick said at the briefing. “And that’s the point of immigration. Hire Americans and make sure the people coming in are the top, top people. Stop the nonsense.”

Immigration experts are questioning whether the executive branch has the authority to impose the exorbitant annual fee.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said on Bluesky: “the president has literally zero legal authority to impose a $100,000 fee on visas. None. Zip. Zilch. The only authority Congress has ever given the executive branch here is to charge fees to recover the cost of processing the application.”

Under the current system, H-1B applicants pay a small fee to enter a lottery and, if selected, subsequent fees that can amount to several thousand dollars, depending on the case. Nearly all the visa fees have to be paid by employers. H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb, or raise more money from, legal immigration. Last month, the US launched a pilot program allowing consular officers to demand bonds of up to $15,000 for tourist and business visas from countries with high overstay rates or limited vetting data. That followed Trump’s June travel ban restricting entry from 19 nations. Trump’s first-term administration issued several regulations that aimed to limit access to H-1B visas and give them to higher-paying employers, but the regulations were blocked in federal court.

In an emergency request filed Sept. 19, the Justice Department said the high court should pause a federal judge's September ruling that the administration wrongly ended a program that allowed the migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States due to living conditions in their country.

The Supreme Court sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted the federal judge's temporary order to keep the program in place as the case is being litigated.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said the lower courts are disregarding the high court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in his request. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision included no explanation for why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said, the courts have more evidence now to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security ran a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

""Neither we nor the Supreme Court had the benefit of reviewing this evidence when the Government first sought an emergency stay of the district court’s March 31 postponement order,"" they wrote.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

Jessica Bansal, TPS counsel with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Trump administration ""has been systematically de-documenting lawful immigrants, spreading fear and chaos by stripping people of their immigration status and work authorization in unprecedented ways and on little to no notice.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/19/USAT/86247320007-usatsi-27033472-168410238-lowres.jpg?crop=1408,793,x0,y100&width=1408&height=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-20 02:57:12.650116

“We’re here today to denounce all the attacks on migrants rights, all the attacks on Filipino activists by the Marcos-U.S. dictatorship,” said activist Brendan Lee, an organizer with the San Francisco Committee for Human Rights in the Philippines.

“We have Filipino migrants who aren’t being assisted by their Philippine government, who are being arrested and deported by the Trump administration,” said Andan Bonifacio, a Stanford graduate and Filipino activist. Filipinos in the country, he said, “are among those being targeted by the ICE crackdown right now, including crew ship workers, hospital workers, caregivers.”

“We went to the U.S. immigration court. We had speakers talk about how immigrants are being pulled off the street, they’re being pulled out of the courthouse, abducted and deported,” added Lee, a San Francisco native with Chinese ancestry who was shot four times by the Filipino military for his work as an activist. The attack left him paraplegic.

The Filipino government, organizers said in a statement, “has offered little to no assistance to Filipino migrants in detention.” The number of Filipinos in San Francisco immigration court has decreased dramatically since the late 1990s, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

In 2024, 82 Filipinos went through immigration court in San Francisco, down from a high of 531 in 1998, according to TRAC. Across California, migrants from the Philippines are the ninth most populous in ICE proceedings, behind Colombia and ahead of Armenia.

Outside of the San Francisco immigration court, speaker Pilar Castille denounced ICE tactics against her countrymen. “Trump directs ICE agents to terrorize migrant communities to kidnap our people. Filipino migrants are left to languish in ICE detention while the Philippine state washes their hands of responsibility.”

The consulate did not immediately respond to a request for comment but in July said in a statement that allegations of the government neglecting Filipinos in ICE custody were inaccurate. “Consulate officials conducted an onsite visit and welfare check on Filipino nationals” held by ICE, it wrote.

The protest, which was organized by BAYAN USA, the Malaya Movement, ICHRP-US and the Tanggol Migrante Movement, also took aim at the Filipino consulate and denounced the government for corruption, among other things.

A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral.
The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working.","On September 6, after months of litigation against the Trump administration, a federal judge ruled that Venezuelan immigrants could renew their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States. However, after the ruling was handed down, only about 20 people gathered to celebrate outside the Arepazo restaurant in Doral, Florida — a focal point of the largest Venezuelan enclave in the country.

“Under normal circumstances, you would have seen 2,000 people here at Arepazo. When [former Venezuela president Hugo] Chávez died [in 2013], 2,500 came and blocked the streets. This shows that people — despite the judge’s decision — aren’t so sure. They say, ‘I’d rather stay home; I’m not going to risk being caught by the police and thrown out of the country.’ There’s fear,” says José Antonio Colina, president of Venezuelans Persecuted in Political Exile (VEPPEX). He speaks with EL PAÍS while sipping coffee at the restaurant, the only one in the area with a statue of Simón Bolívar.

In recent months, the Venezuelan diaspora has seen how the government they once supported appears to have abandoned them. The Trump administration has tried to strip them of Temporary Protected Status and has canceled humanitarian immigration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands to live and work legally in the country. U.S. authorities are detaining asylum seekers in immigration courts, while the official narrative associating Venezuelans with the Tren de Aragua criminal organization is stigmatizing them.

At the same time, President Trump has gone on a war footing against the Nicolás Maduro regime: he has sent warships to the edge of Venezuelan territorial waters and has raised tensions with Caracas to their highest point in years. In the current context, Venezuelans in the United States are presented simultaneously as victims of Chavismo — the political movement that has governed Venezuela since Chávez’s rise to the presidency in 1999 — and as criminals on American soil.

In Doral — a city that’s about 25 miles northwest of Miami — one in three people is of Venezuelan origin. And Trump’s immigration policy has been a tough pill to swallow. The majority of voters in the young city are affiliated with the Republican Party, according to figures from the Miami-Dade County Supervisor of Elections Office.

Many residents sponsored relatives under the Biden administration’s programs. Some beneficiaries have had to leave the country, or are hiding for fear of arrest. Others have been in the U.S. for decades and have been politically active against Maduro’s regime, which would expose them to a serious risk of persecution or retaliation if deported. And all watch in bewilderment as the Trump administration deploys destroyers to combat drug trafficking off the coast of Venezuela — a country that it deems as being safe to return to.

“It’s completely traumatic. It’s one thing to search for undocumented immigrants and another thing to place people in a situation in which they’re not in the country legally,” Colina says. “They’re not seeing us as a community affected by political problems, but as a number of migrants who could be deported to fulfill an electoral promise. The Venezuelan community that voted for Trump voted to remove Maduro from power, not to remove Venezuelans from the United States.”

TPS allows people from countries facing exceptional circumstances — such as natural disasters or humanitarian crises — to live and work legally in the United States. It must be renewed every 18 months. Some 250,000 Venezuelans received TPS in 2021 — including Colina — after years of advocacy to protect those who had fled the Maduro regime and were unable to return, while their asylum cases trickled through immigration courts.

Another 350,000 Venezuelans were granted protection in 2023, when the United States concluded that “extraordinary conditions” persisted in Venezuela and redesignated the country’s citizens as being eligible for TPS. Before leaving office, former president Joe Biden extended TPS until 2026, but in January of 2025, the Trump administration reversed this measure. Immigrant rights groups sued, sparking a legal battle against the government.

Federal Judge Edward Chen blocked the measure this past March. Subsequently, in May, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The court said the government had the authority to terminate TPS, but didn’t suspend the litigation or Chen’s case. In early September, Chen ruled that the government’s move to eliminate TPS was unlawful.

DHS Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin argued in an email to EL PAÍS that TPS “was never intended as a de-facto amnesty program” and that “the Biden administration exploited TPS programs to allow poorly-vetted migrants to gain entry into the country, from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers.” Paradoxically, however, the State Department warns its citizens against traveling to Venezuela due to the “high risk” of insecurity, such as arbitrary detentions, terrorism, and kidnappings, as well as civil unrest and crime.

Johanna is a Venezuelan citizen who came to the U.S. in 2021. She asks that EL PAÍS not reveal her identity, for fear of retaliation from immigration authorities. She tells this newspaper that she has experienced the unrest surrounding TPS in court with anguish. And, even though she applied for the extension, she has lost faith in the system. “We’ll have to see if the government will respect the judge’s decision,” she sighs. She says that, in Doral — where she works as a waitress in a restaurant — there’s a lot of fear. When she drives with her eight-year-old son, the boy looks out the window looking for police officers to warn her, for fear of being stopped.

Following the judge’s ruling, many rushed to renew their TPS before the deadline expired on Wednesday, September 10. However, the website wasn’t allowing the process, causing confusion and panic. On Friday, September 12, the same federal judge ruled that the renewal service must be reestablished.

Judge Chen’s recent decisions have taken many by surprise. “Lots of people have already left the country,” Isamar Torres points out, because they were disappointed or pessimistic. A 35-year-old Venezuelan who arrived in the United States in 2016, she owns a form-preparation business in Doral. She believes the government is trying to “clean up” what the previous administration did.

“They want to find every person — regardless of nationality — and remove them. Their problem is that Venezuelans have TPS, meaning that they cannot be deported,” Torres adds. Many of those who entered through the land border “weren’t given due process, because so many people were transiting.” Thus, she affirms, “many criminals entered. Because it’s no secret that Nicolás Maduro’s regime opened all the prisons.” She repeats an argument that Trump has made numerous times, without evidence.

Torres indicates that most of the TPS renewals that her business has put together recently are “from 2021, from people who have been here for many years.” Some have multiple ongoing immigration processes, including asylum applications, so they “waited until the last minute” to renew their TPS. However, some have chosen to leave the U.S.

On Wednesday, September 10, she met a client who had a ticket to return to Venezuela that Friday. “He says he’s afraid and prefers to leave before being deported. He’s a decent person; he paid his taxes on time every year he’s been here. He’s never even had a fine,” Torres says.

That’s what 22-year-old Bárbara Reyes did, returning to Venezuela on April 7, 2025, the same day her TPS expired. Her aunt — a resident of Doral — had sponsored her under the humanitarian parole program. The young woman had spent two years in the United States, during which she spent a lot of time working. But she wasn’t able to study.

“I was trying to process the paperwork to study, but it seemed more and more difficult without permanent residency,” she tells EL PAÍS by phone from Caracas. She wanted to enroll at Miami Dade College, but because of her status, she couldn’t receive the in-state discount, which Florida discontinued in March of this year. “With the pressure of Trump coming and starting with the ‘I’m going to kick everyone out’ speech, I said, ‘I don’t want to give all I’ve got to one place just so they can kick me out.’”

Colina says that “criminals came in through the border, but so did good people,” including activists he knows who were imprisoned in Venezuela, as well as former officials “who refused to repress [the population].”

“But unfortunately,” he adds, “this administration doesn’t differentiate between the two. It seems that, in some ways, [for them], Venezuela is politically unstable, but in others, it isn’t.”

The Department of Homeland Security argues that it’s not in the national interest to keep these people in the country, claiming that conditions in Venezuela have improved enough for them to return. But in recent weeks, U.S. ships, warplanes and a nuclear submarine have positioned themselves near the coast of the Caribbean nation, generating tensions. This has led Nicolás Maduro’s regime to mobilize its troops in response.

Colina says that there’s hope among the public that “if they’re removing TPS and are in this operational deployment in the Caribbean, it’s because [the U.S. government] is going to remove Nicolás Maduro from power.” However, while it seems like a “somewhat excessive” deployment to combat drug trafficking, it doesn’t seem sufficient “for an invasion.” Reports indicate that there are currently about 4,500 U.S. troops in the Caribbean.

He finds it contradictory that the government wants to remove TPS under these conditions. “Maduro is still there,” he notes. He also doesn’t believe there’s a plan in place, nor a political opposition that’s ready for a transition of power. “It’s not just about removing TPS and removing Maduro. What about the transition?” he wonders.

Mariana Torrellas — the owner of a jewelry business in Doral — sponsored two relatives under the Humanitarian Parole program. She and her husband arrived in the US 10 years ago with their two children. They’re very grateful for the stability they enjoy. She’s Catholic and joined a foundation called Virgen de Coromoto to help the community.

After the social unrest that began in Venezuela in 2014 — which left dozens dead and thousands injured and detained — she saw her fellow Venezuelans arrive, fleeing with nothing but the clothes on their backs. “We helped them with food, furniture and temporary accommodation while they settled in, because there were people sleeping in the Walmart parking lot,” she recalls. She says that her country has always been supportive and welcoming of immigrants, regardless of where they come from. An estimated seven million Venezuelans have left their country as a result of the crisis.

DHS said in an email that those “whose TPS or parole status has expired — or who are otherwise in the country illegally — should take advantage of the CBP Home self-deportation process,” which supposedly gives migrants a free ticket and $1,000.

Torrellas says it’s not that simple. She knows some folks who have returned to Venezuela — especially young people, including the relatives she sponsored — but there are others who don’t have that option. “Especially families with children,” she emphasizes.

Helene Villalonga — president of the Multicultural Association of Activists, Voice and Expression (AMAVEX) — says that the recent court ruling has been “a respite” for thousands of families who “have lived in uncertainty for years.” However, she vows that they will “continue fighting for a permanent solution.”

“TPS is a relief,” she acknowledges, “but it’s not the final goal: we need a path to residency.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/WHWGL7GXYVC4ZFYJLNMIAZZXCA.jpg?auth=5404abbc5b9560b4f815d3e342efad7921aa6c4780e175fd76cd5a918dc02d7e&width=1200,N,,2025-09-20 14:57:17.907913

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden's presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted ""with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration's emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c6ddf93e-0ed2-4b7d-a9b2-8eac1cf08735/wirestory_693aa73df19f5a899133ebb5bf440f03_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-20 04:56:34.852618

People who risked everything to escape persecution, often because they helped US forces, now find themselves treated as unwanted cargo under the Trump administration’s anti-migration policy.

Trump’s expanded deportation programme targets an estimated 10 million foreign-born people who live in the USA but lack proper legal documentation. This includes people who entered the country without authorisation, whose visas have expired, who’ve had their asylum claims denied, whose temporary protected status has lapsed, or whose legal status has been revoked or suspended. Within a hundred days of Trump’s inauguration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had arrested over 66,000 people and removed over 65,000. Some 200,000 had been deported by August.

But the Trump administration isn’t simply removing undocumented immigrants to their countries of origin. It’s increasingly embracing a particularly cruel tactic: dumping people in distant countries they’ve no connection with. This deportation strategy shows how the US government is willing to flout basic humanitarian principles in pursuit of political goals.

The government has invoked an obscure immigration law to deport people to other countries, offering financial incentives or applying diplomatic pressure to compel states to accept US deportees. Around a dozen have recently accepted such deals, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Paraguay in the Americas, and Eswatini, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda in Africa. This geographic spread dispels any pretence that the policy is about returning people to transit countries: it’s about finding anyone willing to accept money in exchange for unwanted human cargo.

The programme is nakedly transactional, with rewards taking the form of direct payments, trade concessions, sanctions relief and diplomatic benefits. Uganda signed a formal agreement with the US government amid US sanctions on government officials, suggesting it traded migrant acceptance for improved diplomatic relations and potential sanctions relief. Rwanda’s deal coincided with US-brokered talks over the Democratic Republic of the Congo conflict, indicating that the deportation agreement was being leveraged in unrelated diplomatic negotiations. It’s highly unlikely the US government will criticise the human rights records of repressive states such as El Salvador, Eswatini and Rwanda now it’s struck migration management deals with them.

Human rights flouted

Although the USA has a long history of outsourcing asylum processing, these practices have been taken to another level under Trump. The administration is prepared to deport people to war zones, authoritarian states and directly to prison. These arrangements violate core principles of international law, including the right to seek asylum and the prohibition against returning people to places where they’ll face danger.

A particularly shocking example involves Venezuelan deportees sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Centre, an overcrowded jail notorious for human rights abuses. In March, the US government accused 238 Venezuelan men of being gang members based on little more than tattoos and fashion choices to justify their expedited removal to this hellish facility. The administration agreed to pay El Salvador US$6 million to house deportees, effectively buying prison space for people whose only crime was seeking safety in the USA. These deportees were later returned to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap, raising further questions about the use of migrants as diplomatic pawns.

Trump’s approach isn’t limited to recent arrivals. Unlike previous policies focused on border enforcement, it targets longtime residents – people who’ve spent years building families, careers and community ties.

This has sparked unprecedented resistance. People have mobilised in ways that transcend traditional political divides, with teachers protecting students’ families, employers refusing to cooperate with raids, religious leaders offering sanctuary and neighbourhoods forming mutual aid networks and early warning systems.

In response to ramped-up ICE raids seeking to fulfil arrest quotas of 3,000 people a day, people have protested in cities across the USA. Resistance has been particularly intense in sanctuary cities such as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco – primary targets for federal operations to arrest migrants. Civil society activists have confronted ICE agents, blocked deportation vehicles, protested at airports and launched boycott campaigns against companies profiting from deportations.

The scale of resistance has prompted an unprecedented federal military intervention, with the government illegally deploying over 4,000 national guard troops and 700 marines to Los Angeles.

A choice to be made

Trump’s policies are legitimising xenophobia and racism, poisoning political discourse and polarising society. When it’s the world’s most powerful democracy that treats refugees as tradeable commodities, it sends an unmistakable signal to all the world’s authoritarian leaders: human rights are negotiable.

The USA faces a choice between two different versions of itself. It can continue down the path of transactional cruelty, treating human beings as problems to be exported, empowering authoritarian regimes and undermining international law. Or it can fulfil its humanitarian and human rights obligations, provide safe and legal pathways for migration and help address the root causes that force people to flee their homes.

The USA must suspend all offshore migration management agreements, stop deporting asylum seekers to unsafe countries and countries they have no connection with and restore the principle that seeking safety isn’t a crime but a fundamental human right.

John B. Larson(link is external).

The statement, posted to the official Homeland Security website, refers to the assassination last week of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and two recent assaults on ICE agents. The statement includes a quote from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin but text outside the quote also uses partisan language. It is entitled “DHS Calls for Media and Far Left to Stop the Demonization of President Trump, His Supporters, and DHS Law Enforcement.”

“Following the evil act of political violence in the country this week and two brutal assaults on our brave ICE law enforcement last week, we are once again calling on the media and the far left to stop the hateful rhetoric directed at President Trump, those who support him, and our brave DHS law enforcement,” McLaughlin is quoted as saying in the statement.

“This demonization is inspiring violence across the country. Our ICE officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them. We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed. This violence must end.”

A long list naming members of Congress, Democratic politicians, TikTokers and the ACLU follows with screenshots of conservative social media accounts quoting their criticisms of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many are from Rapid Response 47, which is attributed to the Trump and the White House. DHS describes the list as “violent rhetoric against DHS law enforcement.” Most of the criticism, including from Larson, likens ICE to the Gestapo, secret police, the SS, a neo-Nazi and a Nazi group.

Larson, who recently called on Congress to pass the No Secret Police Act, which would require ICE agents to identify themselves and prohibit them from wearing masks, and the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, to prevent ICE raids at schools, hospitals, courthouses, and places of worship, is shown in a video(link is external) shouting, “This is not Germany. That’s the SS and the Gestapo. This is the United States of America – unmask yourselves.”

Larson and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong described the DHS statement as “targeting Rep. Larson and immigrant advocates for speaking out against ICE’s abusive tactics and reaffirmed their commitment to defending constitutional rights and holding the Trump Administration accountable for its attacks on free speech and civil liberties.”

The statement comes as Trump has blamed left-leaning groups for Kirk’s murder and threatened to crack down on “dangerous” political speech. Following Kirk’s murder thousands of Democrats were targeted with calls for their firing, expulsion or investigation for social media posts deemed celebratory or critical of Kirk. In Connecticut, at least one local official(link is external) has stepped down after backlash for a social media post.

It also coincides with the indefinite suspension of late-night ABC host(link is external) Jimmy Kimmel over comments about conservative response to Kirk’s death. Trump had previously called for Kimmel’s firing and Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, have called it censorship and government coercion.

While Republicans have decried Democrats as inciting political violence, Larson and Tong alleged the DHS post itself is dangerous.

“This report is reckless, and this kind of irresponsible tagging of political enemies needs to stop…. ,” Tong said. “We have to do better. But if I know one thing about John Larson, he will not be silenced. He’s going to keep speaking up—loudly—to call out wrongs when they occur, to defend our rights and our democracy, and to protect Connecticut families. And he’s going to do that with his voice and his votes, and it is incumbent upon all of us to see and know the difference between forceful and necessary democratic protest and bloodshed.”

Gary Rose, professor of politics and scholar in residence at Sacred Heart University, said the DHS statement is a departure from normal workings of a government agency.

“It’s very atypical for an executive agency to be calling out members of Congress and what is particularly interesting about that is that these agencies depend on congressional support for their survival,” Rose said by phone Thursday. “It’s very unusual to see the hostility against Congress.”

The politicization is, he said, a symptom of the partisan division that is endemic in American society today.

“It’s a reflection of the atmosphere we’re living in. Each side believes the other is hostile – that’s what’s going on here. And for Kristi Noem and others to be accusing members of Congress, it is a reflection of what has emerged in American politics these days,” Rose said.

At Sacred Heart in Fairfield and across the country, he said, meetings and discussions are taking place about toning down rhetoric and working to restore civility. Several leaders have called this moment an inflection point in American politics and culture in which leaders should seek unity amid increasingly divisive views often perpetuated on social media in order to stem a wave of political violence.

Rose said he didn’t hold much hope that would occur.

“It’s getting worse and it’s going to get worse in the days and months and years ahead. I can’t say it’s just associated with the Trump presidency but I will say it has accelerated greatly under him,” Rose said. “Trump has the largest megaphone on that and he certainly can keep that going for as long as he wants but on the other side we have (U.S. Sen.) Chris Murphy and some people from Congress who also have megaphones.

“They really see it as important to placate their unique constituencies and it does sustain them. If it didn’t they probably would tone it down but they find it benefits them.”

Murphy, who has been one of Democrats’ most vocal critics of Trump, has claimed the president is rushing the country into fascism and illegally profiting off the presidency. Thursday he introduced the “No Political Enemies Act,” to put in place legal protections for prosecution or harassment for political speech.

“The shooting of Charlie Kirk was a national tragedy. It should have been a line in the sand, an opportunity for President Trump to bring this country together, to do whatever is necessary to stamp out political violence … but Trump and his lieutenants are choosing a different path. They are choosing to exploit this tragedy, to weaponize the federal government to destroy Donald Trump’s political opposition,” Murphy said in a press conference(link is external) announcing the Act.

He referred to Kimmel’s firing: “Trump’s FCC forced a major network to pull a loud Trump critic, Jimmy Kimmel, off the air essentially saying that any media actor who doesn’t say what Trump wants them to say about Charlie Kirk or Trump’s policies is going to be silenced. That’s censorship. That’s state speech control. That’s not America. Trump is making it 100% clear that he is going to ramp up his efforts to use the power of the federal government to harass and punish his critics – not because they’re supporters of political violence – they are not – but because they have the audacity to openly oppose his policies.”",http://larson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/larson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/DSC_0002.JPG,N,,2025-09-20 09:59:07.278300

Legal experts weighed in on what those people could face if they're charged with any crime.

A protester was pulled behind the fence at the ICE Broadview facility after a chemical irritant canister was deployed, and that person threw the can back at ICE agents. At some point, a tire was slashed on a Department of Homeland Security vehicle.

In a statement, DHS accused demonstrators of blocking the entrance to the ICE Broadview building and assaulting law enforcement. Three people were taken into custody.

A fourth person was taken into custody around 4:10 p.m., after a woman stood in the way of a van trying to leave the parking lot of the ICE facility in Broadview.

An ICE agent pushed the woman, who pushed back, before at least one other agent shoved her away from the van, and she fell to the ground.

She was later placed in handcuffs and taken behind the gate. A Broadview ambulance later responded to the scene and paramedics could be seen treating the woman in the parking lot. She was later loaded into the ambulance on a gurney and driven away. It was unclear if she was still in federal custody when the ambulance took her away.

What could happen to those four people after being detained by ICE?

""They may be detained in custody pending a decision by the feds as to whether they're going to prosecute,"" said attorney Richard Kling, who practices law in federal court.

Kling said, if these the government does file charges against those who were arrested, the protesters could appear in federal court as soon as Friday afternoon.

""It's minor. You have cases in the federal building dealing with murder, and sexual assault, and trafficking, and all of the other terrible things that go on in society, and disorderly conduct at the Broadview ICE facility is probably at the bottom of the totem pole,"" Kling said.

He said, U.S. citizen or not, federal agents might argue the behavior outside the ICE Broadview facility was not protected by the First Amendment.

Meantime, in Bolingbrook, U.S. citizens had a different type of encounter with federal agents. A group of landscaping co-workers was in a car in the parking lot of a Culver's, when the driver claimed ICE agents approached them and blocked them in, and they had to prove their citizenship.

""ICE officers should only be detaining people if they have a reasonable basis to believe the person is not legally in the United States,"" said immigrant rights attorney Kalman Resnick.

Resnick said more and more people are traveling with documentation – a driver's license, passport, or birth certificate – following a recent Supreme Court decision that effectively ""to ICE means that they can now detain people simply on the basis of their appearance.""

""Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,"" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release.
""Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time.
Harjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.
A single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years.","The visiting room of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Centre in Bakersfield, California, is small, loud, and crowded. When Harjit Kaur's family arrived to see her, they could barely hear her - and the first words they caught shattered them.

""She said, 'I would rather die than be in this facility. May God just take me now',"" recalled her distraught daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur.

Harjit Kaur, 73, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum in the US, and has lived in California for more than three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on 8 September, sparking shock and sympathy from the Sikh community across the state and beyond.

Harjit Kaur had filed several asylum appeals over the years which were rejected, with the last denial in 2012, her lawyer said.

Since then, she had been asked to report to immigration authorities every six months. She was arrested in San Francisco when she had gone for a check-in.

It comes amid a wider crackdown by the Donald Trump administration on immigration, and especially alleged illegal immigrants in the US.

The issue is a sensitive one - the country is grappling with how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive at its borders every year. More than 3.7 million asylum cases are pending in immigration courts. An increased budget for immigration enforcement means ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.

Trump has said he wants to deport the ""worst of the worst"", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.

""Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,"" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release. ""Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers. This shameful act is harming our communities.""

US Congressman John Garamendi, who represents the Californian district where Harjit Kaur lives, has submitted a request to ICE for her release.

""This administration's decision to detain a 73-year-old woman - a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years - is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump's immigration enforcement,"" a spokesperson said.

In an emailed statement, ICE told the BBC that Harjit Kaur had ""exhausted decades of due process"" and that an immigration judge had ordered her removal in 2005.

""Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars,"" it added.

Trump orders increase in migrant deportations

India 'will do what's right' on illegal immigration - Trump

Harjit Kaur came to the US in 1991 with her two minor sons after the death of her husband, her lawyer Deepak Ahluwalia told the BBC. Her daughter-in-law Manjit Kaur said that the young widow wanted to shield her sons from and escape the political turbulence in India's Punjab state at the time.

Over the next three decades, she worked modest jobs to raise her sons, one of whom is now a US citizen. Her five grandchildren are also US citizens.

Harjit Kaur, who lives in Hercules city in the San Francisco Bay Area, was working as a seamstress at a sari store for the past two decades and pays her taxes. Asylum applicants across the US are allowed to live, work and pay taxes legally once their claim is officially filed and in process.

Even after her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012, her job permit was renewed every year.

After the rejection, her deportation seemed imminent, but she didn't have the right documents to travel to India.

Indian missions in the US issue emergency certificates - a one-way travel document - to Indians of invalid status to enable them to return. This would require verifying Harjit Kaur's origin and identity in Punjab through photos, cross-checking with relatives or acquaintances or finding old records, which would take at least a few weeks.

More than a decade since the rejection, neither Harjit Kaur nor US immigration officials have been able to get a travel permit for her. Manjit Kaur said they visited the Indian consulate in San Francisco in 2013 for this but didn't succeed. India's Consul General at San Francisco K Srikar Reddy told the BBC they had no record of Harjit Kaur applying for travel documents to India.

ICE did not respond to a question about why it did not get a travel permit in the past 13 years.

Mr Ahluwalia said he is following up with the Indian consulate for the documents which ""ICE was unable to procure for the last 13 years"". The consulate says they are ""facilitating all necessary consular assistance"".

Harjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.

""Provide us the travel documents and she is ready to go,"" Manjit Kaur said. ""She had even packed her suitcases back in 2012.""

Right now, their immediate concern is getting her out of the detention centre.

""You can put an ankle monitor on her. We can check in with immigration when you want,"" said Manjit Kaur. ""Just get her out of the facility and when you provide us the travel documents, she will self-deport to India.""

Her lawyer said that when he met Harjit Kaur on 15 September, she had not been provided with her regular medication. He alleged that she had been ""dragged by guards"", ""denied a chair or a bed"" and was ""forced to sit on the floor"" for hours in a holding cell despite having undergone double knee replacement.

He also alleged that she was ""explicitly refused water"" and not provided a vegetarian meal for the first six days.

ICE did not respond to specific questions on these allegations, but had earlier told BBC Punjabi that ""it is a long-standing policy that as soon as someone comes into ICE custody, they are given full health care"".

Detainees have access to ""medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care"" and no-one ""is denied essential care at any time during detention"", it added.

Kulvinder Singh Pannu, president of the gurdwara committee at The Sikh Centre in San Francisco Bay Area, says that Bibi Harjit (a respectful way to refer to an elderly Punjabi woman) is well-liked in the area.

""She always helped people in our community with whatever she had financially,"" he said.

""A couple of hundred people turned up by themselves to protest against her arrest,"" he said, referring to a 12 September agitation outside the Sikh temple in California.

As the uncertainty continues, Harjit Kaur's supporters are planning to hold more protests, including in other US cities, with many saying they are touched by her plight.

A single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years. Her parents and siblings in India are no longer alive, says Mr Ahluwalia.

""She has no-one, no home, no land to return to.""

Noem rescinded the extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who benefited from the 2023 designation.
“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket,” the justice department told the supreme court in its filing.

The justice department filed an emergency application asking the justices to lift a federal judge’s ruling that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, lacked the authority to end the protections for Venezuelans under the temporary protected status, or TPS, program.

“So long as the district court’s order is in effect, the secretary must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest’,” the justice department said in its filing.

The supremecourt previously sided with the administration in May to lift a temporary order that US judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued at an earlier stage of the case that had halted the TPS termination while the litigation played out in court.

Chen issued a final ruling in the case on 5 September finding that Noem’s actions to terminate the program violated a federal law that governs the actions of federal agencies.

Trump has made a crackdown on legal and illegal immigration a central plank of his second White House term and has moved to strip certain migrants of temporary legal protections, expanding the pool of possible deportees.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the US deportation protection and access to work permits.

Biden designated Venezuela for TPS in 2021 and 2023. Just days before Trump returned to office, Biden’s administration announced an extension of the status .

Noem rescinded the extension and moved to end the TPS designation for a subset of Venezuelans who benefited from the 2023 designation.

The Oregon man, Rigoberto Hernandez Hernandez, and one other firefighter were part of a 44-person crew fighting a blaze in the Olympic National Forest on Aug. 27 when the agents took them into custody during a multiagency criminal investigation into the two contractors for whom the men were employed.

Lawyers with the Innovation Law Lab said during a press conference that his arrest was illegal and violated U.S. Department of Homeland Security polices that say immigration enforcement must not be conducted at locations where emergency responses are happening.

The Bear Gulch Fire, one of the largest in the state, had burned 29 square miles (75 square kilometers) by Friday and was 9% contained.

The Border Patrol said at the time that the two workers were in the U.S. illegally so they were detained. Federal authorities did not provide information about the investigation into the contractors.

Lawyer Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega said they filed a petition for habeas corpus and a motion for a temporary restraining order that seeks the man's release from the Northwest ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to The Associated Press that the two men were not firefighters — they were working in a support role cutting logs into firewood.

“The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time,"" she said. ""U.S. Border Patrol’s actions did not prevent or interfere with any personnel actively engaged in firefighting efforts.” A spokesperson for the Border Patrol declined to comment, saying they don't comment on active or pending litigation.

After Hernandez was taken into custody in August, his lawyers were unable to locate him for 48 hours, which caused distress for his family, Fernandez-Ortega said. He has been in the Tacoma facility ever since, they said.

Hernandez, 23, was the son of migrant farmworkers, his lawyer said. He was raised in Oregon, Washington and California as they traveled for work. He moved to Oregon three years ago and began working as a wildland firefighter.

This was his third season working as a wildland firefighter, “doing the grueling and dangerous job of cutting down trees and clearing vegetation to manage the spread of wildfires and to protect homes, communities, and resources,” his lawyer said.

Hernandez had received a U-Visa certification from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon in 2017 and submitted his U-Visa application with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services the following year. The U-Visa program was established by Congress to protect victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators.

Tensions have been rising in the Chicago area for the last two weeks, since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intensified their push to arrest people in the country illegally, under an effort called Operation Midway Blitz. Demonstrators have typically gathered outside the federal detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday mornings, and their numbers have grown in recent weeks.

During the standoff with protesters on Friday, ICE deployed tear gas and pepper balls at the group, including several local officials. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Chicago operation has resulted in almost 550 arrests, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement on Friday.

Advocates for immigrants have repeatedly raised concerns about conditions at the detention facility, which is used for processing immigration arrests.

“This facility should be shut down, that’s what it comes down to,” said Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a member of the Chicago City Council, who was there during the standoff. Mr. Sigcho-Lopez, who represents a ward with many Latino residents, has been a vocal opponent of ICE’S presence in Chicago.

Mayor Daniel Biss of Evanston, Ill., after wiping tear gas from his eyes, called the actions of ICE “a performance in brutality.”

“They are trying to send a message of public violence and oppression,” he said. “Our job is to resist it as visibly, vocally and aggressively as we can while staying nonviolent.”

Before the clash, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton had stopped outside the Broadview facility and said that she and Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, were monitoring ICE activities in Illinois.

Last Friday, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old man whom officers were trying to arrest during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb of Chicago near O’Hare International Airport with a significant Latino population. The ICE officer “followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law,” Ms. McLaughlin, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in a statement.

But immigration rights advocates and Mr. Villegas-Gonzalez’s family have questioned whether the arrest was warranted, saying that he was a father who had led a quiet life and had no violent criminal history.

The case then returned to Judge Chen, who in September again ruled in favor of the challengers after receiving additional evidence.

The case will be familiar to the justices. In May they temporarily paused a federal trial judge’s earlier order in the case, over the noted dissent of only one member of the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. The trial judge, Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco, had blocked the administration’s efforts to remove the protections while the case moved forward.

The majority opinion in May, which was unsigned, gave no reasons. Nor did Justice Jackson’s dissent.

The case then returned to Judge Chen, who in September again ruled in favor of the challengers after receiving additional evidence. He said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order in May, noting that it “did not provide any specific analysis.”

In his emergency application asking the Supreme Court to pause that second ruling, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said that Judge Chen’s actions were another example of “the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

Citing a recent concurring opinion from Justice Neil M. Gorsuch chastising federal trial judges for what he said was defiance of the Supreme Court, Mr. Sauer wrote that “lower courts cannot treat this court’s orders as good for only one stage of only one case by gesturing at irrelevant distinctions, subjectively grading the persuasiveness of the court’s perceived reasoning or faulting the court’s terseness.”

The court’s emergency docket, which critics call the “shadow docket,” uses truncated procedures that tend to produce terse provisional orders, ruling only on whether a policy can be implemented while its legality is being litigated. The justices often do not include an explanation of how they arrived at these decisions, making it difficult for lower courts to parse whether and how the orders amount to binding precedent.

The case involving the Venezuelans started in February, when Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, terminated an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status that had been granted to Venezuelans by the Biden administration. People affected by the change sued, saying that the move violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias.

Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, gave the figures during an interview with The Associated Press. The figure, which has not been widely reported, offers an early gauge of what is shaping up as a major enforcement effort that comes after similar operations were launched in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

When asked whether he thought that amount of arrests at this point in the operation was positive, Charles said 400 is a “solid number,” adding that the figure includes arrests made by other federal agencies besides ICE who are assisting in the campaign.

“We’re going to be conducting this operation until we feel that we’ve been successful,” he said. “There’s not an end date in sight.”

ICE launched its Chicago area operation dubbed “Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities who say there’s been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents. That has deepened dread in communities already fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by President Donald Trump ’s hardline immigration policies.

The operation has brought allegations of excessive force and heavy-handed dragnets that have ensnared U.S. citizens, while gratifying Trump supporters who say he is delivering on a promise of mass deportations.

The Trump administration has promised to send an influx of immigration agents and National Guard troops to Chicago, over the fierce of objections of local leaders and residents. A military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize even as immigration enforcement operations continue.

Officials and activists in the Chicago area opposed to the enforcement surge argue the approach is dangerous and imprecise, pointing to accounts of two U.S. citizens who were briefly detained this week by federal officers focused on immigration enforcement. Advocates also have protested the death of a man shot by an ICE officer on Sept. 12 after authorities said he tried to flee during a traffic stop, dragging the officer.

Charles said roughly 50% to 60% of the Chicago operation arrests were targeted arrests, meaning they were specific people that ICE was trying to find because they had committed a crime, had a final order of removal or had done something that put them on ICE’s radar.

The rest were what’s often referred to as “collateral arrests,” meaning people that ICE comes across during their operations who aren’t the person they’re looking for but are in the country illegally, so ICE can arrest them.

Collateral arrests were not allowed during the Biden administration but the Trump administration threw out those restrictions almost immediately after coming into office as part of Trump’s efforts to beef up deportations.

“It doesn’t mean that the collateral arrests are non-criminal. Some of our collateral arrests … also have criminal convictions and arrests. They just weren’t the people we were looking for at the time,” said Charles.

The Department of Homeland Security launched “Midway Blitz” after months of Trump administration criticism of Chicago and Illinois over state and local policies that restrict law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

ICE says these policies mean that immigrants who’ve committed crimes in the U.S. and can be deported as a result are instead released into the community. ICE says it then has to go out into the community and track them down to remove them.

Many local officials and activists have said that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that if they cooperate with ICE, it makes it less likely that immigrants who are victims or witnesses to crime will come forward to work with police.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-08T203630Z_1123438712_RC2VNGATSPMK_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:57:27.918126

For the past three weeks, I’ve been attending protests at the Broadview ICE facility.
We went early because they changed their deportation time to around 6 a.m. ICE threw me to the ground then and assaulted other protesters, as well.
That is when that video happened, when the officer picked me up and threw me on the ground.
It’s unfortunate that, just because I’m a congressional candidate, this is more newsworthy than if it would have happened to another protester.","On Friday, Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Democratic U.S. House candidate in Illinois’s 9th congressional district, was thrown forcefully to the ground by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent at a protest outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois. The incident garnered widespread attention after Abughazaleh shared the footage online.

Abughazaleh, a New Republic contributor, was among a crowd demonstrating outside the facility, which is being used in a controversial immigration enforcement operation underway in Illinois. Ostensibly a “processing facility” intended to hold detainees for no more than 12 hours at a time, the center has reportedly held detainees “for days or even weeks,” Abughazaleh said in a recent YouTube video. Protesters have gathered weekly outside the facility and on Friday were reportedly met with severe force: They were tackled, detained, tear-gassed, and pepper-sprayed by ICE agents, who were masked and clad in tactical gear.

Speaking with TNR hours after the protest, Abughazaleh described the abuses she witnessed and experienced earlier in the day.

Could you walk me through the sequence of events this morning that led to the moments you shared online?

For the past three weeks, I’ve been attending protests at the Broadview ICE facility. There’s been a vigil there for almost two decades at this point, but they started ramping up after three protesters were arrested four weeks ago.

Three weeks ago, we went, and it was very peaceful. We ended up actually getting a car to turn around. Last week, when we went, ICE assaulted a lot of us. We went early because they changed their deportation time to around 6 a.m. ICE threw me to the ground then and assaulted other protesters, as well. That was the same day as the Franklin Park murder, and someone else was shot with pepper balls then.

And then today, my friend and I woke up at 3 a.m. and went to the facility. We got there and were sitting on public property. ICE agents told us to essentially go away: “Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk.” Around 6 a.m., they started bringing out a van, and we were in the way, so an ICE agent once again picked me up and threw me to the ground—they love throwing me. The video that people saw was after that. But during that first altercation, they took one of the protesters inside the facility—that’s the first time this has ever happened. We don’t know what happened to that person—we still don’t know where they are.

What happened in the video that has been going around social media for most of the day?

The second altercation was when a car came out of the facility. I went to go aid another protester—once again, on public property. This is all on streets of the town of Broadview. That is when that video happened, when the officer picked me up and threw me on the ground.

And then around 8:30, 9 a.m., we saw that the protester that was arrested was being put in chains and brought into a van. And so I and about 40, maybe even 50, other people that stayed were arm-in-arm to block this car because someone was detained just for exercising their right to protest. ICE tried to run us over, like, plain and simple. A guy fell to the ground, and they kept driving. We got him up, thank God. They kept driving to the point that my friend was on the hood of the car. They started shooting us with pepper balls, and then they deployed tear gas.

The van drove away, and we don’t know where that protester is. In the chaos, they took two other people in. A little bit before that, they actually tried to take another protester, and I and two other guys—it was literally like tug-of-war—ended up keeping him out of the facility.

What have you made of the response to the video of you being thrown to the ground?

I mean, frankly, I’m shocked that people are shocked about this. They did similar [things] last week. This was the most aggressive action they’ve taken. But once last week, twice today, ICE has picked me up and thrown me on the ground.

Honestly, it doesn’t compare to what our neighbors who are trapped inside the Broadview processing facility are going through. They’re committing crimes against humanity there. This is a processing facility, so people are not supposed to be held for more than 12 hours at a time, but they are being held for days or even weeks. They are not given beds. They sleep on the concrete. They are not given hygienic products. They are not given hot meals. And these aren’t criminals. There are literally pregnant women and grandmothers in there. Last week when we saw them being loaded into a van, they were wearing the same clothes that they were detained in.

This is what ICE is. And we need to recognize that. It’s unfortunate that, just because I’m a congressional candidate, this is more newsworthy than if it would have happened to another protester. This shouldn’t be happening to anyone. And we don’t even know what is happening to the protesters who were kidnapped. We don’t know what is happening to our neighbors who were kidnapped and are being detained there. This is what Trump’s America looks like.

You tweeted, “This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights.” Could you expand on that?

The right wants to eliminate free speech. They want to eliminate the First Amendment. They only want people to express speech that they specifically allow. There is no type of capitulation that will satisfy them except complete and utter submission, which is why solidarity is so important. It’s why having companies like ABC cowering to Trump, or universities cowering to Trump, why that does so much harm to all of us.

And ICE is being able to operate with impunity. They are able to operate outside of the law. I don’t know who any of the men who have shoved me, pushed me, picked me up, shot pepper balls at my body—I don’t know who any of them are. They don’t have badge numbers. They don’t have names. They don’t have identification. They’re wearing masks. They’re wearing sunglasses at night. They’re wearing hats. They’re complete ghosts. For all I know, they’re just some guy that was like, “Today I want to work at the ICE facility and rough up some 110-pound girl.”

And that means that they can do whatever they want. This is the secret police. There’s no ifs, ands, or buts about it. And that means that they can designate anything a crime. They can designate protesting as a crime. They can say that speech is a crime. They can just assign any idea, ideology, condition, or act to you, and say, “Well, I saw it happen, so that’s what the truth is. And I can do whatever I want to this citizen, to this civilian, to this person who did nothing wrong, because I’m an ICE officer and I’m above the law.”

What would you like to see from your fellow Democrats?

We need Democrats to put up an aggressive response to ICE. This facility in Illinois needs to be shut down, but these facilities across the country need to be shut down. We need more representatives like [New York City Comptroller] Brad Lander to be standing up for our communities. We need elected representatives at all levels of government to be demanding these facilities have any sort of transparency and abide by our own laws. And it is not controversial or tearing us apart to insist that basic humanity, basic decency, is not only respected but expected in our country.",https://images.newrepublic.com/ee55f1a18ac0601f908abff21a889482337ef35f.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-09-19 18:57:26.217898

In another order, Trump set up a new ""gold card"" to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.
Since 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.
Until now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.
At the time, tech companies pushed back, harshly criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will add a $100,000 (£74,000) fee for applicants to the H-1B visa programme aimed at bringing in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.

The proclamation mentions ""abuse"" of the programme and will restrict entry unless payment is made.

Critics of the programme have long argued that H-1Bs undercut the American workforce, while supporters - including billionaire Elon Musk - argue it allows the US to attract top talent from around the world.

In another order, Trump set up a new ""gold card"" to fast-track visas for certain immigrants in exchange for fees starting at £1m.

Joining Trump in the Oval Office on Friday was US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

""A hundred thousand dollars a year for H1-B visas, and all of the big companies are on board,"" he said. ""We've spoken to them.

""If you're going to train somebody, you're going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs.""

Since 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.

Until now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.

Data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows that applications for H-1B visas for the next fiscal year fell to about 359,000 - a four-year low.

The greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google, according to government statistics.

The BBC has contacted these companies for comment.

Tahmina Watson, a founding attorney at Watson Immigration Law, told the BBC that the ruling could be a ""nail in the coffin"" for many of her clients that are mostly small businesses and start-ups.

""Almost everyone's going to be priced out. This $100,000 as an entry point is going to have a devastating impact,"" she added, noting that many small or medium-sized companies ""will tell you they actually can't find workers to do the job"".

""When employers sponsor foreign talent, more often than not, they're doing that because they have not been able to fulfil those positions,"" Ms Watson added.

Jorge Lopez, the chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler Mendelson PC, said a $100,000 fee ""will put the brakes on American competitiveness in the tech sector and all industries"".

Some companies might consider setting up operations outside the US, though doing so can be challenging in practice, he added.

The debate over H-1Bs had previously caused splits within Trump's team and supporters, pitting those in favour of the visas against critics such as former strategist Steve Bannon.

Trump told reporters at the White House in January that he understands ""both sides of the argument"" on H-1Bs.

The year before - while seeking to attract support from the tech industry while on the campaign trail - Trump vowed to make the process of attracting talent easier, going as far as to propose green cards for college graduates.

""You need a pool of people to work for companies,"" he told the All-In Podcast. ""You have to be able to recruit these people and keep these people.""

Early in his first term in 2017, Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B applications, seeking to improve fraud detection.

Rejections rose to an all-time high of 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared to between 5% and 8% under Barack Obama and then between 2% and 4% under Joe Biden.

At the time, tech companies pushed back, harshly criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order.

The potential for additional restrictions to the H-1B programme has caused considerable concern in countries such as India - which is by far the largest source country for such visa applications.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/fa5f/live/38c3b210-95af-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 20:57:12.040468

Adam Schiff (Calif.) and Tim Kaine (Va.) have introduced a new resolution under the War Powers Act that would stop U.S. military strikes against boats from Venezuela that President Trump says are smuggling fentanyl into the United States.

The resolution is privileged, which means it is guaranteed a vote on the floor, even though it has little chance of passing the Senate or the House and would be vetoed by Trump if it ever made it to his desk.

At the very least, it will put Republican senators on record on the question of whether Trump’s use of force against the ships is legally justified. Critics of the president’s actions argue it violates the law and Constitution.

“Congress alone holds the power to declare war. And while we share with the executive branch the imperative of preventing and deterring drugs from reaching our shores, blowing up boats without any legal justification risks dragging the United States into another war and provoking unjustified hostilities against our own citizens,” Schiff said Friday in a statement.

Democrats say the administration has ignored requests from Democrats to provide more information about the strikes or details about their legal underpinnings.

“President Trump has no legal authority to launch strikes or use military force in the Caribbean or elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. The administration has refused to provide Congress with basic information about the multiple strike it has carried out, including who was killed, why it was necessary to put servicemembers’ lives at risk, and why a standard interdiction operation wasn’t conducted,” Kaine said in a statement.

The resolution will be referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must discharge it to the Senate floor for a vote within 60 days of the president’s announcement of the use of force.

Schiff and Kaine unveiled their resolution after U.S. forces sank a second Venezuelan boat Monday.

Trump announced on Truth Social that military officials “positively identified extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists.”

Trump signed a secret directive this summer ordering the Pentagon to use deadly force against Latin American drug cartels, which his administration have identified as terrorist organizations.

She said the group was tear-gassed and shot with pepper balls — and that one activist was dragged into the facility.

Videos taken at the scene show an ICE officer picking up Abughazaleh and slamming her to the ground. She landed on her backside with an audible thud.

Abughazaleh later posted the video on her X account, warning, “This is what it looks like when ICE violates our First Amendment rights.”

Some right-wing social media accounts were quick to pounce on Abughazaleh, accusing her of interfering in the ICE operation, and implying she got what she deserved.

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 294 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Sept. 12 through 18.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Ramiro Barrera-Gonzalez was charged in San Antonio with assault on a federal officer after he was initially arrested for illegal entry by an alien. A criminal complaint alleges that while he was in U.S. Border Patrol custody on Sept. 11, Barrera-Gonzalez ingested bleach and was transported to a San Antonio hospital for medical treatment. Two days later, as a Border Patrol agent escorted Barrera-Gonzalez to a hospital restroom, Barrera-Gonzalez allegedly lunged toward the agent’s holstered firearm. An altercation ensued, causing both the Barrera-Gonzalez and the agent to fall to the ground and resulting in an injury to the agent’s forearm.

Two U.S. citizens were arrested on Sept. 12 when they approached a Del Rio Border Patrol checkpoint and allegedly drove away at a high rate of speed after refusing to open the trunk of their vehicle and failing to pull over for secondary inspection. A criminal complaint alleges that Border Patrol agents caught up in a pursuit and observed the driver, Andre Limon Criston Austin, pull over before the car’s trunk opened and two females were seen attempting to climb out. As the agents approached, Austin allegedly accelerated again, causing the trunk to close with the females still inside. Austin’s vehicle allegedly stopped again, and one female exited the trunk before he accelerated another time, causing the second female to fall out of the vehicle. Both females were found to be in the U.S. illegally. Austin and a female passenger in his vehicle, Paris Engjqulique Walpool, were eventually taken into custody. Further investigation revealed that Austin and Walpool allegedly co-conspired with other facilitators after accepting a job in a Facebook group to “move” things in Eagle Pass for $2,500. Austin and Walpool are both charged with bringing in and harboring certain aliens.

Another U.S. citizen was charged in a separate incident for allegedly conspiring to transport two illegal aliens further into the United States. Sebastian Medina-Carrillo was arrested near Carrizo Springs on Sept. 11 when U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a traffic stop on and allegedly observed physical abnormalities in an external fuel tank of his vehicle. An immigration vehicle inspection allegedly revealed two illegal aliens concealed inside the fuel tank. A criminal complaint alleges Medina-Carrillo was transporting the two aliens to Dilley and would be paid $1,000.

Three individuals, including two male illegal aliens and a female with a Permanent Resident Alien Card, were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents after allegedly using two vehicles in an attempt to pick up and transport six illegal aliens who had crossed the border fence more than seven miles east of the Fort Hancock Port of Entry. The two vehicles were allegedly seen speeding away from where the illegal aliens had been observed. USBP agents initiated traffic stops, arresting Juan Pedro Zamarron-Navarrete, a Mexican national, who was identified as the driver of one vehicle. The alleged driver of the second vehicle, Ayde Castaneda-Rivera, and her passenger Oscar Chapa-Gomez, who was confirmed to be an illegal alien, were also arrested. Further investigation revealed that Zamarron-Navarrete had illegally re-entered the U.S. on Sept. 2, after serving six months in jail for an alien smuggling conviction and being removed to Mexico. The investigation also revealed that Castaneda-Rivera and Chapa-Gomez allegedly served as lookouts for Zamarron-Navarrete, who decided to leave the pick-up location when he saw USBP arriving.

On Monday, USBP agents in El Paso responded to a vehicle suspected of picking up seven illegal aliens who had just crossed into the U.S. A criminal complaint alleges that the agents observed an empty driver’s seat when they located the vehicle, and they found the seven aliens, including two unaccompanied illegal aliens, attempting to hide inside the vehicle. The driver, identified as U.S. citizen Miguel Arturo Corral, was allegedly located attempting to conceal himself in a nearby cotton field and was arrested on a human smuggling charge. Corral’s criminal history includes several prior convictions, including racing on the highway, driving with an invalid license, evading arrest, and two DWIs.

U.S. citizen Lucio David Rivera-Esparza was also arrested and charged with human smuggling in El Paso. USBP agents arrested two illegal aliens on Sept. 11 and noticed that one of the aliens possessed a cell phone that continuously received calls from a number originating in Mexico. A criminal complaint alleges that the cell phone led agents to a pick-up location where they met Rivera-Esparza, who had coordinated to transport illegal aliens further into the United States. Agents searched Rivera-Esparza’s vehicle and allegedly discovered a loaded handgun and an unknown amount of money in the center console. Agents also seized an additional $1,921 that Rivera-Esparza allegedly obtained by smuggling and transporting illegal aliens. Rivera-Esparza was convicted in April 2024 for a state charge of smuggling of persons and sentenced to five years in jail.

In Austin, Honduran national Jose Orellana Espana was taken into ICE custody after being encountered at the Travis County Jail. He had been arrested and charged with assault causing bodily injury to a family member and unlawful restraint. Espana was previously convicted in 2017 of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and unlawful restraint.

Ricardo Quiroz-Rincon, a Mexican national, was also encountered at the Travis County Jail where he had been charged with assault causing bodily injury. Quiroz-Rincon has been previously removed from the U.S. five times since 2009. He’s been twice convicted for improper entry by an alien, with three additional convictions for illegal re-entry.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Chicago is not alone in seeing locals clash with federal immigration efforts.","A protest outside an Illinois U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center on Friday culminated in a Democratic congressional candidate being tossed to the ground, allegedly by an ICE agent, according to video from the scene that was posted to X.

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a progressive Democrat who is running for Congress in Illinois, was taking part in the ICE protest outside Broadview Processing Center.

Footage then shows an alleged agent pushing her hard enough that she landed on the ground.

""First off they shot pepper balls to the ground, and then said, 'Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,'"" Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday afternoon. ""And then when we tried to get in the way of the van, they picked us up or dragged us away, for some people, shoved people. I was picked up and thrown.""

Why It Matters

While on the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Immigrants residing in the country illegally and legally, with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, as well as those in the process of obtaining legal status, have faced detentions.

Protests have been taking place in and around Chicago in recent days as federal agents have ramped up immigration enforcement in the city at the direction of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While the department insists it is detaining the ""worst of the worst,"" advocates have raised concerns that that is not always true.

What To Know

The protest on Friday took place outside an ICE detention facility in Broadview, a neighborhood on the west side of Chicago. Among those taking part was Abughazaleh, who has attended other demonstrations at the facility in recent days.

In a video posted to YouTube two days earlier, the former journalist spoke about another experience of allegedly being thrown to the ground by DHS agents as she tried to stop vans outside the processing facility being used as the base of ICE action in Chicago.

Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday that federal agents took one protester away in chains, prompting a longer-than-planned protest.

""No one was violent. No one did anything that could possibly warrant being detained by federal officers. But they didn't care,"" she said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responded by pointing a previous press release from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

""The violent targeting of law enforcement in Illinois by lawless rioters is despicable and Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson must call for it to end,"" McLaughlin said. ""The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line to protect the people of Illinois and all Americans.""

Other local officials were also on the scene at the protest, including Democratic Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton and Democratic Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss—another congressional candidate.

Biss shared on X that federal forces used tear gas to move protesters away from the ICE facility, with video showing clashes between agents and those vocalizing their concerns about the conditions at Broadview.

DHS later said that ""rioters assaulted law enforcement"" and that it was protesters who threw tear gas. The department added that it had asked local police for assistance but was denied.

Abughazaleh told Newsweek that the facility is supposed to temporarily hold immigrants held by ICE, but they are being held for several days.

""There have been reports of pregnant women and grandmothers being forced to sleep on the concrete. They're not given beds or hygienic products, or hot meals, actual meals,"" she said.

DHS has said it is seeking out known illegal immigrant criminals in the city and surrounding area under Operation Midway Blitz, the latest in a series of campaigns aimed at what the Trump administration calls sanctuary cities that stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Chicago is not alone in seeing locals clash with federal immigration efforts. In New York on Thursday, about a dozen Democratic officials were detained briefly following a sit-in protest at 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration court and processing facility.

Other sanctuary cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, have also seen demonstrations as the Trump administration continues to face resistance.

What People Are Saying

Kat Abughazaleh told Newsweek on Friday: ""We care about our community. That's why we are there. That's we are standing up. That's why we will not be intimidated.""

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, in a video on X on Friday: ""I have to tell you, it was terrifying, it was impossible to breathe and really, really scary. The point is they are trying to intimidate us, to stop us from standing up and being part of a non-violent resistance, and we will not be intimidated.""

Far-right influencer Laura Loomer, on X: ""I love watching communists get body slammed by ICE. Communist and Palestinian. Pick a struggle. @KatAbughazaleh.""

What Happens Next

Abughazaleh and others have vowed to keep protesting at Broadview while Operation Midway Blitz continues across Chicago.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Updates about “mass deportation” and detention: The population in ICE detention has leveled off for now as resources from the giant spending bill in July are only beginning to come online. Stepped-up ICE enforcement has sent a chill through immigrant communities in Chicago, where agents fatally shot a man from Mexico. Numerous media outlets published alarming investigations of miserable conditions in ICE detention facilities.

Defense and law enforcement officials being diverted from non-immigration cases: Several stories over the past week detailed how military personnel, and civilian personnel normally assigned to missions ranging from stopping drugs to stopping child sex slavery, have been pulled from their regular duties to assist the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort.

Expulsions of Central American children remain on hold: A Washington, DC judge issued a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from expelling a class of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, as it had sought to do during the pre-dawn hours of the Sunday before Labor Day. Evidence shows that government attorneys provided false information to the court when they claimed that the children’s families were seeking to reunite in Guatemala.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Updates about “mass deportation” and detention

Current numbers

As of late on September 18, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had still not reported the number of migrants that the agency encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during August. This release is later than usual: CBP had provided this notification 12 days into March, 14 days into April, 13 days into May, 17 days into June, 15 days into July, and 12 days into August.

The difference may be that, at least according to a leak to the New York Post near the end of August, Border Patrol’s apprehensions of migrants stopped decreasing last month and instead increased by more than 50 percent over July. The reason, a “Homeland Security source” told the Post, was that people deported into Mexico after being apprehended in the U.S. interior have been “trying to sneak back into the United States.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data released on September 11 reported that the agency’s nationwide detained immigrant population totaled 58,766, down slightly from a likely record 61,226 on August 29 and 59,380 on August 14. Analyst Austin Kocher recalled that this number counts “people in one of 187 facilities across the country, as well as many potentially more in unmarked facilities and holding rooms.”

Of those in detention, 29 percent had been convicted of a crime and 25 percent faced criminal charges (ICE’s report does not specify the crimes or their severity). Forty-five percent had no criminal history at all.

Despite a massive new detention budget approved by Congress in early July, ICE’s “immigration enforcement blitz” is being bottlenecked by the slow pace of making new detention beds available, White House “Border Czar” Tom Homan told reporters. “The government has fewer than 65,000 beds,” about 6,000 more than the current detained population, an administration official told Politico.

ICE arrested 171,649 people in the U.S. interior between February 1 and September 7, averaging 784 arrests per day. During the first seven days of September, the average was 848 per day, down from a high of 1,052 per day in June. That month saw a sharp increase after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller’s widely reported late-May order to increase daily arrests to 3,000. Subsequent months’ modest decline in arrests, Kocher and Cato Institute analyst David Bier contend, may have been the result of a court order—overturned by the Supreme Court on September 8 (see WOLA’s September 12 Border Update)—that had limited street arrests in and around Los Angeles.

The data indicate that ICE has removed 302,192 people from the United States during the 2025 fiscal year, which started in October 2024. At the end of January 2025, this number had stood at 85,769, indicating that ICE, under the Trump administration, has deported approximately 216,423 people.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offered the conservative website Daily Wire a number that is impossible to verify: “more than 389,000 illegal immigrants already removed from the United States” so far in the Trump administration, a number that apparently takes ICE removals and adds CBP’s quick removals from the border, Coast Guard returns, and known “self-deportations.”

DHS repeated a claim to Daily Wire that another 1.6 million immigrants have left the United States on their own since January; PolitiFact looked at that number in early September and found it “half-true,” as it is based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey with a small sample size and large margin of error. Still, the Department’s top public affairs official apparently added the 1.6 million and the 389,000 and tweeted on September 17, “2 MILLION illegal aliens are out of the United States of America in less than 250 days.”

Chicago

In Chicago, the Trump administration’s so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” is now underway, with a surge of ICE, CBP, Border Patrol, and other federal law enforcement personnel fanning throughout the city seeking to detain undocumented people. Sweeps have so far been more “scattershot” than “massive,” Adrián Carrasquillo wrote at the Bulwark.

This deployment does not include National Guard personnel on a crime-fighting and ICE support mission, as President Donald Trump had threatened. Sending military forces against the wishes of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) promised too many “legal headaches” for the White House, as CNN put it. Trump has instead sent a new National Guard contingent to Memphis, in the Republican-governed state of Tennessee.

Word of stepped-up ICE (and accompanying agency) operations has spread a climate of fear through Chicago’s large immigrant and Latino communities. “The fear is not just overtly palpable but present in subtle ways as well,” Carrasquillo reported. “School attendance is down; parents are afraid to pick up their children from school. Community events are being canceled, and people are afraid to attend the Mexican Independence Day celebrations that started last week.” Businesses, particularly restaurants, are reporting 40 to 50 percent drops in revenue. Organizers decided to postpone a two-day “El Grito Chicago” festival that would have celebrated Independence Day in the city’s downtown.

While DHS released information on September 16 about 11 people arrested, portraying them as criminals, the total number of Chicago arrests so far is unclear. “I don’t have a sense of a number except to say that it is certainly higher than what ICE is reporting publicly,” read a statement from a spokesperson for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights reported by the Chicago-based investigative news site Unraveled.

The Chicago operation saw its first fatality on September 12, under circumstances that remain unclear in the suburb of Franklin Park. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González, a 38-year-old cook from Michoacán, Mexico, who had just dropped his children off at school. ICE reported that when agents sought to stop his vehicle, Villegas drove toward them, dragging one agent and injuring him, while another fired his weapon in self-defense. Villegas’s criminal record included only minor traffic violations, the local CBS News affiliate reported.

Reporting from Unraveled, citing security footage, “bystander videos,” and eyewitness accounts, casts doubt on the official narrative. “The sedan eventually reverses from the two agents, and the officer on the passenger side points his firearm at the vehicle. As Villegas-Gonzalez drives away from the agents—not toward them, as DHS claimed—the agent on the passenger side aims his weapon at the back of Villegas-Gonzalez’s car.”

The Mexican government’s Foreign Affairs Secretariat “condemns the violence” and has called for a “rigorous investigation” of the Villegas case, read a tweet from the agency.

Joe Botello, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was briefly detained in a pre-dawn ICE raid on the house where he was living with several roommates, some of whom remain detained, in the suburb of Elgin. Masked, armed agents destroyed the home’s front and back doors. A camouflage-clad DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, visiting Chicago, was present for the raid; the Department shared a video including images of Botello, handcuffed. “I’m still a little bit in shock. I’m just glad that I’m OK,” he told the Chicago Tribune. “I recommend that everyone always have their documentation—their passport if they can, and any type of ID that would identify them. … Stay safe.”

L.A. and D.C.

Los Angeles continues to reckon with a surge of immigration operations that began in June. The Border Patrol agent placed in charge of the “at large” mission in the city and in Chicago, El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, testified in the trial of Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester charged with assaulting agents on June 7. Ramos-Brito’s defense attorney recalled a past misconduct investigation, citing Bovino referring to undocumented immigrants as “scum, filth, and trash”; Bovino said that he was referring to a specific individual.

The jury acquitted Ramos-Brito, as video indicated that agents shoved the defendant first. The Los Angeles Times noted that the court had a difficult time building a jury in a community where “many potential jurors have negative views of immigration enforcement, or may be immigrants themselves.”

Miriam Jordan of the New York Times covered another June incident in Los Angeles, profiling 48-year-old Narciso Barranco, an undocumented Mexican citizen who has been in the United States since 1994 and raised three sons who served in the Marine Corps. Masked agents, at least some clearly Border Patrol, arrested Barranco on June 21 when he was landscaping the exterior of an IHOP. DHS tweeted a brief video of the arrest showing Barranco holding a weed whacker aloft and running, with the text “Perhaps the mainstream media would like our officers to stand there and be mowed down instead of defending themselves?”

“Mr. Barranco’s family said he was scared and just trying to move away, not to harm anyone,” Jordan reported. “Mr. Barranco’s memory of his arrest is fragmented: the blinding sting of pepper spray; beefy federal agents taking him down and pinning him to the pavement; their relentless blows; the pain radiating from his left shoulder.” Barranco is currently out of detention, on bond.

In Washington, DC, where increased ICE operations also continue, Chabeli Carrazana at the 19th reported on undocumented childcare workers forced to “go underground,” unable to take kids to parks, libraries, or other public spaces. “Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.”

Family separations

A Washington Post investigation revealed that, in an echo of the 2018 family separations crisis, ICE is taking children away from parents pursuing asylum cases. Agents are detaining parents in the U.S. interior and offering them a choice: give up their cases and be deported together, or persist in seeking asylum and have the children placed in Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody. As a result, “ICE has sharply increased the number of migrant children it is sending to federal shelters for unaccompanied minors,” more than 400 since the Trump administration began.

Death of Estela Ramos

Jacob Soboroff and Kay Guerrero of MSNBC reported on the September 8 death of 45-year-old Estela Ramos, the mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was the subject of a September 2 profile. The mother and daughter had been deported to their native Guatemala on July 4, just days after being apprehended at a routine ICE check-in in Los Angeles. Both had said that agents confiscated Estela’s blood pressure medications and did not return them. While in Guatemala, she was so afraid of the Barrio 18 gang members whom she had initially fled that she did not dare to seek medical help to replace them.

Detention

A Washington Post investigation revealed that an ICE inspection of the Trump administration’s sprawling new “Camp East Montana” tent detention facility at Fort Bliss, outside of El Paso, Texas, found that contractor Acquisition Logistics and medical contractor Loyal Source were in violation of at least 60 federal detention standards. These include failures to provide adequate medical care, proper recordkeeping, functioning plumbing, outdoor recreation, sufficient food, and reliable access to legal counsel or contact with relatives.

Even as the facility is “expected to hold up to 2,700 migrants at a time this month and as many as 5,000 by the end of the year,” armed guards at Fort Bliss lack clear rules for the use of lethal force. Still, it is “the first of at least 10 temporary, tentlike encampments that the Trump Administration plans to build at military bases and the sites of existing detention centers in the coming months.” Initial reports that “Camp East Montana” would only be used to detain people with criminal records appear to be inaccurate.

A four-month Guardian investigation found systemic due process violations, prolonged detentions, poor medical care, and opaque practices at ICE’s Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana, which it calls a “‘black hole’ where immigrants disappear.” At the facility run by the Geo Group, a major detention and prison contractor, detainees are often denied legal representation, held without timely medical screenings, and deported before legal requests are resolved. Former detainees recounted examples of verbal abuse and ridicule from guards, as well as physical mistreatment.

The piece notes “a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year.” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin countered, “This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

The New York Times reported on the worsening mental health of people detained in ICE facilities for long periods, with “persistent reports of suicide attempts and people expressing thoughts of suicide in detention facilities.” After one man tried to hang himself after seven months in detention, officers at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana placed him “on suicide watch. This meant solitary confinement, where he fought off biting ants and endured black mold on the wall and feces in his cell.”

Lauren Villagrán of USA Today also wrote about the increasing application of solitary confinement in ICE detention facilities. The practice began to increase during the Biden administration but has since grown as a percentage of the overall detained population. “The more data that is released the worse we realize it is,” said Dr. Katherine Peeler of Physicians for Human Rights and Harvard Medical School, part of a team that released a new report on September 17.

At the family migrant detention center that the Trump administration reopened in Dilley, Texas, “the tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs,” attorneys, citing families, told the court in a case emerging from the administration’s effort to terminate a 30-year-old judicial agreement governing treatment of minors in immigration custody. “Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice, and milk,” the Associated Press reported, adding that those in detention are charged $1.21 for a bottle of water, $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, $2.39 for toothpaste, and $1.30 for a dose of Tylenol. “Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.”

A federal judge in New York issued a preliminary injunction strengthening an August 12 order to ICE to improve conditions in its short-term holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan found that conditions in the cells—designed for stays of 12 hours or less—likely “violated the First and Fifth Amendments,” the New York Times reported. Migrants, the report continued, have been “complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks. They said they were forced to sleep on the floor or sitting upright, and were deprived of showers, sufficient medical care, and legal representation. Some migrants said they had to contend with a stench emanating from shared toilets, which were in plain view of other detainees.”

The Women’s Refugee Commission launched a new Detention Pregnancy Tracker, which it describes as “the first nationwide tool designed to collect real-time reports on pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in U.S. immigration detention.” This is necessary, the organization notes, because DHS “has effectively gutted its monitoring and oversight agencies and is no longer submitting the previously required reporting to Congress on the number and treatment of pregnant detainees.”

Defense and law enforcement officials being diverted from non-immigration cases

WOLA’s September 5 Border Update cited data, obtained by the Cato Institute’s David Bier, regarding the large number of federal law enforcement personnel that the Trump administration has pulled away from their agencies’ missions and assigned to immigration enforcement. The call to support “mass deportation,” according to this data, has diverted one in five US marshals, one in five FBI agents, half of DEA agents, over two-thirds of the ATF, and nearly 90 percent of Homeland Security Investigations.

These diversions, along with drawdowns of military personnel and resources, were the subject of several media outlets’ investigations over the past week.

A Wall Street Journal investigation of the booming cocaine market found the migration mission hampering U.S. drug interdiction efforts. “The president’s campaign to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally has taken federal agents away from drug-traffic interdiction. In Arizona, two Customs and Border Protection checkpoints along a main fentanyl-smuggling corridor from Mexico have been left unstaffed. Officers stationed there were sent to process detained migrants.”

A Guardian investigation found that the Trump administration’s redirection of resources to immigration enforcement has dismantled U.S. programs to combat human trafficking, undermining “decades of progress” in developing programs to combat sexual slavery, forced labor, and child exploitation. The State Department’s Trafficking in Persons office lost over 70 percent of its staff, while Homeland Security Investigations agents have been reassigned to immigration raids, which has demoralized them. Reduced access to visas for victims, and intimidating “welfare checks” carried out by ICE agents in tactical gear have further complicated efforts. Meanwhile, “Traffickers exploit the fear of immigration enforcement and the police so they [victims] don’t come forward,” pointed out Stephanie Richard, director of the Sunita Jain Anti-Trafficking Initiative at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.

Pulling 20 percent of FBI agents into the immigration enforcement mission—a greater percentage than were pulled into counter-terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks—has crippled the FBI’s ability to investigate cases against child predators, reported MSNBC’s Ken Dilanian. “Nearly every agent on Baltimore’s domestic terrorism squad was reassigned this year to work full time on immigration enforcement, forcing them to walk away from investigations of a network of violent predators that targets and exploits children online,” two former FBI officials said.

The Associated Press reported on a letter to the military services, signed by 12 of 13 Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voicing strong concerns about the administration’s plan to assign 600 military lawyers, or Judges Advocate General (JAGs), to the Justice Department to serve as immigration judges. “These actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces,” the letter warns.

At the Intercept, Nick Turse tallied the number of active-duty and National Guard personnel serving in border security and immigration enforcement support roles, and found that the Trump administration has now deployed roughly 35,000 military personnel on domestic missions within the United States. That is 75 percent more than an estimate the Intercept compiled in July. Most are in Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas. “The true number of federal troops deployed may be markedly higher.”

The annual National Defense Authorization Act, which recently passed the House of Representatives, included a provision that would allow the Defense Department to deploy private military contractors to the border. This would enable the Pentagon to outsource tasks currently performed by soldiers to companies like the controversial outfit formerly known as Blackwater or the data-mining giant Palantir, the Lever reported.

The Justice Department’s instructions to prosecutors to prioritize immigration cases have brought a sharp increase in prosecutions of undocumented immigrants in San Diego, noted the San Diego Union-Tribune. Prosecutors filed 127 felony or misdemeanor re-entry cases in December 2024 under the Biden administration; that number increased to 486 cases in May 2025, even as border apprehensions plummeted.

In Texas, state police assigned to enforce federal migration law, organized as “regional tactical strike teams,” have helped arrest 3,131 undocumented immigrants between late January and early September, reported Alejandro Serrano at the Texas Tribune. Many arrests took place hundreds of miles from the border: 700 in Austin, Dallas, and Houston.

Expulsions of Central American children remain on hold

Washington, DC federal District Judge Timothy Kelly (a Trump appointee) issued a September 18 preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. DHS had sought to expel 76 children from U.S. shelters in the pre-dawn hours of August 31, the Sunday before Labor Day, only to be blocked by an on-duty judge’s temporary restraining order (see WOLA’s September 5 Border Update).

Kelly’s opinion takes administration officials to task for telling that judge, Sparkle Sooknanan, that the children’s parents were in Guatemala and desired to be reunited with their children. Separately, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller had tweeted that Sooknanan, whom he called “the Biden judge,” was “effectively kidnapping these migrant children.”

This was not true. After the revelation of a document from the Guatemalan government’s General Counsel’s Office recounting unsuccessful efforts to find any parents who actually sought to bring their children back, Trump administration attorneys retracted their story. On September 16, the Government Accountability Project added a whistleblower disclosure alleging that the acting head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), career ICE Homeland Security Investigations official Angie Salazar, likely knew that at least 30 of the Guatemalan children would have faced danger if returned.

“Counsel for Defendants [the Trump administration] explained why it was ‘fairly outrageous’ for Plaintiffs [the children’s attorneys] to have sued: all Defendants wanted to do was reunify children with parents who had requested their return,” read Judge Kelly’s opinion. “But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later. There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

“While he limited the ruling on Thursday to Guatemalan children,” the New York Times explained, “Judge Kelly… warned the government not to interpret the opinion as an invitation to expand its operations.” This refers to indications that the administration has been discussing similar transfers of unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases to Honduras and perhaps elsewhere.

A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona issued a similar temporary restraining order on September 11 to prohibit the deportation of another class of 57 Guatemalan and 12 Honduran children. That order expires on September 26.

The Guatemalan children’s attempted expulsion was a frequent topic in a contentious Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing about unaccompanied minor migrant children held on September 17. Republican senators alleged that hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors were released to unvetted sponsors and that more than 300,000 went “missing” during the Biden years, a misreading of a 2024 DHS Inspector-General report noting that 291,000 lacked court dates. Democrats said the “missing kids” narrative is being weaponized and that the real danger is the Trump administration’s attempts at mass removals and obstacles to sponsors seeking to get kids out of ORR shelters.

Circling 26 Federal Plaza in Prayer

Our New York City Organizer, Vrinda Jagota, joined the New Sanctuary Coalition’s weekly Jericho Walk at 26 Federal Plaza, the building where ICE operates. Together with interfaith partners, Vrinda circled the building seven times, stopping to offer a prayer at each turn. This ritual walk draws on the biblical story of Jericho, symbolizing the spiritual act of bringing down walls of injustice through persistent, loving action.

This year alone, ICE has abducted more than 3,300 New Yorkers, many of whom are held in deplorable conditions after attending court hearings at 26 Federal Plaza. Yesterday’s walk was both a mourning of that reality and a collective call to resist.

Faith Leaders, Politicians, and Direct Action

While Vrinda was at the Jericho Walk, our Executive Director, Sunita Viswanath, joined a coalition of faith leaders—including Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer, Rabbi Abby Stein, Rev. Junia Joplin, Rabbi Rachel Kahn-Troster and others—who accompanied a group of elected officials preparing for a direct action inside the building.

The faith leaders were not permitted past security. They gathered outside, prayed together, and sent the officials forward, blessing their courage. Once inside, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and more than a dozen other city and state leaders sat down outside the 10th-floor holding cells where undocumented immigrants are detained. They unfurled a banner demanding access to the cells—and were met with force. DHS agents arrested eleven officials, including Lander and Williams, after these official had staged a dramatic act of civil disobedience by sitting outside the 10th-floor holding cells with a banner, refusing to move until they were granted access to see the undocumented immigrants detained inside.

A Movement Building Momentum

These actions are part of a growing movement to hold ICE accountable for their deplorable behavior towards our neighbors and to dismantle the systems profiting from immigrant detention and deportation. Climate refugees, families fleeing violence, and individuals simply seeking a better life are caught in a web spun by Big Oil, prison profiteers, and an inhumane immigration system.

Hindus for Human Rights stands with our interfaith partners in demanding an end to these abuses. Yesterday, our community witnessed both the power of prayerful resistance and the necessity of bold, direct action.

What Comes Next

The fight isn’t over. We invite our community to join this movement:

Follow local groups like @newsanctuarynsc, @sunrisenyc, and other grassroots partners leading these actions.

Show up for future Jericho Walks to embody hope and resistance through prayer and presence.

Call on your elected officials to demand ICE out of NYC and an end to the detention-to-deportation pipeline.

Yesterday’s actions remind us that faith and justice are inseparable. Together, we can tear down the walls of fear and cruelty—and build a world rooted in compassion and human dignity.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45b55d7563de000169a046/5d82f81daa54b15405efff8f/68cda349cfcc673625a0e779/1758309857909/New+INstagram+size+PRESS+STATEMENT+TEMPLATE+%28Instagram+Post+%2845%29%29+%2812%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-19 20:57:15.519636

What happens now? - WHYY,"Associated Press, Jake Offenhartz",,,,,https://whyy.org/articles/immigration-judge-orders-mahmoud-khalil-deported/,"Three months after his release from an immigration jail, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil is facing the growing threat of deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel.

In court documents made public Wednesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil should be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The decision marked a setback for Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident and recent Columbia University graduate student who became the first person targeted by President Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. But while the ruling puts him one step closer to a final order of removal, it is far from the last word in the case.

For now, Khalil remains protected from detention and deportation under a separate judicial order. His legal team has said they intend to appeal the immigration judge’s ruling, which Khalil has characterized as “further evidence of retaliation” from a “kangaroo court.”

Here’s a look at where things stand in the ongoing legal battle:

What did the immigration judge in Louisiana decide?

The Sept. 12 ruling by the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, builds on her previous order issued in April, which found Khalil could be forced out of the country as a national security risk.

Khalil’s attorneys had challenged that decision, citing his lack of criminal history and close ties to the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen, as is his 5-month-old son, who was born while Khalil was in federal custody.

Khalil was a prominent figure in protests at Columbia University against the war in Gaza, which spread to campuses nationwide. He was arrested inside his campus apartment building this past March and accused by the Trump administration of supporting “pro-Hamas” activity, referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Khalil has repeatedly denied the charge and the federal government has not provided evidence for it.

Khalil has argued he is being targeted for exercising his free speech, pointing to a memo by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that justified his arrest on the grounds that his pro-Palestinian beliefs could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.

In her latest decision, Comans said she lacked the authority “to question foreign policy determinations” and that Khalil’s “limited family ties” to the country did not amount to a compelling reason to waive her prior ruling.

Comans then sided with the government on a separate claim, finding that Khalil had “willfully misrepresented” facts about his background on his green card application, including his role in a United Nations agency that provides services to Palestinian refugees.

Khalil has maintained that any omissions on the application were unintentional.

What happens now?

Khalil’s attorneys said Wednesday that they intend to appeal the decision. But they also expressed concern about their odds of success in the reliably conservative federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the case.

If he were to lose his appeal, Khalil would be stripped of his permanent residency status, further restricting his ability to work and travel, according to his attorneys. But the government would still be prohibited from removing him under a June 11 order from a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz.

That order will remain in place while his civil rights case plays out in New Jersey. It may soon be “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s deportation, according to a letter that his attorneys sent Wednesday to Farbiarz.

Oral arguments in that case could begin as soon as next month.

Where would he be deported?

Judge Comans has said Khalil would be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or “in the alternative” Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

Attorneys for Khalil have said the publicity surrounding his case would leave him in mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.

Khalil, 30, fled Syria for Lebanon in 2013 after joining protests against then-President Bashar al-Assad. His family has roots in Tiberias but were displaced during the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what is now Israel, according to court documents.

Khalil has said he will continue advocating for Palestinians as his legal battle plays out. He is also currently suing the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging that he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite.

It appears to be becoming more and more punitive, and solitary confinement is part of that.

Over 14 months from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention facilities run by the U.S. Homeland Security Department’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, the report found.

From February to March 2025, the number of detainees subjected to the practice increased by an average of 6.5% per month, more than six times the average recorded between April and November 2024 under the Biden administration.

It appears to be becoming more and more punitive, and solitary confinement is part of that.

— Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical advisor for Physicians for Human Rights

The United Nations says solitary confinement, isolation without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day, should be banned except in “very exceptional circumstances” and should never be used to isolate the mentally ill or minors. No one should be held for longer than 15 days, which the U.N. considers psychological torture. But previous reporting by ICIJ has documented ICE’s misuse and overuse of solitary confinement as a form of punishment intended only as a last resort.

“This report adds to over a decade of persistent advocacy and research,” the report said. “ICE must publicly commit to ending solitary confinement entirely.”

In 2019, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Solitary Voices investigation found that ICE detention centers had used solitary confinement to isolate thousands of the most vulnerable immigrant detainees, including people with severe mental illness or disabilities, and LGBTQI people, for weeks and months at a time. Follow-up reporting in 2020 found that ICE resorted to solitary confinement to isolate sick people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The United States maintains the world’s largest immigration detention system, with over 60,000 people in immigration detention this August — a record high hit under the second Trump administration. Solitary confinement has been used across administrations, however. A previous Physicians for Human Rights report released in February 2024 also noted an uptick in the use of solitary confinement under the Biden administration.

But the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which gave ICE a historic $75 billion in additional funding and quadrupled its detention budget, has increased the urgency of the report’s findings, according to Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical advisor for Physicians for Human Rights and assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.

“It’s important to think about this in the context of rapidly escalating detention system in the United States,” Dr. Peeler said. “It appears to be becoming more and more punitive, and solitary confinement is part of that.”

The report, based on publicly available ICE data as well as records obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, documents how the rate of monthly increases in the use of solitary confinement during the first four months of the Trump administration is twice as high as it was between 2018 and 2023.

The analysis also found that during the first three months of 2025, people with vulnerabilities — such as those with disabilities, mental health conditions or those at risk of violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity — were held in solitary confinement for more than twice as long as they had been over the same period in 2022.

ICE did not respond to ICIJ’s request for comment but Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told The Guardian that detainee safety, security and wellbeing was “a top priority at ICE.” McLaughlin said any allegation that ICE is “weaponizing” solitary confinement against detainees was “DISGUSTING and FALSE.”

Since December 2024, new federal reporting requirements have made it mandatory for ICE to collect and report data on all solitary confinement placements, regardless of duration. But, despite the transparency measures, ICE data has continued to be notoriously barebones, and in some cases inconsistent, said Arevik Avedian, a law lecturer and the director of Empirical Research Services at Harvard Law School.

“I use, oftentimes, a web archive to be able to go back to the different versions and check and see: what are the things that are changing, and how they’re changing?” Avedian said. “There was a month during this Trump administration where the data was published, and then in the next updated version, two weeks later, that monthly information for solitary confinement disappeared, and then it was put back.”

In that way, even with some data available, ICE detention remains “a black box,” she said.

“I kind of shudder to think what it’s really like if we had a truly complete, comprehensive data set of every single placement, every single person,” Dr. Peeler said.

The report also broke down data on solitary confinement in New England, finding segregation was used to retaliate against detainees for filing grievances, sharing food or requesting access to basic necessities like showers. Between 2018 and 2023, nearly three out of four solitary confinement placements in New England lasted 15 days or longer; on average, detainees spent about a month in solitary, and some were isolated for more than a year.

In light of a forceful federal immigration crackdown and ballooning funding for the federal immigration agency, the report calls on lawmakers at all levels of government to use their powers to intervene and impose stronger oversight mechanisms in detention facilities, such as unannounced inspections or visits.

“The urgency of addressing these abuses is further heightened by ICE’s active obstruction of Congressional oversight, including denying entry to lawmakers seeking to inspect facilities in their own districts,” the report said. “ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities.”",https://media.icij.org/uploads/2025/09/2221602767-Edited.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:14.509195

Political violence has targeted those of every political persuasion and of no political persuasion. It is un-American and wrong to use this act of violence as a pretext for weaponizing the government to threaten nonprofit and charitable organizations, other perceived adversaries, or any class of people. They did not commit this murder, and the vast powers of the government should not be abused to threaten their constitutionally-protected free speech and other rights.

Nonprofit and charitable organizations support critical services to our nation – working with faith communities, caring for vulnerable populations, upholding the Constitution, defending the rule of law and much more. Attacks on nonprofits and charities threaten that essential work happening everywhere across our country.

We implore the government to cease its escalation of political division, and stop the unjustified targeting of organizations and people in the wake of this terrible act of political violence.

This moment of tragedy does not call for exploiting a horrific act to further deepen our divides and make us less safe. It calls for unity–unity against violence and unity of purpose as Americans.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants.

The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that the administration wrongly ended Temporary Protected Status for the Venezuelans.

The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold the ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen while the case continues.

In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the new court filing that the justices’ May order should also apply to the current case.

“This case is familiar to the court and involves the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court’s orders on the emergency docket,” Sauer wrote.

The result, he said, is that the “new order, just like the old one, halted the vacatur and termination of TPS affecting over 300,000 aliens based on meritless legal theories.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending TPS for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection during Joe Biden’s presidency. TPS is granted in 18-month increments.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary.

Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security acted “with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela’s TPS” status.

In denying the administration’s emergency appeal, Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote for a unanimous three-judge appellate panel that Chen determined that DHS made its “decisions first and searched for a valid basis for those decisions second.”",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Tariffs_07704_b0ade8-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:27.322609

Tensions have been rising in the Chicago area for the last two weeks, since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents intensified their push to arrest people in the country illegally, under an effort called Operation Midway Blitz. Demonstrators have typically gathered outside the federal detention facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday mornings, and their numbers have grown in recent weeks.

During the standoff with protesters on Friday, ICE deployed tear gas and pepper balls at the group, including several local officials. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Advocates for immigrants have repeatedly raised concerns about conditions at the detention facility, which is used for processing immigration arrests.

“This facility should be shut down, that’s what it comes down to,” said Byron Sigcho-Lopez, a member of the Chicago City Council, who was there during the standoff. Mr. Sigcho-Lopez, who represents a ward with many Latino residents, has been a vocal opponent of ICE’S presence in Chicago.

Mayor Daniel Biss of Evanston, Ill., after wiping tear gas from his eyes, called the actions of ICE “a performance in brutality.”

“They are trying to send a message of public violence and oppression,” he said. “Our job is to resist it as visibly, vocally and aggressively as we can while staying nonviolent.”

Before the clash, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton had stopped outside the Broadview facility and said that she and Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, were monitoring ICE activities in Illinois.

Last Friday, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old man whom officers were trying to arrest during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb of Chicago near O’Hare International Airport with a significant Latino population. The ICE officer “followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/19/multimedia/19trump-news-ice-topart-gpfm/19trump-news-ice-topart-gpfm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 16:57:18.555810

Bender, Apoorva Mandavilli",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/19/us/trump-news,"Some colleges, including Columbia University, have negotiated deals with the Trump administration.
Some, like the trade agreements Mr. Trump announced with Vietnam and South Korea in July, have yet to be completed.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent first announced that the United States had a “framework” for a deal to keep TikTok operational in the United States at a news conference in Madrid on Monday.
“We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Mr. Trump said.
It stated that the United States would “withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States.” During its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States left behind thousands of weapons and other pieces of military equipment and a sprawling embassy compound that sits vacant in the center of Kabul.","“This is what restoring sanity to America’s immigration system looks like,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a statement. “Conditions in Syria no longer prevent their nationals from returning home. Syria has been a hotbed of terrorism and extremism for nearly two decades, and it is contrary to our national interest to allow Syrians to remain in our country. T.P.S. is meant to be temporary.”

Some immigration policy experts criticized the decision, saying that conditions in Syria were still unstable and that Syrians did not pose major terrorism risks. After more than a decade of civil war, rebels ended the Assad family’s brutal rule in Syria late last year. Although Syria’s new leaders have sought to move away from dictatorship, concerns over sectarian conflict and violence remain.

Amanda Baran, the former head of policy for Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the decision to end the program was “gutting for the thousands of Syrians here with T.P.S. and the communities in which they live.”

“Conditions in Syria remain dangerous and unstable, clearly warranting an extension under the law,” Ms. Baran said. “This administration’s disregard for the expertise of human rights experts is having real, dire consequences on the lives of everyday people as demonstrated by this reckless decision.”

David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors more legal immigration, said that Syrians historically did not pose significant terrorism risks, and that federal officials could choose to deny an individual from the program if they believed that person was a threat to national security.

Mr. Bier said he also thought it was contradictory for the department to assert that Syria was a “hotbed” of terrorism, while saying that it was safe for Syrians to return there.

Syrians with T.P.S. will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country before they are subject to arrest and deportation, department officials said. The program, which was first authorized for Syrians in 2012 and extended several times, was slated to end on Sept. 30 after receiving an extension from the Biden administration.

The Obama administration first authorized the protections because of the civil warfare in Syria. In a statement announcing the designation, Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary at the time, said Syrians in the United States “would face serious threats to their personal safety” if they were forced to return home. She also said applicants would undergo full background checks to gain approval for T.P.S.

The end of the T.P.S. program is the latest effort by the Homeland Security Department to terminate deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants who had been authorized to temporarily live and work in the United States. The administration has also moved to end the status for people from countries including Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Cameroon and Afghanistan.

The actions are part of the Trump administration’s broader initiative to ramp up deportations and crack down on immigration. The administration has also moved to end other programs that temporarily authorized hundreds of thousands of migrants to live and work in the country lawfully, including a Biden-era program that granted protections to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Administration officials have said the protections were always meant to be temporary and that conditions in certain countries have improved, making it safe for migrants to return home.

The protections for Syrians have been extended multiple times. During President Trump’s first term, his administration extended the designation twice, though it excluded migrants who came to live in the United States after Aug. 1, 2016. Administration officials said at the time that the ongoing armed conflict in Syria had justified allowing Syrians to remain in the country.

The Biden administration extended the program three times. It also opened up the program to more people, allowing Syrians who had been living in the United States since Jan. 25, 2024, to apply for T.P.S.

Some of the Trump administration’s efforts to end deportation protections have been met with legal challenges. After the administration tried to terminate temporary protections for Haitians by September, for example, a federal judge blocked it from doing so until at least next year. Before he left office, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. extended those protections through February 2026.

Still, the administration is insisting on a guarantee of more than $36 million, representing about 30 percent of the federal financial aid that has flowed to the university during the past year, because of financial risks posed by more than a dozen government investigations targeting the university.

Harvard officials have never suggested that the university’s financial footing is in any immediate danger. The school has the largest endowment of any in the nation, but most of that $53 billion fund is restricted for specific purposes.

University leaders have, however, expressed concerns about the potential long-term effect of the monthslong battle with the administration, which has resulted in the freezing of billions of dollars in federal research funds.

In a separate letter, the administration on Friday also warned Harvard about additional enforcement actions from the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights unless the university provides more documents related to its admissions policies, including individualized student data on race, gender and standardized test scores.

The Trump administration’s targeting of Harvard is the most prominent part of its broad assault on higher education this year, rooted in conservative concerns over diversity practices and the handling of campus antisemitism. The pressure campaign has plunged campuses into financial and political crises as the government cuts research grants, opens investigations and demands steep settlement payments. Some colleges, including Columbia University, have negotiated deals with the Trump administration.

Harvard has privately considered a settlement, but has so far resisted government pressure. A Harvard spokesman declined to comment on the latest inquiries.

The university previously criticized the government’s actions as retaliation against Harvard for defending its rights and freedom. A federal judge agreed earlier this month, ruling that the Trump administration had broken the law by freezing research money and ordering no further funding blockades “in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms” of civil rights law.

The White House has vowed to appeal the ruling, but has restarted the flow of research funds to the university, including $46 million from the Health and Human Services Department on Friday, said Jason Newton, a spokesman for Harvard.

“We are pleased to see the disbursement,” Mr. Newton said. “This is an initial step, and we hope to continue to see funding restored across all of the federal agencies.”

The Education Department opened its investigation into Harvard’s admissions policies in May, and the university has provided a trove of documents. But the administration has maintained that Harvard has refused to provide individualized and anonymized data for each student — such as race, ethnicity, gender, standardized test scores and grade point average — that the government says will show whether the university is discriminating against white and Asian students.

The aggressive actions from the Trump admini stration come as negotiations between Harvard and the White House have stalled over a landmark settlement that would restore the university’s research funding and resolve the multitude of federal investigations aimed at addressing a perceived liberal bias on campus.

The Cambridge, Mass.-based university has challenged the administration in court and resisted the White House’s push to include an independent monitor to ensure compliance with any agreement. The administration views a monitor as a way to strengthen the current framework of a deal that some on Mr. Trump’s team view as too favorable to Harvard. University negotiators have consistently opposed the idea of a monitor.

Harvard and the White House engaged in a steady back-and-forth earlier this year over how to resolve the administration’s concerns about antisemitism on campus, the legality of the college’s admissions polices and additional issues raised by more than a dozen separate federal investigations opened since February.

Still, the government has continued to ramp up the pressure. The State Department demanded a trove of detailed records about the university’s international students in July. In August, the Commerce Department opened a new investigation into Harvard’s patents.

Now, the Federal Student Aid office is raising questions about the university’s financial stability by pointing to risks presented by the flurry of federal investigations aimed at Harvard.

The letter from the student aid office also said Harvard’s sale of $750 million in bonds in April, layoffs of staff over the summer and a salary freeze initiated this year “call into question the ability of Harvard to meet its financial responsibility obligations.”

And the panelists said they felt unready to decide whether to limit the use of a vaccine for hepatitis B that is typically given to all newborns. Some said they still had questions about the vaccine’s safety, while others seemed relieved that the panel did not make what they saw as a rash decision that might harm children.

“We are more prudent when we are cautious,” Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a neuroscientist formerly at the National Institutes of Health, said as he voted to table the vote.

Thursday’s session ended with the panel members at odds. A hot microphone caught one panelist calling another committee member “an idiot,” although it was unclear who was speaking.

Friday’s session, too, at times devolved into raised voices and sharp-toned remarks. Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison to the committee from the American College of Physicians, accused the committee’s chair, Martin Kulldorff, of muting him.

“You want debate and discussion, but you’re muting people and silencing them,” Dr. Goldman said. “If you could respectfully tell the public how you are going to be analyzing all of these vaccine decisions, we can have confidence in this committee.”

Dr. Kulldorff retorted: “You made that comment before, and I responded to that comment in a very nice and polite manner.”

The decisions of the committee, which is meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, are of enormous importance. Most private insurers are required to cover the shots it recommends — although they may choose to cover those not recommended — and many state policies on vaccines are tied to the committee’s guidelines.

At least some members seemed aligned with Mr. Kennedy’s goal of making sweeping changes to routine childhood immunizations. Mr. Kennedy has maintained for years that children receive too many shots, and he has incorrectly claimed that the vaccines in use today were never properly tested.

The indecision of the panelists was a sign of the hurried way that Mr. Kennedy assembled the committee. Most of the panelists are first-time members, and their inexperience seemed to lead to the confusion that marred the meeting. About half of the committee members were appointed to the panel earlier this week.

On Thursday, the committee voted to rescind the M.M.R.V. vaccine’s use in children under 4. A second vote was on whether the Vaccines for Children program, which provides shots to about half of American children, should continue to cover the cost of the shot. The committee voted yes on Thursday and then reversed that decision on Friday, in another vote.

Such a contradiction was a first for the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, as was the decision the next day to redo the vote.

Approving which shots the vaccine program should cover is a key function of the committee, but some members did not appear to know how their decision would affect coverage. Several members said Thursday that they were unclear what they were voting for. One abstained from the vote, citing his confusion as the reason.

The members themselves seemed uncomfortably aware of the optics.

The panelists have “enormous depth and knowledge” about vaccines, Dr. Kulldorff acknowledged on Friday, but they are “rookies” when it comes to how the A.C.I.P. committee typically makes decisions.

In June, Mr. Kennedy fired all 17 previous members of the committee, and appointed seven new members, many of whom are aligned with his vaccine skepticism. He announced another five members earlier this week. Members of the A.C.I.P. are typically vetted for months to years before they are invited to join.

Some medical organizations sharply criticized the committee’s skipping of the methods the A.C.I.P. has typically followed, with detailed discussions on the feasibility and acceptability of the decision, the cost-benefit ratio and equity concerns.

Instead, the panelists were “distracted” by small studies that raised safety concerns, said Dr. Amy Middleman, who heads pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Case Western Reserve University. She is a liaison to the committee from the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Every vaccine and drug carries risks, she said, but “the committee’s scientific challenge is to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”

Public health experts who study hepatitis B said they were pleased that the committee postponed the vote on that vaccine.

“Tabling the vote is appropriate and a relief,” said Dr. Noele P. Nelson, a senior author on the current guidelines for the vaccine and a former leader of the C.D.C.’s hepatitis vaccines work group.

“This discussion should not be rushed and would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation of the public health impact,” she said.

Babies are routinely immunized for hepatitis B within 24 hours after birth. The committee was scheduled to vote on whether the shot should instead be recommended only for those newborns whose mothers were known to be infected. Other babies, the motion said, should be immunized only after they are at least one month old.

Hepatitis B experts noted that the vaccine has nearly eliminated maternal transmission of the disease in the United States, slashing the incidence to fewer than 20 cases a year from about 20,000 a year before 1991, the experts said.

They said delaying the first dose of the vaccine would increase the risk to newborns because many cases in pregnant women are missed, despite a longstanding recommendation to test them routinely.

Infected women may also not be identified because of inaccurate results or because of problems reporting or interpreting the results.

“A universal birth dose recommendation is the only way to ensure we don’t miss vaccinating newborns exposed to this virus, including those whose mothers were not tested during pregnancy,” said Dr. John. W. Ward, director of the Coalition for Global Hepatitis Elimination and a former head of the C.D.C.’s viral hepatitis division.

Hepatitis B experts also questioned the panel’s focus on the vaccine’s safety, despite years of data from millions of babies showing that the shot is safe. Some committee members were also unhappy with the discourse.

The discussion about the hepatitis B vaccine’s potential harms was veering into “speculation,” Dr. Hibbeln said on Thursday, sounding frustrated. “We need data on real risks and benefits.”

The committee is scheduled to vote on Covid-19 vaccines later on Friday and is expected to restrict access to those shots.

A readout of the call from a Chinese state-run news agency was similarly vague, but Mr. Xi appeared to support a commercial solution to TikTok. It reported that Mr. Xi said the Chinese government “respects the wishes of the company in question and is glad to see business negotiations in line with market rules and a solution that conforms to Chinese laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides.”

TikTok’s future has been in limbo in the United States since January, when a federal law took effect requiring the company to find a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the United States. The law was intended to address national security concerns that the app’s ownership could give Beijing a channel to spread propaganda or to collect sensitive data about Americans. Mr. Trump has extended the deadline four times.

ByteDance has for months been in talks to spin out the app’s American operations into a new company, and to bring on new U.S. investors, like the software giant Oracle, to dilute its Chinese ownership and satisfy the law’s requirements. The list of other potential investors has been in flux, two people familiar with the talks said.

In a statement on Friday, ByteDance thanked the two leaders for “their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States.” The company added that it would “work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.”

The fate of the app has also become entangled with trade negotiations between the United States and China, as the two sides have haggled over tariffs, China’s supply of minerals and other topics. In his post Friday, Mr. Trump said that he would meet Mr. Xi at a summit in South Korea this fall and go to China early next year, and that Mr. Xi would reciprocate.

Mr. Trump has in the past heralded major deals that ended up falling short. The president has announced a flurry of trade deals this year, only to have some foreign trading partners subsequently dispute the terms he described. Some, like the trade agreements Mr. Trump announced with Vietnam and South Korea in July, have yet to be completed.

His deals with China have not always materialized, either. In 2020, the president announced a trade deal in which China would commit to buying an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services by 2021. A 2022 analysis of the trade data found that China had bought only 57 percent of the exports it promised.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump added a detail to the TikTok agreement: The United States would be receiving a “tremendous fee” for putting the deal together. If that occurs, it would be the latest example of the government’s incursion into corporate deal making. In recent months, the Trump administration has negotiated and obtained a 10 percent stake in Intel, and a “golden share” in U.S. Steel as part of its sale to Nippon Steel.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent first announced that the United States had a “framework” for a deal to keep TikTok operational in the United States at a news conference in Madrid on Monday.

Chinese officials had previously vowed to oppose a forced sale of TikTok, and in 2020 it amended its export control list to include technology like algorithms and source codes.

China decided to reach an agreement with the United States on TikTok because “this consensus serves the interests of both sides,” Li Chenggang, China’s vice minister of commerce, said in Madrid on Monday after meeting with American officials, according to a readout published in Chinese state media.

On Tuesday, one day before a deadline for TikTok to separate from ByteDance, Mr. Trump issued an extension — the fourth this year — to mid-December. With the president’s suggestion on Friday of a deal approval, the extension could prove to be the final one.

Ana Swanson contributed reporting.

Republicans have offered a plan to keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The House passed that plan on Friday in a 217-to-212 vote, with all but one Democrat in opposition.

Democrats have put forward an alternative that would extend funding through Oct. 31 and add more than $1 trillion to extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid and other health program cuts that Republicans included in their marquee tax cut and domestic policy law enacted over the summer. G.O.P. leaders have flatly ruled out those changes.

On Friday, neither bill could muster the 60 votes necessary to move ahead, with each party dug in against the other’s measure. If they fail to break their impasse and enact at least a temporary spending plan by Sept. 30, the government will shut down.

The Democratic plan failed in a 47-to-45 vote. The Republican plan failed in a 44-to-48 vote.

All Democrats but one, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, opposed the G.O.P. proposal. Two Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky, joined Democrats to oppose their party’s bill.

Democrats refused to provide the votes to move forward with the Republicans’ plan because, they said, the G.O.P. has not negotiated with them on what should be included at a time when President Trump has sought to usurp congressional spending power.

“Republicans cannot expect that another take-it-or-leave-it extension of government funding that fails to address health care costs is going to cut it for the American people,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “What we should do instead is move forward with our Democratic proposal to work to keep the government open, to lower people’s premiums, protect people’s health care.”

Republican leaders have said there is nothing to negotiate because their funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or “C.R.,” keeps spending levels flat and has no policy changes attached.

“The Republican bill is a clean, nonpartisan, short-term continuing resolution to fund the government to give us time to do the full appropriations process,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader. “And the Democrat bill is the exact opposite. It’s what you might call not a clean C.R.; a dirty C.R. laden down with partisan policies and appeals to the Democrats’ leftist base.”

Mr. Thune said that he would call up the Republican proposal for another vote when senators return to Washington on Sept. 29. Lawmakers are set to spend the next week working at home.

Democrats argue that their plan includes vital measures to help Americans deal with health care costs.

If the Obamacare tax credits are allowed to lapse, around four million people are projected to lose coverage starting in 2026, and prices would go up for around 20 million more. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 10 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 as a result of the health cuts in the new tax law.

Democrats’ stopgap spending plan also would restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back funding Congress previously approved, following the White House’s repeated efforts to unilaterally cancel such spending.

And it would provide far more funding to strengthen security measures for government officials than House Republicans have proposed — $326 million in total, compared to the $88 million boost sought by the G.O.P.

In March, the last time Congress faced a government funding deadline, Senate Democrats agonized for days over whether to allow Republicans’ stopgap measure to move forward. They ultimately allowed it to advance, prompting an outpouring of anger from liberal voters and activists who had urged their leaders to deny their votes in protest of Mr. Trump’s assault on the federal bureaucracy and unilateral defunding of programs.

This time, Democrats have not hesitated to signal their refusal to go along with Mr. Trump and Republicans, arguing that they are in a much different position after passage of the tax cut and domestic policy bill.

That measure, Mr. Schumer said, “is highly unpopular with the American people.

“Democrats are unified,” he went on. “We have been strong on the same message for a very long time, which is: We need to help the American people lower their costs, particularly on health care.”

It was not clear who wrote the draft congressional authorization or whether it could pass the Republican-led Congress, but the White House has been passing it around the executive branch.

The broadly worded proposal, which would legally authorize the president to kill people he deems narco-terrorists and attack countries he says helped them, has set off alarm bells in some quarters of the executive branch and on Capitol Hill, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity about sensitive internal deliberations.

Three people familiar with the matter said that Representative Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and combat veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, was involved in developing the draft. Mr. Mills, a staunch Trump ally, declined to comment on the potential legislation or his role. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, declined to comment, citing a policy against discussing “drafts that may or may not be circulating.”

An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said the draft originated with a member of Congress who had asked for technical assistance in improving it. The official portrayed its circulation for input by executive branch agencies as a routine courtesy that should not be interpreted as support for the idea.

The measure has emerged amid an escalating debate in Washington over the president’s war-making power and Congress’s role in authorizing the use of American military force, after the Trump administration opened a deadly campaign against the boaters.

The two boat attacks — killing what Mr. Trump has said were 14 people he accused of smuggling drugs toward the United States — were the latest in a series of military operations the president has taken without congressional authorization, raising constitutional concerns among some lawmakers in both parties, who say their branch should play a greater role in such decisions.

Critics have also said that Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have given illegal orders, causing Special Operations troops to target civilians — even if they are suspected of crimes — in apparent violation of laws against murder.

The U.S. Coast Guard, with help from the Navy, has long treated drug trafficking as a law enforcement problem, interdicting boats and arresting their crews if a search confirmed suspicions of drug smuggling. Regular forces repeated that approach with a Venezuelan fishing boat last week, releasing its crew after the suspicions apparently proved to be inaccurate.

But the administration has insisted that Mr. Trump has legal authority, under his constitutional power as commander in chief, to direct Special Operations forces to instead summarily kill those suspected of drug running as if they are combatants on a battlefield. Citing the roughly 100,000 overdose deaths of Americans each year, the administration has invoked self-defense and the law of armed conflict.

Congress has not authorized any armed conflict with drug cartels. The draft legislation, which the White House Office of Management and Budget has circulated within the executive branch for comment, would address that potential weakness in the administration’s argument — at least as a matter of domestic law.

Following the first boat strike, on Sept. 2, Democrats and some Republicans expressed concern about the White House’s legal basis for the attack, even as administration officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, said there would be more to come.

Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would introduce a measure under the War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law aimed at checking a president’s power to wage war without the consent of Congress, that directs the executive branch to curtail the operation.

Before Mr. Schiff did so, Mr. Trump on Monday announced a second deadly strike against what he described as a Venezuelan boat in international waters. Together with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, Mr. Schiff on Friday morning introduced the measure, which would direct the administration to end any additional planned strikes and reassert congressional authority over the use of military force.

The resolution also states that Congress has received insufficient information about the vessels, their threat level or the legal basis for using force against them. It also reaffirms a commitment to funding intelligence gathering, diplomatic tools and counternarcotics efforts to fight drug trafficking.

At a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday, several Democrats asked questions about the legal authority for the military strikes. But a Pentagon nominee said he was unable to answer them. At the end of the hearing, the Republican chairman of the panel, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said the administration must respond.

“The questions about what happened in the Caribbean are going to have to be answered,” Mr. Wicker said. “This committee has congressional oversight responsibility. Members are entitled to ask the questions that they’ve asked, and answers will be given. And I just think it’s important for every American to understand that obligation.”

Some Republicans have discussed ways to shore up Mr. Trump’s legal authority. Mr. Mills, who served during conflicts in Kosovo and Iraq, advised the Pentagon in Mr. Trump’s first term before launching his bid for Congress in 2021 and winning election the following year.

The draft, which was described to The New York Times, would cover groups that the executive branch designates as terrorists and that Mr. Trump determines, in consultation with Congress, have either trafficked in drugs to finance terrorist activities or used terrorist tactics to advance narcotics-related enterprises. Nations that harbored such groups would also be covered.

It does not define what constitutes sufficient consultation with Congress or what counts as terrorist tactics.

Such an authorization would amount to giving Mr. Trump “a blank check,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and a former senior Justice Department official in the Bush administration.

“It’s insanely broad,” Professor Goldsmith said. “This is an open-ended war authorization against an untold number of countries, organizations and persons that the president could deem within its scope.”

Professor Goldsmith said that Congress had the authority, as a matter of domestic law, to authorize the use of military force against nonstate groups. But deliberately killing civilians who are not directly participating in hostilities — even those suspected of being criminals — would still violate international law, he added.

The draft appears to be modeled on the broad authorization that Congress granted President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Like that one, it does not name a specific enemy — empowering the president to decide whom to target — and is not confined to geographical limits.

The 2001 law was originally understood to target Al Qaeda and its Taliban hosts in Afghanistan. But over the years, as the original Al Qaeda splintered and morphed, administrations of both parties stretched it into standing legal authority to fight related groups of Islamist militants, like the Islamic State and Al Shabab, in places like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

The draft has one key difference: It would expire after five years if Congress did not act to extend it. The 2001 law will remain on the books until lawmakers repeal it. Repeated efforts in Congress to do so have foundered over disagreements about what should replace it.

Any decision to push the draft legislation to Congress is likely to set off a pitched political fight over how to weigh a serious problem against fatigue with open-ended “forever wars,” and the wisdom of what would be a massive expansion of Mr. Trump’s ability to use the military as he sees fit. It would also raise the question of whether Congress was effectively giving Mr. Trump the authority to wage a regime-change war in Venezuela.

Mr. Trump’s administration has been ratcheting up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro, calling him an illegitimate leader and accusing him of directing the actions of criminal gangs and drug cartels.

Starting in February, the Trump administration broke new ground by labeling various Latin American criminal gangs and drug cartels as “terrorist” organizations, including some from Venezuela. That label and status has traditionally been given only to violent groups with religious or ideological ends, as opposed to criminals seeking illicit profits.

Mr. Trump claimed the right to use an 18th-century wartime deportation law, the Alien Enemies Act, to summarily remove Venezuelans suspected of belonging to one of the criminal gangs his administration had deemed to be terrorists, Tren de Aragua, without due process hearings.

To invoke the law, Mr. Trump claimed that Tren de Aragua was committing crimes in the United States under the direction and control of Mr. Maduro. But the U.S. intelligence community, weighing the available evidence about the gang, believed that accusation was false, a memo declassified in May showed.

Mr. Trump used the law to send several planeloads of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison. But courts have for now blocked more such transfers, and have raised doubts about whether the law could be legitimately invoked under present circumstances.

A congressionally authorized armed conflict, however, would provide a new basis for the administration to claim a right to resume using it for summary deportations.

In July, Mr. Trump signed a still-secret order directing the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American criminal gangs and drug cartels, while stepping up rhetorical attacks on Mr. Maduro. And in August, the U.S. Navy sent a heavy amount of firepower into the southern Caribbean Sea, leading to the Sept. 2 and Sept. 15 attacks.

This week, before Mr. Trump announced the second boat strike, Mr. Maduro condemned the Sept. 2 attack as a “heinous crime” and “a military attack on civilians who were not at war and were not militarily threatening any country.”

He said that if the United States believed that the boat’s passengers were drug traffickers, they should have been arrested. He accused the administration of trying to start a war.

Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

“We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us,” Mr. Trump said. He added that Bagram was strategically important for the United States because “it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Trump has said in the past that the United States should not have abandoned the air base, but his comments on Thursday were the first public acknowledgment that negotiations to reclaim it might be underway.

The Taliban government was quick to respond, suggesting that it was open to conversation but not the return of U.S. security personnel.

“Without the U.S. having any military presence in Afghanistan, both Afghanistan and the U.S. need to engage with each other, and they can have political and economic relations based on mutual respect and shared interests,” Zakir Jalaly, an Afghan foreign ministry official, said on social media.

“Afghans have never accepted the military presence of anyone throughout history,” Mr. Jalaly added. “But for other kinds of engagement, all paths remain open for them.” He called Mr. Trump “a good businessman and negotiator, more than just a politician.”

Other officials were less diplomatic. Muhajer Farahi, a deputy minister, posted part of a poem on X: “Those who once smashed their heads against the rocks with us, their minds have still not found peace.” He ended his post with “Bagram, Afghanistan.”

Mr. Trump did not specify in his comments on Thursday what he envisioned for Bagram. The United States has kept a minimal level of public engagement with Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, restricting it to hostage negotiations. In a rare visit to Afghanistan last week, Adam Boehler, the Trump administration’s special envoy for hostage response, met with the Afghan foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, in Kabul.

The State Department referred any comment about Bagram to the White House, which referred comments to the Department of Defense. It said in a statement on Thursday that “we are always ready to execute any mission at the president’s direction.”

In Washington, congressional Democrats assailed Mr. Trump’s comments.

“It’s deeply, deeply troubling that the president of the United States can be that idiotic,” Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said in an interview.

Afghanistan has remained largely isolated on the global stage since the Taliban took control, in August 2021. The Taliban government has not been recognized by any country other than Russia. Its economy is struggling to attract foreign support and private investments. And as high-level meetings at the United Nations General Assembly are set to begin on Monday, Afghanistan will once again not be represented because its officials face a U.N. travel ban.

Bagram, which sits 25 miles north of Kabul and was built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s, was the largest U.S. base in Afghanistan during its 20-year occupation of the country.

Mr. Trump said in March that the United States should have stayed at Bagram “not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it’s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.” At the time, he claimed that Bagram was “now under China’s influence,” which the Taliban denied.

The 2020 deal signed between the Taliban and United States under the first Trump administration contained no provision to retain Bagram Air Base or any other foothold. It stated that the United States would “withdraw from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States.”

During its withdrawal from Afghanistan, the United States left behind thousands of weapons and other pieces of military equipment and a sprawling embassy compound that sits vacant in the center of Kabul. U.S. military uniforms and shoes can still be found in Kabul’s bazaars, and a message in graffiti greets international visitors coming from the airport: “Our nation defeated America with the help of God.”

The UK military is focused on defending the nation rather than stopping asylum seekers from crossing the Channel, a cabinet minister has said.

US President Donald Trump suggested that military intervention could be used to deal with illegal migration to the UK during his state visit this week.

But Trade Secretary Peter Kyle has rejected that call, telling BBC Breakfast the UK Border Force has specific responsibility for policing UK borders.

Hundreds of migrants attempted to cross the Channel earlier on Friday, as the second deportation under the government's ""one in, one out"" deal with France took place.

Six boats are believed to have set off from northern France, as the smugglers made the most of a break in the windy weather in the Channel. There had been no crossings for a week before then due to choppy seas.

People were then seen being taken from the Port of Dover by coach, including two small children.

On Friday morning, an Eritrean man became the second migrant to be deported under the government's deal with France, after he lost a High Court bid to halt his removal.

The Home Office tightened the rules around human trafficking claims to win that case.

On Friday afternoon, Home Office sources said an Iranian male had also been returned to France after crossing the Channel in a small boat.

Speaking at a press conference at Chequers on Thursday, Trump suggested military force was a better deterrent than the Labour government's approach of diplomatic negotiations agreeing returns and toughening up court guidance.

Speaking alongside Sir Keir Starmer at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, Trump suggested such force was needed as illegal migration ""destroys countries from within"".

He said: ""You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use.""

Asked about the US president's claims, Kyle told BBC Breakfast: ""Well, what he suggested was the military are used, but we have the UK Border Force that is now established and has been reinforced and bolstered and have new powers under this government.

""The navy actually does have a working relationship with the UK Border Force, and the navy can be called upon if needed, so we do have the functional relationship that we need between our military and keeping our borders safe and secure.

""But what we really need at the moment is our military focused on all of those really key issues around the world, directly relating to our national defence.""

Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge dismissed Trump's suggestion that military could be used to cut illegal migration, saying it would be ""extremely complicated"".

He told BBC Look East that ""we have a border force…we need a deterrent"" and cited the Conservative government's Rwanda plan, which he said would have been ""extremely effective"".

The Supreme Court ruled that the African country could not be considered to be safe at all, because of human rights abuses, and the plan was scrapped almost immediately after Labour took office last year.

'Different geography'

Trump has issued a series of executive orders implementing a broad ban on asylum for migrants entering at the southern US border and has sent in troops to assist border security efforts.

The arrests of migrants by the US Border Patrol have been decreasing since Trump took office.

The Conservatives and Reform UK are calling for tougher action on migration, with Reform saying it would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum.

Neither party has proposed using military force, although Nigel Farage has said a Reform government would tow small boats back to France ""as an absolute last resort"".

The Ministry of Defence recently said that military assets had been bought ""for defence tasks"" and were ""not optimised"" to be used in tackling illegal migration.

General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, cautioned that the involvement of the British military would be limited by the ""very different geography"" involved in migration flows.

Speaking to The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4, he added: ""I don't think France is going to be very enthusiastic about British troops on French beaches, unless they were very carefully co-ordinated.""

He added that the military was unlikely to ""add very much"" to existing efforts to spot boats using commercial drones.

""When migrants arrive in the UK, the Home Office has a system for gathering them up and the military would add manpower to that but they're not going to make the problem any different.""

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to fight what she called ""vexatious, last-minute claims"" and Kyle described her as ""straining at the bit"" to make sure the pilot one-in-one-out scheme for migrant returns was a success.

""We're making sure we get as many people as don't have the right to be here returned as swiftly as possible,"" he said, adding there are ""a lot of cases"" going through court.

Asked whether there was any target figure for the number of returns, Kyle said: ""Our target is to make sure that everybody who comes to our shore and doesn't have the right to stay is removed from the country, that is our target.

""We want to get a full grip on the system, we want to make sure people see a functioning system that's delivering so rapidly, efficiently and swiftly that people don't come here in the first place, that's the deterrent that we need.""

About 100 men who arrived in the UK by small boat are currently in immigration removal centres near Heathrow and may be removed to France under the scheme.

The Home Office said more deportation flights are planned into next week and a government appeal has been launched, aimed at limiting the time migrants have to provide evidence to challenge their removal.

More than 5,500 migrants have reached the UK since the scheme came into effect at the start of August but the government is hoping continuing removal flights will act as a deterrent.

President Donald Trump criticized Jimmy Kimmel and dismissed questions over whether his suspension amounted to an attack on free speech during a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel came after FCC Chariman Brendan Carr, threatened to take action against Disney if they did not address Kimmel’s comments about the reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder.

President Donald Trump was greeted by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, at their country residence, Chequers, as the two leaders meet to discuss a range of geopolitical issues.

Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the killing of Charlie Kirk, appeared virtually for his first court hearing since he was formally charged with aggravated murder, among other charges. Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty in the case.

A New York judge on Tuesday dismissed two terror-related murder charges against Luigi Mangione, finding they are “legally insufficient,” according to the judge’s ruling.

Dashing actor, Oscar-winning director, and environmentalist Robert Redford has died at 89, according to his publicist. Known for his starring roles in “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President’s Men,” Redford also directed award-winning films such as “Ordinary People” and “A River Runs Through It.” Redford was also a dedicated environmentalist and led efforts to preserve the natural landscape of the American West.

Several homes were damaged or destroyed in San Juan County, Utah, on Saturday. The state rarely sees destructive tornadoes, with only three confirmed in that county since 1950, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.

The US military killed three people in another deadly strike on a vessel in international waters near South America.

A Fox News crew caught the moment a teen stomped on a memorial to Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Police identified the man as Ryder Corral. The 19-year-old was taken into custody and police say he has been booked into the Maricopa County Jail on one count of criminal damage and another count for disorderly conduct.

Gov. Spencer Cox (R-UT) told CNN’s Dana Bash that the nation faces a “dark chapter” following Charlie Kirk’s assassination, calling the violence a “direct assault” and urging Americans to look inward to repair divisions.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/114063-icearrest-ilfamilyvertical.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-19 14:57:29.878363

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can use this funding to further escalate the administration’s unprecedented and indiscriminate deportation agenda that separates families, detains students and children, and terrorizes communities. A new report from the Center for American Progress details how by supercharging the Trump administration’s deportation agenda, the OBBBA threatens local communities and economies across the United States.

ICE is already operating with impunity in response to the Trump administration’s demand to arrest 3,000 immigrants per day. The deployment of the National Guard to support federal immigration officials in Los Angeles and the nation’s capital has spread fear in local immigrant communities. And with no end in sight to the administration’s cruel and unwise policies, the full extent of the economic and human impact on families and communities will only multiply as the OBBBA funds are expended. In fact, ICE’s annual budget will nearly triple—from approximately $9.9 billion to $28 billion. At the same time, the administration has essentially dismantled the congressionally created watchdog agencies that provided oversight of DHS. The report demonstrates the need for Congress to hold the Trump administration accountable for its reckless and indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions.

Specifically, the report outlines several frightening and wide-ranging uses of the OBBBA funds, which provide $45 billion to expand ICE’s detention capacity to 100,000 beds and nearly $30 billion to dramatically increase ICE’s personnel and enforcement operations. These funds will:

Turbocharge the rampant and reckless targeting of immigrants for arbitrary arrests and detentions by ICE agents who are often masked and unidentifiable.

Dramatically increase the detention of people in inhumane conditions at private facilities with insufficient oversight.

Likely lead to a massive financial windfall for private prison companies, since nearly 90 percent of immigrants in ICE custody are held in private facilities.

The report also lays out the widespread harm of the Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement tactics on people, communities, and the economy:

Undocumented immigrants make up an estimated 45 percent of the agricultural workforce, and an estimated 1.6 million undocumented immigrants work in construction. The Trump administration’s deportation efforts will drain workers from these critical fields, harming housing and infrastructure projects while also driving up food costs.

Immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion to state and local taxes in 2022, and small businesses across the country report that the administration’s reckless enforcement tactics have led to drops in sales as immigrant families stay home for fear of detention.

The OBBBA’s blank check to fund the administration’s mass deportation agenda will escalate indiscriminate immigration raids, ensnaring long-time immigrants and tearing families apart.

Giving the Trump administration a slush fund for ICE to operate above the law and arrest anyone—even those who have contributed to our country for years and pose no threat—is not the answer to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system. A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but, as the report underscores, an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law; reflect our values; and strengthen the American economy and local communities.

What we know:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Tuesday's five arrests were part of Operation Midway Blitz, a targeted initiative aimed at undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem joined the effort, which included serving a felony arrest warrant.

Among those arrested, according to DHS:

Carlos Gonzalez-Leon, of Mexico, convicted of assault of a family member causing bodily harm. He has previously been deported.

Jose Morales-Rodriguez, of Mexico, convicted of aggravated DUI with a child passenger under 16 and driving with a revoked or suspended license.

Juan Eduardo Solarzano-Morales, of Mexico, arrested on domestic violence, harassment, obstruction, and felony stalking charges. He was served a protection order earlier this year.

Victor Manuel Rodriguez-Pantoja, of Mexico, accused of entering the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and location.

Ruben Antonio Gonzalez-Querales, of Venezuela, who DHS said was released into the country under the Biden administration.

What they're saying:

Secretary Noem praised the operation, saying, ""President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will… Our work is only beginning.""

The backstory:

Operation Midway Blitz is one of two federal immigration efforts underway in the Chicago area. DHS is also leading Operation At Large.

Last week, federal authorities announced at least 13 arrests in Chicago linked to Operation Midway Blitz, describing those taken into custody as the ""worst of the worst.""

DHS has been ramping up its mass deportation efforts since President Donald Trump took office in January, including in large cities such as Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

In recent weeks, Trump has expressed interest in cracking down on crime in Chicago after a multi-agency surge in D.C. led to a reported decrease in crime and hundreds of immigration-related arrests.

The other side:

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and other state leaders have criticized the immigration enforcement operations, saying they create fear in immigrant communities and undermine trust in law enforcement.

""People are frightened about the potential of military troops coming to our neighborhoods. People are fearful of masked men in unmarked vans who could grab them on a street corner because of how they look or how they sound,"" Pritzker said.

""I’d rather see a dozen ICE agents here at the office standing off against peaceful protestors than out on the streets terrorizing my neighbors,"" social worker Quinn Pennington said.","Federal agents shot pellet guns and deployed tear gas on a crowd of protesters Friday morning gathering outside the Broadview ICE processing center.

Protesters returned to the facility for a day of demonstrations, vowing to keep pressure on federal immigration officials after previous tense confrontations.

What we know:

Crowds gathered outside the facility at 1930 Beach St. from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. They plan to return at 7 p.m., with organizers expecting a larger turnout after work hours.

The site has long been a focal point for activists opposing ICE operations in the Chicago area.

Dozens of protesters gathered outside the facility for the third straight Friday, trying to block vehicles from entering or exiting.

Kat Abughazaleh, a candidate for Congress in the 9th district, was captured on video being thrown to the ground by federal agents. She said she was bruised but not hurt.

Two other protesters were detained inside the facility during the confrontation for trying to stop transport vans from moving detainees captured by ICE.

Aerials from Sky Fox showed the view behind the gate, where detainees were cuffed and on their knees, waiting to be taken to holding facilities.

As agents prepared to move more vehicles, agents on the roof fired pellets near the crowd gathered in front of the gate. They released tear gas cannisters, the smoke grew and the chemicals spread.

Several protesters were seen gagging, coughing and vomiting. They shared water and poured it over their faces.

Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) was right up front when it happened.

""We were kind of on the front line of it as a vehicle was coming, and so we were looking to block the vehicle. It still kept driving, almost ran over someone and at that point, we started seeing the pellets. So it was tear gas, it was pepper spray, a little mix of both. So you could feel it even under the mask and start coughing and spitting out to get everything,"" Vasquez said.

Vasquez was wearing a mask at the time.

""Even through the mask, you can feel it, like right now you can still feel a little burning in the eyes, the back of the neck, just because of the chemicals themselves. I was able to walk, cler my head a little bit and grab water, one to take care of myself but then make sure other people were okay,"" Vasquez said.

Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton was one of several local officials present at the protest. She said the crowd would not disperse while they are exercising their First Amendment rights.

""They want us to be afraid. They want us to step back and kind of go into our little corners and not do anything so that this president can make a military presence on American soil normalized. We're not going to let that happen,"" Stratton said.

What they're saying:

A week ago, protesters said they were met by more than a dozen ICE agents wearing military clothing and carrying guns, and that agents twice fired ""chemical weapons"" into the crowd.

""ICE doesn’t make me or my community safer,"" demonstrator Britt Hodgdon said in a statement. ""If exercising my right to free speech gets me tear gassed, then I’m not safe. If my neighbors go missing into a deportation system where their families can’t find out where they’ve been taken, then my neighborhood is not safe.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson recently announced federal officials plan to use the facility as the ""primary processing location"" for people detained in the Chicago area by ICE this fall.

Last week, protesters blocked a vehicle they believed was being driven by an ICE agent as it attempted to enter the facility. Activists said they remain determined to continue their demonstrations.

""I’d rather see a dozen ICE agents here at the office standing off against peaceful protestors than out on the streets terrorizing my neighbors,"" social worker Quinn Pennington said. ""If coming out means I can keep my community even a little bit safer, I’m going to keep showing up.""

The recruitment push has appeared in Chicago with one commercial that appeared on ESPN asking law enforcement officers to apply for ICE, urging recruits to “fulfill your mission” to “protect America.”

“Attention Chicago law enforcement,” the ad says, with a backdrop of the city’s skyline. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down.”

The commercial, like other recent ICE advertisements on TV, radio and social media, lauds a signing bonus of up to $50,000, student loan repayment of up to $60,000 and loan forgiveness options, as well as other benefits.

Chicago has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign, and it has accelerated with this month’s launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

A spokesperson for Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office said in a statement that the ads targeting Chicago officers set back the work he and Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling have done to increase the police department’s retention rate, which has been notably poor in the last decade.

“The president’s desire to poach officers from CPD’s ranks has the potential to decrease the number of police officers serving on the streets of Chicago and would only undermine our public safety efforts, which have led to historic decreases in violent crime,” Johnson’s spokesperson said.

ICE’s marketing campaign aims to help bring in 14,050 new hires and generate more than 42 million views among its target audience, which includes former military and law enforcement personnel, legal professionals, Gen Z and early career professionals, according to procurement documents filed by ICE last month.

“ICE is facing a critical and time-sensitive need to significantly increase its workforce to meet expanding operational demands,” the documents state. It states the agency is looking to hire enforcement officers, Homeland Security investigations agents, lawyers and support staff.

The agency already has around 21,000 employees. In July, funding for the DHS and ICE increased drastically, with $170 billion allocated to immigration and border enforcement, and ICE’s budget tripled to about $30 billion.

DHS officials said Tuesday that the agency has received more than 150,000 applications for ICE from across the country, and it has extended more than 18,000 job offers, though the recruitment timeline is unclear.

The procurement documents also said ICE was looking to contract with a women-owned small business for its ad campaigns.

Virginia-based Marcom Group, which describes itself as a woman-owned small business, has a $47.5 million contract with DHS through Sept. 25 for “marketing and advertising recruitment services.”

Marcom Group couldn’t be reached for comment. An ICE official didn’t expand on details of the agency’s marketing campaign.

John Paul Rollert, University of Chicago’s professor of behavioral science, likened ICE’s advertising blitz to the U.S. Army’s “We Want You” campaign featuring Uncle Sam during World War I and World War II. He said it’s a similar call to join the federal government to take action and address an “urgent problem.”

“When you’ve decided that the scope of the need is as big as the Trump administration believes it to be, you have a personnel issue. You need to hire as many people as you possibly can and cast as wide a net as you can and get people as quickly as you can,” Rollert said. “If Chicago is one of those parts of the country that they have determined they need to catch a lot of people, then you’re going to have to hire a lot of people who are already there to do it.”

ICE said in its procurement documents that it wants to advertise on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and streaming platforms like Hulu and HBO Max.

In Chicago, commercials have aired on ABC, ESPN, CBS, Fox, Telemundo, Univision and WGN. Spokespersons for those companies either did not return a message seeking comment or declined to comment.

“Clearly they [media companies] neither have a principled objection against what ICE is doing nor do they fear reprisal for running those ads,” Rollert said.

Other commercials call on people to “join the mission” to “catch the worst of the worst.”

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has appeared in commercials as part of a multimillion-dollar ad campaign “warning illegal aliens to leave our country now or face deportation with the inability to return to the United States.”

She and Trump have also appeared in social media ads calling on people to “Defend the Homeland.”

Rollert said ICE’s advertising bombardment doesn’t come as a surprise because of Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and because a niche audience is most likely to apply.

“These are people who will be entrusted with the use of violence, lawful violence, to accomplish government goals,” he said. “It’s not just that you need 14,000 people. You need 14,000 — ideally —very specific people.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba36ca2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3705x2115+23+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2F11%2Ff5f7e45c4f06b7fcdfd4e9d0728c%2Fimg-1572.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:58:16.572021

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the First Circuit Court of Appealsheld that the administration’s early mass termination of CHNV parole was likely lawful. In its opinion, the court interpreted that the language of the parole statute and its legislative history do not require parole to be terminated on an individualized basis. The court did not think Secretary Noem needed to further consider the “urgent humanitarian reasons” motivating the CHNV program – and their continued relevance for CHNV beneficiaries. However, the court did recognize:

“the risks of irreparable harm [that mass termination has wrought]… that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month – a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries… or staying after the loss of their legal status, which means the risk of removal proceedings and detention, the loss of any work authorization, and potential effects on their eligibility for other forms of immigration relief in the future.”

The September 12 decision means termination of parole and work authorization remains in effect for CHNV beneficiaries while litigation over the lawfulness of the CHNV parole termination continues at the district court. The September 12 decision does not affect the district court’s May 28, 2025, order, which requires the government to process the immigration benefits applications – including for asylum and green cards – for humanitarian parole beneficiaries.

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order to protect people paroled into the United States from expedited removal. This ruling leaves in place the district court’s order, issued on August 1, which found that it was unlawful to place those who entered on humanitarian parole into expedited removal. This means that any person who entered on parole and is detained should insist that ICE cannot place them in expedited removal per the lower court’s decision. Please contact Hilary Li at JAC, if you hear of cases of ICE nonetheless pursuing expedited removal.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

Dismissals of cases and arrests by ICE at immigration courts have dropped off significantly (and these practices are being challenged in federal court in New York.) But, on September 8, the Supreme Court ruled that immigration agents can stop, question, and demand papers from anyone they guess to be here illegally based on how they look, what language they speak, what work they do, or where they happen to be. This sanctions the ongoing violent, racialized immigration enforcement by masked agents in Massachusetts, Los Angeles, Washington DC, and Chicago that has led to arrests of, among others, people who arrived on parole and are seeking asylum and who are legal permanent residents and U.S. citizens. Communities have mobilized to protect their neighbors, including through alerts about the presence of immigration enforcement and through protests – in Washington DC, in upstate New York, and near the Midway Airport outside Chicago – to stop arrests. Congregations and communities are coming together to support families impacted by immigration arrests and organizing protests at ICE detention facilities.

The administration’s effort to turn USCIS into an agency that hinders application processing and handles immigration enforcement is happening on many fronts, including:

USCIS hampered the ability of Venezuelans to take advantage of a court order reinstating their TPS by making it impossible to re-register electronically through the USCIS website – a problem that was only fixed by bringing additional litigation.

A regulation giving USCIS officers not only the power to issue orders of expedited removal but to carry weapons and make arrests – including potentially arresting sponsors or supporters accompanying relatives to interviews and appointments – will go into effect on October 6.

Forthcoming proposed regulations will limit eligibility for work authorization. This will come on top of the already lengthening adjudication times for work authorization applications, partly caused by USCIS’s eliminating efficiencies and adding dilatory and unnecessary vetting to their procedures.

These changes at USCIS have had, and will have, important impacts on people who entered on parole. Though USCIS has been ordered to resume processing applications by parolees per the Doe v. Noem lawsuit, attorneys in that case have complained of lack of “meaningful action” on diversity visa applications. USCIS has told E-verify employers to check status reports that list revoked work permits, though some people who entered on humanitarian parole may be eligible to work based on other applications.

People who have come in on parole should be aware of resources such as the Legal Pathways Learning Tool and others that may help them find alternative authority to work. A legal challenge – Sileiri Doe v. Noem – to the mass termination of parole and revocation of work permits for people who arrived through CBP One appointments is ongoing.

Latest from Congress

On September 18, the Congresswoman Jayapal of the House Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement (House Judiciary Committee) hosted a shadow hearing titled “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Assault Destroys U.S. Families and Communities.” Members highlighted how they have had to navigate information blackouts, instances when they have not been able to locate constituents across ICE detention facilities, the shortage of publicly available data, and limited responses from the administration.

The hearing featured witnesses who testified about the traumatic arrest, detention, and deportation of loved ones and underscored the damage wrought on American communities and the economy by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Witnesses also proposed solutions including the creation of legal pathways to citizenship, greater transparency to challenge indiscriminate enforcement practices, and amplifying constituents’ stories to help shape public understanding of the issue.

FY26 Appropriations Update: The House GOP leadership released bill text for a continuing resolution to keep the government open through November 21. Separately, Democrats released bill text for a proposal of their own to keep the government open through October 31. At the time of writing, Speaker Johnson is eyeing a vote on the GOP CR by September 19, and if passed, would then move to the Senate where Democrats have already come out in strong opposition to a stopgap bill. Relatedly, while the House had already released its Homeland Security funding bill and approved out of committee on June 24, the Senate is yet to release its version.

Although, I believe she's now on the Ninth Circuit.

Professor Wang earned his BA in economics and master's in public policy from the University of Virginia, where he was a Jefferson Scholar. He earned his JD from Yale Law School, where he was a Truman Scholar. Before law school, Professor Wang worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. What a bio. [LAUGHS] Welcome to the show, Professor Wang.

XIAO WANG: Hey, thanks so much for inviting me to be here. I'm really looking forward to it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I am, too. I am, too. So as a little icebreaker, I love asking people who were here for a time as students in Charlottesville and then went away and then came back-- because that's what I did-- but did you have any favorite spots as a student and either the same spots now as a professor or different?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. There are some spots that have stayed constant favorites. So when I was a student here, the Bodo's on the corner actually opened--

NATALIE BLAZER: Mm!

XIAO WANG: --after a long awaited construction timeline. And so--

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow. Opened for the first time?

XIAO WANG: The Bodo's on the-- I think it opened in 2007 when I was an undergrad.

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow. So that's when I was in law school. I don't even think I realized that it was new at that point. That's cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, so that. The herb cream cheese and everything bagel has always been a steadfast constant for me. I would say one thing that's changed is, when I was a student here, for maybe a special once-a-year, maybe once-every-two-year treat, I would go to TenSushi or, you know. And luckily the Law School pays me well enough that I can go there a little bit more regularly-- not that much more regularly, but a little bit more. And they're obviously standouts in the Charlottesville dining.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure. So speaking of your time here at UVA, even though you didn't go here for law school, you are a Double Hoo--

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: --because you got your undergrad and your masters. So how did you decide to come to UVA?

XIAO WANG: It was sort of a little bit on a lark. One of my friends from high school, his brother had come to UVA. And I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. And one of my friends from high school, his brother, had gone to UVA. And I'd been like, oh-- his brother was this three-sports star and head of the class. And when you're growing up in Ohio, not everyone even goes out of state.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure.

XIAO WANG: So I asked him, I was like, well, why'd you decide to go out of state? And why did you decide to choose UVA and all that? And he said, well, it turns out I got this really great scholarship, the Jefferson Scholarship. And he told me all about it. And it sounded like this amazing package. It truly is an amazing package.

And I remember thinking, well, we were going to go on an East Coast college visit swing with my parents. And we decided to stop in Charlottesville. We literally took the scenic route and stopped by and saw the mountains and everything. And I sort of loved it.

And I remember going to the admissions committee open house. And I asked them about the Jefferson Scholarship because I was like, wow, this is a sweet deal, such a great deal. It's such a beautiful campus. How could you say no? And they were like, well, yeah, no one gets that.

[LAUGHTER]

So just try to apply and get in, and you'll have a great time here. So I sent in my application and applied to a couple other schools, as well. And I think each round of the Jefferson Scholarship-- it's this multi-round process. Each round, I don't know how it happened, but I would just make it to the next round and make it to the next round. And I ended up getting it.

I was incredibly fortunate, very privileged, very blessed to get it. And I mean, that makes the decision really easy, I think, because UVA is such an amazing school. The people here are just incredibly nice and kind and wonderful. The other students, the faculty at the undergrad are just fantastic. And it just made it a really easy decision to come here, and I've never regretted it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I love that story. ""Nobody gets that."" It just goes to show you you have to try. Don't let people get you down.

XIAO WANG: Exactly, exactly. So I'm very happy to report-- I don't even remember who the person from the admissions office was, but--

[LAUGHTER]

--yeah, definitely my parents and I laugh about that sometimes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love it. So I think I read somewhere that it was during your time here in undergrad that you were maybe taking some law-related courses, I think even maybe from one of our current law school faculty.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: So tell me how that worked. And was that when your interest in maybe going to law school sparked?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. I think my interest-- my mom says my interest started when I was conscripted into doing mock trial as a sixth grader. And she was like, you become so passionate about this. And I think my parents were like-- my parents are both in the medical field. And they're like, he's never this passionate about Petri dishes.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I was like, yeah, I mean, fair, fair. But more seriously, at UVA, yeah, I got to know Micah Schwartzman quite a bit. And he had been a mentor for me when I was an undergrad. He had helped me navigate the Jefferson Scholarship process. He helped me navigate the Truman Scholarship process and some other postgraduate scholarships.

And I got to know him, and I thought, wow, what a fascinating career that he's had at that point. I was sort of a super dork in the time, and I read a little bit-- or tried to read a little bit-- of his Law Review work on academic scholarship. I was so fascinated.

So my last year in undergrad, I said, well-- [CHUCKLES] --I hope I can go to law school someday and maybe someday go to UVA. But in the meantime, do you mind if I just sit in on your constitutional law seminar? And I thought it was just amazing to see him and to also see the students really wrestle with these tough questions that the Supreme Court was wrestling with. And it just brought a level of rigor and a level of discussion that I didn't see in some of my other classes.

And so I think that was the time where I thought, well, yeah, I really do want to go to law school at some point. But I don't know if this is something that I should be telling on a podcast. So on a lark, I decided to take the LSAT without studying my senior year, and I did not do very well on it. [CHUCKLES] So I had to take a few years off to work for a few years and concentrate a little bit on studying for the LSAT and doing a lot better on it. And that opened a lot of doors.

NATALIE BLAZER: I'm glad you shared that, though, because I always say the LSAT is not a diagnostic, right? Like, you need to study for it.

XIAO WANG: For sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: Although, I have had guests on here who are like, I just took it, and then, yeah, great. I was like--

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I don't believe that.

[LAUGHTER]

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. So you got your master's in public policy here.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: And then, like you said, you worked for-- was it a couple years, McKinsey?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I worked for a couple years.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK. And then, ultimately you went to Yale Law School.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: How was that experience?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I think Yale is really quite a different place than UVA in some ways. I mean, it took me a while to find my footing there. There were a couple other folks also that had gone to UVA undergrad that were there, and that was really nice to have that community.

In some ways, navigating Yale as just a different place at first. But I ended up finding a really good group of friends, a really good group of professors. I tried to spend none of the winters in New Haven, or the springs in New Haven.

[LAUGHTER]

And I really look back fondly, ultimately, on my law school experience. I think I have some lifelong friends and lifelong mentorships there.

NATALIE BLAZER: I think I saw you were in the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Yale Law School. So was that kind of-- I'm just curious. Were you sort of-- that's where your interests were going, this appellate-level litigation and the real clinical work?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I had a-- actually, this is one of the mentors I got to meet, was my first year. I got to take a class with Linda Greenhouse, who was then the New York Times' Supreme Court reporter.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's so cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I know she does some short courses here every few years. But it was just interesting to hear her talk about being at the Supreme Court, listening to argument, distilling it, and then teaching it to students, and all in the course of a week and a half.

And I really enjoyed the seminar. And she encouraged me to apply for the Supreme Court Clinic. And I ended up getting in. I think there's an application process. I can't really remember. And ended up getting in. And yeah, it took this idea of, hey, here's the cases you read, and now you're going to work on one that might end up setting law. So yeah, I thought that was really fun and interesting and unique to do in law school, also intimidating at first.

NATALIE BLAZER: I cannot even imagine. When you were in law school-- I'm curious-- because Yale's known for-- if you want to get into academia, I think a lot of people think about Yale and Harvard.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: So were you surrounded by people who wanted to be law professors? Is that what you wanted to do? Or what was that like?

XIAO WANG: Oh, yeah. I mean, I think this podcast is trotting out all my embarrassments of my bombing the LSAT and-- in law school, actually, it's weird. There are a ton of people that want-- especially at Yale-- they want to be law professors one day. And I think I had entertained that. My dad is a professor of medicine. And I've always been interested a little bit in research. [CHUCKLES]

But it's sort of embarrassing. I think UVA has this, too. The Virginia Law Review has a similar process. But at Yale, you can write a student note, which is like this-- essentially, this short law review piece for-- a student writes it, a form of student scholarship. And you're encouraged to write your student notes and submit it and have them review it. And the best notes or whatever get chosen and published in the Yale Law Journal or the Virginia Law Review or whatever law school you're going to.

And-- [LAUGHS] --I mean, this is so embarrassing. When you send in a student note at Yale, they'll always send you back-- try to give you some feedback and try to send you back a memo. And usually the memo has three boxes that they can put your student note in. One is like, hey, this is amazing, and we're going to publish it. And we just need you to make a couple small changes and work with us to do that.

And the second box is, there's some idea here, but you really need to make all these changes and revise and maybe come resubmit. And then the third box is like, no, just don't come back. Please don't come back.

[LAUGHTER]

And I would say that-- they tell you up front. They're like, maybe 5% of pieces get in that first box that are accepted. And then 90% or 92% are in that second box of like, we think there's something here. And try to keep on improving and refining. They're like, very rare-- they tell you this at the start. They're like, very rarely will we ever put you in box 3, which is like, please don't come back, like do not pass Go again.

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: And I remember I submitted two notes for consideration. And both of them got box 3.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my God!

XIAO WANG: [LAUGHS] And it was just like, I remember seeing that and being like, well, [CLICKS LIPS] probably just too dumb to be a law professor. Probably should give up this idea, this thing, and just be a big law lawyer or something.

So it did not work out as well when I was in law school. I'm happy to say it's worked out a little bit better since. But yeah, there were definitely a lot of people that were interested in it. And I just honestly didn't know if I was cut out for it.

NATALIE BLAZER: I love that story. It's very real. And I think it helps people who-- first of all, when I welcomed our 1Ls on Friday, I said, while you are here in law school, try out for things, go for things. You will fail sometimes, but you have to try. And that story is just such a great example of like, what if you had just decided, I guess I'm not cut out for it. I mean, you can't take those things to heart. You have to keep trying. So I love that story.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that was helpful, I had a professor in law school, and I had gone up to her. She was a real mentor to me. I was her RA. I was her TA. Got this amazing, fantastic record, like a Rhodes scholar, Yale Law School, and everything, and this incredible CV. And I talked to her about some of these struggles, and I was pretty candid about it.

And she said something that was really helpful for me to think about. And she was like, the CV that you see on the website or the resume you see for your professors or for these big law partners or whatever, those are the greatest hits of their lives. And they never talk about any of their greatest misses. And sometimes you learn the most from your greatest misses. And I think that helped a lot because I think that all of us have things that we wish it panned out differently, but we learn a lot from when they don't-- when they don't work out.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love that advice. I'm going to remember that. It's like what people say about social media. You see people's highlight reel--

XIAO WANG: Exactly.

NATALIE BLAZER: --not their random day of just doing nothing. So I love that. So you ultimately did get a couple of clerkships.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: How did that work? Did you do them back to back?

XIAO WANG: I did.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK. Tell us a little bit about your clerkship experience. What was your favorite part? Was it challenging?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think my favorite part is that you get a front-row view of how arguments get made and what works and what doesn't work. And usually you wouldn't get that. And usually you wouldn't be able to peer inside the head of a judge.

I mean, there's so many times now when I'm in court and arguing that I'm like, oh, I wish I could understand what the judge is thinking. But as a clerk, you actually do get to see that. And that's a skill that, as a litigator, I just always go back to, of saying, well, when I was a law clerk, my judge would think about these couple things. How do I think about that and reverse engineer that when it comes to working with my clients?

NATALIE BLAZER: That's so cool. And then, from there, you went to your law practice, right, as an appellate litigator.

XIAO WANG: I worked at Williams & Connolly first for several years. And you're sort of thrown in. And it's a firm that does a lot of different work-- trial work, appellate work. And I wasn't-- you're not really assigned to a group. But it's a little bit based on, hey, if you show an interest in this stuff, if we lose a trial, there's usually going to be going to be an appeal. So if you want to be on the appellate team, have at it, and stuff. So it was a lot of trying to seek out those opportunities and develop some of my skills at the law firm.

NATALIE BLAZER: When I was at my law firm, I don't know if you're just being humble or what, but I remember our appellate group, that was the all stars. It was like, when you guys mess up at the trial level, they're going to take it from here. I remember a co-associate who I was very close with. We did a lot of pro bono cases together. He was in our appellate group. And I was in a trial group.

And I just remember he was always writing briefs. He was always-- our work was very different, is my point. So for listeners who may not know, can you explain just what an appellate-- if someone's in an appellate group versus a trial group, what's the day-to-day difference?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think the day-to-day difference is, in trial, you're trying to find facts, shape narratives, and interview witnesses, figure out what your experts have to say, and build this thing called a record, build a factual record. And that takes a ton of work. And especially if you're working with a big company, they have a ton of documents you have to sift through. And sometimes that can be a little bit monotonous.

[LAUGHTER]

And I think there's a different form of-- I suppose-- monotony at the appellate level because, at the appellate level, you're not supposed to build the record anymore. The record's set. You're not supposed to find new facts. But in some ways, it's monotonous in the sense that you're trying to craft these legal arguments.

And for instance, for one case that the clinic has worked on, one of our legal arguments depended a lot on what 17th-century British common law had to say. And so I don't know if it's more interesting, less interesting, more monotonous, or less, but it takes a certain type of grit and perseverance to just sift through what old bailiwick story Fishbourne had to say in the Court of Common Pleas and figure out how that fits into your legal theory.

So yeah, I think that's the difference between trial and appellate practice. I think, in some ways, there's certainly commonalities. You want to understand how the law applies to the facts. But there are differences in the day to day, for sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: It's good for listeners to know there's going to be some level of monotony in any area of your law practice, but also a lot of really exciting, interesting things. So you did go from there, I believe, to Northwestern Law.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: How did that-- were you like, OK, I've really liked my time practicing, but I'm really ready to get into academia? How did that decision play out for you?

XIAO WANG: This is one thing where COVID actually was a little bit of a silver lining. I know it feels so long ago. But one of the great things about COVID is it gave a lot of folks, especially in law practice, a breather if you were going at a hundred miles an hour. You couldn't do in-person depositions. You couldn't do certain meetings anymore.

And so the pace slowed down a lot at my law firm. And it was one where I had been thinking about a few different ideas, scholarship ideas. I mean, I sort of, I think, recovered and licked my wounds from law school. And I thought, well, why don't I try my hand again? I'll write some short pieces, and I'll send them out to these law reviews and especially their online supplements.

Maybe this is also embarrassing, but I sent it to a dozen online supplements, this first piece. And it was like, one by one, they'd be like, no, no, no. And I was like, well, this is just replaying my trauma.

[LAUGHTER]

And then I think, one day, California Law Review, so the law review for Berkeley Law School, which is a very well regarded law review, reached out and were like, we love this piece, and we'd love to publish it. And I think it would be really, really fitting. And we'll dedicate the resources to make it better. And we're sure you have other offers. Listener, I did not. [LAUGHS] And it was like, we're sure you have other offers, so take your time.

And it must have been one of those where immediately I responded, probably as they were getting their cup of coffee in California. And I was like, I accept. And so I think that was-- and then I think once you write one piece and you go through the editorial process, you figure out a little bit how your own style works and how that style works with what other law reviews are looking for.

So my next piece got published by Michigan. And once, I think, you start publishing a little bit more, I started looking a little bit more into teaching and teaching jobs. And this opportunity at Northwestern came up.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's so fascinating to me because I did read just the title of some of the law review articles that you've had published. And I'm like, these all, to me, sound super interesting, the topics. I was actually curious if you're writing anything now.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: I imagine you have to keep going.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, sort of. I mean, I think I've been really fortunate that I have a number of incredibly bright students that work as my RAs. And there will be a figment of an idea that I have. And I ask them to look at something, and they'll come up with this incredibly detailed perspective. And that really informs me.

So yeah, I have a few things that I'm working on right now. They're in different stages of development. They're in the areas that I have traditionally studied, so law and religion, judicial organization. And we'll see where they get placed.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that's awesome. So while you were at Northwestern, just tell me quickly-- because I really want to dive into the UVA experience-- I read that you created some sort of-- and I mentioned in your bio-- a network. Basically, my understanding of it is like a database for clinics to use. So can you explain that?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. And a lot of the idea, the credit for the idea, goes to Scott Ballinger, who's also on our faculty, and another very close friend of mine who's at NYU, Daniel Harawa. And basically, both of them said, if you're working in an appellate clinic, if you're directing an appellate clinic, you end up seeing similar issues. And you see that other clinics have similar viewpoints or issues because a lot of clinics work on cases like habeas cases, criminal defense cases, plaintiff's side civil cases.

And you'll see a lot of overlap in terms of the types of issues, the type of cases, the type of plaintiffs that get represented by appellate clinics. And so Daniel and Scott both independently told me like, hey, it'd be great if we had a listserv and a briefs database because, every fall, I feel like we reinvent the wheel with our students about, how do you write a brief that presents a habeas question? Or how do you write a brief that presents a prison conditions and confinement question?

And I guess this is where my value comes in. I said, well, we can do all that. If people start sending me the briefs, I have a very, very, very rudimentary understanding of how to code and put things in a database form that's accessible. And so I said, maybe we can do that. And I can put that together. And that can actually be a database that people can search and use and students can look at so they can know that they're not starting from scratch.

And so we started with a couple schools. I think now we're up to two dozen. And we've got 300 or 400 briefs, maybe more than that. And I think it's been-- people have told me it's been very helpful because, instead of, again, starting from scratch in the fall, they'll already have this template ready to go. And I think, when you're an appellate litigator, if you have the template ready to go, that just gives you more time to devote to some of the more difficult, challenging issues.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure, yeah. So are you using that still in your clinic today?

XIAO WANG: Oh, yeah. For sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, awesome.

XIAO WANG: For sure. [LAUGHS] I also don't want to start from scratch--

[LAUGHTER]

--when we write briefs. So definitely I'll encourage my students to look and see if other clinics have briefed similar issues. And if they don't find it, I'll try to find it, too, just because it's such a time saver.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, what is the En Banc Institute? Maybe first explain what ""en banc"" means, if people don't know.

XIAO WANG: Totally, totally. So across the country, there are, I think, 12 to 13-- depends on how you count one of the circuits-- but there's 12 to 13 federal courts of appeals. And they hear appeals from these trial courts, which is where cases start. And they're the intermediate layer between the trial court and the Supreme Court.

And usually, when you bring an appeal in those courts, your appeal is heard by this panel of three judges. And they end up voting. And because there's three judges, they always come up with a decision. It's like two to one, or three-nothing, or what have you.

And after they come up with the decision, if you're not a big fan of that decision, you can do something called seek en banc review. And what that means is that the court itself, the appeals court itself, might have 15 or 18 judges. And when you seek en banc review, you say, look, I think these three judges that heard my first appeal didn't get it right. I want it to be heard by the big 15-judge court.

Sometimes folks will choose that route. And other times, they'll choose to just go straight to the Supreme Court. Either way, en banc courts end up-- when the court decides to take up a case and hear it en banc, all the judges in that court, it's usually a pretty big deal. And often, it's a preview of what might come up in the Supreme Court going forward because if 15 judges on the appellate court say this is an important enough issue we want to take up, the Supreme Court might be like, well, this is an important issue. We might--

NATALIE BLAZER: Because to get 15 judges to come together, that's-- I mean, yeah. You would think that this is going to be an issue that they're like, OK, we want to talk about this. OK, cool.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, and I think one of the reasons I wanted to do it is because when you get a case that's before the Supreme Court, a lot of people want to help you prepare for that argument. There are institutes and programs and other professors. And when you end up, in fact, arguing for the Supreme Court, usually you've had a couple different practice runs. But it's not like that on the en banc side.

Basically, we're the only people in the country that will reach out and say, do you want to come here for a moot and we'll help you? And people have said, well, [SCOFFS] this will be my first and only practice. And I think that's a really good public service to have and to offer.

And it gives us a sense, from the Supreme Court clinic side, to say, well, hey, maybe we're not working on this case en banc. We're not representing the party. But now we know what the issue is, and we can track this issue. We can help navigate it as it maybe pops up elsewhere and might show up in front of the Supreme Court.

NATALIE BLAZER: So basically, you become aware of a case that's going to be heard en banc. And you reach out to them. And you say, hey, if you, the lawyers, want to come moot, like a full dress rehearsal-- for people who don't really understand what mooting is-- full dress rehearsal in front of your clinic to prepare them because, like you said, typically you only do that before a Supreme Court argument. But as we've said, en banc is nearly as important because of the issues at hand. Do the students get to play the other sides?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, all the students get to attend the moots. And one or two of the students will usually stand in for the other side because I think what's helpful for the advocate is not just to rehearse your own arguments. But usually, how appellate arguments are is like, one side goes up, and then the other side goes up. And then the first side gets to do a rebuttal.

And I've been in moots where I go up, and I don't hear the other side. And then they just tell you, now's your time to do a rebuttal. And that's not super helpful because usually in the rebuttal you want to talk about what was said and what was asked for your opponent and opposing counsel.

So usually, we'll have a student stand in for the other side. And that's always a little fun. I mean, I think we have students who are really interested in certain topics. We've had a mood about voting rights. And sometimes the clinic wouldn't be necessarily involved in that at the Supreme Court stage, but they get to basically represent the other side in a voting rights case in front of their professors, in front of practitioners, in a moot.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK, now I want to get to our time at UVA.

XIAO WANG: OK.

NATALIE BLAZER: So you were at Northwestern for a few years.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: And then you returned to UVA, I believe, in 2023.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Was that just always in your head, that you wanted to come back? Or how did that come together?

XIAO WANG: I think there were two different warring sides on it. I loved my time at UVA. But I remember when I was at UVA just thinking, I'm not going to be a townie one day.

[LAUGHTER]

I'm not going to be a townie, like these people that love UVA and just stick around and stick around. That's not going to be me. But then the other part of me said, well, I loved and have really gotten to know folks like Micah Schwartzman really well. And Scott Ballinger has been a mentor of mine. And it'd be really, really amazing to be able to work with these folks every day.

So I think I saw this opening come up. And a few people reached out to me and encouraged me to apply. I applied, and I didn't know if I would get very far. But I definitely-- I think the side of me that was like, look, I really love this place. And I don't know why I have this irrational worry about being a townie. And now I think I can say it on the other side. I enjoy being a townie. And the summer months when the students aren't here is actually great. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: I know.

XIAO WANG: There's never any traffic. And I can actually go to all the places and restaurants and plays that I want to see. So I would say the side of me that always really loved this place and the people here won out, and I'm really glad it did.

NATALIE BLAZER: Well, and-- I mean, again, similar to my experience-- we went away. We did stuff. We did big-city stuff. We saw the world.

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, to come back, and you know it's a great place. For those who don't know, Micah Schwartzman, who Professor Wang mentioned earlier, he's also a UVA alum, teaches at the Law School, is actually married to Leslie Kendrick, the Dean of the Law School. And Scott Ballinger-- also an alum of the law school and runs our appellate litigation clinic.

So I want to talk about the clinic. I've done an episode before on clinics. It was a while ago now. And it was with a student who was in the Innocence Project Clinic, so we talked a lot about that. I'm really curious because the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic seems to me like it's very prestigious. It's maybe competitive. Tell listeners, how does one get into the clinic to begin with?

XIAO WANG: So the clinic is open to 3Ls, third-year law students. And in their summer between their second and third year, they'll send in an application. The application is not super involved. Right now, I ask for a cover letter, a resume, and a transcript, and a writing sample.

And then I have a co-director of the clinic, Bob Long, who works at a law firm, Covington & Burling. And usually Bob and I will see the applications come in. We'll talk through and say, how do we-- we have an incredibly qualified group of applicants. How do we narrow this down to a dozen students? And that's a really tough process.

I mean, honestly, I wish we could take more students. There are a lot of amazing, amazing applicants every year. But we want to also make sure that each of the students that's in the clinic gets an incredible amount of mentorship and experience and the opportunities that continue to make people interested in the clinic going forward.

NATALIE BLAZER: So how much do grades play a role?

XIAO WANG: I think they definitely play a role. I won't sugarcoat it. And I think the reason that they play a role-- for instance, we have a case right now that we're working on about venue, which is where a lawsuit gets filed. And that has to do with civil procedure, which is one of the core first-year law classes.

And it's not a big deal for me that you get an A or an A-plus or an A-minus in civil procedure. I think it's more to say, look, all the questions that we're trying to answer, they're not necessarily answered in the casebook. I mean, that's why they're going in front of the Supreme Court.

And so why grades matter is I think they're a signal to say, I've read the decision below. I've read some of the cases. Am I going to be committed to take a deeper look, to go that extra step of the way in my research and in my thinking about this in order to come up with an innovative or novel line of thought?

Now, of course that's not the only way you can show that. You can also demonstrate it through work experience and other items in your resume. So certainly grades are not dispositive. I think it's just one way to signal.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right. I mean, hey, I do admissions. I get it.

[LAUGHTER]

It's really tough. Sometimes it is going to be things like that that help you decide when you have so many wonderful people. I know it's difficult. So it's a year-long clinic.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Are there any prerequisites? Do they have to have taken fed courts or something?

XIAO WANG: I don't think there are any prerequisites. [CHUCKLES] I think, unlike some of the other clinics at UVA, like, say, the immigration clinic or some of these other specialty clinics, for us, our case matter is really varied. So sometimes we'll be working on a securities class action. Sometimes we'll do a criminal case. Sometimes we'll do a case about employment law.

And so to me, it actually is really great to have students that have a variety of different interests. If I had 12 students that were only interested in constitutional law, it would be really tough sometimes, maybe, with a securities law case.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right. That makes sense. So I'm curious, what is the breakdown between, what are you doing when the class meets versus what are they then doing on their own the rest of the time?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. So I think our big class meeting is a way to convene for this overall team huddle for all 12 students. And I think that's important because sometimes we'll have what are known as case rounds, where the smaller-- usually, for the 12 students, we usually break them up into three or four teams of three or four students.

And so on a weekly basis, maybe those three or four students will do a presentation to the whole class about their case round. And I've actually found that to be really incredibly helpful because I think, between myself and the three students that are dedicated to a case, that's all we think about. But then when you have someone else who's really, really bright and hasn't really thought about the case that much but has these other background concepts or experiences, they can really provide a lot of insight.

I mean, in both of our cases that were argued for the Supreme Court this year, we had arguments that we made that just came out of a case round. A student was like, well, I haven't really thought about this, but what about this idea? And I was like, honestly, brilliant. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: Wow! Cool.

XIAO WANG: So we'll do that. And I think that's a good way for the whole class to feel invested in everyone's work. We'll also try to do speakers during the case rounds so people learn a little bit more about how the Supreme Court and appellate advocacy works. Sometimes we'll do moot courts. But it's not necessarily supposed to be this intensive class session.

I think the bulk of the work, the bulk of what happens is these individual case team meetings that happen on a weekly basis or more frequently, depending on how busy a case is. And that's when I meet with the three or four students, sometimes in my office, sometimes in a small conference room. And we start talking about what they found on the research, how to craft an argument, how to recraft an argument. And so that's pretty intense, I would say. And yeah, it definitely is more work than the 80 minutes that is blocked off on the schedule.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, because they're participating in writing briefs and obviously, yes, like you said, coming up with arguments and things like that, and research.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, and just on each one of those takes a ton of time, I mean, especially in front of the Supreme Court. I mean, last year we had one brief-- I was looking this up the other day. I always save new versions or different versions of briefs as version 1, version 2, version 3. And I think on one of our briefs it was like-- I think we were at, like, version 47. [LAUGHS]

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my God.

XIAO WANG: And then we just renamed it. So it's definitely more than version 47. But we really, really try to make things as perfect as we can be in front of the Supreme Court. And I think the learning that happens-- the learning that takes place happens between version 1 and 47. And I think that's how you become a better writer, a better thinker. And it takes a ton of work. There's really no shortcut there.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah.

[THEME MUSIC]

It's September, which means a lot of you may already be hard at work on your law school applications. But I also realize that a lot of Admissible listeners out there are folks who are much earlier on in the process. You may be wondering, is law school even right for me? What's it all about? And what do lawyers do anyway?

If you're thinking about applying to law school but don't really know where to begin, be sure to check out season 3, episode 1 of the show. UVA law professor Joe Fore joined me to discuss all the things you should be thinking about when it comes to this rather big life decision.

For someone out there who's listening to this episode, maybe it's the beginning of their college career. Maybe they haven't even gone to college yet. But let's pretend they're in a relatively early stage of thinking about law school. Do you have advice in terms of what they should study in undergrad? What kind of internships? What kind of advice would you give to a person who's maybe just embarking on their college career?

XIAO WANG: I don't think there is really a particularly one track to prepare you. I think, stereotypically, a lot of people would say, well, I'm going to major in history. Or maybe I should take some Latin or whatever. I should take English if I want to write a lot. I'd actually say, no, take all different things because what I think students should do is study what you're interested in, study what you're passionate about, study broadly.

At this point, I'm closing in on a thousand or so students that I've taught in my courses. And I've had students that run the gamut for majors. I've had everybody from your stereotypical history, English, business person, to people that were computer programmers and engineers. And they've all been super successful. There's not one recipe. Don't try to fit yourself to the mold of, quote, a ""lawyer."" Bring yourself to that role.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK, this is, to me, the most fascinating part of the clinic. How is it even guaranteed that you're going to have a case? Why don't we start with the Ames case?

XIAO WANG: Sure, sure.

NATALIE BLAZER: So for people who don't know, can you just give a brief background of what the case is, what are the issues, how it got to the Supreme Court?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. So the case is a case involving Title VII, which is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is a part of the Civil Rights Act that essentially seeks to root out discrimination in the workplace. There are other titles that seek to address discrimination in other forms. But Title VII is the one that seeks to root it out at the workplace.

And the Ames case was a Title VII case where this individual alleged that she was subject to discrimination on the basis of her sexual orientation. So she brought her case first in federal trial court. She didn't get very far. She lost. She appealed it to the Sixth Circuit. And the Sixth Circuit also dismissed her claim.

And that's where we came in. And we called and said, hey, we think your case has some potential to go to the Supreme Court. And we'd be happy to file a cert petition for you and represent you before the Supreme Court because that's a pretty specialized version of practice, I think.

When we talked about earlier, like, how is trial practice different from appellate practice, we said, look, trial practice is different from appellate practice. And appellate practice is a little bit different from Supreme Court practice. So we really want to help you. We think that there's a chance that the lower courts got it wrong. And we'd like to take this up to the Supreme Court. And that is a case that I think many other folks reached out to. And we were really lucky to be able to be selected among the many that reached out.

NATALIE BLAZER: Are you then working alongside her counsel who represented her at the Sixth Circuit?

XIAO WANG: Totally, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think this is an area where I think some Supreme Court specialists differ. My understanding is that there are some clinics and some law firms that say, look, you give us the case files when we go to the Supreme Court. And then you, as the trial counsel, just sit back and watch and let us work.

And I really disagree with that. I think that that's not right because, first of all, it's their client. They've worked with them for a long time. They've built that trust. And secondly, I think that the life cycle of a case is such that the lawyers need to work together. They really need to work in partnership.

And so do we, as UVA, do we do the bulk of the writing and the research and the work? Certainly at the Supreme Court stage. But at the same time, we always share drafts with our co-counsel. We always say, look, I'm not really sure if this is right, so let me know. And sometimes there are things that are not necessarily in the factual record but you would really want to know and really want to get a sense of.

And so for the Ames case, for instance, I just flew out to Akron, Ohio. And I sat down with her and her trial counsel and said, hey, let's spend a day here. And let me just really understand the case. And I'm not going to be able to know everything in a day, but I'll get a better sense. And at least you'll who I am. And then if I have other questions, it's not like I'm a blank person on voicemail. You know who I am.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. I mean, that's what advocacy really is all about. I'm sure she wanted to you. You wanted to her. What is it about this case that you think made so many people reach out?

XIAO WANG: One of the key questions that the Supreme Court usually wants to tackle is when there's something known as a circuit split, which means that the appellate courts around the country-- like I mentioned, there are 12 appellate courts around the country-- whether they come to different conclusions on the same legal question.

And there was a circuit split here. And everyone acknowledged that there was a circuit split. And so that suggested that the Supreme Court wanted to-- might be interested in taking up this case. So that's, I think, part of why other people wanted to reach out. I think there are other-- I mean, certainly there are other-- there's discussion about the case in terms of its sociocultural, political ramifications that made people want to reach out. I think most of the times when we reach out and offer our assistance, there are other people that have also reached out and offered assistance, not just in Ames, but in almost all of our cases.

NATALIE BLAZER: And is that pretty common of how you get a case, of how the clinic gets a case? You're reaching out to somebody at that level?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, it depends. It depends. I mean, I think the best model and probably the model that would allow me to have more hobbies and sleep more and be a better tennis player is if folks just came to us. And they are coming to us more. I will say they are coming to us more. One of our cases last year, someone just came to us and said, I heard you'd done really great work. And we really would be super privileged and excited to work with you.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's cool.

XIAO WANG: And the other-- and I think the more grueling-- way is get up really early in the morning, and you read these opinions. And you're like, all right, I think there's a circuit split here. I think I'm going to try to reach out. And here's how I would pitch UVA. And here's how I would say that we can offer an advantage. And here's the questions that I would have for the local counsel. And here's how the conversation I think should go.

And it's similar to the CV resume comment that I said earlier. I mean, I think it's easy to say, look, hey, UVA has landed some great things. But we've also lost a few of them, you know? And it sucks to lose. But I think that's a learning experience that you just go through, that, look, I can do the best and try to pitch us as well as I can. And sometimes people will end up going for another law firm or another law clinic.

NATALIE BLAZER: Well, I was going to say it's pretty remarkable, if you think about it, that the client would choose a clinic of law students versus a Williams & Connolly or Covington, right?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think--

NATALIE BLAZER: Or are they-- so this didn't even occur to me until right now. Is this pro bono?

XIAO WANG: So two things. One is, yes, we offer our services free of charge, right?

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. The students aren't making billing hours for this.

[LAUGHTER]

XIAO WANG: You could see the car that I drove in on. It was not a Lamborghini.

[LAUGHTER]

So we offer our services free of charge. But a lot of law firms do, too. And I think--

NATALIE BLAZER: Because of the prestige?

XIAO WANG: Yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: OK.

XIAO WANG: Because of the prestige, because of the marketing value, the experience that it affords. First of all, I certainly lead with and talk about how remarkable our students are. And that's because of your work, honestly. You find really great folks.

NATALIE BLAZER: Aw, thank you.

XIAO WANG: And so I just coast on your laurels, Natalie.

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I say it's not just the students. It's certainly not just me. I mean, we have an incredible faculty here and an incredible librarian staff and an incredible set of staff and researchers. And that's something that a lot of other places don't have.

And so I've been on pitch meetings where I say, look, the lower court that decided your case, also, in deciding your case, cited an article by Aditya Bamzai. Guess where he works? He works four doors down from me, and I can just call him.

NATALIE BLAZER: Right, he's a law professor here. So cool.

XIAO WANG: And so I think that that provides us a comparative advantage. But it's an incredibly competitive clinic.

NATALIE BLAZER: So competitive. Any case that goes before the Supreme Court, I imagine-- I mean, there's going to be some venue issues, I know, that maybe are not that controversial. But this one, I know, had some controversy surrounding it. And so, first of all, how do you talk students through that?

I'm just curious because for-- I'll just reiterate for listeners, this was a reverse discrimination issue, basically a straight, cisgender, white woman saying, if I'm discriminated against-- in other words, she was not promoted in favor of an LGBTQ+ person who was promoted, and then she was demoted. Basically, my understanding is, OK, well, if you are claiming reverse discrimination, you actually have a higher burden to meet than if the reverse fact pattern was true. And so you could see that that would push some people to--

XIAO WANG: Yeah, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: So what conversations happen either within the clinic, or do you hear from people even outside of the clinic? How does that work?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, well, certainly I hear from people outside of the clinic, for sure. For sure. I mean, I think it's incredibly tough to land one of these cases. But it's also incredibly tough to advocate and figure out what the strategy is and to hear all the noise from outside. I mean, that can be really distracting. And it can be really tough at times. I'm definitely not going to sugarcoat it.

And to your point, it's not relegated to just this more high profile case. I mean, in our other case that we argued had to do with retirement benefits. And a few of my friends who work in finance, who aren't in law, would call me and be like, I can't believe you're doing this! This is going to ruin my relationship with my clients and everything!

NATALIE BLAZER: And meanwhile, I'm thinking, that's pretty dry.

XIAO WANG: I know, I know!

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, yeah.

XIAO WANG: And so whenever it gets to the Supreme Court, there's going to be some level of controversy, whether it's the broader public or it's a smaller section of people that are really invested or interested in the issue. And I think what I try to tell our students is like, we're not going to be-- our clinic will never be like Michael Avenatti. We're not going to be out in the press, trying to advocate our case.

I think what we want to do is we want to work with our clients. We want to come up with the best legal strategy. And we want to put that forward and base that based on research, precedent, fact, text, and see where we go. And I think we have a good track record there. And I'm really proud of that track record.

But I think, with our students, to me, I've tried to emphasize that when it gets tough and when there's-- I certainly don't want them to feel that-- feel any opprobrium or anything like that. But I think I try to flip it around and say, look, this is a really good learning experience.

It really is a way to-- I mean, because when you're at a big law firm, often you're going to take positions that are unpopular and may, in fact, be wrong. Like, who knows? And I think figuring out and navigating like, hey, what's real out there and what's the law say, and how do we advocate for this fairly and with integrity, I mean, those are really key questions that we want students to really develop and learn and think about as they navigate through law school.

NATALIE BLAZER: It's like what moot court is all about, or what mock trial is all about. You're arguing for a position that you don't necessarily agree with. When I was in big law, one of our biggest clients was like Philip Morris. Do I agree with anything that Philip Morris does? Not necessarily. But you see how arguments get made. You see the creativity of arguments for a client like that. And I think that's all toward the good for developing young lawyers.

I also tell students like, the Supreme Court is what it is right now. So any chance you have to see how they-- this is going to be probably the makeup of the court for many, many years to come. And so for our students who are graduating and practicing, this is going to be where we're at. I'm curious actually, now that we're talking about that, do you talk to them about the Supreme Court itself? Like, in this day of 2025, they are under scrutiny. Are they really independent? What's going on with the Trump administration? How much does that come into play, or not really?

XIAO WANG: Yeah. Well, I want to hop back really quick. I think this will tie back into your question. One thing that I think did make a difference-- and it is something really, really critical for me as a professor, especially that I want to bring to my students-- is to really get a sense to know our clients.

So I made sure they all got to know Marlene Ames because it's really, really easy to make generalizations and come up with narratives or stories or stereotypes or whatever. But if you meet her, I mean, such a sweet woman.

And to get a chance to meet her and talk to her and see, hey, this is a woman that went from working her decades at a social services agency, ending up well-reviewed, well-regarded, ended up pulling herself up to make about $100,000 a year, and was a single mom supporting two kids, and to lose that and to have her salary cut in half for something that she really doesn't why she got, I think that puts a human face to things. And it becomes a lot harder to say, well, we should be up here, when really what's going on is working with an individual and trying to get them to have the courthouse doors open for them. So I think that really matters.

I think your broader question about the Supreme Court, to me, I think working with the students on the cases and seeing how we were able to craft arguments that had support from all sides really, actually, I hope gave them some faith in the system to say, like, hey, at the end, you really want to come up with arguments that appeal to everybody and really sound and work for everyone. But there's no question that there's a broader discussion about the Supreme Court's role and the makeup of the court and how it plays within our society today.

And I don't want to-- I certainly don't shut the door to those discussions. I mean, the last couple of years, I've had Bertrall Ross, who used to be part of our faculty, come in. He was part of President Biden's commission to look at the Supreme Court. And I've had him come in and talk about the broader structural place of the Supreme Court. And we do have those discussions, for sure. And I think those discussions enrich the experience.

That said, there are, I think, so many classes at UVA that have those discussions. I think our thought is, we're working there in front of them. How do we do the best and get justice for our clients?

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I think both are important. Like, we're working-- like I said, this is what we have.

XIAO WANG: Exactly.

NATALIE BLAZER: We're not changing the Supreme Court anytime soon. We're working with what we have. But also, I think, to Bertrall's point, we can also think critically about where this is going and all that. So Ames was your second time arguing before the Supreme Court. Walk me through-- the clinic is mooting you, my guess.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, totally.

NATALIE BLAZER: So how long are you preparing before this?

XIAO WANG: We were so busy. Once the case is granted, you'll file what's known as your opening merits brief. The other side files their response brief. And you file a reply brief. And our cases were back-to-back months. And so our reply brief-- I argued in front of the Supreme Court, I think, January 22. That was my first argument, January 22 of this year.

NATALIE BLAZER: And that was the Cunningham retirement benefits case.

XIAO WANG: Yeah. And my birthday was two days later.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I took, I guess, two or three days off for my birthday. So that's late January. And then by February 7, we had to file our reply brief in Ames. And when you're filing your reply brief, you're not thinking about oral argument. You're just trying to get the reply. This is the last written word you get in front of the Court.

So that's February 7. And I think the argument was February 24 or 26. So it's like 2 and 1/2 weeks. And basically, those 2 and 1/2 weeks, I think I did three or four moots at different places. But yeah, I remember we sent in our reply brief. I think I took a nap. And then the next day--

NATALIE BLAZER: [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I mean, this is the great thing. Usually, my first moot is with our students. And it is always hilariously bad.

[LAUGHTER]

And honestly, I think it would not get past the quarterfinals of the Wild Moot Court Competition. It's so bad. I think, for my first moot in Cunningham, I'll be honest, I think some of the students had some questions.

[LAUGHTER]

But then my last moot is also with the students. And I think they can see-- and I think that's helpful because I think, in the end when you see it, you're like, wow, they were able to answer the questions. They were cool under fire. And they had a ready answer. And it's not like that. It's this random set of pieces at the start. And you see it coming together over moot 1, 2, 3, 4. And it ends in a good place. But to see it build, I think that's a good learning opportunity for the students.

NATALIE BLAZER: So you basically had your first-ever Supreme Court argument and your second-ever Supreme Court argument like a month apart.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: We're kind of flip-flopping now between Cunningham and Ames, but I think that's OK. What was your first argument like? Were you terrified?

XIAO WANG: I felt pretty prepped. I don't know if I was terrified as much as-- there's a certain amount of pomp and circumstance that goes with arguing before the Supreme Court. And that's really interesting and really fun. I mean, you get to be on the stage. And you get to be in the lawyers lounge beforehand and prep your notes. And the person that I was arguing against, my opposing counsel, had argued 33 times or something beforehand.

NATALIE BLAZER: [GASPS] Wow.

XIAO WANG: And so I think that-- I wouldn't say I was terrified. It was just sort of like taking the court for the first time and trying to understand what it was like. I will say we were the second argument that day. And the first argument was about this police shooting, Fourth Amendment question.

And when you're the second argument, you sit behind the first argument. And you sit behind the first argument, and the Supreme Court is like, I don't know, 30 feet high. It's incredibly-- it's this cavernous, majestic building courtroom. And where you sit, if you're the second argument, is right under the lights. And it's like a heat lamp.

[LAUGHTER]

So I remember going to the bathroom a couple times just because you would be--

NATALIE BLAZER: Just sweating.

XIAO WANG: You're baking. You're baked Alaska out there. And then you're trying to drink some water. And then you're like, I need to go to the bathroom. And you're like, I hope they don't call my case.

[LAUGHTER]

And so I think that actually takes some pressure off because instead of thinking about, what am I going to say, you're like, I honestly need to just have an empty bladder and a not sore throat when I get up there.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, yeah. And so, that case, was it 9-0?

XIAO WANG: Yes. Yeah, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Congratulations.

XIAO WANG: Oh, thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's incredible.

XIAO WANG: Oh, thanks.

NATALIE BLAZER: And Ames was also 9-0.

XIAO WANG: Yep, yep. Thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: I mean, so this is why now you don't have to go out and find cases anymore. [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: I definitely still do. I definitely still do. I wish I didn't, but yeah, it's always great to see that for the clients. But yeah, they're still hard work to be done. Don't worry about that.

NATALIE BLAZER: I have no doubt. Did these clinic students just get extremely lucky to have two cases going on at the same time? Or is that normal?

XIAO WANG: I don't know if they would say they were extremely lucky. I think in retrospect they would. But during the time when we were working on it, I mean, I think we put in a lot of hours and a lot of time. And the students were remarkable. This isn't just all we were doing. We had some other cases we were working on. And they put in really, really fantastic work.

They hold a really special place in my heart for all the work, but really all my students because I tell them-- and when I say that they've done such great work, it was actually-- they worked on the merits cases. But the last year, the students before that worked on the cert petition. So it's like, I've really been blessed with multiple classes of incredibly hardworking and incredibly intelligent students.

I think they were very fortunate this year. They got to go to the Supreme Court several times to watch the argument, to see how the Justices react. They got to go-- the Biden and Trump administration supported us in both cases. And when that happens, you actually work as a tag team with the Solicitor General's office, which is the office within the Justice Department that argues Supreme Court cases. And so we'll go up there, and we'll just sit around a table with members of the Solicitor General's office and think about strategy, think about argument. And that's an opportunity that I almost never got in a law firm.

NATALIE BLAZER: I was gonna say, that's very rare. I mean, and they're getting that? That's awesome.

XIAO WANG: We got to moot at what's known as Georgetown Supreme Court Institute and got to see Georgetown faculty ask us tough questions on both of our cases. And so I think that they had an incredible amount of opportunities. I'm really glad we were able to give it to them. And I think, in exchange, they all put in a lot of time. And very, very grateful for that.

NATALIE BLAZER: That makes me so happy, makes me so proud of them. Do you know what this upcoming year-- what cases you're working on?

XIAO WANG: I do.

NATALIE BLAZER: If you can't share, that's OK.

XIAO WANG: No, no, no, I can share a little bit about it. I think we've had a case that's been pending, which is this Fourth Amendment case about dog sniffs.

NATALIE BLAZER: Oooh.

XIAO WANG: And basically there's a question-- there's an open question in the lower courts that if you get stopped and a dog goes around and sniffs your car-- if they just go around and sniff your car and they don't touch your car, it's actually constitutional. The Supreme Court has already decided that question.

But there's an open question of, what happens if the dog walks around and say you have your window open and they just jump through your window and then-- they jump through the window because they think they smell drugs or whatever? Is jumping through your window, is that considered a trespass? And if that's a trespass, is that a Fourth Amendment violation?

So we represent an individual out of Iowa. Her name's Ashley Mumford. And we are arguing that that is considered a Fourth Amendment search. And so right now, that's in the very final stages of briefing. I actually need to finish writing the reply brief by next Tuesday. So--

NATALIE BLAZER: Oh, my goodness!

XIAO WANG: --four days from now.

[LAUGHTER]

NATALIE BLAZER: So just so I understand, you're arguing that that is a lawful--

XIAO WANG: An unlawful search.

NATALIE BLAZER: Unlawful, OK.

XIAO WANG: Unlawful search, yeah.

NATALIE BLAZER: Fourth Amendment violation.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, and the other side, represented by the Iowa Attorney General's Office, says that that's totally fine.

NATALIE BLAZER: And presumably this would only come up if something was found when the dog jumps through the window. So student listeners out there, you will learn all about this in crim law, fruit of the poisonous tree, and all that stuff. So wow, ooh, I can't wait to hear how this goes.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I think we really hope for the best for our client. I mean, I think that this is an issue that definitely comes up. I mean, police use dogs all the time. And often, they ask you to roll down your window to give your license and registration. So I think that what-- I think it's definitely an interesting issue.

We have another case that involves what's known as venue, which I mentioned earlier. It's, where do you file a lawsuit? Incidentally, that case has to do with a dog bite. So we are the canine--

[LAUGHTER]

--canine-themed clinic this year. And then, finally, we're working on some other matters that have to do with environmental law, with retirement law-- employee benefits law, and voting rights. So those are operating in the background.

NATALIE BLAZER: Really cool. Do a lot of students in the clinic have aspirations to clerk or to even clerk for the Supreme Court?

XIAO WANG: Certainly, I think probably more so than the general population of students at the law school. And--

NATALIE BLAZER: I imagine it helps them be competitive for a clerkship to go through the clinic.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just a conversation. And I'm sure that Scott Ballinger has the same conversation with his appellate litigation clinic. But a lot of the times-- or many times, judges-- if you apply for a clerkship, judges will call your references or your recommenders. Or they'll call me, for instance. And I can say really great things about all my students, that I do end up saying.

But it's one thing saying, like, hey, this is a great student, to say-- it's one thing to say that. And it's another thing to say, this is a student that worked on a merits case for the Supreme Court. And they wrote this section of the brief. I can tell you that. Their name can't be on it, but I can tell you that.

And if I trust them with an argument that goes before the Supreme Court, I think that that's a level of credibility and legitimacy that would be really helpful for a judicial law clerk. So I think that those conversations really matter. And I think it's been really, really supportive of our students in being able to apply for and land clerkships.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah. Before we wrap up, because I know you have this reply brief to work on-- [LAUGHS]

XIAO WANG: It's all good.

NATALIE BLAZER: --I really want to return to what you said about human client. All these cases before the Supreme Court involve people. At the end of the day, they involve people. This venue question that might sound super boring-- someone got bitten by a dog, presumably-- just because you hear ""Fourth Amendment"" or whatever Amendment, it's like, this is a person, or these are people.

So I'm curious. Now that you've argued before the Supreme Court twice and you see the judges, do you see students feeling conflicted about clerking for certain judges? I'm asking because of how political everything is now. Everything is political. But like we were talking about before, this is the Supreme Court we have.

And you have made two arguments where all nine agree. So in theory, we can agree on things, right? So I just feel that this is so important to talk about today. How would you talk to a student or counsel a student who maybe is someone who could clerk on the Supreme Court but feels conflicted because of their own personal values?

XIAO WANG: Well, first, I'd say apply and hopefully be in our clinic because I think every year that I've taught, including the time when I taught at Northwestern, but certainly at UVA, we've had students of all political persuasions, backgrounds, racial, gender, religious backgrounds. And that is a real strength of UVA.

And really thanks to the admissions committee for finding those folks because what it means is that we can talk about these issues. And we can't talk about it just in the abstract. We have to represent our client. And we can say, all right, I know you guys come from different backgrounds. You have different views. But how do we come up with something that would make sense, that you could understand, that you could agree with? Because that's going to be what's going to work with the Supreme Court. And I think that is something that I really value and treasure.

I think for the students, though, I would also say, look, you learn a ton from clerking and from working and from seeing how the law is formed and established and how to be a great advocate. And you'll use those skills. And there are definitely going to be times where you work for a judge or where you work for a law firm that you may not agree with everything, and that's OK. People don't agree with a lot of things. And that's OK.

I think what is something that you can take from it is like, what can I learn? How can I be a better advocate? How can I work with my clients? How can I come up with what I hope are arguments that folks can really agree with from across the aisle? And if that works, I think that's-- then I'm doing my job.

And I would really counsel students to say, certainly there's a degree of politics, there's a degree of partisanship and polarization in society at large, and in the legal system perhaps, as well. But you can either add to it, or you can try to work through it and maybe turn down the temperature a bit. And I've always mentioned to my students that I really want to be a person that turns down the temperature and thinks about how we can really advocate for our clients and come up with things that are workable for everyone.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, I love that. You can add to the polarization. You can do what you're doing, which is turn down the temperature. Or you can sit out entirely, which is almost the worst option. So getting in there, understanding how it works, the difficulty of crafting an argument, that will get that 9-0 ruling, I mean, I think that's what it's all about.

XIAO WANG: I mean, I think it's totally right. And I think that one thing with Ames in particular, I remember, is one of the professors-- I'm not going to name names-- one professor-- a couple professors actually told me-- they were like, well, if you just change this argument and really played into a grievance narrative or whatever, you could just win it 6-3, and it could be a lot easier for you.

And I just told them-- I just looked at them. And I said, like, yeah, we're not going to do that. We're definitely not going to do that because I don't think that gets us anywhere. And I think that it's certainly probably harder to come up with universal arguments, to come up with the research, and to listen through to the precedents and the texts and to really investigate the history behind certain clauses and how to interpret them.

But I think what comes out is a better product for everyone that we can agree with. And that takes work for me. It takes a ton of work for me. It takes a ton of work for my staff. It takes a ton of work for our students. But I think that's what we want to teach our students at the end of the day. And I am really fortunate for the Law School's support behind that.

NATALIE BLAZER: Yeah, that resonates with what I tell our students all the time. I mean, it is going to be hard work. Trying to do it the easy way or trying to do-- that's never going to get us where we want to be. I mean, we're UVA Law. Why should we be trying to take the easy route?

XIAO WANG: Well, when you said something about, you could turn up the temperature or turn it down or sit on the sidelines, I think that-- and I don't want listeners to take this the wrong way, but I think that if you're a UVA Law student, I really don't think you can or should sit on the sidelines. You have already proven that you're incredibly gifted and talented, sharp and precocious. And you have this privilege to be able to really help people and to work in a legal system and improve that legal system. And I think sitting out on that is something that society loses out on, but you definitely lose out on.

NATALIE BLAZER: For sure, yeah. I tell them, remember why you applied to law school in the first place. Sitting out is-- I agree-- completely not an option. And I have been, honestly, so inspired by this conversation. It makes me so happy that you're here.

It makes me so proud of all of the students. I'm going to go back and look up who was in the clinic each year because it makes me so excited for our 3L's who are about to have this experience. So before we go, because most listeners are thinking about applying to law school or they're getting ready to apply to law school, what advice would you give based on everything we've talked about, your own experience?

XIAO WANG: Yeah, when it comes to applying to law school, I think that, in some ways, as you craft your application, some things are set, like your LSAT score and your undergraduate GPA. But I think what I would say is, hey, what's not said are, make sure you have a great set of recommenders and references. Make sure you keep up with those folks. And write a personal statement that reflects who you are.

And I think, as things come in, have an open mind about where you want to attend and go to. I'm certain, for some people, they may not think of Charlottesville, Virginia as a place that they could imagine themselves. But then they come here, and they fall in love with this place. So I would just say, have an open mind. And if UVA is something that you're interested in, my email is on the website. I'm happy to talk and be a booster for this place.

NATALIE BLAZER: That's so nice. And as we've talked about, in the middle of everything you're working on, that's very generous. So thank you. This was awesome.

XIAO WANG: Thank you. I appreciate it. This was great.

NATALIE BLAZER: This was so, so fun. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know you have just so much going on. You just got married.

XIAO WANG: Yes.

NATALIE BLAZER: Congratulations.

XIAO WANG: Thank you.

NATALIE BLAZER: I'm glad you're back from all your travels. And I'm excited to see what you guys do this year.

XIAO WANG: Yeah, yeah. Same, same. Hopefully we'll be able to get some great opportunities again for our students.

Whether we’re Black, White, Brown, Latino, Asian, Arab, or Indigenous, Native or newcomer, LGBTQ+or not, disabled or not, and regardless of faith, we believe in the freedom to speak out against injustice, organize for change, and fight hate and discrimination through peaceful means. It is not just a right, but a duty to the communities we represent. That’s why civil rights groups have criticized acts of this administration and denounced offensive and dangerous rhetoric.

This administration has made clear its intent to protect discrimination over civil rights and use any opportunity to silence dissent and target nonprofits that oppose its policies. It attacks philanthropic institutions, unions, teachers, and universities that support diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, the freedom to protest and to learn our history. We cannot be silent as they turn government power against our rights.

We continue to unequivocally condemn all forms of violence, including political violence, as our communities have long been targets of white supremacists’ hatred. America’s civil rights movement is rooted in nonviolence – as championed by Dr. King and Bayard Rustin—from the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington to today’s fight for equal opportunity for all.

Our communities face the highest rates of hate and violence –including anti-Arab, anti-Asian, anti-Black, anti-homeless, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-Muslim, antisemitic, and gender-based violence— and this administration’s actions and rhetoric have only intensified the dangers of hate crimes and violence by militarizing our cities, demonizing these communities, and enabling mass raids based on race and immigration status.

In an effort to silence opposition, the administration now also threatens to designate civil rights groups as “domestic terrorists,” revoke their non-profit status, and launch criminal investigations. But no group or individual should be considered a “criminal” for documenting hate incidents, protecting vulnerable communities, and pursuing justice through courts and legislation rather than violence.

The First Amendment protects our right to assemble, petition our government, and speak truth to power. These are not privileges—they are fundamental rights. Our strength has always come from unity built on freedom, not fear; on debate, not silence. When an administration seeks to stifle dissent, it rejects the very spirit that carries this nation forward. That’s why we:

Call on Congress to reject these attacks and publicly defend organizations exercising their constitutional rights,

Call on our allies to speak up now, because in unity, there is strength, and

Call on all Americans to recognize this attack for what it is: an assault on the institutions that protect all our rights.

Further attacks will only strengthen our conviction—a conviction driven not by greed, power, or envy, but by the fundamental belief that all people, regardless of race or identity, deserve equality, fairness, and dignity.

Laye Sekou Camara, 47, of Mays Landing, New Jersey, entered the United States on an immigrant visa and lied on his immigration forms by failing to admit he was involved in Liberia’s civil war.

“As a leader in Liberia’s civil war, Mr. Camara facilitated atrocities against civilians in his own country — including the use of child soldiers,” said ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Philadelphia Special Agent in Charge Edward V. Owens. “By concealing his crimes in Liberia, Camara was able to obtain immigration benefits and use those documents to seek employment and a new life in the United States. HSI will not allow the U.S. to become a refuge for human rights violators or for individuals who secure lawful status through deception. We will continue to work with our federal, state and international partners to identify fraud, protect the integrity of the immigration system, and support the prosecutors that hold these offenders accountable.”

According to the investigation, in 2010, Camara obtained lawful permanent resident status by falsely stating on immigration forms that he had never participated in extrajudicial killings or other acts of violence; had never been involved with a paramilitary unit, rebel group, or guerilla group; and had never engaged in the recruitment or use of child soldiers.

Officials in Canada said they have received more than 5,500 asylum claims since the beginning of July at one border crossing – Quebec’s Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle border crossing, south of Montreal.

The figure represents a 263% increase from the same period last year, according to data from the Canada Border Services Agency.

The spike in border crossings comes as President Trump ramps up military-style raids by armed, masked, agents of the Department for Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency as the White House presses them to hit deportation targets.

The Trump administration’s operation is targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally with criminal records, and has seen over 200,000 people arrested, and over 50,000 detained so far this year. Many are being seized from their homes, while going to work, outside courthouses and at store parking lots.

Many of those arrested and detained have had previous protections allowing them to legally remain in the U.S. removed by the government.

Earlier this year the Trump administration revoked temporary legal status granted to more than 800,000 immigrants who fled violence, disasters and instability in countries like Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

This week, Trump deployed the National Guard to Memphis and suggested he could also send troops into Chicago. The White House has previously sent them into Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

As well as those who may face deportation from the U.S. trying to flee the country, increasing numbers of U.S. citizens are also trying to leave, the Canadian figures suggest.

Data from the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada covering claims of alleged persecution within the U.S. last month revealed there were 245 refugee applications made by U.S. citizens in the first six months of this year.

This represents a sharp rise in claims, with 204 referrals filed by Americans in the whole of 2024.

Canada’s acceptance of U.S. refugees has historically been low. Applicants must convince the board that nowhere in the U.S. offers them safety to gain asylum.

Trump took it away. • Stateline,"Shalina Chatlani, Anna Claire Vollers",,,,,https://stateline.org/2025/09/19/biden-offered-health-insurance-access-to-daca-immigrants-trump-took-it-away/,"A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).
Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace.
Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association.
“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.","A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The change, announced in June, took effect at the beginning of this month. It reverses a policy change enacted by the Biden administration for last November’s annual enrollment period.

DACA, which President Barack Obama established in 2012, applies to certain immigrants who are here illegally but were brought to the U.S. as children. The program was enacted to protect them from deportation and allows them to work for renewable two-year periods. To be eligible, an immigrant must have come to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before June 15, 2007. DACA participants also must be high school graduates, high school students or veterans of the U.S. military.

The oldest are now in their early 40s, some with children of their own.

Even though there are some 525,000 active DACA recipients, only about 10,000 were getting their health insurance from the marketplaces before the policy change, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, critics of the new Trump administration rule say participation would have grown as more people became aware of their eligibility.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

DACA recipients from 19 states were blocked from the marketplaces, though, because of pending litigation. More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules, said DACA was an “abuse of executive authority” and should not have entitled some immigrants to benefits. The rule change simply restores the status quo, Vaughan said.

“It was kind of an experiment or an end run around our legal immigration system that was set up by the rules that were set up by Congress to try to offer an amnesty to this particular group,” Vaughan said. “Because it’s not a legal status, these individuals are not, under the law, eligible for certain public benefits, and one of them is subsidized health insurance.”

But critics of the change say it’s cruel to cancel health care coverage for people who were brought to the country as children.

“Health care is a fundamental human right all of us, no matter where we were born, how much money we have, what we look like, what language we speak, we should be able to access quality and affordable care when we need it,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, a policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants.

Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace. Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association. But nearly 20% lacked coverage, more than twice the national uninsured rate of 8%.

Mohyeddin said that many of the DACA recipients without coverage reported skipping recommended medical and dental appointments or declining to fill prescriptions, because they couldn’t afford it or were fearful of being targeted for their status.

“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.

While DACA recipients were only recently allowed to purchase coverage on the marketplace, it was a huge step toward better health outcomes for them, said Arline Cruz Escobar, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, a group that provides legal and social services to immigrants.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

“We see a lot of mixed-status households, and so I think people are just very confused about what this means for them, and what it means for their families,” Cruz Escobar said. “We already know that the immigrant community doesn’t access enough preventive care and screenings and so, I can only imagine that we will see an increase in a lot of chronic conditions, or undiagnosed chronic conditions that could have been prevented.”

The impact of the new Trump administration rule on DACA recipients will vary, as some states offer other health care options to noncitizens.

States are going to have to decide whether they can afford to offer state-subsidized health coverage to DACA recipients and other immigrants who are no longer eligible for federal help, said Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace exchange, Covered California.

California has the most DACA recipients, at 147,440. Altman said more than 2,300 of them have purchased plans on the California marketplace and will lose their coverage. She said many DACA recipients in the state were not aware of their eligibility, and more would have enrolled if the Trump administration hadn’t made the policy change.

California provides state-funded health coverage to all income-eligible immigrants, regardless of their legal status. But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a budget that scales back that coverage because of budgetary issues.

In light of federal changes and financial obligations on states, Altman said, California will have to make the same choices as other states about how or whether to help DACA recipients with their health care.

“The hard part is, to actually make coverage affordable for the populations that we’re talking about, you have to fund financial assistance at least somewhat comparable to what’s available on the federal marketplace,” Altman said. “So the state dollars are really where the rubber meets the road.”

House passes stopgap funding bill to avert government shutdown

The US House passed a stopgap funding bill, known as a ‘continuing resolution’ (CR) which would keep the government funded until 21 November.

The CR now advances to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.

A reminder, that a government shutdown would take effect at the end of September if lawmakers can’t pass the necessary legislation.

Per my last post, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) responded to the Thursday’s vaccine advisory panel meeting with a statement that said the committee (which health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr completely replaced earlier this year) “promoted false claims and misguided information about vaccines as part of an unprecedented effort to limit access to routine childhood immunizations and sow fear and mistrust in vaccines”.

The academy also reshared their guidance for vaccines, which includes “giving newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth” and a combination MMRV vaccine should “remain an option” for families. The AAP advises that children receive the shot “at 1 year and again at 4-6 years”.

We’ll get more from the second day of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) later. A reminder that on Thursday the panel voted on recommending that children receive multiple vaccines to protect against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox (MMRV), instead of a single vaccine that can protect against all four diseases.

As my colleague, Carter Sherman, reports, the committee is scheduled to focus on Covid vaccines today. It will also hold two votes on the recommended timing of the vaccine for hepatitis B – an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease and death.

The committee was originally scheduled to vote on the hepatitis B vaccine on Wednesday, but delayed the vote after the committee chair, Martin Kulldorff, noticed “slight discrepancies” in the wording of the planned votes.

Following Kirk shooting, new poll shows drop in positive direction of the country among Republicans

A new Associated Press-NORC poll shows that there has been a significant drop, among Republicans, that the country is heading in a positive direction.

51% of Republicans said the country is heading in the wrong direction, in a poll conducted between 11 and 15 September. A 22-point increase from the 29% of Republicans who expressed the same feeling in June of this year.

For Democrats, 92% say the country is heading in the wrong direction – a number that’s stayed consistent since Donald Trump returned to the White House for a second term.

More broadly, 39% of adults approve of the way Trump is handing his job as president, while 60% disapprove.

Congress prepares to vote of funding bills to avert government shutdown

Today, lawmakers in the House will vote on legislation, known as a “continuing resolution” (CR), to prevent a looming government shutdown at the end of September.

The bill, introduced by Republicans, would fund the government until 21 November. According to Politico, House GOP whip Tom Emmer was confident, as of Thursday, that his party had enough votes. “We’re going to pass this,” he said in an interview.

A reminder, Republicans only have a very thin majority in the lower chamber, and have already heard push back from some members on certain provisions in the bill.

Democrats have, almost unanimously, said they’re bucking the CR as is, taking issue with its lack of health care provisions. “The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis,” senate minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a joint statement.

Democrats in the lower chamber also released their own legislation that would keep the government funded until the end of October.

For their part, GOP lawmakers only need a simple majority for their CR to advance to the Senate, where Democrats can use the filibuster to tank it if it lacks 60 votes. However, that requires Schumer to ensure that moderate members of his party don’t end up voting for the legislation if the threat of a shutdown inches closer.

This is the problem the top Democrat faced the last time this happened, back in March, when Schumer ended up voting for the Republican-written bill that kept federal agencies funded. At the time, Schumer faced immense pressure from his Democratic colleagues in the House to push back, but ultimately believed a shutdown would carry “consequences for America that are much, much worse”.

Trump expected to focus on TikTok and trade in call with Xi Jinping

The president doesn’t have any public events scheduled today, according to the White House.

He’s due to sign executive orders at 3pm EST, but that is closed press for the time being. We’ll let you know if that opens up.

In less than an hour, Trump is expected to have a call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. It’s the first time the pair have spoken since June, and Trump said to reporters yesterday that they’ll focus on TikTok and trade on their call. “We’re very close on all of it,” the president added.

Taiwan’s top representative in the United States met privately in Washington this month with a little-known group of intelligence advisers.

The meeting with Alexander Yui, Taiwan’s de facto US ambassador, was described by two sources with knowledge of the matter and amounted to one of the higher-level Taiwan-US contacts to date during Donald Trump’s second term, Reuters reports.

It was also an unusually sensitive meeting for the previously obscure group, the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB), which includes members who have jobs outside of the federal government and has historically played a low-key role in policymaking.

A White House official downplayed the encounter, saying it was not an official, sanctioned PIAB gathering but rather an informal conversation between some PIAB members and a foreign diplomat that was put together by a mutual contact.

Kamala Harris critical of Joe Biden in new book: ‘angry and disappointed’

David Smith

Kamala Harris has revealed she was left “angry and disappointed” when Joe Biden called her hours before her US presidential debate with Donald Trump to suggest powerful associates of Biden’s brother refused to support her.

The former vice-president and Democratic nominee recounts the episode – and other criticisms of Biden – in her campaign memoir 107 Days, obtained by the Guardian before its publication next week.

Harris writes that in September she was in a hotel room in Philadelphia, poised to take on Trump in a potentially decisive debate, when the then president called to wish her good luck – and to ask if she would be back in Philadelphia before the election.

Harris wondered why Biden would ask such a non sequitur. According to the book, he told her: “My brother called. He’s been talking to a group of real power brokers in Philly.” He offered several names and asked if Harris knew them. She did not.

Harris writes: “Then he got to his point. His brother had told him that those guys were not going to support me because I’d been saying bad things about him. He wasn’t inclined to believe it, he claimed, but he thought I should know in case my team had been encouraging me to put daylight between the two of us.”

The then vice-president asked Biden to put the group in touch with her directly. But he was not done with the call. He sought to rewrite the history of his own disastrous debate performance against Trump three months earlier.

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show.

Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr. Carr’s complaints stem from Kimmel’s recent monologue in which he addressed the killing of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk by saying:

Many in Maga land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.

Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump earlier this year, said Kimmel’s comments were “truly sick” and that ABC had violated its “public interest” broadcast obligations. ABC’s suspension of the show also came after Nexstar Media, one of the US’s largest owners of TV stations, said it “strongly object[ed]” to Kimmel’s comments and would pre-empt, or halt, any of the show’s episodes set to air on its stations “for the foreseeable future”.

Meanwhile, the conservative TV conglomerate Sinclair announced it would run a tribute to Kirk during Kimmel’s time slot on Friday. It also called on Kimmel to issue a formal apology and make a personal donation to Kirk’s family and his rightwing political advocacy group, Turning Point USA.

Overnight, calls to boycott ABC and Disney emerged, with Nelini Stamp, organizing director of the pro-labor union political group Working Families Party, sharing a viral boycott resource guide online that says:

Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t suspended because of what he said. He was suspended because the FCC threatened his employer. That’s state-sanctioned censorship and it is a giant red flag … Authoritarianism isn’t coming, it’s already here. Today it’s Jimmy. Tomorrow it’s the rest of us.

A Los Angeles protester charged with assaulting a border patrol agent in June was acquitted on Wednesday after US immigration officials were accused in court of lying about the incident.

The not guilty verdict for Brayan Ramos-Brito is a major setback for the Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in southern California and for Gregory Bovino, a border patrol chief who has become a key figure in Trump’s immigration crackdown. The 29-year-old defendant, who is a US citizen, was facing a misdemeanor and was the first protester to go to trial since demonstrations against immigration raids erupted in LA earlier this summer.

Border patrol and prosecutors alleged that Ramos-Brito struck an agent during a chaotic protest on 7 June in the south Los Angeles county city of Paramount outside a complex where the Department of Homeland Security has an office. But footage from a witness, which the Guardian published days after the incident, showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito. The footage did not capture the demonstrator assaulting the officer.

The jury delivered its not guilty verdict after a little over an hour of deliberations, the Los Angeles Times reported. Bovino testified earlier in the day and faced a tough cross-examination from public defenders.

Bovino was one of four border patrol agents who testified as witnesses, but was the only one to say he saw the alleged assault by Ramos-Brito, according to the LA Times. Videos played in court captured the agent shoving Ramos-Brito, sending him flying backward, and showed the protester marching back toward the agent, the paper reported. The videos did not capture Ramos-Brito’s alleged assault.

There were multiple factual discrepancies in DHS’s internal reports on the protest, which initially led to charges against five demonstrators, the Guardian reported in July. A criminal complaint suggested Ramos-Brito and others had attacked agents in protest of the arrests of two sisters, but records showed the women had been arrested in a separate incident that occurred after Ramos-Brito’s arrest.

A supervisor later documented the correct timeline and “apologized” for errors, records showed.

DC Democrat challenges long-serving House delegate amid age concerns

Chris Stein

Washington DC’s long-serving delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton is under renewed pressure to step down after a city council member announced on Thursday he would challenge her in next year’s election, saying the federal district needs its “strongest fighters” as it faces unprecedented interference from Donald Trump and the Republican party.

Robert White’s decision to jump into the race for the non-voting role in the House of Representatives comes amid mounting concern over the 88-year-old Norton’s ability to continue doing the job at a tense moment for the city.

Trump in August ordered a temporary federal takeover of the Washington DC police department and dispatched national guard and federal agents onto its streets to fight what he called an “out-of-control” crime wave, a claim city leaders disputed.

In a video announcing his candidacy, White, an at-large council member who made an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2022, referred to Norton as “our lion on the Hill” but implied it was time for new leadership.

“I have never seen my city more vulnerable than we are right now, and in this entire Congress, there is one person whose job it is to protect and stand up for our residents, and we need our strongest fighters,” said White. “I’m ready to take this torch.”

The announcement comes days after Donna Brazile, a former chief of staff to Norton who rose to serve as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that she should not seek a 19th term in the office she has held since 1991.

Though not allowed to cast votes in the House, Norton was known as a tenacious advocate for the rights of the federal district, but has appeared subdued in recent years.

She had been pictured requiring the help of an aide at public appearances, and reads haltingly from prepared remarks at committee appearances, even when the topic concerns contentious proposals to change Washington DC’s laws.

Representatives Don Bacon and Ro Khanna plan to introduce bipartisan legislation that would exempt coffee products from any tariffs imposed after 19 January, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing a copy of the draft legislation.

The exemption would apply to roasted and decaffeinated coffee, as well as coffee husks, skins, and other drinks or substitutes containing coffee, the report said.

Republican Bacon and Khanna, who is a Democrat, said they focused on coffee because they want to help Americans save on a daily staple, according to the report.

“Why are we tariffing American citizens on something that we don’t even grow? It doesn’t make sense,” Bacon told the newspaper. Representatives for Bacon, Khanna and the White House did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Coffee is one of the items that are keeping food prices in the United States persistently high since the Trump administration applied a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports at the end of July, including green coffee.

Prices for arabica coffee, the mild variety mostly used by coffee chains such as Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, have since jumped around 50% at the Intercontinental Exchange in New York. Brazil used to supply a third of all the coffee used in the US, but shipments have dried up since the tariffs were imposed.

Opening summary

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with news that Donald Trump suggested on Thursday that TV networks which cover him “negatively” could be punished by the government after his celebration of ABC suspending late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.

On Air Force One, the president spoke to reporters on his flight back to the US from his state visit to the UK. The president said major US networks were “97% against me”, though he did not offer evidence to prove this figure or detail how this conclusion was evaluated. He said he read the statistic “someplace”.

“Again, 97% negative, and yet I won easily. I won all seven swing states,” Trump said. “They give me only bad press. I mean they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their licenses should be taken away.”

The president’s claim that US TV networks need to be licensed by the government to operate is, however, incorrect. While local TV stations do require a license from the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC says clearly on its website that it does “not license TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox)”.

Trump supported ABC’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, saying that the comedian was “not a talented person” who “had very bad ratings”.

“Well, Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,” Trump told reporters during his state visit to the United Kingdom, adding “they should have fired him a long time ago”.

According to Nielsen ratings as reported by LateNighter, although Stephen Colbert’s Late Show leads the time slot in total viewers with 2.42 million, Kimmel’s show averaged 1.77 million viewers in the second quarter of 2025 and edged out Colbert in the key 18-49 demographic.

However, there was an 11% drop-off in his show’s viewership the last month. Kimmel also has over 20 million subscribers on YouTube.

In other developments:

Barack Obama condemned what he called a “dangerous” escalation by the Trump administration over the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show. “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like,” Obama wrote on X.

The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show. Boycott calls grew after ABC announced it would indefinitely suspend the popular show following complaints from the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr.

Kamala Harris watched mortified as her running mate, Tim Walz, fell into JD Vance’s trap in last year’s vice-presidential debate and “fumbled” a crucial answer, she writes in a campaign memoir. The former Democratic presidential nominee also admits that Walz had not been her first choice for vice-president in her book 107 Days, obtained by the Guardian ahead of its publication next week.

The Trump administration asked the US supreme court to allow it to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, as it continues its extraordinary attack on the central bank’s independence. In a filing on Thursday, Donald Trump’s officials requested an emergency order to remove Cook from the Fed’s board of governors, after an appeals court refused to go along with efforts to oust her.

Donald Trump accused Vladimir Putin of letting him down in a joint press conference with Keir Starmer during which the US president piled criticism on his Russian counterpart. Trump said he had hoped to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine soon after entering office, but that Putin’s actions had prevented him from doing so.

Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, has been appointed as the new CEO and chair of the board for Turning Point USA. The organization announced on Thursday that the late CEO and co-founder of Turning Point USA, who was shot and killed at an event last week, had previously expressed that he would want his wife to lead in the event of his death.

On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed into law a massive, partisan budget bill: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). This bill—which congressional Republicans passed—makes devastating cuts to programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that help Americans meet their basic needs while giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy.1 The OBBBA—combined with other changes to the Affordable Care Act enacted by the president and congressional Republicans—will leave 15 million more people without health insurance and cause about 4 million people to have their food assistance terminated or cut substantially.2

However, the harmful impacts of the law don’t stop there. The new law provides an unprecedented increase in funding to implement the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda with zero accountability, after congressional Republicans rejected multiple requests to amend the bill to place checks on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) use of these funds.3 The law provides $45 billion—available through fiscal year 2029—to dramatically expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity to 100,000 beds.4 Additionally, the law appropriates nearly $30 billion for ICE personnel and enforcement operations.5 It pushes ICE’s overall annual budget of around $9.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $28 billion.6 The OBBBA will nearly triple ICE’s budget with this infusion of additional funding while taking away valuable support for vulnerable populations, including more than $1 trillion in cuts to medical care for children, the elderly, and disabled people.7 Even prior to the OBBBA, ICE and its contractors have operated without sufficient accountability and oversight.8 This funding increase will only enhance the Trump administration’s cruel immigration actions without making Americans safer.

The OBBBA will nearly triple ICE’s budget with this infusion of additional funding while taking away valuable support for vulnerable populations.

In response to the Trump administration’s arbitrary demand that DHS arrest 3,000 immigrants per day, ICE has operated with impunity.9 The administration has essentially dismantled congressionally created watchdog agencies that provided oversight of DHS, including monitoring immigration detention and ensuring the protection of detainees’ civil rights.10 Unless Congress steps up and demands accountability for the slush fund, DHS under the Trump administration now has at its disposal the additional funding provided by the OBBBA. This funding will be used to further escalate the Trump administration’s unprecedented and indiscriminate deportation agenda that separates families, detains students and children, and terrorizes communities. Although we are already seeing the effects of the administration’s cruel, anti-immigrant policies, the full extent of the economic and human impact on families and communities will only multiply as these funds are expended.

A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law, reflect our values, and strengthen the American economy and local communities.

Giving the Trump administration a slush fund for ICE to operate above the law and arrest anyone—even those who have contributed to our country for years and pose no threat—is not the answer to secure the border and fix our broken immigration system. A secure border is mandatory for a functioning, efficient immigration system, but an actual solution to fix what’s broken must also respect due process and the rule of law, reflect our values, and strengthen the American economy and local communities.11

The frightening and wide-ranging use of the OBBBA funds

The OBBBA appropriates nearly $30 billion to massively increase ICE’s deportation force through the hiring and training of an unprecedented number of new ICE officers.12 These funds will also go toward bonuses for signing, performance, and retention as well as expanding transportation and information technology to support immigration enforcement operations.13 This increased funding will cause further harm in communities across the United States by turbocharging ICE’s ability to operate with impunity on a massive, countrywide scale.

Rampant and reckless targeting of immigrants

Despite campaign promises pledging to focus on deporting criminals, under the Trump administration, ICE has recklessly targeted hardworking immigrants to meet extreme arrest quotas rather than prioritizing removal of people who pose a genuine threat to public safety.14 ICE personnel—frequently masked and unidentified—have arrested pregnant women; high school students; a grandmother gardening outside her home; and people who are trying to comply with the law by reporting for routine ICE check-ins or appearing at scheduled court hearings.15 Officials have detained members of religious groups, including a Florida pastor who has been in the U.S. for 20 years and Iranian Christian asylum seekers.16 Even U.S. citizens are getting caught up in the immigration enforcement dragnet, with reports of them being wrongfully detained by ICE and sometimes kept in detention facilities.17

ICE personnel—frequently masked and unidentified—have arrested pregnant women; high school students; a grandmother gardening outside her home; and people who are trying to comply with the law by reporting for routine ICE check-ins or appearing at scheduled court hearings.

In carrying out arbitrary arrests and detentions while masked and unidentifiable, ICE is stoking fear in communities across the country.18 By greatly increasing funding for ICE operations with no checks, the OBBBA will turbocharge this reckless campaign against immigrants and Americans, increasing fear without any meaningful improvements to the safety and security of our nation.

Massive expansion of unaccountable immigrant detention

The OBBBA also materializes the Trump administration’s plan to spend a staggering $45 billion to expand ICE’s immigration detention capacity.19 These detention centers will include facilities to detain families with children under conditions that are not appropriate for children, despite the well-documented detrimental impacts that such detention can have on children’s well-being.20 The additional funding will magnify the horrific conditions that characterize immigrant detention under the second Trump administration and have already contributed to multiple deaths.21 This includes detention centers in extreme locations such as the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, where detainees reported a “lack of access to water, inadequate food and denial of religious rights.”22

ICE is also considering reopening shuttered prisons across the U.S. to increase its detention capacity.23 Some private entities are already cashing in at the expense of the immigrants who are kept at detention centers in inhumane conditions.24 For example, Acquisition Logistics Company, with no significant experience managing large-scale federal projects, was awarded a $1.26 billion contract to build a massive 5,000 bed immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss—an Army base in the Texas desert—to house single adults, raising serious concerns about the welfare of those who will be detained there.25 The reason as to why this small company that apparently does not even have a functioning website won the contract to build and operate “the nation’s largest immigration detention complex” is a mystery, allegedly prompting at least one competitor to file a complaint.26

The additional funding will magnify the horrific conditions that characterize immigrant detention under the second Trump administration and have already contributed to multiple deaths.

Given that nearly 90 percent of immigrants in ICE custody are held in private facilities operated by for-profit corporations—such as GEO Group and CoreCivic—that multiple reports found have insufficient oversight, the tens of billions of dollars in new detention funding will likely be a financial benefit to private companies.27 In addition to increased profits from expanded immigration detention facilities, GEO Group could also greatly benefit from the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts via the expanded use of an ankle-monitor tracking program entirely run by one of GEO Group’s subsidiaries.28 GEO Group has a track record of supporting pro-Trump Super PACs, according to an analysis of the Trump campaign’s finances.29 In addition, months before the OBBBA was enacted, CoreCivic was keeping its investors informed about communications the company was having with the administration.30 Expanding private prisons and ankle-monitor tracking will thus serve as a windfall to the Trump administration’s wealthy supporters on top of the tax breaks included in the OBBBA that benefit the rich while harming vulnerable Americans.31

More authoritarian and lawless immigration enforcement activities

As part of its mass deportation efforts, the Trump administration has already violated due process and disrespected court orders.32 The OBBBA’s massive influx of funding will enable the Trump administration to intensify these actions that flout rights and upend democratic values. Expanding ICE’s personnel and resources without sufficient guardrails will likely lead to further abuses, such as detaining foreign students for exercising free speech; targeting people who show up for their hearings at immigration courts; detaining foreign journalists for covering protests; and racial profiling.33

In September 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed a federal district court’s ruling that granted a temporary restraining order blocking ICE from conducting operations in Los Angeles.34 The district court said these operations were likely done with improper reliance upon race, ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, or type of work to target people to detain.35 The Supreme Court’s stay allows ICE to resume arrests of people they suspect are undocumented based on their appearance, the language they speak, and their type of work, paving the way for more indiscriminate arrests and detention.36 In a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted, “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”37 The Supreme Court’s ruling opens the door for ICE to rely on racial stereotypes and target anyone who “is perceived as Latino,” putting Latino and other immigrant communities, including U.S. citizens, at risk of unconstitutional seizure and detention during immigration enforcement activities.38

We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job – Justice Sonia Sotomayor

In addition to expanding unaccountable funding to fuel the administration’s racial profiling, the OBBBA fails to hold the Trump administration to account for its authoritarian attacks on other independent branches of government. These attacks have included restricting members of Congress from conducting unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities, which they have a right to do under federal law.39 The Trump administration has also attacked the separation of powers by filing a lawsuit against all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland over court orders slowing deportations, which was thrown out and founded to be “potentially calamitous” by a federal judge appointed by President Trump.40

The OBBBA funds could also be used by the Trump administration to continue to rapidly deport immigrants without due process, such as what occurred when the administration deported more than 200 migrants, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison, CECOT.41 Multiple courts, including conservative judges, have ruled deporting migrants without due process unlawful.42 And, as ICE operations expand across the country, the Trump administration could continue to utilize the National Guard as part of its immigration enforcement efforts, further endangering civil-military relations.43 In June 2025, the administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles to support federal immigration officials, a move a federal judge later ruled illegal.44 National Guard members have also been seen appearing alongside ICE agents to lend support to the Trump administration’s authoritarian power grab in Washington, D.C., spreading fear in local immigrant communities.45

One current ICE employee told The Atlantic that pressure to increase the number of deportations has led supervisors at the agency to keep agents off of new cases involving drugs, human trafficking, and child exploitation in order to be able to continue “arresting gardeners.”

Many ICE employees are also feeling burned out and morally conflicted due to the Trump administration’s focus on expanding mass deportations at the expense of keeping American communities safe from serious crimes.46 For example, one current ICE employee told The Atlantic that pressure to increase the number of deportations has led supervisors at the agency to keep agents off of new cases involving drugs, human trafficking, and child exploitation in order to be able to continue “arresting gardeners.”47 Moreover, former ICE officials worry that by receiving increased funding to rapidly hire agents, while simultaneously lowering its hiring standards, ICE will open the door to extremist candidates.48

Each of these unwise policies and actions demonstrate why the OBBBA’s huge expansion of ICE’s funding for the Trump administration to use unchecked is likely to have negative consequences for our democracy and the rule of law.

Inappropriate use of other law enforcement agencies for expanded interior enforcement

The OBBBA also provides more than $6 billion in funds to hire, train, and provide bonuses for Border Patrol agents, which sets the stage for expanding the agency’s involvement in immigration enforcement activities far beyond the border.49 Using a provision that allows DHS to deploy up to 100 miles from any external U.S. boundary, including the coastline, Border Patrol agents have recently conducted immigration enforcement actions in the interior of the country—far away from the southern border—including in New York City.50 The Trump administration could use the funds provided in the OBBBA for hiring new personnel to greatly increase the Border Patrol’s involvement in these interior immigration enforcement operations, further encroaching on places where up to two-thirds of Americans live.51

Finally, the Trump administration is forcing federal law enforcement officials from other agencies to abandon their respective missions to support its cruel and unnecessary mass deportation efforts. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and the U.S. Marshals Service are being enlisted to help DHS detain undocumented immigrants through at least the end of the year.52 This move harms national security by pulling these officials away from their efforts to keep Americans safe from drugs, guns, and violent crime.53 In addition, the administration ordered the FBI to assign more agents to assist ICE’s operations.54 The FBI has subsequently begun to reassign agents back from immigration to focus on counterterrorism citing insufficient resources to pursue terrorism and cyber threats.55 The reckless reassignment of federal law enforcement personnel across multiple agencies from their essential duties further demonstrates how the Trump administration is disregarding real national security priorities at the expense of driving its extreme mass deportation efforts.

The impact of the Trump administration’s cruel enforcement operations on people and the economy

The OBBBA funds will exacerbate the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that are causing fear and will further impact the economy and communities across the United States. These impacts will be broad since immigrants are interwoven in our communities and are not a monolith, as they can be workers, caregivers, business owners, consumers, and other community members.

Major industries are adversely impacted by raids

Reckless deportation efforts—including work site raids—will drain America’s workforce, hitting critical industries such as agriculture and construction that rely on undocumented labor. In agriculture, where undocumented immigrants make up an estimated 45 percent of the workforce, increased worksite raids such as those across California’s Central Coast and San Joaquin valley are driving workers to stay home out of fear.56 Cherry farmers in Oregon and Washington are seeing unharvested crops—and potential financial losses—mirroring challenges farms face nationwide.57 Eventually Americans will feel this impact in their pockets. A study found that deporting 8.3 million undocumented immigrant workers could lead to a more than 10 percent increase in agricultural prices over the next decade.58 This additional burden threatens further financial devastation on families who already feel squeezed by high grocery prices, particularly as the president’s tariffs push items such as coffee, beef, fresh fruit, and vegetables to all-time high prices.59

Furthermore, a CAP study from 2021 estimated that there are nearly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants who are working in construction.60 These raids will worsen the labor shortage in construction, a field which has already been facing a deficit of 200,000 to 400,000 workers every month over the past decade.61 The industry is also losing workers with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), many of whom have legally lived in the United States for decades but now face deportation after President Trump ended protections for TPS recipients from several countries.62

The OBBBA funds will exacerbate the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that are causing fear and will further impact the economy and communities across the United States.

Without these workers, housing and infrastructure projects will be delayed, driving up housing costs for American families who already face daunting home prices and interest rates.63 Recent raids on construction sites in states such as Florida, Louisiana, and Texas have stalled housing and infrastructure projects with workers afraid to show up for fear of detention.64

Small businesses suffer from retreating customer base

Fear of immigration raids echoes through local economies and small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of local economies and communities. They buy goods and services from local vendors; inspire innovation; create jobs; and contribute tax dollars that support schools and public safety.65 When these businesses are disrupted, owners may be forced to lay off employees or cut worker hours, leading to less spending and ripple effects across local economies.66

While immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, small businesses across California, Wisconsin, and Maryland have reported drops in sales as immigrant families stay home—afraid to shop or go to work for fear of detention.

While immigrants contributed an estimated $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, small businesses across California, Wisconsin, and Maryland have reported drops in sales as immigrant families stay home—afraid to shop or go to work for fear of detention.67 One restaurant owner in Los Angeles said the recent ICE raids were “hurting everybody’s business … It’s worse than COVID.”68 Restaurant workers across California, Texas, and Pennsylvania have been arrested and detained in worksite raids, exacerbating the fear.69 In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and parts of Massachusetts, some businesses have seen revenues fall by 50 percent, leaving small business owners concerned for their future.70 As one business owner in Milwaukee put it:

It’s unknown what will happen to my shop that I’ve worked so hard to have for 27 years. I’m concerned for my family, my kids, grandkids and community.71

In Nebraska, small businesses were still struggling a month after a large immigration raid.72 Additionally, areas with a high number of Latino immigrants have been hit the hardest with families staying home and cutting back on groceries.73 These ripple effects show that the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies undermine small businesses that anchor local economies. As sales fall and workers lose hours, entire neighborhoods feel the strain, threatening jobs, public revenue, and long-term stability of communities.

Family separation

Beyond the economic impact, raids devastate communities and tear apart families. Communities are witnessing silent streets, empty stores, and families canceling celebrations.74 Additionally, during the school year, schools recorded an increase of student absences due to immigration raids.75 In Los Angeles, between June 6 and June 22, more than 1,600 people were detained in car washes, clothing wholesalers, and outside of Home Depots—where day laborers gather to find work—sending shockwaves through the community.76 Increased raids are ensnaring long time immigrants and tearing families apart. In Michigan, Jose Guadalupe Jaimes, a father and small business owner who lived in the United States for 30 years, was detained outside his son’s school.77 In California, Narcisco Barranco, father of three U.S. Marines, was violently detained despite having lived in the country for decades.78

Beyond the economic impact, raids devastate communities and tear apart families. Communities are witnessing silent streets, empty stores, and families canceling celebrations.

Among those impacted by increased immigration enforcement are American children with immigrant parents who are separated from their families.79 While some follow their parents to their country of origin, others stay in the United States, living with family members while they wait to be reunited with their parents.80 Cases like these show how the OBBBA’s blank check to the Trump administration’s deportation force will escalate indiscriminate immigration raids, leaving deep scars on families, communities, and the American economy. As Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami recently warned:

[A] mass deportation campaign, which this legislation funds, will prove detrimental to the future of our nation, as long-term residents with U.S.-citizen children who work hard and contribute to our economy and culture will be removed. This does not serve the long-term interests and the values of our country.81

Conclusion

While the OBBBA funnels unprecedented funds to supercharge deportation and detention activities without any guardrails, it cuts funds for agencies and programs designed to help strengthen public safety, such as funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and community violence intervention programs.82 The OBBBA is also putting millions of Americans at risk of losing access to basic and lifesaving health care services and gutting services for children.83 In addition, under the OBBBA, taxpayer dollars are poised to line the pockets of the wealthy, such as private prison companies, some of which have donated repeatedly to President Trump’s campaign.84

The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant actions have already illustrated what is to come, harming local economies and communities. This overreach of power should terrify not only immigrants directly affected but also all Americans. The OBBBA boosts ICE’s funding without guardrails to create a slush fund for President Trump to abuse—and this does not make us safer. Instead of further fueling the Trump administration’s harmful immigration actions, the American public needs a new system that respects due process and the rule of law, prioritizes public safety, grows the economy, and makes communities safer.85 Actually fixing the immigration system will ensure high economic benefits for the United States, better competitive advantage, and an overall stronger country.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/ICESlushFundReport-2219519292.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 10:57:01.951449

Oliver-Barker Vormawor said the deportees had not violated any Ghanaian law, and their detention in a military camp was therefore illegal.

The government has not yet commented on the law suit, but has previously said that it plans to accept another 40 deportees. Opposition MPs are demanding the immediate suspension of the deportation deal until parliament ratifies it, saying this was required under Ghanaian law.

Last week, Ghana's President John Mahama said that 14 deportees of West African origin had arrived in the country following an agreement reached with the US.

He later said that all of them had been returned to their countries of origin, though Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa contradicted him by saying that only most of them had been returned.

Mr Vormawor's court application contradicts both of them, saying that 11 deportees are still in detention in Ghana.

The 11 were held in a US detention facility before being shackled and deported in a military cargo aircraft, according to papers filed in court.

The deportations are part of the US government's hard-line approach towards immigration since President Donald Trump took office in January.

He has vowed to conduct record-level deportations of migrants in the country illegally.

Dominic Cascianihome and legal correspondent and

Will Vernonin Paris

An Eritrean man has left the UK under the government's ""one in, one out"" deal with France, after a last-minute court bid to delay the departure failed.

The Home Office tightened rules around human trafficking claims to win Thursday's case - the first time ministers won a legal challenge that led to an immediate removal under the scheme.

Earlier this week, the removal of another migrant was temporarily blocked, though later an Indian national did become the first person to be sent to France under the pilot scheme, in a case without a legal challenge.

The UK and France have agreed a year-long scheme of exchanges of migrants to deter small boat crossings - although three more boats were seen leaving France on Friday morning as winds eased.

The man was accompanied by Home Office officials on an Air France flight from Heathrow Airport and handed over to police in Paris.

He told BBC News he felt ""very bad"" to be back in France and he did not know what he would do now before being led away to a different part of the airport.

French officials told the BBC he would be taken to a migrant accommodation centre. Under French rules, he will have eight days to either claim asylum in France or return to his home country.

The ""one in, one out"" deal is intended to deter people from turning to smugglers to cross the Channel because of the risk they could be sent back.

It proposes that, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will be allowed to come in return, the first of whom is expected in the coming days.

Trade Secretary Peter Kyle told BBC Breakfast this week's removals were ""the first steps and we will be ramping up from here"".

But he refused to comment on how many people the UK hoped to remove, saying: ""We're not going to put a number that would cap our ability to get a grip on this situation.""

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's removal of two migrants under the returns deal was ""pathetic"" and that ""boasting about it is absurd"".

""Hundreds of illegal immigrants crossed the Channel today alone and Labour want applause for removing just two - both of whom will be replaced,"" he said.

The Eritrean man removed on Friday arrived in England on a small boat in August, and told an emergency High Court hearing he had fled his home in 2019 because of forced conscription.

He said he spent time in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Libya before coming to Europe, where he slept rough in France before making his way to Dunkirk.

His removal is legally far more significant for the government's strategy than the failure on Tuesday to win permission for a flight to leave.

In that case, a 25-year-old Eritrean man won a temporary reprieve because the Home Office slavery assessment team, who rejected his case, said he could make further representations.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood then told officials to make clear that anyone who has been turned down for protection as a victim of slavery could continue their claim after being put on a flight to a safe country.

That saw the court rule there was no reason to stop Friday's removal flight. The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, said France was a safe country abiding by the same safeguards as the UK under the European Convention of Human Rights.

He said there was no evidence that a migrant sent there would be treated unfairly - and if he were, he had a legal route to return to the UK by continuing his claim from there.

The ruling was in stark contrast to the failed £700m Rwanda plan under the last government, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the African country could not be considered to be safe at all, because of human rights abuses.

The judge then added that it was in the public interest for the flight to depart because it was part of a policy to disrupt criminal smuggling gangs who were posing a serious risk to life.

His ruling strengthened the Home Office's hand, after a separate unreported case concerning a stateless Palestinian fighting removal.

In its first two years, Operation Lone Star resulted in 340,000 immigrant detentions, over 23,000 criminal arrests, and 355 million doses of fentanyl seized.
Moreover, if SB4 — the law currently blocked — were to take effect, local sheriffs would be required to cooperate with federal immigration agents.
Civil rights organizations have expressed concerns about the new version of Lone Star.
“Under the current president, I don’t anticipate any resistance or lawsuits from the federal government against Texas over immigration enforcement,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch.","Operation Lone Star began as Texas’ strategy to curb migrant crossings at the southern border during Joe Biden’s presidency. Four years later, it has become a detention machine that reinforces the immigration crackdown launched under the Donald Trump administration. Now, under what several experts are calling Lone Star 2.0, Texas has taken on a role that normally belongs to the federal government: so far this year, more than 3,100 undocumented migrants have been arrested by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).

“Constitutionally, it’s very clear that immigration law is a federal matter, not a state matter. The difference here is that Texas isn’t interfering with the wishes of the current president,” explains immigration attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch.

During Biden’s term, Texas faced federal lawsuits for trying to manage immigration on its own. Courts blocked the state from placing barbed-wire buoys in the Rio Grande and struck down SB4, a law that authorized local police to detain and deport people suspected of being in the country illegally.

However, under Trump, that federal opposition disappeared. As a result, the Texas government, led by Republican and Trump ally Greg Abbott, has intensified its operations and begun acting with near-total freedom.

According to official records obtained by The Texas Tribune, nearly 700 of the 3,131 arrests made by the DPS this year took place in cities like Austin, Dallas, and Houston — hundreds of miles from the border. Lone Star is no longer just a border issue. With Trump back in the White House, “any immigration enforcement actions the state can or wants to take are now welcomed by the White House,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is currently running for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives.

The original initiative

Operation Lone Star has been one of the most expensive operations in U.S. history, costing nearly $11 billion to date, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national organization that provides legal training and advocates for immigration policy reform. That amount is more than double Texas’ usual annual budget for its public university system and exceeds the combined budget the state allocates for child healthcare, housing subsidies, and rural community development. Although exact figures for Lone Star 2.0 are not yet available, the operation is likely to increase spending significantly — for example, to fund DPS special units deployed across the state.

In its first two years, Operation Lone Star resulted in 340,000 immigrant detentions, over 23,000 criminal arrests, and 355 million doses of fentanyl seized. A statement from Governor Abbott’s office at the time said the goal was to “secure the border; stop the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people into Texas; and prevent, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity between ports of entry.” The statement also boasted that the operation had transported more than 9,100 immigrants to Washington, D.C., more than 4,900 to New York City, over 1,500 to Chicago, and more than 840 to Philadelphia in just a few months. Texas was essentially dumping arriving migrants in cities run by Democrats.

However, a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) revealed that most arrests involved people with minor offenses. The program “spends billions of dollars to racially profile and arrest people who pose no threat to public safety, then forces them into a separate and unequal legal system run by the state,” the ACLU said.

“The immigrant community sees DPS as equivalent to ICE”

Traditionally, the Texas Department of Public Safety focused on public safety issues, such as traffic accidents. Now, much of its resources are devoted to immigration enforcement. Immigration attorney Pedro López considers it dangerous that this agency has effectively taken on the role of deporting people from the country. “For citizens, it’s an imminent danger to have state police directly involved in these arrests without oversight. Officers who make arrests can be subject to lawsuits for violating civil rights,” López points out.

Attorney Lincoln-Goldfinch points out that “the problem with state police or state law enforcement officers collaborating, cooperating, or enforcing immigration enforcement is that it destroys the relationship between the immigrant community and state law enforcement.” According to the attorney, the community now “sees DPS as equivalent to ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], and so they will flee. They will refuse to talk to or cooperate with DPS because they perceive it as a danger. That breaks the relationship between law enforcement and the immigrant community, which is very large in Texas, and harms public safety for everyone,” she adds.

Moreover, if SB4 — the law currently blocked — were to take effect, local sheriffs would be required to cooperate with federal immigration agents. “This essentially turns Texas into an immigration police state,” Lincoln-Goldfinch warns.

Civil rights organizations have expressed concerns about the new version of Lone Star. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center said it was misallocating resources that should be directed toward meeting Texans’ basic needs. The ACLU, for its part, has questioned the operation’s lack of transparency. In a recent report, the organization noted that DPS data do not match court records and that in many cases there is no clarity about what happens to people once they leave state custody. It also said the operation undermines the immigrant community’s trust in authorities and creates a “separate and unequal” system that allows DPS to act as an immigration enforcement force without sufficient judicial oversight.

“Under the current president, I don’t anticipate any resistance or lawsuits from the federal government against Texas over immigration enforcement,” says Lincoln-Goldfinch. “On the contrary, the only thing expected is cooperation.” She is also concerned that other states may implement similar programs, particularly because “the more Republican states do this, the more it will be welcomed by the Trump administration.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/BBWGSE2ZAUMZ3CYS3FKQG4TJOM.jpg?auth=6d6b5c10ae86010a64bac4f2aafab59846bef448bed5bdd2b5cfd6630648a3f5&width=1200,N,,2025-09-19 10:57:56.994389

Shadow hearings, unofficial congressional hearings typically held by the minority party when the majority party refuses to hold an official one, have been utilized by Democrats more frequently in the Trump administration. Thursday's hearing was Jayapal’s third time holding one.

Rep. Jayapal began the day’s hearing, titled “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Assault Destroys U.S. Families and Communities,” by saying, “Donald Trump lied to the American people. He lied when he said he would bring grocery prices down. He lied when he said he would release the Epstein files. And he sure as hell lied when it came to immigration enforcement.”

Jayapal said that even though Trump said he would focus on “deporting the worst of the worst” and “serious national security threats,” immigration officials are “targeting everyone that they think they might be able to deport, including veterans, farmworkers, green-card holders, students and U.S. citizens.” She said, “The American people see right through this deception and lies.”

Chelsea White, a witness from Nashville, tearfully recounted the events leading up to the deportation of her husband, Hilario Martinez Garzia, whom she described as a “devoted husband and father.”

“For 25 years, Tennessee was his home, where he built a life and contributed to his community,” White said. White said she and her husband were pulled over in what she thought was a normal DUI stop when they were quickly surrounded by officers and separated, with no information about where he was being taken.

“Driving home alone, four months pregnant and in shock, was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I kept thinking, ‘How am I going to explain this to our kids?’ Hilario had never spent a single night away from us. How do you prepare yourself to do it all alone?” White asked, adding that no one told her where her husband, who suffers from high blood pressure, was being detained for a week. And she didn’t know if he had his medication. After he was eventually deported to Mexico, White said she sold everything she could and took their three children, all of whom are U.S. citizens, with her to join him “in an unfamiliar country.”

“Families belong together without being forced to choose between love and survival,” White said.

Mimi Lettunich and her husband are currently caring for the four young children of her friend, a Canadian national, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a picnic in June. Despite the fact that the children all have American citizenship, Lettunich testified at the hearing that Customs and Border Patrol officials “expedited passports to send children out of the United States, their country of birth,” interrogated them without their parents, threatened them with foster care and separated them from each other.

Janessa Goldbeck, a former U.S. Marine and CEO of a military family nonprofit, criticized the administration for “turning the National Guard and active duty military into an immigration police force,” which she said “dishonors their oath and corrupts their mission. The Guard exists to protect Americans in times of crisis, flood, fires and war — not to police families on our streets. Misusing them this way erodes readiness, wastes taxpayer dollars, and endangers the freedoms every service member swore to defend.”

Trump, along with his border czar Tom Homan, vowed to carry out “the biggest deportation this country has ever seen” upon taking office.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250918-Pramila-Jayapal-2023-ac-452p-261878.jpg",N,,2025-09-19 10:57:07.026232

For instance, back in June 2022, the European Court of Human Rights grounded a flight which was deporting asylum seekers (in the eyes of many, illegal migrants) from Britain to Rwanda under a “migration partnership” between the two governments.
The current legal settlement tends to prioritize individual rights over public institutions having a fundamental duty to remove threats to the safety and well-being of the wider public.

There is also a strong case for a reformed legal arrangement of “national preference.” In other words, the rights of citizens to security and social cohesion must take precedence over the claims of non-citizens.","Great Britain is facing a crisis in the English Channel. Recently, the number of unpermitted migrants crossing from France to England in small boats hit the milestone of 30,000 in record time, including over a thousand on one day in September. That is more people than live in many English villages. The political response so far has been feeble. The Labour government has vowed to dismantle the people-smuggling networks that ferry migrants, but it is wishful thinking to believe that the problem can be resolved so easily when these networks span not only countries but whole continents. The last Conservative government made similar vows, but left office without delivering.

The impasse has allowed the insurgent Reform UK led by Nigel Farage, an ally of President Donald Trump, to tap into public anxieties over porous borders. Founded less than a decade ago, the party now consistently ranks first in surveys. Reform promises to deport 600,000 migrants over its parliamentary term, to withdraw Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and to scrap the 1998 Human Rights Act (HRA) by replacing it with a “British Bill of Rights.” Critics have framed this proposal as a veiled fascist plan to take away the human rights of ordinary British citizens, pointing out that Russia and Belarus are the only non-signatories in Europe.

“The rights of citizens to security and social cohesion must take precedence.”

But the reality is that the current human-rights framework and asylum process are not fit for purpose, because they prioritize the individual rights of foreign nationals over the collective security of British citizens. The ECHR, a supranational international treaty which is incorporated into British law through the HRA, is described by critics as an obstacle to border security and public safety, both of which are the responsibility of the Home Office (the UK’s interior ministry). Against the backdrop of a worrying lack of public confidence in the judicial system, recent court rulings have revealed just how inadequate the ECHR framework is when it comes to protecting the interests of law-abiding British citizens. For instance, back in June 2022, the European Court of Human Rights grounded a flight which was deporting asylum seekers (in the eyes of many, illegal migrants) from Britain to Rwanda under a “migration partnership” between the two governments. This dramatic 11th-hour intervention seemed to vindicate those who believe the ECHR is meddling inappropriately in the political affairs of its signatories.

It was once the case that many of these concerns could be waved away with the mere accusation of “racism.” But Reform’s surging popularity should force a serious conversation about what a new human-rights framework might look like. While the details must be discussed at a societal level, there can be some clear guiding principles based on what is and is not working with the status quo. The current legal settlement tends to prioritize individual rights over public institutions having a fundamental duty to remove threats to the safety and well-being of the wider public. This means that judges often end up privileging the claims of foreign nationals, including those who have broken the law, over the collective security of law-abiding British citizens. A new framework would seek to restore balance.

There is also a strong case for a reformed legal arrangement of “national preference.” In other words, the rights of citizens to security and social cohesion must take precedence over the claims of non-citizens. This should include “protective” measures that would give public authorities not just the power but the duty to prevent crime and disorder linked to immigration and asylum. Finally, a British human rights framework would also offer the ability to adequately balance rights with responsibilities, whether it is the expectation that foreign nationals behave appropriately in the host country where they are seeking asylum, or the duty of public authorities to remove them as swiftly as possible if they fail to do so.

Leaving the ECHR comes with both political and legal risks. But doing so would make it easier for a future government to improve on a human-rights framework that is far too protective of the individual rights of foreign nationals, and does not adequately account for collective safety, social cohesion, and public order. There are no easy solutions when it comes to addressing the small-boats emergency. But politics will eventually force a radical reordering of our existing legal architecture. Internationalist governance will—and should—give way to the democratic desire for national preference.",https://api.microlink.io?url=https://www.compactmag.com/article/toward-a-national-conception-of-human-rights/&screenshot=true&meta=false&embed=screenshot.url,N,,2025-09-19 11:59:34.478405

Trump took it away.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-offered-health-insurance-access-daca-immigrants-trump-took-it-away,"A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).
Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace.
Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association.
“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.","A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

The change, announced in June, took effect at the beginning of this month. It reverses a policy change enacted by the Biden administration for last November’s annual enrollment period.

DACA, which President Barack Obama established in 2012, applies to certain immigrants who are here illegally but were brought to the U.S. as children. The program was enacted to protect them from deportation and allows them to work for renewable two-year periods. To be eligible, an immigrant must have come to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before June 15, 2007. DACA participants also must be high school graduates, high school students or veterans of the U.S. military.

The oldest are now in their early 40s, some with children of their own.

Even though there are some 525,000 active DACA recipients, only about 10,000 were getting their health insurance from the marketplaces before the policy change, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, critics of the new Trump administration rule say participation would have grown as more people became aware of their eligibility.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

DACA recipients from 19 states were blocked from the marketplaces, though, because of pending litigation. More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules, said DACA was an “abuse of executive authority” and should not have entitled some immigrants to benefits. The rule change simply restores the status quo, Vaughan said.

“It was kind of an experiment or an end run around our legal immigration system that was set up by the rules that were set up by Congress to try to offer an amnesty to this particular group,” Vaughan said. “Because it’s not a legal status, these individuals are not, under the law, eligible for certain public benefits, and one of them is subsidized health insurance.”

But critics of the change say it’s cruel to cancel health care coverage for people who were brought to the country as children.

“Health care is a fundamental human right all of us, no matter where we were born, how much money we have, what we look like, what language we speak, we should be able to access quality and affordable care when we need it,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, a policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants.

Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace. Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association. But nearly 20% lacked coverage, more than twice the national uninsured rate of 8%.

Mohyeddin said that many of the DACA recipients without coverage reported skipping recommended medical and dental appointments or declining to fill prescriptions, because they couldn’t afford it or were fearful of being targeted for their status.

“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.

While DACA recipients were only recently allowed to purchase coverage on the marketplace, it was a huge step toward better health outcomes for them, said Arline Cruz Escobar, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, a group that provides legal and social services to immigrants.

Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

“We see a lot of mixed-status households, and so I think people are just very confused about what this means for them, and what it means for their families,” Cruz Escobar said. “We already know that the immigrant community doesn’t access enough preventive care and screenings and so, I can only imagine that we will see an increase in a lot of chronic conditions, or undiagnosed chronic conditions that could have been prevented.”

The impact of the new Trump administration rule on DACA recipients will vary, as some states offer other health care options to noncitizens.

States are going to have to decide whether they can afford to offer state-subsidized health coverage to DACA recipients and other immigrants who are no longer eligible for federal help, said Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace exchange, Covered California.

California has the most DACA recipients, at 147,440. Altman said more than 2,300 of them have purchased plans on the California marketplace and will lose their coverage. She said many DACA recipients in the state were not aware of their eligibility, and more would have enrolled if the Trump administration hadn’t made the policy change.

California provides state-funded health coverage to all income-eligible immigrants, regardless of their legal status. But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a budget that scales back that coverage because of budgetary issues.

In light of federal changes and financial obligations on states, Altman said, California will have to make the same choices as other states about how or whether to help DACA recipients with their health care.

“The hard part is, to actually make coverage affordable for the populations that we’re talking about, you have to fund financial assistance at least somewhat comparable to what’s available on the federal marketplace,” Altman said. “So the state dollars are really where the rubber meets the road.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-9164056561758272795.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=2Ndl_F0m,N,,2025-09-19 11:59:38.415509

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Somalia on Thursday, a day after a resolution to formally reprimand the Minnesota Democrat and remove her from committee assignments failed in the House.
Appreciate them safeguarding first amendment protections and the usage of the censure,” Omar said on social media after the vote.
“Finally some sanity in the House.” Trump, who has gone after Omar’s Somali roots before, also hammered Somalia on Thursday.

“All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America!","President Trump slammed Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Somalia on Thursday, a day after a resolution to formally reprimand the Minnesota Democrat and remove her from committee assignments failed in the House.

“I think she’s terrible. I think she should be impeached. I think she’s terrible,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday.

“So how are they doing? How’s your government? Do they have a president? Do they have a council? Do they have anything? Do they have police? I love these people,” Trump added. “They come from a place with nothing, nothing, no, anything, and then they tell us how to run our country.”

“If she got censured, that’s great, if she got impeached, that’s even better,” he added.

Trump’s remarks about Omar, who was born in Somalia before her family came to the U.S. in the 1990s, came after the House voted to table the resolution, brought by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), to rebuke the Minnesota lawmaker. Mace alleged Omar “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder” in retweeting a video on social media.

On Wednesday, the House voted 214-213 to table the resolution. Four GOP lawmakers joined the Democrats to defeat the resolution.

“Thank you to my colleagues for having my back and not furthering lies on the House floor. Appreciate them safeguarding first amendment protections and the usage of the censure,” Omar said on social media after the vote. “Finally some sanity in the House.”

Trump, who has gone after Omar’s Somali roots before, also hammered Somalia on Thursday.

“Ilhan Omar’s Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption, and pervasive Violence,” the president wrote in a Thursday evening post on Truth Social.

Trump said that “70 percent of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity. Somalia is consistently ranked among the World’s Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement and a Dysfunctional Government.”

The Hill has reached out to Omar’s office for comment.

Trump then accused Omar of marrying her brother to get U.S. citizenship. Omar has long denied these accusations.

“It makes race itself, speaking Spanish, or looking Hispanic like a pretext for suspicion on anything now,” she said.
In one case, a citizen briefly detained by federal law enforcement agency said he was told he looked like someone the agents were looking for.
“So we’re all fearful of the worst, and that’s really what daily life is like here in Los Angeles.”","Cesar, a green card holder and student at Washington, DC’s Georgetown University, never used to think he needed to carry proof that he was allowed to be in the United States.

But that changed last week, when the Supreme Court cleared the way for a person’s ethnicity to be at least a partial factor behind immigration stops by law enforcement. “Now I have to carry it all the time,” he says.

“And that is very scary, because if I lose it, that’s a whole other process, fees, and consequences,” said Cesar, who spoke to CNN on the condition that only his first name be used.

Since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term, immigration-advocacy groups have recommended that migrants, green-card holders and non-White US citizens carry their documents as an added protection against being errantly caught up in his immigration sweeps.

It was an arduous request for people like Cesar, who feared losing the links that proved they are legally in the United States, and the fees, long waits and possible persecution that could come with misplacing their papers.

The calculus is different in the wake of the September 8 Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to continue what critics describe as “roving” immigration patrols in California, immigrants and advocates say. It’s a decision they fear endorses racial profiling by proxy and enables federal agents to make indeterminate judgements about who they think may or may not belong in the country.

Other people who spoke with CNN noted the fraught history of alleged racial profiling by law enforcement in America — from stop-and-frisk policies in several major US cities to the government’s surveillance against mosques and Muslims shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

The ruling, Cesar said, “makes what we’ve already noticed true. It just put it on paper.”

‘A show-your-papers nation’

In its emergency ruling, the conservative-majority court rejected lower courts’ rulings which said parts of Trump’s immigration operations in Southern California — which in some cases involved armed and masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling aside people who look Latino to ask if they are US citizens — violated Fourth Amendment rights.

Those rulings, now overturned, prohibited the government from detaining people to ask their status solely based on four factors: the race of the person being stopped; whether they spoke Spanish, or English with an accent; their presence at places frequented by immigrants; or their employment at jobs usually held by immigrants.

While that litigation only dealt with seven counties in Southern California, the court’s decision could be read as a green light for those types of immigration-related pre textual stops across the country — especially in cities like Chicago, DC and Boston, where the administration has directed a surge of immigration enforcement, and Memphis, where Trump says he will deploy the National Guard and law enforcement personnel from several federal agencies.

Immigration attorneys, immigrants living in the US legally and non-White US citizens now worry that innocuous activities that aren’t indicative of illegal behavior — speaking Spanish, working certain jobs or looking like someone from South or Central America — will be used as reasons for law enforcement to stop and question them.

“This is going to affect everyone, no matter whether they are an immigrant that’s documented or undocumented, or whether it’s somebody that’s a citizen,” said Jennifer Bade, a Boston-based immigration attorney. “I’m very, very concerned, because this effectively makes us a ‘show-your-papers’ nation where appearance and language is going to make everyone a suspect.”

“It just green-lit racial profiling,” she added.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, described the Supreme Court decision as a “a win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the agency, said law enforcement “will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members, and other criminal illegal aliens.”

Taking extra precautions

Andrea, a Venezuelan woman living in Washington, DC, who works as a government contractor, said “anybody that reads a basic history book can see the danger of this decision.” She also asked that CNN only use her first name.

“It makes race itself, speaking Spanish, or looking Hispanic like a pretext for suspicion on anything now,” she said. “Today it’s being Hispanic and speaking Spanish—tomorrow, what other group are they going to demonize?”

She described taking extra precautions in Washington, a city that has seen a surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard members as part of Trump’s crime crackdown in the city. Recently walking down the National Mall with friends, Andrea said: “We made it a point not to speak Spanish.”

The Supreme Court did not provide any analysis explaining their decision to overturn the lower courts’ rulings. But in a 10-page concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that in cases where legal immigrants are stopped by law enforcement, “the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.”

He also wrote: “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

In June, prior to the ramping up of immigration enforcement in several large American cities, CNN had already identified several cases of people being detained by ICE despite them describing themselves as American citizens. In one case, a citizen briefly detained by federal law enforcement agency said he was told he looked like someone the agents were looking for.

In another, a citizen said he was held against a fence by ICE agents and asked what hospital he was born in, despite him telling them three times he was an American citizen.

Some said they had been taking precautions for months, or since Trump took office, that now feel justified in light of the ruling.

Francisco Moreno, the executive director of the Los Angeles-based Council of Mexican Federations in North America and a naturalized citizen, said he has been carrying around his proof of US citizenship since wide-spread immigration raids began in that city in June.

“I’m a US citizen and I carry my citizenship card because I don’t know if they’re going to stop me at some point, ask me questions simply for being brown, for speaking Spanish, or because I’m also advocating for immigrants,” he said. “So we’re all fearful of the worst, and that’s really what daily life is like here in Los Angeles.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-gettyimages-2224603707.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-19 06:57:07.197600

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

For more than six months, the Trump administration has been trying to deport Mahmoud Khalil. He's the former Columbia University grad student who ICE agents arrested back in March when the government started cracking down on pro-Palestinian student activists. An immigration judge in Louisiana has now ordered him deported on charges that he committed fraud on his green card application. Camille's (ph) - Khalil's lawyers are promising to fight this. His case highlights how aggressively the government is continuing to try to expel foreign-born students for their political activism. For the latest, I want to bring in NPR's Adrian Florido, and Adrian, tell me a little bit more about what exactly this judge in Louisiana ruled.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Well, Mary Louise, the judge is Jamee Comans, and she ordered Khalil deported either to Algeria, where he holds a passport, or to Syria, where he was born and where he grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp. This does not mean that Khalil will be immediately deported or even soon. There's still likely a long legal fight ahead. But the judge, in ordering him deported, relied on the government's accusation that Khalil purposely left information off of his green card application last year, specifically some work that he'd done with the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians and his involvement in a pro-Palestinian activist group at Colombia. His lawyers have long said that these claims are bogus.

KELLY: And what are they saying today? How are they responding to this deportation order?

FLORIDO: Well, in a statement, Khalil said that it was no surprise. He and his lawyers have always said that these fraud charges are a pretext and that they're really targeting him for his political activism, which they say is unconstitutional. Now, the Trump administration first arrested Khalil back in March, claiming that his pro-Palestinian activism was antisemitic and that he was a Hamas terrorist sympathizer - all claims that Khalil denies and that the government has never actually provided evidence for. Now, I spoke with Baher Azmy, one of his attorneys, today.

BAHER AZMY: They're making up charges to remove him because they disagree with his dissent from U.S. foreign policy.

FLORIDO: You might remember, Mary Louise, that Khalil spent more than three months in a detention center in Louisiana before his lawyers were able to get him released on bail in June.

KELLY: I do indeed remember. OK, so timing here, you said this could be tied up in courts for a while. How quickly might he be deported?

FLORIDO: Well, it's hard to say, assuming that he is ultimately ordered, you know, deported by a court...

KELLY: Right.

FLORIDO: ...Because his lawyers are promising a long legal fight. His case is actually playing out in two different court systems - in this immigration court, where the government has been moving aggressively to try to expel him and where it has succeeded in getting this order against him this week, but also in a New Jersey federal court, where he's challenging his deportation on claims that the government is retaliating for his activism and violating his right to free speech. The judge in that federal case issued an order months ago prohibiting the government from deporting Khalil while he considers those constitutional claims, and that could take a long time. In a statement to NPR, Tricia McLaughlin, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, reiterated today the government's claims that Khalil advocated for violence and supported terrorists, and she said that he should not be in this country.

KELLY: And just briefly, Adrian, catch us up on some of the other cases. There have been quite a few other high-profile cases, pro-Palestinian student protesters detained for campus activism.

FLORIDO: Yeah, they're all in various stages of litigation. All of these students are fighting their deportations on free speech grounds. They've had a lot of success in federal courts so far, but there are big questions as the cases make their way through the federal court system. Will appeals courts ultimately protect their right to protest or allow the Trump administration to deport them?

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.

FLORIDO: Thanks, Mary Louise.

“Records indicate that detainees were held beyond the facility’s 12-hour limit or kept overnight 25 times between October 1, 2024 and July 27, 2025,” the city said in a news release, noting the latest “violation” was on May 20.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The city said it would issue its formal notice to ICE Thursday. It’s the result of an investigation conducted by the city’s permitting bureau that began in late July after the city received formal complaints.

For months, some community members have pressed Portland leaders to close the facility by revoking the land use agreement that has allowed ICE to operate since 2011 at 4310 S. Macadam Ave.

The location is not a long-term detention facility, but rather a processing center where immigration officers conduct check-ins with asylum seekers and other noncitizens.

“U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement. “I am proud of our team for conducting a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and referring the matter to the next steps in the land use violation process.”

Some Portlanders have argued that ICE is violating the conditions of the agreement, and that demonstrations outside the building are causing a hazard to nearby residents, particularly the use of chemical munitions like pepper balls. In August, a charter school that was located near the ICE facility decided to move, citing concerns about safety for its students.

The officials — including the city’s fiscal watchdog and state lawmakers — were among 77 people detained during protests at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. The government building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Eleven officials were arrested inside the building while attempting to inspect holding rooms on the 10th floor that are the subject of ongoing litigation alleging squalid conditions and overcrowding, according to a coalition of politicians, advocates and faith leaders involved in the protest. They were given summonses and released. The building was later locked down because of a telephoned bomb threat, authorities said.

The officials had gone to the holding facility to see if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was complying with a preliminary injunction issued Wednesday that requires the agency to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, among other remedies, the coalition said.

But federal agents barred them from entering the holding rooms and arrested them as news reporters and photographers documented the scene. The arrests happened as the officials were conducting a sit-in in the hallway, encircled around a sign showing a slash through the word “ICE.” Agents bound their hands with plastic ties, lined them up against a wall and paraded them down a hall.

In a statement, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin singled out the city’s comptroller, Brad Lander. She accused the Democrat of showing up “unannounced with agitators and media” and yelling that he wouldn't leave until detainees were released. Lander was previously arrested at the building in June after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain outside immigration court.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician pulling a stunt in attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees,” McLaughlin said, adding that “Lander’s obsession with attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically, must stop NOW.""

Another arrested politician, state Sen. Jabari Brisport, said immigration officials used zip ties to lock the doors to the holding areas and put duct tape over cracks to prevent them from seeing inside.

“What I saw on the 10th floor today was both disgusting and cowardly,” the Brooklyn Democrat said. After the immigration officials were finished, “they laughed, and I heard them laugh about what they were doing, and they should absolutely be ashamed of themselves.”

Outside, police arrested dozens of people, including politicians, advocates and religious leaders, who were protesting in front of a garage entrance used by vans transporting immigrants to and from the detention facility.

Other officials who were detained included the city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams; Democratic state Sen. Julia Salazar; and City Council Member Tiffany Caban.

“A federal judge has indicated that the federal law is not being followed — the conditions are cruel and inhumane, that ICE is not respecting their rights,” Lander told reporters after his release. “And no elected official or other oversight agency has been allowed in to see it.”

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction keeping in place requirements that the agency give detainees adequate space; thoroughly clean the cells three times a day; provide soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products; and make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

The injunction followed a temporary restraining order last month in the wake of a lawsuit that immigration and civil rights organizations filed on behalf of people held at the Manhattan facility. In court filings, detainees complained they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets.

According to three employees at GSA, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal operations and to avoid retribution, the agency has created an “ICE surge” team in recent weeks, referring to an effort to lease private offices to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency officers to establish long-term work space in the cities where they are operating.

Last week, the GSA’s Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for “as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement” in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the “unique” quick period of one week to submit bids.

One of the GSA employees said ICE has urgently requested the agency find around 300 fully furnished properties with private office space to lease by this winter.

The push is happening just months after the informal White House advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, fired a large number of GSA employees and terminated a huge chunk of government leases, decisions that are now being reversed in many cases in order to accommodate government procurement needs. There’s no clear evidence those cuts saved significant amounts of taxpayer money.

It’s also happening alongside a government-wide effort to divert resources towards immigration enforcement, from federal leasing efforts to law enforcement expertise from other agencies like the FBI. Limited enforcement resources, including a lack of funding to bring on more people to conduct arrests and investigations and litigate cases, have been one of the biggest challenges to scaling up the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.

Congress this summer provided ICE with $75 billion to hire more officers, expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests and deportations. The agency, which started the year with about 20,000 people, is looking to hire more than 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. The agency is offering candidates large signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars in a streamlined hiring effort that immigration policy experts and other critics fear could compromise vetting standards.

The agency is also increasing its detention capacity and launching enforcement operations across the country aimed at increasing the number of people arrested and detained. The administration has promoted large-scale operations in cities like Boston and Chicago.

The most recently available immigration detention data publicly published by ICE shows that there are 58,000 people in detention. Immigrant rights advocates have warned that the rapid expansion of arrests and detention is leading to widespread concern over human rights and due process violations for immigrants.

Public polls have increasingly shown that American voters disapprove of how ICE is carrying out its operations, particularly in places like hospitals and other “protected areas.”

Meanwhile, GSA employees are finding themselves swept into the immigration crackdown.

“It’s been incredibly chaotic,” said one of the GSA employees familiar with the new “emergency” lease project.

In addition to finding new office space to lease for ICE, the agency has also requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country. Those cities include Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, New York City, Denver, Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., Greensboro, N.C., and Fort Myers, Fla., according to a list shared with NPR. The list mentions that the properties would be used in enforcement and removal operations. In Boise, Idaho, ICE is looking to spend over a million dollars to expand an existing, leased office space, according to a permit application filed with the city uncovered in reporting by the Idaho Statesman.

The efforts are causing frustration among some GSA employees, who dealt with months of DOGE downsizing and reorganizing at the agency. Now, with around half the staff they had before the government restructuring efforts began, they’re being forced to renegotiate cancelled leases with landlords who are “increasing their rates substantially,” said one of the GSA employees.

“It’s hypocrisy at its finest,” said another GSA employee.

In a statement, a GSA spokesperson told NPR that GSA is “proud to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in fulfilling their mission to protect America. We are working closely with our agency partners to ensure they have the facilities that fit their workforce needs.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-thepublicsradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/gettyimages-2234329401-scaled.webp?fit=2560%2C1708&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-19 12:58:03.869981

While the Pentagon this year reverses those changes, the House bill would block that reversal.","WASHINGTON — Congress inched ahead with a plan to halt a Trump administration proposal to change a weapons program at Picatinny Arsenal, a military base in Morris County, a move New Jersey lawmakers said would cost jobs and money.

An amendment Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) filed to block federal funding from being used to shift the Picatinny program until the Army submits a report about its proposal was included in the House version of the annual military policy bill.

But efforts by New Jersey senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, to counter the Trump administration’s efforts to use military sites to hold and then deport undocumented immigrants are likely to fall short. And Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th) tried, also unsuccessfully, to amend the bill by blocking offshore wind projects unless the military certified they did not interfere with radar.

For weeks, both chambers of Congress, the House and Senate, have been debating, altering and voting on the annual bill that sets broad U.S. military policy — an opportunity for members to tack on amendments on issues they care about to what is considered “must-pass” legislation.

The legislation in question contains no funding but lays out Pentagon operations.

House lawmakers voted 231-196 last week to pass their version of the bill.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) and New Jersey’s three Republicans — Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th) — voted for it, while every Democrat but Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) voted against it.

A spokesman for Gottheimer did not respond to a request for comment about his vote for the bill, which has historically passed with comfortable bipartisan margins.

Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for governor, has missed multiple votes in recent months as she campaigns, though none have been on significant legislation.

The House voted down Smith’s amendment, 209 to 224, as the state delegation split along party lines, with Van Drew and Kean voting for it and Democrats voting no.

In a July letter, New Jersey members requested the Pentagon stop plans to restructure a series of Army weapons sites, including Picatinny, a munitions site known for making weapons.

“We write to you to express our grave concern over the Army’s proposed restructuring of its acquisition enterprise,” the letter said. “This would damage the Army’s ammunition acquisition efforts and would have a devastating impact on Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey where that effort is managed. There is no other DoD installation with the same uniquely experienced and qualified staff in arms and ammunition.”

The lawmakers continued: “Moving these missions to other installations would inevitably lead to reduced lethality and poorer weapons being delivered to our soldiers.”

Members sent the letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

Along with Sherrill, Booker, Kim, Van Drew and Kean, Reps. Donald Norcross (D-1st), Herb Conaway (D-3rd), Josh Gottheimer (D-5th), Frank Pallone (D-6th), Rob Menendez (D-8th), Nellie Pou (D-9th), LaMonica McIver (D-10th) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12th) signed the letter.

The Army’s proposal places at risk as much as $1 billion and 1,000 jobs at Picatinny, according to Sherrill’s office.

The Senate has not voted on its version of the military bill.

Kim tried without success to attach an amendment to allow access to government-provided legal counsel for immigrants detained on military bases. He also offered an amendment to allow members of Congress to access immigrant detention sites on military facilities and a separate amendment to block the military from work “to engage in or support immigration enforcement.”

Booker offered an amendment to require a federal report about how “military readiness” has been affected by the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

The report would include descriptions of military sites used for immigration detention; the number of people held at such sites and their demographic information; and records about aircraft the military has used for removal flights.

The Republican-majority Senate accepted none of those amendments.

The administration this summer approved the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst to hold and deport undocumented immigrants, though neither base nor administration officials have confirmed immigration activities are happening on the base.

One measure slipped into the House version would thwart an administration decision to rename Army bases after Confederate leaders.

In 2020, Congress moved to rename nine Army bases in southern states — Alabama, George, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia — named after Confederates to honor women, racial minorities and other military leaders.

While the Pentagon this year reverses those changes, the House bill would block that reversal.

Hegseth has said that “DEI is dead” at the Pentagon, using the shorthand for “diversity, equity and inclusion.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/12/Picatinny-Arsenal-sign.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 00:56:21.024859

This clarity benefits both patent owners and accused infringers by setting predictable standards for fee-shifting and sanctions in federal court.","The Federal Circuit’s recent decision in Future Link Systems, LLC v. Realtek Semiconductor Corporation offers important guidance on what it means to be a “prevailing party” and the standards for awarding attorney fees, costs, and sanctions in patent litigation. This ruling, which vacated in part, affirmed in part, and remanded the district court’s decisions, is particularly instructive when compared to other recent Federal Circuit cases addressing exceptionality and litigation misconduct.

Background

Future Link Systems, LLC filed two patent infringement suits against Realtek Semiconductor Corporation in the Western District of Texas, alleging Realtek’s integrated circuit products infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 8,099,614 and 7,685,439. The litigation involved electronic circuitry technology, a complex procedural history, including motions to dismiss, requests for sanctions, and discovery disputes.

Some of the conduct argued by Realtek to be egregious included Future Link’s agreement with third party MediaTek, Inc., where MediaTek would pay Future Link a lump sum amount if Future Link filed a lawsuit against Realtek. Notably, after Future Link voluntarily dismissed both cases, the district court converted those dismissals to dismissals with prejudice as a sanction for litigation misconduct by Future Link. However, the district court declined to find Realtek a prevailing party and, as a result, denied Realtek’s motion for attorneys’ fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 in one case and fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 in both cases.

Prevailing Party Status: The Gateway to Fees and Costs

A central issue on appeal was whether Realtek qualified as a “prevailing party” entitled to attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 and costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure § 54(d)(1). According to Supreme Court precedent:

[t]he touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.

[and]

[w]hen a plaintiff secures an enforceable judgment on the merits… that plaintiff is the prevailing party because he has received a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.

To be clear though, securing an enforceable judgment on the merits is not a predicate for achieving prevailing party status. Rather, Supreme Court precedent emphasizes that a party prevails when it successfully rebuffs the opposing party’s claims, regardless of whether the case is resolved on the merits or through procedural means.In this aspect, the court cited cases such as CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. EEOC and B.E. Technology, L.L.C. v. Facebook, Inc., reinforcing that a defendant can prevail even if the dismissal is for reasons such as mootness or lack of standing. Here, Realtek’s success in converting the dismissals to “with prejudice” ensured that Future Link could not reassert the same claims. On this basis, the Federal Circuit found that the district court’s conversion of the voluntary dismissals to dismissals with prejudice (even if not intending to do so) constituted a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship between the parties making Realtek a prevailing party.

While Realtek was deemed a prevailing party by the appellate panel, the Federal Circuit remanded the case for the district court to determine whether the case was “exceptional” under § 285, which is a prerequisite for awarding attorney fees. On remand, the district court will surely consider other Federal Circuit decisions, such as OneSubsea, IP v. FMC Technologies, Inc. and United Cannabis Corp. v. Pure Hemp Collective Inc., when deciding whether the case was exceptional under § 285. Federal Circuit precedent makes it clear that aggressive litigation tactics or hard-fought disputes between competitors do not, by themselves, make a case exceptional. Instead, exceptionality requires litigation misconduct or a case that “stands out” due to its substantive weakness or unreasonable conduct. Indeed, the court must find something more — such as objectively baseless claims or clear litigation misconduct — to warrant exceptionality under § 285.

Sanctionable Conduct: Not Enough Bad Behavior Here

The Federal Circuit also addressed Realtek’s requests for Rule 11 sanctions, which was denied by the district court. The panel found that Future Link’s pre-filing investigation met the minimum requirements for a reasonable inquiry with a reminder that “testing of an accused product is not necessarily a required part of an adequate pre-filing investigation.” Because Future Link performed a comparison of the claims against the accused products prior to filing suit, the panel held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Future Link’s infringement claims were sufficiently factually supported. Moreover, the panel explained that “[i]f a reasonably clear legal justification can be shown for the filing of the paper in question, no improper purpose can be found and sanctions are inappropriate.”

Key Takeaways for Patent Litigants

Prevailing Party Status – A defendant can be a prevailing party entitled to fees and costs even if the case is dismissed with prejudice for reasons other than a merits determination.

Exceptionality Standard – Attorney fees under § 285 require more than just aggressive litigation; there must be clear evidence of misconduct or a case that is objectively baseless.

Sanctions – Rule 11 sanctions are reserved for egregious conduct, not for mere litigation losses or strategic decisions.

The Future Link decision reinforces the Federal Circuit’s consistent approach: While courts will not hesitate to sanction true litigation misconduct, they will not penalize parties simply for vigorously defending their interests in complex patent disputes. This clarity benefits both patent owners and accused infringers by setting predictable standards for fee-shifting and sanctions in federal court.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13676_5142.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 09:57:08.488380

For the latest, I want to bring in NPR's Adrian Florido, and Adrian, tell me a little bit more about what exactly this judge in Louisiana ruled.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Well, Mary Louise, the judge is Jamee Comans, and she ordered Khalil deported either to Algeria, where he holds a passport, or to Syria, where he was born and where he grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp. This does not mean that Khalil will be immediately deported or even soon. There's still likely a long legal fight ahead. But the judge, in ordering him deported, relied on the government's accusation that Khalil purposely left information off of his green card application last year, specifically some work that he'd done with the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians and his involvement in a pro-Palestinian activist group at Colombia. His lawyers have long said that these claims are bogus.

KELLY: And what are they saying today? How are they responding to this deportation order?

FLORIDO: Well, in a statement, Khalil said that it was no surprise. He and his lawyers have always said that these fraud charges are a pretext and that they're really targeting him for his political activism, which they say is unconstitutional. Now, the Trump administration first arrested Khalil back in March, claiming that his pro-Palestinian activism was antisemitic and that he was a Hamas terrorist sympathizer - all claims that Khalil denies and that the government has never actually provided evidence for. Now, I spoke with Baher Azmy, one of his attorneys, today.

BAHER AZMY: They're making up charges to remove him because they disagree with his dissent from U.S. foreign policy.

FLORIDO: You might remember, Mary Louise, that Khalil spent more than three months in a detention center in Louisiana before his lawyers were able to get him released on bail in June.

KELLY: I do indeed remember. OK, so timing here, you said this could be tied up in courts for a while. How quickly might he be deported?

FLORIDO: Well, it's hard to say, assuming that he is ultimately ordered, you know, deported by a court...

KELLY: Right.

FLORIDO: ...Because his lawyers are promising a long legal fight. His case is actually playing out in two different court systems - in this immigration court, where the government has been moving aggressively to try to expel him and where it has succeeded in getting this order against him this week, but also in a New Jersey federal court, where he's challenging his deportation on claims that the government is retaliating for his activism and violating his right to free speech. The judge in that federal case issued an order months ago prohibiting the government from deporting Khalil while he considers those constitutional claims, and that could take a long time. In a statement to NPR, Tricia McLaughlin, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, reiterated today the government's claims that Khalil advocated for violence and supported terrorists, and she said that he should not be in this country.

KELLY: And just briefly, Adrian, catch us up on some of the other cases. There have been quite a few other high-profile cases, pro-Palestinian student protesters detained for campus activism.

FLORIDO: Yeah, they're all in various stages of litigation. All of these students are fighting their deportations on free speech grounds. They've had a lot of success in federal courts so far, but there are big questions as the cases make their way through the federal court system. Will appeals courts ultimately protect their right to protest or allow the Trump administration to deport them?

KELLY: NPR's Adrian Florido - thanks, Adrian.

FLORIDO: Thanks, Mary Louise.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Welcome back to the Culture & Compliance Chronicles, the podcast that gives you new perspectives on legal, compliance and regulatory challenges faced by organizations and individuals worldwide. The clue is in the title—culture is at the heart of everything. It’s the endlessly shifting patterns that govern our environment and behaviors. The magic is in amplifying certain patterns and dampening others. Let’s see if we can pique your curiosity, get you to challenge some of your perceptions and give you space to think differently about some of your own challenges. I’m Nitish Upadhyaya, and I’m joined by Amanda Raad and Richard Bistrong. Hello, Amanda and Richard.

Amanda Raad: Hello. Good to see you.

Richard Bistrong: Nitish and Amanda, it’s great to join you today. That was such an interesting episode with Guido Palazzo talking about his co-authored book, The Dark Pattern, where he took us through what he called “corporate hellscapes” but was nice enough to return us to the light pattern. Nitish, with that said, who do we have joining us today?

Nitish Upadhyaya: Delighted to welcome Archana Kotecha, CEO of The Remedy Project.

Archana Kotecha: Thanks for having me on this podcast, Nitish.

[1:15] Getting to Know Archana

Nitish Upadhyaya: I’ve had the absolute pleasure of working with you on a really fascinating project mapping safety of women in industry and agriculture roles across Asia. I’ve been so inspired by the passion for what you do and your desire to push boundaries, and so, I couldn’t wait to have you on this podcast, and I’m really glad we’re here. Just recently, we were talking about a research method that you’d read about, eliciting honest opinions to sensitive questions, and these sorts of conversations where you’re continually pushing the boundaries and searching for new ways of doing things, I’m hoping that will come across to our listeners in a very different cultural context to what they might be used to. Now, we always help our audience get to know you a little bit better before we dive into the detail and your experience. Let’s do a rapid-fire round—give us three things we should know about you.

Archana Kotecha: I’m originally from Mauritius. I am an avid weightlifter and a fitness freak. And I’m the proud mum of two teenagers.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Very snappy. Now, what’s one thing you’re curious about?

Archana Kotecha: I think one thing I’m really curious about is whether worker-driven social responsibility can really take off in Asia. There are examples of it in different parts of the world, but the context and the rule of law, the setup is very different—Asia has its own particularities. And I’ve always been very curious to know whether empowered and supported workers within the right context could also make it in Asia.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Let’s see if we can touch on that during the course of this recording. What’s the last thing that surprised you?

Archana Kotecha: One of the things that always amazes me is how our children get taught the curriculum at school: very carefully and very diligently by their teachers and by school. But actually, they don’t really get taught many skills that are so vital for later in life. For me, one of the key skills that they need to be taught is resilience. My daughter surprised me by demonstrating really good resilience in the face of rejection recently. And I think this is something that is surprising in this day and age, particularly where everybody is instantly gratified or feels instantly entitled to get what they want. So, that was a pleasant surprise.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Let’s get to understand your career path, because all of the points you talked about around social responsibility, working across it in Asia, what brought you to where you are now?

Archana Kotecha: I started out my career as a corporate lawyer. I qualified as a barrister in the U.K., lived the high life, did M&A work, worked the hours, had the training, and had the benefit of working in Big Law for a number of years. I was still looking for something, I didn’t quite find it, and was very grateful for everything I had learned in Big Law, and decided to start looking elsewhere, and very accidentally stumbled into an opportunity at the UNHCR doing refugee work. That’s the first time I found lawyering with purpose and for a purpose—I could use my skills, and knowledge, and expertise to touch the lives of people. And that was almost over 18 years ago. Subsequent to doing refugee work, I had a chance encounter with a victim of human trafficking in London, and that changed the course of my career. I decided from that point onward, I wanted to focus on human trafficking and forced labor. I came to Asia about 17 years ago and had an opportunity to be part of an NGO startup and to work on counter-trafficking across the region. So, very quickly, I became a go-to person for governments in the region, prosecutors, judges, worker groups, CSOs in relation to forced labor and human trafficking.

Five years ago, I decided that I wanted to take my work to another level. One of the issues of being with an NGO platform is your ability to reach and interact with businesses can be very limited. There are inherent trust issues and various gaps between these two stakeholders. So, I set up on my own—I set up The Remedy Project. The idea was really to try and reach as many workers in global supply chains by working with businesses and essentially to leave the world in a better place than I found it. At The Remedy Project, we basically do human rights risk assessments, human rights impact assessments. We create tools for businesses so that they can better understand their footprint on human rights issues of their stakeholders. And we pay particular attention to migrant workers, to women, and to children. For us, it is really important to be partnering and co-creating with businesses while maintaining that human rights lens. We are not about designing and giving it to the business, but rather, working with business, understanding their challenges, the opportunities to scale, and creating real pathways and inroads into the way business understands risk, responds to it, and prevents it rather than constantly reacting to risk.

[6:30] Tools for Assessing Culture

Amanda Raad: I love that, especially the point about partnering with the business, I think, is such an important point. Digging in a little bit, how do you go about thinking about assessing culture at a manufacturing site, for example? How do you approach that?

Archana Kotecha: We do a lot of investigations or human rights impact assessments where we go to visit farms, we visit factories and various sites. I think one of the things that I always insist on—and electronics companies get very nervous about allowing this—is a visit to the production floor, because I want to be able to experience what the temperature is like on the floor. I want to be able to see how workers are interacting with each other. Do they look at ease? Do they look nervous? Do they look stressed? And just ask them, “Are you able to go to the bathroom when you need to? Are there enough bathrooms on the facilities? What sort of facilities are there for workers? Is there a canteen where people can sit and eat?” Another thing that’s quite interesting is knowing whether the canteen provides food only for the workers while management have a separate canteen. That’s also telling in some cases, and you can see the differences in the quality of both. Where are workers sitting to eat? If it’s under corrugated sheets of iron that are attracting sun at midday and it’s uncomfortably hot, that’s also very telling.

We talk to workers. We do focus group discussions. We ask them about how they feel about their workplace. We do one-on-one interviews as well. Before we go in, we also look at audit reports. We look at what sort of grievances workers might have reported, so we have a fairly good idea of where to direct some of our inquiries and questions. We look at how signage is for workers within the factory. Are grievance mechanisms well advertised? Would people know where to go? Is it in a language that they would understand? And the management interviews also give us a real sense of: What is management’s vision for the workforce?” How do they feel about their workforce? Are they contributors to the factory who are recognized as contributors, or are they just there doing their job, and they’re supposed to be there because we pay them to be there”?

Worker welfare committees are also very telling. How clean the production floor is. And more recently, we’ve been very, very attentive to the needs of women in particular. You have women in their 40s, in their 50s who might be going through menopause, who experience hot flashes, and when the factory floor is hot, it is so difficult for these women to stand there—let’s say they’re at the ironing station the whole day—and do that job. So, all those are really important things, and they give you a real sense of how workers feel about their workplace, what the culture is, how they’re treated. Do they have freedom of association? Are they able to air grievances? If not, why not? Do they feel threatened? We also look at how workers interact with each other. In many large factories, it’s very common to see a large population of internal migrant workers, but also, maybe foreign migrant workers. You might also have a lot of contract workers who are basically there for two months, three months, six months depending on production needs, and full-time workers. They both have different entitlements and different packages. It’s also important to see how they interact with each other. How do they feel about each other? How do they feel about management? And do they feel valued in the workplace? All of those are really interesting.

One of the projects we’ve been working on with Ropes & Gray, and with Nitish and his team in particular, are these surveys called She Voices. The idea is really to have women share what they feel about their workplace. And it’s so important to have that, because actually in many places, women become silent and passive participants in the workplace. They’re not seen, and they’re not heard. That’s also something we look out for. What sort of channels do you have to really tap into the female workforce and understand their needs?

[10:50] Engaging with Stakeholders

Amanda Raad: It’s so important that you started there, right at the beginning, about how important it is to actually get on the site, see for yourself, and start to ask questions directly. How much of a struggle is it to actually get the access that you feel like you need? Practically speaking, how does that go? Are there tools that you’ve used to be able to get people to be more willing to engage in this process in a productive manner?

Archana Kotecha: We don’t get access unless a brand gets involved and says to the supplier, “You need to allow them on field because there is a nonconformance, and we want them to investigate this independently.” But I’ve found, even when suppliers are very reluctant, the success of my mission relies on how collaborative they’re going to be when I get there. So, the first thing I do is to spend time with the supplier management so that they understand fully that I’m not here to find problems—I’m here to find a solution, and we’re going to find it together. I’ll sit, and I’ll spend the time it takes with them first to get them on board and on-site for them to understand fully, “What is my role? What am I trying to do here? And what is the overall objective?” Then, we’ll move from there. And when we end the process, we will do a closing meeting. At the closing meeting, I will always remember to thank them for their time, but also, to share with them some of our thinking, and that will include both positives and perhaps areas for growth. It’s so important to be constructive and not finger-pointing.

Now, there have been occasions where suppliers have simply said, especially when the brand doesn’t have much leverage, “We’re not going to give you access.” In those cases, I’ve requested whether I can have a call with the supplier, and part of that call is making them feel at ease with who this third party is, what the role of the third party is, and why this visit is necessary. And usually we will draw on regulations, we will draw on reputational risk, we will draw on the importance for their other brands that might be also sourcing from them and how they could be a lot more competitive in the market if they allowed us to go ahead with the visit. It really is massaging at both ends and really trying to be as constructive and bringing people together as possible. So, again, it’s that idea of co-owning the process.

[13:20] Diving into The Supply Chain

Richard Bistrong: When you’re working with your business partners, how deep do you go into the levels of the supply chain? I was thinking about your sharing, “How clean is the factory? How clean is the manufacturing operation?” Would you then go and say, “We’d like to talk to the people that are responsible for maintenance of this factory and to see what those conditions are like,” or, “The people that you’ve subcontracted to operate your canteen, we want to also look at those working conditions”? So, it seems to be this common debate and frequent debate in our compliance field, how far down the supply chain levels should we go? What would be your specific advice, let’s say with your business partners and for those elsewhere, how should they look at this issue?

Archana Kotecha: I think in relation to this, if I’m doing a site visit, I will go into the canteen, and I will see what’s happening there. I will go talk to the maintenance guy. I’ll talk to the electrician. I’ll speak to the security guard at the gate. I’ll speak to the workers on the floor. Because at the end of the day, if anything happens to any one of these people, it is a reputational, a legal, and a financial issue for the brand—it doesn’t matter what function they’re in. So, for me, you can’t do a good job from a risk assessment perspective unless you’re really looking at everything that’s on-site. It gets a lot more complicated when you start going to Tier N, which is raw materials sourcing, etc. That’s another layer of complexity, and that’s where we often lose business partners, because right now, the way regulations are, there’s a lot of legal uncertainty, there’s a lot of blocks. Unless they are clearly aware of something going on in the raw materials supply chain, it’s very rare for them to want to go beyond and to look there, particularly as there’s often multiple layers in between the supplier and the raw materials sourcing process. If it’s electronics, there may be layers of smelters, brokers, etc., in between, and the distance created means that there is almost that, I’ll say “safety” within air quotes, between the supplier, the brand, and those parties where there are higher risks.

However, we’ve seen in the case of many high-profile American businesses, for example, that that does not stop lawsuits being filed in relation to risks that arise in the raw materials supply chain. But if I was advising a client, I would definitely say to them, “If you’re subcontracting your security services, your janitorial services, or your canteen services, you need to have a good understanding of what those contracts look like and whether there might be any risks sitting there.” So, those are the documents that we request to see even before we get to the site. And in an ideal world, we get access to those documents. In a not-so-ideal world, we may get access to those documents but only when we are on-site, and that’s okay, too.

Richard Bistrong: Just out of curiosity, when you take on a business partner in your work—and I’m thinking about some of the collective action NGOs that are out there—is there a least common denominator where if your business partner isn’t willing to commit to certain things, that you’re not going to take them on because it could just be window dressing as opposed to looking for real change?

Archana Kotecha: This is our fifth year as a social enterprise, and we have a select group of private sector clients, large clients, who have been repeat clients from the time we set up. The reason why I love working with them is I know them really well. I know what they can do. I know where their limitations are. And I understand the dynamics between legal and compliance, procurement, and the sustainability team. So, it makes for a much more productive relationship. And I know those people are committed to doing right. We don’t always get everything through that we want to, but we’re able to have difficult conversations. We’re able to take and implement some recommendations while others remain work in progress, but such is life. It doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t work with them because they can’t do everything we want at the same time. I think I learned from my NGO days that wanting the absolute position is very often not achievable and not possible, but that still means we can continue to make those steps toward progress. The way I choose to see it, and I think clients particularly appreciate this, is this is a journey that we take together. There are milestones along the journey, but we remain less attached to the outcomes so that the process itself is rich, and that in itself is worth so much.

I have had situations where clients have asked me, for example, to change my findings in relation to a report. They say, “Our legal team doesn’t like the use of this word. Our legal team doesn’t like that. They don’t like this. They don’t like that.” Now, there’s an extent to which I’m willing to accommodate language and semantics as long as we don’t alter the core meaning and the recommendations that are attached to it. I think the beauty of being independent and the beauty of not being driven by profit, but rather by purpose, is that I’m quite happy to step away and walk away from something where I have to compromise the vision of the organization or its values.

[19:10] Bringing Stakeholders Together

Nitish Upadhyaya: You spend so much time bringing lots of these stakeholders together. You talked about the brands, you talked about the suppliers, and you talked about the people on the ground as well, and, of course, you’re an accredited mediator as well. Do you have any lessons for our audience on how to facilitate conversations to bring about alignment or understanding of these different perspectives to actually allow people to then move forward?

Archana Kotecha: I think, for me, a lot of this is leading with commonalities in agenda. I think we do tend to be very hyper-focused on differences, on divergences, on perspectives and positions, but actually, if we leave those aside, there’s always commonalities in agenda. For me, finding that is really important to understanding what makes them tick. What would they be happy to see? Actually, I find the other party is not so dissimilar—they’re just looking at it from a different perspective. So, I think first leading with commonalities in the agenda. The second thing is demonstrating good listening skills, understanding, and having an open mindset to receive. It might be something you’re not really prepared or happy to receive, but actually being willing to receive it, to think about it, and to process it. You don’t have to react to it—you can respond to it. I think that’s really important.

There are different cultures. For example, child labor. In an Asian community, it’s very acceptable for a family that has a farm to have the child be helping out at the farm. The perception from different parts of the world where children do not work but they go to school, they stay in school, and they come home, and they relax—they have a different life. There isn’t some one perspective that is right and one that is wrong—they’re different perspectives that work for different communities in different parts of the world coming from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and therefore, that nuance is really important. I think we forget very often, in a bid to get what we want, that we’re all human—we’re very different. The human condition is complex, and it’s sometimes just really difficult to arrive at one strand that represents everybody or one thing that everybody has in common. But actually, that thing is there—it’s just nuanced, and it looks and feels different in different parts of the world. I think being open to that is critical, and finding opportunities to align rather than constantly focusing on where there are gaps—and where there are gaps, being constructive about it. “I hear you. I hear that this is an issue in your country. Here’s how we think about this issue. How do you feel about that?” We don’t have conversations like that very often, where you’re putting something on the table, you’re asking people how they feel about it. It’s about finding solutions together. I do find that where you try to impose a view, a solution, or a perspective, you are less likely to evolve to a solution that is acceptable and something that can be implemented and be successful.

[22:30] Using Pilots

Amanda Raad: The finding the solutions together, I think even if you try that with the very best intent, sometimes it’s hard to know what the right solution is. So, you’re hearing a bunch of different perspectives, and you try to come together with what the right proposed change is, or how to try to move along a particular remediation, for example. Have you found any use in pilots or smaller interventions? And how does that work for you in the context of bringing people along together?

Archana Kotecha: Being a female founder in a sector where there isn’t ever any money available or resources for self-development, I’m an avid devourer of podcasts and anything that helps me do some self-development as a leader and as a female leader. One of the things I learned was that if you’re building a tool or you’re building a product, quit procrastinating over building the perfect thing. Have something that you can pilot, and then just keep refining it till it gets really good. So, pilots, for me, are an absolutely critical way of learning and tweaking so that the product can be created to fit the needs and the purpose of the people it’s designed to serve rather than being something that I think is the right thing to serve people. I just get something that is good enough out so that we’re constantly playing and learning.

For example, She Voices, we’ve got four pilots that have gotten underway. There have been lots of lessons learned, including how some questions are very difficult to translate. Women find it very hard, depending on levels of literacy, around imagining or eliciting the right responses or a response that we hope will help us get an insight into how they’re thinking, because the image that they’re looking at is too abstract, and they respond better to concrete images and the image of an object, for example. We would never know that unless we went out and we tried, we tested, we spoke to women, we spoke to those who are working with these women, those who are administering the pilots, etc. And I think, for me, a pilot also offers the opportunity to eliminate contextual externalities that can actually hamper launching a product at scale. So, there are so many particularities, and the particularities of each pilot allow you to really learn so that if you are creating a product that you want to be deployed at scale, you can really eliminate those externalities that might stop deployment from being effective. So, it really is a critical, critical part of not just creating products but also co-owning and co-creating products.

Amanda Raad: I love it so much because I think it also plays into normalizing or making it easier to welcome feedback, because you almost go in from the very beginning not looking for perfection—which I’m guilty of often, and you can get paralyzed—but seeking out that input to know what the next right thing is, so taking a step and making it easier to get more feedback, and to take away a negative attribution to whatever that feedback might be but see it really as a positive.

[26:00] Key Takeaways

Nitish Upadhyaya: Lots of useful wisdom and tips, I think, coming out of this from talking about pilots to bringing stakeholders together, and talking about how you even go about assessing something as amorphous as culture in a manufacturing site. Richard, what’s your key takeaway from this?

Richard Bistrong: I think I have an appreciation that name-and-shame doesn’t spark social change or corporate change. And the whole concept—and we’ve seen this before, Archana—of being a good listener and to try to understand cultural nuances, see where there can be alignment so that you’re better able to then say, “Let’s also take a look at the gaps.” It’s not just about everything that’s wrong. And all of that ends up, as you shared, to how we find solutions. So, being a good listener, understanding where those gaps are to find those solutions, I think, is just great global counsel, and thank you for being so open in sharing it.

Nitish Upadhyaya: And what about you, Amanda?

Amanda Raad: You had me hooked at the very beginning when you talked about your journey and lawyering with purpose. I’ve been thinking a lot about the purpose and the meaning in all that we do, and I think there’s so much. I think all of us can really dig into that, because if we do our jobs the best we can, we are really interacting with people on a daily basis on issues that are just hugely important in the world. The approach that you talked about from start to finish really highlights how if we’re aware and sensitive to what our purpose and our goals are, and work with each other, and are open to change, there’s a lot we can accomplish together. So, I loved it—it was a really great discussion. Thank you very much.

Nitish Upadhyaya: Archana, if you had one key area that listeners should take away or that you wish for them to explore further, what would it be?

Archana Kotecha: Thanks, Nitish. I think over the years, I learned that my skill was the ability to do storytelling. I think as human beings, we fundamentally respond so well to stories. When we are babies, parents tell you stories. Sometimes you can’t go to sleep without stories. It gives you a sense of security, a sense of enchantment, being taken to another world. It’s no different in the work that we do. A lot of what I do is to take stories from the ground and translate those stories and those needs into businesses so that I can get them to respond to those stories by creating new narratives and new stories. A lot of this is about human connection, and I find that sometimes we’re so busy doing our role, our jobs in our little silos, collecting data, we forget why we’re collecting data. Data has to be actionable, it has to tell a story, and it has to be responsive to the needs of the business, but also, of those featuring in those stories. So, for me, over the years, it has been, “How can I perfect that skill so I can really bring the plight, the experiences of workers in a manner that is the most constructive so as to get decision-makers to move the needle?” For me, that’s what it’s about—that’s what life is about. It’s about connecting, it’s about connecting for the better, and it’s about connecting for change.

Nitish Upadhyaya: What an inspirational way to finish the episode. Thank you so much for sharing your story and for encouraging everyone else to think about theirs, but also, the stories that their colleagues, the stakeholders, and others have on the ground. So, I’m looking forward to feedback, seeing what people do off the back of this episode in their own stories, in their compliance functions as they think about risk, and maybe giving a voice to folks that don’t often get to be heard. Thank you so much, Archana, for all your ideas and thoughts, and we’re really looking forward to hearing more from you in the coming months.

Archana Kotecha: Absolutely. And thank you for the partnership with Ropes & Gray. I’m so grateful for this, and I’m excited to see where we go with this partnership.

Over 300 civil society groups from Europe and beyond have called on the European Parliament and EU governments to reject a proposed deportation law. They said that it would expand detention, surveillance, and forced removals, violating basic rights.

The European Commission introduced the proposal in March 2025, calling it a “Return Regulation” to replace the current Return Directive.

Critics warned that the draft law would set up offshore deportation centers, allow detention for up to two years, weaken appeal rights, and send people to countries where they have no connections.

The groups argued that the plan would lock in harsh measures that put migrants, asylum seekers, and racialized communities at greater risk of abuse.

A broad coalition opposing the plan

Over 300 groups signed the statement opposing the law.

The signatories include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Médecins Sans Frontières, the European Network Against Racism, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, and many refugee support organizations across EU countries.

They urged the European Commission to withdraw the proposal and called on the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to reject it as it stands.

They described the draft as “driven by detention, deportation, [externalization], and punishment,” warning that it would trap more people in legal uncertainty and unsafe conditions.

Offshore deportations and “return hubs”

One of the most disputed parts of the proposal is the option to deport people to countries outside the EU where they have no ties.

Articles 4 and 17 would allow transfers to third countries that people may have only passed through briefly or never entered at all.

The plan also calls for “return hubs” outside EU territory, which campaigners said would serve as detention centers. They argued that this would lead to automatic detention, forced returns, and denial of legal protections, raising questions about compliance with international law and whether rights could be properly monitored.

The groups compared the plan to offshore asylum models used by Australia and the United Kingdom, which critics say led to high costs, rights abuses, and diplomatic conflicts.

Expansion of surveillance and policing

Article 6 of the proposal requires EU states to set up systems to identify people living irregularly on their territory.

Civil society groups warned this would lead to racial profiling, discriminatory policing, and immigration raids that spread fear in migrant communities. They also cautioned that these measures could stop undocumented people from seeking healthcare, reporting abuse, or asking for protection.

The proposal further allows sensitive personal data, including health records, to be shared with EU and third-country authorities, raising concerns about violations of data protection standards.

Prolonged detention, impact on children

The proposal would raise the maximum detention period from 18 to 24 months and expand the reasons people can be detained. Under the draft rules, simply lacking documents or being homeless could be enough.

Children could also be detained, despite international agreements stating that immigration detention is never in a child’s best interests.

Campaigners warned the law would make detention routine, permit indefinite confinement of people labeled as “security risks,” and fuel a “detention industry” by creating business opportunities for private contractors.

Weakened safeguards, appeal rights

The plan also weakens protections for people who cannot be deported because they are stateless or face other barriers.

It would require deportation orders to be issued at the same time as any decision ending legal stay, even before options like humanitarian permits are considered.

The proposal further limits appeal rights. It removes the automatic suspensive effect of appeals, meaning people could be expelled while waiting for a court ruling.

It also shortens the deadline to file appeals to 14 days, raising concerns that many would lose their chance to seek an effective remedy.

Punitive measures, sanctions

Articles 10, 12, 13, 16, 22, and 29 of the proposal set new obligations for people facing deportation. These include providing identity documents, submitting to searches, and cooperating with third countries to obtain travel papers.

Failure to comply could lead to penalties such as fines, re-entry bans, denial of benefits or work permits, and limits on voluntary departure.

Civil society groups warned these measures would unfairly punish vulnerable people and make forced removals the default, weakening the idea of voluntary return.

Expanded digital surveillance

The draft law allows the use of intrusive technologies like GPS tracking and mobile phone surveillance as supposed “alternatives to detention.”

Rights groups and the European Data Protection Supervisor warned these tools amount to detention in practice and create lucrative markets for surveillance companies.

The proposal also introduces a new “European Return Order” to be stored in the Schengen Information System and shared across law enforcement. Past abuses of EU police databases have raised concerns about privacy, discrimination, and misuse.

Lack of consultation, impact assessment

Statewatch reported that the European Commission released the proposal without a human rights impact assessment or formal consultations with social partners.

This goes against the EU’s own “Better Regulation” guidelines, which require such reviews when laws have major social effects.

Without an assessment, the proposal has not been properly checked against EU obligations on fundamental rights, including the ban on torture and degrading treatment, children’s rights, and protections against discrimination.

Alternatives to forced returns

The coalition of organizations argued that the Commission’s focus on deportation ignores alternatives that could reduce irregular migration while respecting rights.

They called for more residence permits based on humanitarian needs, family ties, or statelessness, as well as regular migration pathways that let people contribute socially and economically to EU societies.

They stressed that deportation should not be the only option for people whose asylum claims are rejected, urging the EU to invest instead in policies built on safety, protection, and inclusion.

Uncertainty for travelers, migrants

For short-term visitors, the new deportation proposal combined with upcoming border systems could mean stricter checks and less room for mistakes.

Starting in October 2025, the Entry/Exit System (EES) will replace passport stamps with digital records, collecting biometric and facial data from non-EU nationals.

By late 2026, the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) will also require travelers from 59 visa-exempt countries to get prior authorization before entering the Schengen Area.

If the deportation regulation passes, data from EES and ETIAS could be tied directly to expanded removal powers. Civil society groups warned this could increase deportations, even for minor overstays or paperwork delays.

Long-term residents and migrants may also face greater insecurity, since deportation orders would become automatic once residence permits expire, with no regard for humanitarian needs or family ties.

Together, these systems point to tighter monitoring and enforcement of mobility within the EU, with harsher consequences for irregularities.

EU officials present EES and ETIAS as tools for efficiency and security, but rights groups argue that, paired with the deportation law, they risk creating a climate of surveillance and fear for both visitors and migrants.

A choice that shapes Europe’s future

More than 300 groups have spoken out against the EU deportation law, warning that it would expand detention, increase surveillance, and weaken basic rights.

The question now is whether Europe will handle migration by enforcing punishment or by protecting people. Lawmakers must decide if they will build a system that deepens fear or one that supports dignity and safety.

This debate matters because the EU deportation law would affect not only migrants but also the communities they live in. The decision will show what values Europe wants to uphold in the years ahead.",https://etias.com/assets/uploads/imagery/blog/european-union-flags-outside-modern-building.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 23:57:36.556690

“Rapid response teams,” as they’re known, have been making their presence felt on the streets from Brighton Park to the city’s Northwest Side and out to the suburbs.

In Wheaton, the actions of ICE agents have been met with intense scrutiny this week.

Rapid response teams arrived within minutes of an ICE stop and applied undeniable pressure on federal agents.

A number of community organizations joined forces at a rally held on Thursday.

Members of the specially trained Northwest Side Rapid Response Network are asking people to step up to help neighbors living in fear.

“I encourage you to offer to bring/deliver groceries to your neighbors too terrified to leave their homes,” Sandra Puebla of the Northwest Rapid Response Network said.

The rapid response teams in Wheaten demand due process for detainees who often don’t speak English.

Patrick Brosnan, executive director of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, has a large area to monitor with his team.

“We’re dealing with neighborhoods in Chicago south of I-55. There’s about 80 active members. These are all community residents,” Brosnan said.

After new rules were introduced requiring the majority of temporary visa holders—including H-2A temporary farm workers—to attend in-person interviews, the State Department said Thursday that it is lifting the requirement for that group.

""With heightened scrutiny of applicants, particularly students, social media vetting, and the regular security screenings already in place, officers are facing a steep increase in time spent per case, meaning their time is more limited and the number of cases they can process is lower,"" Matt Mauntel-Medici, an immigration attorney with Brown Winick in Iowa and a former U.S. consular officer, told Newsweek.

""This affects employers of all kinds, from financial services firms to manufacturers, but the agricultural sector is more hindered than others. All delays in processing create opportunity costs and can hinder operations.""

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has left many farm owners concerned about maintaining staffing, with a large proportion being temporary migrant workers. Trump has voiced his support for the industry, but enforcement raids have continued, leaving farms struggling to recruit and keep those without long-term security.

What To Know

Early this month, the Trump administration introduced new visa interview requirements, essentially removing waivers that had been in place for many temporary immigrants already in the U.S. or with existing visas living abroad.

Many first-time applicants, such as those under 14 and some elderly people, had been able to get a waiver, but that was dropped on September 2. The new rules allowed only certain government and diplomatic officials, and some visitor visa holders, to skip an in-person interview when renewing their documents.

On Thursday, another category was added to the list of those who are eligible for an interview waiver—H-2A visa holders, who are temporary farm workers. That means workers may be granted a waiver but are not guaranteed one.

The visa category is temporary, and workers generally must renew every year. Adding in-person interview requirements would likely lead to difficulties for those with little means of traveling, and the farming industry has called for a modernized approach to ensure continued workforce levels.

There are still caps on H-2A terms, with immigrants allowed a maximum of three years in the U.S., then must return home for at least 60 days before applying again.

Whether the change by the State Department leads to other adjustments to the H-2A program remains to be seen. The U.S. Department of Agriculture previously told Newsweek that it was working to streamline and strengthen the process, but official announcements on program changes have yet to be made.

What People Are Saying

Matt Mauntel-Medici told Newsweek: ""Here in Iowa our corn and soybean yields help to not only provide nutrition for people and livestock but also bring in critical dollars for our rural communities. If farmers are left with their yields unpicked, that directly translates to dollars lost for them, their families, their communities, states and country. That is hugely important across the country and especially here in Iowa.

""The reversal of the interview waiver restrictions on H-2A agricultural workers will speed up their processing, allowing these experienced workers to renew their visas and return to the U.S. to help our farmers in such a critical and time sensitive period. I am glad to see the administration putting farmers first and hope that they expand this to other industries.""

Ben Tindall, executive director of Save Family Farming, in a statement shared with Newsweek: ""The heavily-regulated program, while costly and cumbersome, provides a lifeline for American farmers to continue producing food here, rather than watching American consumers eat even more food imported from foreign countries.

""Save Family Farming applauds the federal government's efforts to keep this program as efficient as possible, even while maintaining border security, safeguarding domestic workers, and protecting guest workers.""

The State Department, in its September 18 update: ""Consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis for any reason. Applicants should check embassy and consulate websites for more detailed information about visa application requirements and procedures, and to learn more about the embassy or consulate's operating status and services.""

A USDA spokesperson previously told Newsweek: ""President Trump is putting America First and that includes strengthening the farm workforce and streamlining H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world.""

What Happens Next

The updated guidance will go into effect October 1.

The precedent-setting UNEF operation was authorized in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution via the first emergency special session.
The Potential for other General Assembly Recommendations and Determinations to Shift the Situation Mandating a peace operation is of course not the only recourse for the General Assembly.","Today marks the expiration of the General Assembly’s one-year deadline for Israel to comply with its legal obligations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), those outlined in the International Court of Justice’s July 2024 advisory opinion on the “Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem” (“Legal Consequences” opinion). As that deadline has approached, experts, commentators and even Member States themselves have increasingly offered proposals for what more the General Assembly could do to spur action on the increasingly dire situation in the Gaza Strip – from providing armed protection to humanitarian aid workers or naval relief convoys, to recommending or even directly mandating a peacekeeping or stabilization operation.

On July 29, 2025, the global body that appraises hunger levels officially declared famine in Gaza. After the Israeli Knesset passed legislation in October 2024 that effectively halted the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the main body providing basic services and humanitarian aid to the territory for decades, the UN Secretary-General appealed to Member States and the General Assembly. Since the renewed Israeli blockade on aid in March 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been one of the few outlets bringing food, medicine and other aid into the territory. But its background, setup and means of operating are controversial, and aid distribution points have repeatedly come under attack. UN experts estimate that 2000 Palestinians have been killed at distribution sites for humanitarian aid, the vast majority (70%) in areas served and protected by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. As a result, attention has focused not only on getting a much higher volume of relief into Gaza, but also on finding ways to ensure protection for those humanitarian convoys and distribution sites.

The Security Council has considered the situation in Gaza regularly over the last two years, and in June 2024 passed resolution 2735 endorsing a ceasefire proposal and setting out several phases for its implementation. However, since then, even the most stripped down of resolutions have not proved veto-proof. In June 2025, the US vetoed an extremely limited draft resolution that would have simply reinforced resolution 2735, and demanded an immediate ceasefire and the lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian aid. All total since October 2023, there have been no less than eight vetoes cast on resolutions related to the situation in Gaza: seven vetoed by the US (S/2025/353, June 2025; S/2024/835, November 2024; S/2024/173, February 2024; Amendment to S/PV.9520, December 2023; S/2023/970, December 2023; S/2023/792, October 2023; S/2023/773, 18 October 2023); and one vetoed by the Russian Federation and China (S/2024/239, March 2024). The only resolutions that have passed did so by virtue of an abstention by either the US, the Russian Federation or both (these were: S/RES/2712, November 2023; S/RES/2720, December 2023; S/RES/2728, March 2024; S/RES/2735, June 2024).

Given the deadlock on this issue in the Security Council, policymakers and international experts have increasingly looked to other decision-making bodies for a response. In June the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, proposed that the General Assembly might authorize armed peacekeepers to accompany and protect humanitarian aid convoys, including (but not limited to) the situation in Gaza. On Sept. 5, a group of 27 UN high-level UN experts called on the General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting and facilitate humanitarian aid by recommending a peace operation, demanding the opening of all crossings, and to “request the authorization of UN-led international humanitarian convoys” to supervise humanitarian aid flows. Then last week, the General Assembly endorsed the concluding recommendations from a July 2025 high-level conference on Palestine and a two-state solution. The endorsed final outcome document of that conference included proposals to deploy a temporary UN “stabilization mission” to Gaza to monitor implementation of a prior ceasefire agreement (negotiated in January 2025) and any future peace agreement. The proposal was for a Security Council-authorized stabilization mission, however, given the standoff in the Council, the General Assembly may be the more likely body to take such proposals forward.

With operations in Gaza now approaching their second year, and no end in sight for the humanitarian crisis, could the UN General Assembly provide the muscle to support humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention? The proposals for it to do so raise a number of questions about the legal remit of the General Assembly, as well as of any practical or procedural limitations. Can the General Assembly authorize (armed) peacekeepers and aid convoys? Under what UN Charter provisions or other legal authority? What other measures might the General Assembly take to create more pressure for humanitarian relief or Member State action on this?

In the spirit of full-disclosure, I co-authored the 2024 Digital Handbook on the General Assembly’s peace and security practice, resources from which are cited throughout this article in parentheticals and hyperlinked text.

Can the General Assembly Authorize Peace Operations, including Armed Peacekeepers?

The General Assembly has mandated peace operations throughout its history, from the first armed UN peacekeeping force in 1956, the UN Emergency Force (UNEF), in response to the Suez Crisis, to the first UN peace operation to administer a territory, the UN Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) in 1962 in West New Guinea (now Indonesia). While not all have included armed peacekeepers (as UNEF and UNTEA did), past General Assembly-mandated peace operations have undertaken the range functions that might be required to take forward the various proposals for humanitarian relief or ceasefire monitoring operations in Gaza. Past General Assembly-mandated peace operations have monitored ceasefires and overseen withdrawal of forces (UNEF), taken up policing, rule of law, and stabilization tasks (UNTEA, UNMIH), facilitated mediation and regional good offices (UNSMA, UNSCOB), monitored human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL) violations (MICAH, UNSMA, MINUGUA), and facilitated and coordinated humanitarian aid and support to refugees and those displaced (UNSMA). Although not extensive, General Assembly-mandated peace operations have also incorporated maritime operations and functions (notably UNEF), which might be necessary to carry out some of the proposals regarding Gaza for protecting (naval) humanitarian aid convoys, unblocking access, or directly carrying provisions by sea.

Peace operations can also have something of a mixed model, with the General Assembly authorizing the overall mission, but that mission later (when political conditions were more favorable) incorporating armed peacekeepers mandated by the Security Council. This happened with General Assembly-authorized operations in Guatemala and in Haiti. The General Assembly has also mandated missions jointly with regional organizations, for example one with the Organizations of American States in Haiti in 1993. This is an important but under-explored facet, given growing suggestions that perhaps given Security Council deadlock and budget cuts, the future of peacekeeping will be one in which missions are primarily led by regional organizations, rather than by the UN (but with Security Council and General Assembly political and financial support). The most recent example of a jointly authorized peace operation was the General Assembly’s authorization of a joint Special Envoy position for Syria in 2011 and 2012, jointly mandated with the League of Arab States. Notably, it was linked to a League of Arab States monitoring mission, which General Assembly resolutions also lent support to (A/RES/66/176; A/RES/66/253) after several Security Council vetoes.

This sort of mixed model and interoperability with regional organizations could be particularly relevant for some of the proposals for maritime relief or protection operations in relation to Gaza. Given that the UN does not have a standing navy, where UN peace operations have included maritime components, or where these have been authorized by the Security Council alongside other peace operations, they have often been provided by regional organizations or coalitions of multi-national Member States operating under color of this broader authority (for example, with EU and US-led multinational maritime missions around Yemen’s maritime borders). Thus it might be more likely that we would see a General Assembly-authorized peace operation that included naval functions if it was done in conjunction with a regional organization or some other already identified multinational coalition.

Some of the measures proposed for General Assembly intervention would not require a full peace operation, but simply an operational body capable of facilitating aid, taking preparatory steps toward a ceasefire or the monitoring of it, or taking on other conflict management tasks. The General Assembly also has the capacity to authorize other operational bodies short of a full peace operation, including those involved in coordinating or supporting humanitarian aid delivery. The longest running example of this is the agency at the center of the humanitarian and political storm in Gaza, UNRWA, which was established by General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) in December 1949. The size of UNRWA and length of its operations illustrates the power of the General Assembly to authorize and maintain quite substantial operational bodies.

These sorts of operational bodies can also be useful in bridging gaps when the Security Council is deadlocked. In the past, when Security Council missions lapsed, or when there was not yet sufficient support to authorize a new one, operational bodies mandated by the General Assembly have filled the gaps by taking up immediate monitoring or good offices tasks or engaging in the preparatory work that would lay the groundwork for future monitoring missions or operations. One example of this was a UN office in Afghanistan that picked up the tasks of a Security Council-mandated peace operations that lapsed in 1990, and was designed to lay the groundwork for future operations. It also included military advisors, but not armed peacekeepers.

There is a similar General Assembly origin story behind the other main UN office involved in Israel-Palestine issues outside of UNRWA, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO), which started as a General Assembly-appointed coordination position to boost good offices after the Oslo Accords. In the current context, some have suggested expanding UNSCO’s mandate to take on additional humanitarian, operational, or ceasefire support tasks. These proposals for expanding its mandate might also face blockages in the Security Council. Here again, the history of General Assembly engagement with peace operations is instructive: it has not only created peace operations, but also expanded the tasks and mandate of those created by the Security Council, as in Lebanon in 1958 and the Congo in 1960.

What is the Legal Basis for the General Assembly to Authorize a Peace Operation, and What are the Limitations? Is the Uniting for Peace Resolution Necessary?

The legal authority for the General Assembly to mandate these peacekeeping and operational bodies stems from its overall remit under the UN Charter to pass recommendations related to the “maintenance of international peace and security” and the peaceful resolution of disputes (Articles 10, 11, and 14 of the UN Charter), as well as its Article 22 power to create “subsidiary organs” or bodies. The peace operations bodies thus have the technical status of “subsidiary organs” to the General Assembly.

The General Assembly’s legal authority to do this was affirmed in the International Court of Justice’s 1961 advisory opinion on Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter) (which had been requested by the General Assembly in resolution 1731(XVI)). The opinion hinged on whether the General Assembly had the legal authority to mandate UNEF and to extend another peace operation in the Congo, or if these sorts of powers only resided with the Security Council; if the General Assembly had overstepped its powers under the Charter then the costs associated would not be valid “expenses of the Organisation.”

The ICJ’s opinion on this question offered what still stands as the most decisive articulation of the balance of powers between the Security Council and the General Assembly, with specific application to the question of authorizing peace operations. It offered that responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security conferred on the Security Council by Article 24 of the UN Charter was “‘primary,’ not exclusive,” and that “the Charter makes it abundantly clear that the General Assembly is also to be concerned with international peace and security” (Certain Expenses case, p. 163). It emphasized that while only the Security Council has mandatory, enforcement authority, this does not mean that General Assembly powers are “merely hortatory” but that its recommendations and decisions can “have dispositive force and effect” and could constitute taking or enabling “action” (Certain Expenses case, p. 163). As examples of General Assembly decisions that could result in “action,” the Court pointed both to the General Assembly’s budgetary authorities and to its Article 22 power to create subsidiary organs (Certain Expenses case, pp. 163, 165).

However, the Court did introduce one important legal limitation. Because the General Assembly does not have the mandatory, coercive power of the Security Council, peace operations or other subsidiary bodies mandated by the General Assembly can only deploy with the consent of the country involved. This has been interpreted as applying not only to the particular structure of peace operations but also to other bodies or individuals that might deploy on Member States’ territories to carry out their General Assembly mandate. For example, the General Assembly has also provided the authority for mediators or envoys undertaking good offices and diplomatic initiatives, or fact-finding bodies or investigators. Where they were not able to obtain consent (for example, to enter Hungary and Syria), these individuals or fact-finding bodies have had to perform their roles remotely. The same would undoubtedly apply to armed peacekeepers or protection services not embedded in a particular peace operation or “subsidiary body” structure, if they did not first obtain consent. The particular legal challenges of consent in the case of Gazan territory are explored further below.

How Does the General Assembly Usually Authorize a Peace Operation and is the Uniting for Peace Resolution Necessary?

When UN experts recommended a list of measures for the General Assembly in early September, at the top of the list was for it to: “Call on Member states to act under ‘uniting for peace’ in line with General Assembly resolution 377(V) and recommend a peace operation.” Other commentators have gone even further, framing the Uniting for Peace resolution as an under-utilized exception or loophole by which the General Assembly could step in to “mandate a UN protection force” where the Security Council will not. Neither view is exactly on point: the Uniting for Peace resolution is not necessary for the General Assembly to take up most of the proposals for it to take action on Gaza, but nor is it sufficient to cure all the legal issues that would prevent the most forceful of them.

The Uniting for Peace resolution (adopted in resolution 377(V)) is a special procedure created in 1950 in response to Security Council deadlock over the Korean War. It created a procedure by which the General Assembly can consider a matter immediately through an emergency special session where there has been a veto (or arguably threat of veto) in the Security Council in relation to a threat to peace or act of aggression. It is not automatic: it does not come into play whenever there is a veto. Either 9 members of the Security Council or the majority of the General Assembly have to vote to activate the Uniting for Peace resolution, and they have only done so 11 times. Where an emergency special session is called in relation to the Uniting for Peace resolution, it does not necessarily mean that the General Assembly will then pass a resolution, or even if they do, that they will meaningfully take up the provisions that triggered a veto.

Most importantly, the Uniting for Peace resolution does not create or unlock any special powers for the General Assembly, other than those already granted it under the UN Charter. It does not grant the General Assembly powers to do what the Security Council might have done had there been no veto (i.e. to issue a mandatory resolution). On the other hand, this also means that the General Assembly does not need to invoke the “Uniting for Peace” resolution ((A/RES/377A(V)) for it to authorize a peace operation.

As a matter of practice, General Assembly decisions adopted during Uniting for Peace-linked emergency special sessions have been the basis for mandating or extending the mandate of peace operations, including the two missions at issue in the Certain Expenses case (UNEF and ONUC) as well as the extension of a border monitoring force in Lebanon in 1958. But there have been as many instances of the General Assembly providing the mandate or other support to peace operations or related operational bodies outside of these emergency special sessions.

While the Uniting for Peace resolution doesn’t lend any additional powers, it does give political expediency and momentum, which can be helpful in getting over the collective action problem and inertia that can be the main block to getting new initiatives and resolutions through the General Assembly. As a result, considering some of these proposals in a reconvened 10th emergency special session (first convened in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution in 1997) would be the path of least resistance. As noted, to initiate an emergency special session requires that there first be a veto on a situation representing a threat to peace, and then a vote of 9 members of the Security Council or a majority of the General Assembly that the conditions of the Uniting for Peace resolution have been met. However, where the General Assembly has left an existing or prior emergency special session open, any Member State can request to the President of the General Assembly that it be reconvened at any time. This has happened repeatedly with the 10th emergency special session since it was first initiated in 1997. It was reconvened three times in the 79th session alone (the 2024-2025 period), directly in relation to the situation in Gaza – twice directly following vetoes in the Security Council but also in response to another matter for which there was not an immediate, precursor veto, responding to the ICJ’s July 2024 “Legal Consequences” opinion. The emergency special session remains ongoing and can be reconvened at any time, upon the request of Member States.

A last procedural point concerns the authorizing language: where the General Assembly has mandated peace operations or operational bodies in the past, how has it framed this in its resolutions? The UN experts’ proposal was that the General Assembly “recommend a peace operation.” Where the General Assembly has mandated a peace operation in the past, it has not “recommended” a peace operation but has simply “decided to establish” a mission, decided to “authorize the deployment” of the mission, or “requested” the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to set up the mission, or for the Secretary-General to “carry out the tasks entrusted” to him/her (where the mission scope is set out in another agreement or legal document). The General Assembly could of course recommend that the Security Council set up a peace operation (as was proposed by Member States recently), but among its many recommendations to the Security Council over the years (especially following vetoes), the General Assembly has not typically recommended that the Council establish a peace operation. In any case, given the number of vetoes on the Gaza situation, such a recommendation would likely not be taken up.

Would General Assembly-Authorized peacekeepers have the Necessary Level of Consent, Legally and Practically?

Because the General Assembly does not have mandatory or coercive powers, any peacekeepers, civilian missions, or operational bodies authorized by the General Assembly can only deploy to the territory with the consent of the State in question. As a matter of principle and standing practice, Security Council-supported peace operations also rely on the consent of the host State, but the Security Council’s Chapter VII authority at least allows for the scope for mandatory or coercive authority.

It is important to re-emphasize that a resolution being passed in conjunction with the Uniting for Peace resolution (through an emergency special session) does nothing to alter this fundamental consent requirement. The precedent-setting UNEF operation was authorized in connection with the Uniting for Peace resolution via the first emergency special session. And yet there were elaborate negotiations with the government of Egypt before the force was authorized, and again throughout its planning and deployment. Further, the ICJ noted the consent of Egypt in their analysis of the situation’s legality, and Egypt’s consent was a pivotal part of their conclusion that this was within the bounds of the General Assembly’s powers, as it meant that this action did not then constitute mandatory enforcement powers (Certain Expenses case, p. 170-171).

This means that even if the General Assembly authorized a “stabilization force,” monitoring mission, or a peacekeeping force to accompany relief convoys, it would need consent for those forces to enter the territory of Gaza. It seems unlikely given the restrictions on UNRWA and on other emergency aid over the last two years, that Israel would provide this consent. However, there is some legal ambiguity over whose consent would be required, and there are those who would argue that Israel is not in a position to withhold or offer its consent, or alternatively, to prevent delivery of humanitarian aid or the presence of UN agencies. The ICJ’s July 2024 “Legal Consequences” opinion offers some grounding for these arguments, but does not entirely settle the question. A matter currently under consideration by the ICJ as to Israel’s legal obligations with regard to provision of humanitarian and development assistance in Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) may flesh out this issue, depending on how the ICJ chooses to interpret the question. The opinion was requested by the General Assembly in December 2024, by resolution 79/232.

One legal theory for why Israel’s consent is not necessary would be that although Israel has “unlawfully” (in the words of the ICJ) occupied Gaza, this does not give it sovereignty over the territory, and thus the consent cannot come from Israel. In its 2024 “Legal Consequences” case, the ICJ offered detailed historical context on the status of the OPT, stretching back to the General Assembly Partition Plan proposed in resolution 181 (II) in 1948 (which proposed separate Israeli and Palestinian States), up to the 2024 resolution ES-10/23 determining that the State of Palestine is qualified for membership (paras. 51-71). The opinion also emphasized the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force and the fundamental rights of self-determination of the Palestinian people at multiple points. The Court concluded “that Israel is not entitled to sovereignty over or to exercise sovereign powers in any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory on account of its occupation” (para. 254). An argument could therefore be made that given that Israel is not the sovereign power, it is not for Israel to withhold or grant consent for peace operations with respect to the OPT, including Gaza, but that this authority resides with Palestinian authorities.

A second argument would engage not with this question of sovereignty but with Israel’s obligations as an occupying power. Under the Geneva Conventions and international law, the occupying power has the obligation to administer the territory for the benefit of the population, to ensure that basic needs of the population are met, and to ensure to the fullest extent possible that food and medical resources are available and adequate. The General Assembly’s request for an advisory opinion in resolution 79/232 appeared to reference this obligation, asking the Court to consider: “What are the obligations of Israel, as an occupying Power and as a member of the United Nations… to ensure and facilitate the unhindered provision of urgently needed supplies essential to the survival of the Palestinian civilian population as well as of basic services and humanitarian and development assistance, for the benefit of the Palestinian civilian population” (para. 10). This question is less pertinent to the issue of consent for a UN peace operation or operational body, but instead tests Israel’s scope to deny or obstruct the delivery of basic services and external delivery of humanitarian aid where the needs of the population in territories it occupies is not met. If the Court decided that Israel could not bar external assistance in such situations, then the General Assembly might choose to enable humanitarian responses further by determining that the basic food, medical and other humanitarian needs were not met (the General Assembly’s scope to exercise such a “quasi-judicial” function is discussed further below).

A third argument advanced by some is that restricting UNRWA’s operations violates the 1946 General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. While a slightly different legal issue, given that UNRWA is also a General Assembly-mandated “subsidiary organ” (an issue that few contest), the conclusions on this argument have direct bearing on what is required for authorizing (or not interfering with) General Assembly-authorized peace operations. Among its provisions the Convention on Privileges and Immunities protects UN property and assets as “inviolable,” free from search and seizure, as well as interference by administrative, judicial, or legislative action. A statement on behalf of the Secretary-General at ICJ hearings in April 2025 noted that violations of the privileges and immunities of UN personnel had occurred, and also noted the restrictions implicit in the October 2024 law passed by the Israeli Knesset as well as others (see also this letter by the Secretary-General on restrictions on UNRWA). Nonetheless, while the 1946 Convention protects the inviolability of UN personnel and property where they are lawfully authorized and have a legal basis to be there, it may not reach to the underlying consent issue. The ICJ was certainly aware of the 1946 Convention on Privileges and Immunities when it published its Certain Expenses opinion in 1962, and nonetheless insisted on consent for any General Assembly subsidiary body. This position would seem to suggest that there must first be a legal justification to have a General Assembly-mandated subsidiary body on the territory (and that given the General Assembly’s lack of coercive power, this hinges on consent); once the UN unit or body is legally there, certain rules and obligations are then implicated, including the inviolability protections of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities.

In its resolution 79/232 referral request to the ICJ, the General Assembly noted the Convention on Privileges and Immunities in the preamble and in some of the operative paragraphs (with respect to safety of UN personnel), but it did not reference the Convention in the direct question put before the ICJ. While no doubt a deliberate choice on the part of the Member States drafting the resolution, the ICJ could still decide to take up the issue given other references in the requesting resolution.

Regardless of whether any of these three legal theories were seen to prevail, any General Assembly-authorized forces or mission would undoubtedly face the practical challenge of lack of consent. Entry via Egypt or by sea without Israel’s consent raises an equally significant number of legal, political, and logistical challenges, full discussion of which is beyond the scope of this article.

Empty Promises or Legally Determinative Words? The Potential for other General Assembly Recommendations and Determinations to Shift the Situation

Mandating a peace operation is of course not the only recourse for the General Assembly. The other key demands by the UN experts were for the General Assembly to “[d]emand the opening of all the crossings to unrestricted humanitarian access under direct UN oversight,” demand the immediate suspension of all “failed or dangerous” mechanisms (presumably the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation), call on Member States to “deploy emergency navies carrying humanitarian aid,” request the “authorisation of UN-led international humanitarian convoys with full UN authority to coordinate and supervise all crossings into Gaza,” and demand “immediate, permanent ceasefire and the release of arbitrarily detained Palestinians and Israelis alike.”

Many of these reflect the regular content of General Assembly recommendations, and would be seen as fully within the scope of the General Assembly’s powers to recommend. Indeed, the last of their six recommendations, regarding a ceasefire and release of those arbitrarily detained, have already been taken up in two resolutions passed in the last session, in resolutions ES-10-26 and ES-10/27. However, as noted above, the General Assembly does not have mandatory or coercive power, even when acting in conjunction with the Uniting for Peace resolution. The General Assembly can certainly “demand” that border crossings be opened, or that UN aid convoys be authorized and allowed permission to enter, but this does not mean that they will be.

However, there is one other way that General Assembly resolutions – even if declarative or proscriptive in nature – might potentially alter the status or legal interpretation of the situation, in ways that might lend additional enforcement pressure. Scholars have identified a certain “quasi-judicial” role of the General Assembly, wherein the General Assembly’s determination of the facts surrounding a given situations can then influence subsequent judicial or legal proceedings (such as those before the ICJ or the International Criminal Court) or the way that other Member States interpret the legal obligations and respond accordingly. One example was the General Assembly’s 1967 declaration that South Africa’s claim to govern South West Africa (now Namibia) was terminated (A/RES/2145(XXI)), which effectively made it so. Henceforth, both the General Assembly and the Security Council referred to South Africa’s governance as an “illegal” ( see, e.g., A/RES/2372(XXII), S/RES/264). In a subsequent ICJ advisory opinion on “the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia,”, the Court found that the Assembly had the power to make such a determination.

Other examples raised by scholars include ICJ reliance on the General Assembly’s determination of the existence of “mass killings” or other atrocities in its finding that atrocity crimes had been committed (see, e.g., Barber, p. 33). In a similar vein, General Assembly determinations that the basic needs of the population were not met, and that the obligations of the occupying power had not been fulfilled, could buttress subsequent judicial findings about the obligation to admit external international assistance. Scholar Rebecca Barber has offered another theory for how this “quasi-judicial” or status-determining role could be used to overcome legal obstacles to providing humanitarian aid without host State consent. She argues that where there is overwhelming humanitarian need and a lack of host State consent, the General Assembly could determine a “state of necessity” with no other alternative but to provide humanitarian assistance given the exigence of the situation. On this rationale, the countermeasure of necessity would preclude the wrongfulness of the un-authorized humanitarian assistance.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1843518641.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 01:56:50.197924

It’s a busy time for the caucus, which is positioning itself to combat President Trump both on his immigration policies and other issues they say affect the quality of life for Latinos.

Garay, 31, describes the group as raising the voices of Latinos “from south Bronx to South Texas.”

“We’re going to continue to express how there is strength in our diversity, how we don’t just represent over 62 million Americans,” Garay said, pointing to estimates of the Hispanic population in the U.S., “but a growing pillar of democracy — how we cannot achieve economic well-being in America without Latinos. National security, infrastructure — we are so woven into the fabric of America.”

“The CHC moving forward is going to continue to emphasize that, but also defend those very values, because right now, there seems to be a sense of erasure of our community.”

Garay said she learned a lot about how to operate in Congress from her first boss and neighborhood representative, Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.).

“I think it really set the tone for what to expect here, and, most importantly, how to assert dominance in spaces where you know that not only does your academic and career experience matter, but your lived experience is an asset,” Garay said.

For Garay, that lived experience has included the struggles of a working-class Nuyorican family in developing Brooklyn, when a buyer of their apartment building raised the rent, forcing her family to relocate.

She later put herself through college while working an overnight shift at Gap, getting off work only to head to class, and getting through the day with the occasional nap at the library.

Garay said those experiences motivate her now as the caucus fights back against Trump’s effort to limit Medicaid and food stamps, programs she said were the difference during her childhood from her parents choosing between paying rent and putting food on the table.

The officials — including the city’s fiscal watchdog and state lawmakers — were among 77 people detained during protests at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan. The government building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Eleven officials were arrested inside the building while attempting to inspect holding rooms on the 10th floor that are the subject of ongoing litigation alleging squalid conditions and overcrowding, according to a coalition of politicians, advocates and faith leaders involved in the protest. They were given summonses and released. The building was later locked down because of a telephoned bomb threat, authorities said.

The officials had gone to the holding facility to see if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was complying with a preliminary injunction issued Wednesday that requires the agency to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, among other remedies, the coalition said.

But federal agents barred them from entering the holding rooms and arrested them as news reporters and photographers documented the scene. The arrests happened as the officials were conducting a sit-in in the hallway, encircled around a sign showing a slash through the word “ICE.” Agents bound their hands with plastic ties, lined them up against a wall and paraded them down a hall.

In a statement, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin singled out the city’s comptroller, Brad Lander. She accused the Democrat of showing up “unannounced with agitators and media” and yelling that he wouldn’t leave until detainees were released. Lander was previously arrested at the building in June after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain outside immigration court.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician pulling a stunt in attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees,” McLaughlin said, adding that “Lander’s obsession with attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically, must stop NOW.”

Another arrested politician, state Sen. Jabari Brisport, said immigration officials used zip ties to lock the doors to the holding areas and put duct tape over cracks to prevent them from seeing inside.

“What I saw on the 10th floor today was both disgusting and cowardly,” the Brooklyn Democrat said. After the immigration officials were finished, “they laughed, and I heard them laugh about what they were doing, and they should absolutely be ashamed of themselves.”

Outside, police arrested dozens of people, including politicians, advocates and religious leaders, who were protesting in front of a garage entrance used by vans transporting immigrants to and from the detention facility.

Other officials who were detained included the city’s public advocate, Jumaane Williams; Democratic state Sen. Julia Salazar; and City Council Member Tiffany Caban.

“A federal judge has indicated that the federal law is not being followed — the conditions are cruel and inhumane, that ICE is not respecting their rights,” Lander told reporters after his release. “And no elected official or other oversight agency has been allowed in to see it.”

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a preliminary injunction keeping in place requirements that the agency give detainees adequate space; thoroughly clean the cells three times a day; provide soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products; and make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

The injunction followed a temporary restraining order last month in the wake of a lawsuit that immigration and civil rights organizations filed on behalf of people held at the Manhattan facility. In court filings, detainees complained they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets.

But the court filing says that they were forced to go to Ghana “under the instruction or connivance of foreign and local actors” — meaning the United States.
The lawyers instead argued that once a migrant had been removed from the United States and was in foreign custody, the issue was out of their hands.

Fourteen people were taken from their cells in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and put on a military cargo plane to Ghana, with some claiming they were placed in straitjackets, according to legal filings. Three of the migrants have since been sent back to their home countries, and 11 remain in Ghana.

Ghana’s foreign minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, has said that the West African country took the migrants in on humanitarian grounds, in a spirit of pan-African solidarity.

But the court filing says that they were forced to go to Ghana “under the instruction or connivance of foreign and local actors” — meaning the United States. It also says they are being guarded by military personnel without having been formally charged and without access to local lawyers.

While defending the deportations this month, Justice Department lawyers did not dispute that Ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court-ordered protections. The lawyers instead argued that once a migrant had been removed from the United States and was in foreign custody, the issue was out of their hands.

“The United States is not saying that this is OK,” Elianis N. Pérez, a Justice Department lawyer, said during a hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. “What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”
