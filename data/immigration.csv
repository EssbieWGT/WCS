NINA MOINI: You heard us talking to our Ben Hovland just now. A lot of people have questions about what ICE has been up to recently. Like, who holds ICE accountable for any illegal activity, racial profiling, or use of force incidents? And though Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz have stated that federal immigration agents are clearly not welcome here, to them, it's not clear what action they're following up those statements with. So here to provide some insight on that is Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Thank you for your time this morning, or this afternoon.

KEITH ELLISON: Thanks for having me. Thank you very much.

NINA MOINI: I want to get right to asking you about a news conference that we are told that you'll be having later today. It says to talk about DHS future in Minnesota, saying you're going to be joined by some local area mayors. Can you tell us more about that?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, what I can tell you is that you're referring to a press conference that we're having a little bit later this afternoon. It wouldn't be right for me to tell you what I'm going to announce then, OK? But I will set the stage for you this way, that we are contemplating action, legal action, to protect and preserve the people of the state of Minnesota. We are going to announce how we are going to move forward to safeguard civil rights, human rights, the Constitution itself, the proper balance between the state government and the federal government.

We are going to talk about how overreaching federal government action is inappropriate and not contemplated by the Constitution. We're going to talk about-- and we're going to talk about what we're going to do about it.

So, you've been a reporter for a long time. What it means when people are going to do a press conference at a certain time. And I hope that you'll allow me-- I hope that, one, you'll come-- you're personally invited-- and that you'll allow us to make the announcement at the right and proper time.

NINA MOINI: I appreciate that.

KEITH ELLISON: Which is this afternoon.

NINA MOINI: And I understand where you're coming from, but I'm on the air, and I have this information that this is coming up, and that every minute has just been so critical for folks. So even 3 and 1/2 more hours, Minnesotans really want know, what is being done on their behalf? So, if there's nothing else you--

KEITH ELLISON: OK, I can answer that.

NINA MOINI: OK.

KEITH ELLISON: We're going to announce how we're going to take action to protect people.

NINA MOINI: OK. Who is responsible, Attorney General Ellison, for holding ICE agents accountable for any sort of illegal activity?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, Kristi Noem is. And the president of the United States is responsible for them. That's who is responsible. And in conversations often, you'll see somebody acting badly, breaking the law, violating people's human rights, breaking norms and common custom, and you'll see this bad conduct. And then the question is, how come somebody who is not doing it is responsible for stopping it?

Well, we are going to take action. We're going to talk about that today. But please, let's make sure the focus and the blame and the responsibility stay where it belongs, which is firmly and squarely with Donald J. Trump and the people who he has hired to carry out Homeland Security activities, which is Kristi Noem. That is who is responsible.

You ask me, who's responsible? That's who's responsible. But if they don't do their job, then it's our job to make them do their job. So that's what we're going to be talking about later today.

NINA MOINI: President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Noem have, of course, said that they feel their agents are just doing their job and that people should essentially stay out of their way and let them do their job, and then there won't be an issue. Obviously, a lot of people in the state of Minnesota feel that they need to be there observing what's going on. And obviously, we've been getting a lot of reports like we just heard from our own photojournalist, Ben Hovland, of just blatant racial profiling that people are telling us is going on against, oftentimes, US citizens, against anyone that is illegal. Correct?

So what should people do if they're in a situation like that? What kind of recourse do if they were just sitting in their car and somebody came up and asked them, are you a United States citizen?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to legal counsel. And I think you should exercise those rights. Absolutely-- absolutely, you should. You should if you get a chance to go to Know Your Rights-- [AUDIO OUT].

NINA MOINI: I think we've lost him. We're going to call him back because we want to get as much information for our listeners as we can.

I understand we have Attorney General Keith Ellison back on the line. Thank you for joining us again.

KEITH ELLISON: Sure. Sorry about that fall off. Anyway, where were we?

NINA MOINI: That's OK. The two things I really want to make sure that we're able to talk about is just the many complaints and different videos and things that are surfacing regarding use of force at different incidents or instances where people are encountering ICE agents, whether they be in an observer role or the person who's at the center of the questions being asked. So what can people do about that, realistically, if they feel that heavy use of force or things were way beyond the scope of what was necessary or reasonable?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, certainly, people can sue the federal government for violation of their civil rights. That absolutely is an opportunity people have. There are a lot of-- we have a good civil rights bar in Minnesota and around the country, who want to help people, very concerned. And so that's why I was urging folks before to make sure they take documentation, videotape, things like that. These will be very helpful.

If you don't have video, then make sure you write your recollections down quickly. Note your time, date, location, and what you saw. And make sure that you gather any evidence that could help prove your case. Because the civil-- the system of civil redress, meaning file a lawsuit. A civil rights case is still part of how we protect our rights in the United States and in Minnesota.

The other thing is that, look, as your state attorney general, I am watching this situation very carefully, and I am ready and prepared to take action. I'm hoping that you, Nina, will join us at 3:30 at the press conference. And I want everybody to pay attention to the announcement that we're about to make, because it is important. And it has everything to do with defending and protecting our rights as Minnesotans and as Americans. And so between the state government, between individual citizens taking note and seeking out legal counsel to file their own cases, there are things we can do, and we should do them all.

I also-- let me make a note, that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution says that people have the right to peacefully assemble. They have the right to redress grievances of their government. They have the right to freedom of the press. They have the right to freedom of faith. They have the right to freedom of expression. People have these rights and they should exercise them. They should exercise them peacefully, of course, but I think they should exercise them. Because I think that unless we do exercise them, we might send the Trump administration the signal that we're fine with the bad things that they're doing to our neighbors, and we're not.

And so I would say exercise your rights, seek legal redress in a private civil rights lawsuit, and continue to call on me to do what I can do to help. And we're going to be making some announcements in a very short period of time.

NINA MOINI: Just lastly, Attorney General, what you were talking about in your lane is that lane of judicial action and the court of law. I think people are-- a lot of people are really afraid. A lot of Minnesotans are driving around with their passports on them. I believe, Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her said she's carrying hers. If I come to the press conference this afternoon, I'm also carrying my passport with me now.

So I do wonder, in those moments, people want to be able to call their local police agency. We've heard from Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that he feels they're outnumbered. Mayor Jacob Frey said they are outnumbered and unable really to respond to these instances, which leaves people not knowing where to turn in the moment. What is your message to Minnesotans who are in fear right now? A fear that they may have not felt in their entire lives.

KEITH ELLISON: Well, they may have felt the same fear if they were living under a repressive government at one point in their life. I think that people, anybody who might have lived-- we do have some elderly people who may have some experience with totalitarian governments in places like Germany, Italy, and Spain, and Chile and Argentina and maybe even Venezuela. Those neighbors who know what it's like, they can tell us a lot.

But what I would say is don't let fear take over, because fear is of no assistance. What we need is action. What we need is-- we need people to not be fearful, but be thoughtful and think through what we're going to do, think through what you're going to do.

I personally am not bringing my passport, and I'm going to tell you why. I am a 10 generations in this country, and I'm just not doing that. Because even though I have a passport and I used it as late as last week, or-- I'm just not giving into that. Now, I don't recommend people do what I'm doing. I have my own reasons. But I think people, carrying your passport is a wise idea, is a smart idea.

But don't be fearful. Think of what we can do to counter this outrageous, unprecedented behavior by the federal government. And just remember, you're not alone. You're absolutely not alone. Make sure that you are in touch with people know you, love you, and want to take care of you. And know that we're here to-- at the AG's office, we're thinking constantly about what we can do to protect our fellow Minnesotans. And we'll be making an announcement at 3:30 today.

NINA MOINI: All right. And I guess, I will see you there since you invited me a few times. Thank you very much for your time. Really appreciate.

KEITH ELLISON: Personally, individually, please come.

NINA MOINI: All right. Thank you so much.

That was Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who says more news for us this afternoon at 3:30 about what actions our state leaders are taking on behalf of Minnesotans. And we'll obviously bring you the very latest on All Things Considered with Clay Masters at 3:00.

Immigrants rights groups and organizations cheered passage of the legislation on Monday.","From Camden and Cherry Hill to Trenton and the Jersey Shore, what about life in New Jersey do you want WHYY News to cover? Let us know.

On Monday, the final day of the current New Jersey legislative session, lawmakers in the General Assembly and state Senate passed three bills designed to strengthen public trust and safety in immigrant communities across the Garden State, and to protect them from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and roundups.

To become law, the legislation must be signed by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy before he leaves office Jan. 20. New Jersey has the second-largest immigrant population in the country after California.

The Safe Communities Act requires the state attorney general to develop a plan for how sensitive locations such as public schools, health care facilities and houses of worship would interact with federal immigration authorities without deterring community members from seeking services or engaging with them.

The act mandates that the commissioners of Community Affairs, Children and Families, Health, Human Services, Education and Corrections, as well as the administrative director of the courts, adopt the attorney general’s model policies, or policies to provide greater protection for community members, and to prominently display them in public-facing areas.

The Privacy Protection Act limits the collection and sharing of data by federal government and health care entities to ensure that Jersey residents are not discouraged from seeking necessary services.

The third measure codifies the attorney general’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which draws a clear distinction between state, county and local law enforcement officers — who are responsible for enforcing state criminal law — and federal immigration authorities, including ICE, who enforce federal civil immigration law. The bill limits the voluntary assistance that state law enforcement officers may provide to federal authorities. The directive, which is designed to foster trust between police and community members, has withstood legal challenges by state and federal courts since it was issued in 2018.

All three bills were championed by state Sens. Pat Diegnan, Gordon Johnson, John McKeon, Raj Mukherji, Teresa Ruiz, Britnee Timberlake and Andrew Zwicker, and state Reps. Joe Danielsen, Verlina Reynolds-Jackson, Ellen Park, Eliana Pintor Marin and Gabriel Rodriguez.

Immigrants rights groups and organizations cheered passage of the legislation on Monday.

Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, in a statement called the trio of bills “a hard-earned victory for efforts to free ourselves from the tyranny of mass detention and deportation.” She said as the legislation moves to the governor’s desk, “New Jersey is one step closer to becoming a place where fear no longer dictates people’s lives.”

“These bills strengthen limits on local cooperation with ICE, including a major improvement: ending collaboration based solely on a final order of removal,” said Katy Sastre, executive director of First Friends of New Jersey and New York, in a statement. “That will help keep families together.”

Nedia Morsy, director of Make the Road New Jersey, said in a statement that communities no longer can trust the federal government to keep them safe.

“The murder of Renee Nicole Good is all the proof we need that ICE is a threat to all of us,” she said. “That’s why legislation like this is so important.”

Hazel Applewhite, CEO of the Ironbound Community Corporation, said in a statement that the fear of ICE raids keeps many families in Newark’s Ironbound neighborhood from accessing the services they rely on.

“From children missing school to seniors and survivors avoiding essential support,” she said, “this legislation allows families to safely get the help they need and ensures our neighborhoods can rebuild and remain connected.”

“We are Jersey brave, and we chose to love our neighbors, because that’s what faithful people do when fear is loud,” said Charlene Walker, executive director of Faith in New Jersey. “We grieve what this victory cannot repair: the lives already shattered, and the loss of Jean Wilson Brutus, whose name we will not let be forgotten.”

During legislative debate, several Republicans voiced opposition to the three bills, saying they protected criminals and ignored the rights of New Jersey residents.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/police-ice-agent-file.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:57:07.234812

The raids and protests continue across the country, including in Southern California.

Social media posts on Monday alerted residents to ICE activity around Los Angeles, including near the Eagle Rock Plaza.

Residents in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood said an immigration arrest occurred on Friday. Video of the incident shows a person on the ground being placed in handcuffs.

A woman who asked that her face and name not be shared said the man seen being taken away by immigration agents is her godfather, Rafael.

She and other neighbors say Rafael has been a fixture in the neighborhood for about 40 years, collecting recyclables and doing handyman work.

She noted that family and neighbors have hope that Rafael will be OK as they try to secure an attorney for him.

The goddaughter said Rafael saw immigration agents chasing two other men, became scared and ran. Rafael was the one who was caught and taken into custody.

Over the weekend in Downey, immigration agents detained nearly a dozen people. In a written statement to Eyewitness News, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, ""On January 10, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) conducted a targeted immigration operation in Downey, California, resulting in the arrest of 11 illegal aliens from Mexico and El Salvador that have all broken the immigration laws of the nation.""

In another incident in Downey, video shows the attempted detention of two landscapers.

Witnesses say two landscapers were confronted and grabbed by what appears to be immigration agents as they tried to take them into custody. As neighbors began to come outside, the landscapers were released, and the agents drove away.

In the video, an agent inside a car was seen pointing a gas canister at people on the street who were filming.

Neighbors say one of the landscapers has a green card and has lived in the U.S. for 40 years. The other has a valid work permit that he was carrying with him at the time.

Eyewitness News spoke with Victor Correa, who shot cellphone video of the Downey arrests.

""Stay active. Be vigilant. Be an active witness. Create awareness. Don't be afraid to get up close. Now obviously, don't interfere, but make sure that you're trying to see why they're detaining them, if they have a warrant, ask the people what their name is. Because if they are detained, we want to get their information so we can pass it along to their families. We don't want this happening anymore in our city,"" Correa said.

In a statement, Downey councilmember Mario Trujillo said the city was not given any warning that immigration agents were coming in this weekend, and he noted that city police are not helping immigration agents.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18393368_011226-kabc-local-ice-arrests-tn-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-12 23:57:22.951951

That push – accentuated by the outrage over a Minnesota woman being killed by an ICE officer this week – will probably mean more protests and potentially more violence against journalists.
The Freedom of the Press Foundation tracks arrests and assaults against journalists and found that last year there were 172 alleged assaults against journalists, most from law enforcement at protests concerning the administration’s immigration policies.
Gabe Rottman, vice-president of policy for the Reporters Committee, said the confrontations also occur because DHS officers do not receive enough training on how to interact with journalists.
“Should disputes arise over ICE treatment of journalists … it will behoove us to have tried.”","After a year in which US journalists faced a dramatic increase in violence from law enforcement, news organizations and advocacy groups have recently tried to better protect reporters through outreach to the Department of Homeland Security.

Over the last four months, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a collection of New York news outlets have sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security attempting to open dialogue to reduce confrontations between law enforcement officers and journalists at protests, especially over efforts to deport alleged undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration recently announced that it hired thousands of new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and will escalate operations this year as part of its deportation efforts that DHS is coordinating.

That push – accentuated by the outrage over a Minnesota woman being killed by an ICE officer this week – will probably mean more protests and potentially more violence against journalists. It’s unclear if the messages to the DHS will help keep journalists safe.

“We don’t know if ICE is going to step up its immigration efforts in New York – that depends on a lot of political factors – but we certainly have seen it happen [elsewhere], and the way ICE has conducted itself in those cities gives some cause for concern that not having those channels of communication is bad for everybody,” said Carroll Bogert, CEO of the City, a New York news outlet, who wrote a letter in December to DHS officials.

The Freedom of the Press Foundation tracks arrests and assaults against journalists and found that last year there were 172 alleged assaults against journalists, most from law enforcement at protests concerning the administration’s immigration policies. From 2022 to 2024, there were 175 alleged assaults.

The foundation states that it only reports “incidents that can be verified by first-person accounts or cross-referenced by multiple news sources”.

Part of that increase is, of course, because there have simply been more protests.

Gabe Rottman, vice-president of policy for the Reporters Committee, said the confrontations also occur because DHS officers do not receive enough training on how to interact with journalists.

That includes instructions on enforcing a dispersal order, Rottman said.

“It’s crucial that officers be trained to permit journalists to remain on the scene even when they are issuing a dispersal order,” Rottman said. “The law enforcement response needs to be tailored to the unlawful activity that’s occurring, and if journalists are on the side not obstructing police operations, then as a first amendment matter, they may have a right to remain.”

Also, whereas the Department of Justice has news media guidelines, the DHS does not, Rottman said.

In 2024 the justice department worked with the Reporters Committee to establish recommendations on police and media interactions at mass demonstrations. These include directives that journalists wear credentials and that law enforcement allow the media to “position themselves in a safe location” and only clear the area when necessary for public safety.

“Even if there is cause for the detention, when the journalist says, ‘I’m press, I’m press,’ the officer [should be] trained to give the journalist a chance to establish that they are, in fact, journalists and then let them go,” Rottman said.

Ryanne Mena, a Southern California News Group reporter, was struck with a pepper-ball bullet allegedly fired by a DHS agent while covering a protest in Los Angeles. A day later at a protest, another DHS officer allegedly fired a rubber bullet that struck her in the head and caused a concussion.

Both times, Mena wore press credentials.

She and others filed a lawsuit against DHS to prevent officers from “using unnecessary and excessive violence to prevent them from exercising their first amendment rights”.

A federal judge issued a temporary injunction in September, ruling that DHS officers cannot legally disperse anyone “they know or reasonably should know is a journalist” without probable cause to believe that the person committed a crime “unrelated to failing to obey a dispersal order”.

“Under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protesters, legal observers and journalists,” the judge stated.

The DHS appealed, claiming that the measure to protect journalists from dispersals could “expose officers to someone who wishes to harm them or damage federal property just by wearing fraudulent press credentials”.

In October, the Reporters Committee sent the letter to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, seeking a meeting and asking the agency to adopt an “arrest avoidance” policy like the justice department.

“By making supervisory officials in the field immediately available to review the detention of individuals who present evidence of their identity as a journalist, law enforcement agencies avoid unnecessary conflict,” the letter states.

Last month, the City and seven other news organizations also sent a letter to the DHS. Questions included: “What are the agencies’ current training protocols regarding interactions with the press when enforcement activity is ongoing?”

The DHS did not respond to either letter, according to the senders.

When the Guardian asked the DHS about the letters, assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in an email, focused on dangers ICE officers face and claimed that there had been a 1,150% increase in assaults against them. The Los Angeles Times and National Public Radio both found that the increase was actually about 25%.

“We remind members of the media to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots and remind journalists that covering unlawful activities in the field does come with risks – though our officers take every reasonable precaution to mitigate those dangers to those exercising protected first amendment rights,” McLaughlin stated.

Immigration reporters will probably be busy this year.

“We’ve got 10,000 new ICE agents coming on board” and “morale is high”, Gregory Bovino, a border patrol official, told Fox News. “2026 is going to be huge.”

As such, will the outreach make any difference?

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says she's sending additional federal law enforcement agents to Minnesota.

LEILA FADEL, HOST:

Coming up, we'll speak with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey about his response to the move, which comes after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in his city last week. First, though, let's get the latest information on the deployment and on the protests this Minneapolis killing has sparked in the city and across the nation.

MARTÍNEZ: Joining us from Minneapolis is NPR's Jason DeRose. Jason, so OK - additional forces. What do we know about these forces that Noem is sending?

JASON DEROSE, BYLINE: Well, Noem says she's moving many more Homeland Security agents into Minnesota. Here she is speaking on Fox News Sunday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KRISTI NOEM: There'll be hundreds more, and in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely.

DEROSE: She says some have already arrived. Others will arrive today. But some elected officials here are pushing back against DHS actions, including U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar. She's demanding a full investigation into Renee Good's killing. Also, A, U.S. representatives had normally been allowed to visit ICE detention centers unannounced, but Omar says she was turned away over the weekend. Now, Homeland Security, according to a memo obtained by NPR, now says it requires elected officials to give seven days' notice to enter a detention center. So overall, as someone who knows the area and has been here for a few days, tensions are pretty high. You hear sirens and helicopters throughout the day and night, and people are really on edge.

MARTÍNEZ: That neighborhood where the shooting took place - I mean, how are people feeling there?

DEROSE: Well, there is a lot of fear there, but there's also a lot of care for neighbors. I want to play this piece of tape for you from a singing and walking vigil from Sunday afternoon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) I am not afraid. I will stand for liberation 'cause I know...

DEROSE: Several hundred people gathered at a church not far from last week's killing and then walked about a mile loop around the neighborhood, singing to their neighbors to bring some comfort and encouragement. And as they walked, A, they stopped from time to time in places where ICE agents had detained people recently, and they kept a moment of silence at each of those places.

MARTÍNEZ: You know, there is a lot coming at Minneapolis right now - the killing of Renee Good, the larger immigration actions there. So tell us - I mean, you cover religion, Jason. What has been the response from communities of faith?

DEROSE: Well, you know, A, here in Minneapolis, people of faith have really taken the lead in working to counter what they believe to be unjust actions by the Trump administration around immigration enforcement. In a statement over the weekend, Renee Good's wife said that Renee was a Christian whose faith motivated her work. That's also true of Minneapolis resident Carol Hornbeck, a family therapist. She says she's been thinking a lot about a verse from the hymn ""How Firm A Foundation.""

CAROL HORNBECK: I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, and sanctify to thee thy deepest distress so that the hardest thing becomes holy.

DEROSE: Hornbeck says the idea that her resistance work is hard but holy is what's giving her strength and resolve right now.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, what are you going to be looking for in the next few days?

DEROSE: Well, as those additional federal agents arrive, I'll be looking to see what they're actually doing on the ground, and I'll be watching how community members who oppose ICE's presence respond to these increased federal forces. They've been patrolling neighborhoods and alerting people with whistles and chat groups about where ICE agents are. Will they continue to think that kind of work is enough, especially since ICE is now responding so aggressively, using pepper spray and, as of last week, deadly force?

MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Jason DeRose in Minneapolis. Jason, thanks.

DEROSE: You're welcome.

Allies of President Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states.

The challenges align with parts of Trump’s agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants’ privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit’s intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

“This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,” Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees’ association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of “a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process” if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump’s agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump’s agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president’s social media post.

Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to exclude noncitizens from the apportionment process. That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, healthcare and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau’s defense in both cases, despite the intervenors’ concerns.

In the Louisiana case, Justice Department lawyers argued against lifting the hold, saying the Census Bureau was in the middle of planning for the 2030 census: “At this stage of such preparations, lifting the stay is not appropriate.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5e57d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4007x2104+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd8%2Fba%2F44a3757443bbba17c25f561849ee%2Fc9d0c9f94b1147e397eb973bcabab65e.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 21:11:46.701410

Jason Crow’s staff show the immigration detention center in Aurora is close to hitting its newly increased population capacity.

About 1,200 people were in custody at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at the end of September. The facility recently increased its capacity from 1,360 to 1,530 detainees, and while Crow’s office did not get an exact number, ICE staff on Jan. 5 told Crow staff the facility was “slightly below capacity.”

Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. Crow, an Aurora Democrat, attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s policy that requires at least a week’s notice for members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities. But after Minnesota lawmakers were denied access to an ICE facility in Minneapolis Saturday, Democrats asked the judge for an emergency hearing.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy that requires seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits, saying facilities funded through last year’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act do not need to comply with a 2019 appropriations law that allows for unannounced visits at facilities that hold immigrants.

The Jan. 5 report from Crow’s office says the Aurora facility’s segregated transgender pods were consolidated into one pod, which holds “a few transgender detainees.” Other transgender individuals were moved to the general population, the report says. It also says “grandfathered” transgender detainees continue to receive gender-affirming medical care at the facility.

Much of the information Crow’s office asked of ICE was not made available, and facility staff redirected his team to the ICE Office of Congressional Relations.

ICE did not respond to a request for information on the Aurora facility’s population, including the care available for transgender individuals.

The Aurora facility, privately run by The GEO Group for ICE, is the only ICE detention center in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado show that the Trump administration contracted with The GEO Group in December to run another ICE detention center out of a dormant prison in Hudson.

Federal ‘occupation’ Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region.","SPRINGFIELD — Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, seeking to severely limit immigration agents’ authority in the state after accusing the feds of unleashing an “organized bombardment” to coerce state and local officials to change their immigration policies.

State and city leaders want to end the feds’ “roving patrol” policy of interrogating people they encounter on the street about their citizenship and immigration status without any probable cause. They’re also seeking to limit crowd control tactics such as using tear gas to disperse nonviolent crowds and to prevent the feds from scanning the biometric information of state residents.

“Border Patrol agents and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers.”

Raoul, along with the city of Chicago, filed the 103-page lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. It accused the federal government of applying pressure over policy differences through means such as withholding federal funds, attempting to deploy the National Guard and, most disruptively, executing an immigration enforcement operation described by state officials as “causing turmoil and imposing a climate of fear.”

It also seeks to prevent immigration enforcement at “sensitive locations” without “appropriate reasoning,” including courthouses, schools, social service organizations and medical facilities. And it seeks to bar immigration agents from “trespassing” on private property to make arrests, in violation of the 4th Amendment. The suit argues immigration agents only have the authority to do so within 25 miles of a U.S. Border to prevent illegal entry to the country.

The state is asking the court to find that the federal government’s “menacing, violent, and unlawful incursion” violates the 10th Amendment, and to order federal agents to stop using tactics that exceed their statutory authority.

‘Unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations’

Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement in support of the lawsuit, writing that “in the face of the Trump Administration’s cruelty and intimidation, Illinois is standing up against the attacks on our people.”

“Today, Illinois is once again taking Donald Trump to court to hold his administration accountable for their unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations, and flagrant abuses of power,” Pritzker said.

The lawsuit names, among others, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino — the public face of DHS’ Operation Midway Blitz immigration enforcement campaign — as defendants.

Much of the lawsuit pulls from claims brought in an earlier suit by media organizations and protestors who challenged the feds’ use-of-force tactics. The plaintiffs motioned for the case to be reassigned to the same judge in that challenge, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, according to reporting by the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times. Previously, she issued an injunction against use of force in that case, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed it.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois in a statement the latest suit was “baseless.”

“The fact is that sanctuary politicians in Illinois and Chicago released violent criminals including murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists, onto its streets and their dereliction of duty cost lives—just ask Katie Abraham’s father,” McLaughlin said, referring to a 20-year-old Glenview woman who was killed in a hit-and-run crash last year allegedly by a Guatemalan in the country without legal authorization. “This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.”

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a similar lawsuit Monday seeking to block a surge of immigration enforcement in that state. It comes less than a week after an ICE agent shot 37-year-old American citizen Renee Nicole Good at close range while she was apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop.

‘Campaign of coercion’

The Illinois lawsuit claims that Midway Blitz is part of a “campaign of coercion” by the Trump administration attempting to force state and local governments, including Illinois and the city of Chicago, to change their sanctuary immigration policies.

The state’s TRUST Act, signed by then-Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017, generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with immigration enforcement unless a federal criminal warrant is presented.

Chicago has had “sanctuary city” status since 1985.

The state and federal policies are meant to foster trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by ensuring that interactions do not result in immigration detention or deportation. But these policies, which predominate in the nation’s blue states and blue cities, have been the target of ire from the Trump administration, which has accused state and local jurisdictions of impeding their mass deportation goals.

Trump sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last year seeking to invalidate the state and local policies, but the challenge was dismissed by a federal judge in July, who found that they were protected under the 10th Amendment.

Federal ‘occupation’

Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region. The department claims that it has resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants in the country without legal authorization.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview.

Confrontations initiated by immigration officers resulted in two shootings, including one with deadly consequences, during the height of Midway Blitz. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park in September after he attempted to flee a traffic stop. In October, a federal agent shot Marimar Martinez five times in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. She survived and the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago has dropped all charges against her.

Characterizing it as a federal “occupation” of a sovereign state, the suit accuses the feds of sending armed immigration agents to roam city streets to question people about their citizenship status, capture and retain biometric data without consent, arrest people without a warrant or probable cause and deploy tear gas and other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods and trespass on private property — all while concealing their identities with face masks and covering up license plates.

The suit includes a laundry list of documentation, alleging, for instance that federal agents deployed tear gas and other chemicals without warning at least 49 times in 18 separate incidents in Chicago over a 90-day period in 2025.

And following the launch of a “plate watch” hotline in late October, at least thirty-five distinct license plates were reported being swapped or used on more than one federal vehicle operated by Border Patrol or ICE, according to the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, which sent a “cease and desist” letter to DHS in October over the practice.

Return of Midway blitz?

While Midway Blitz has wound down in recent weeks, federal officials have been teasing a return with even larger numbers of agents in March. The filing includes Bovino stating, “Don’t call it a comeback; we’re gonna be here for years.”

The state is asking the court to bar Border Patrol agents from conducting civil immigration enforcement in Illinois, arguing that they are “not authorized or trained for large-scale removal enforcement in the interior of the United States.”

It’s also asking a judge to declare that tactics such as roving patrols, warrantless arrests, deploying tear gas and swapping plates, at least in this context, are in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs want those tactics barred in the future.

The lawsuit is just the latest in a litany of litigation between the state and federal government. Raoul has filed or joined in more than four-dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration over the past year, challenging everything from cuts to congressionally appropriated state funding to Trump’s now-aborted push to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago over the strenuous objections of Illinois’ elected leaders.

Actions like those, Raoul alleged in the latest lawsuit, are part of the Trump administration’s “coercion” campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court preventing the deployment of troops in Illinois. The underlying case Is still working through the courts, though Trump late last month dropped plans to deploy troops to American cities.

The federal government filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated. Like the latest lawsuit, the case largely rests on the 10th Amendment.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7c0da8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1140x599+0+81/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F17%2F6a%2Fe9bad3274999b773cad48a12ef41%2Fcni-lawsuit-1-12-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 21:11:56.663333

“DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas.
“My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said.","The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, announced a lawsuit on Monday against the federal government, seeking to end the surge of ICE agents in the state.

The lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials comes in the aftermath of an ICE agent fatally shooting resident Renee Nicole Good behind the wheel of her vehicle last week, leading to protests across the city, and country.

“We allege that DHS’ use of excessive and lethal force, their warrantless, racist arrests, their targeting of our courts, our churches, houses of worship and schools, our violation of the administrative procedures act on arbitrary and capricious federal actions. And we ask that the courts will end the surge of thousands of DHS agents in Minnesota.”

“The deployment of thousands of armed DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is in essence a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said during a press conference, noting the shutdown of schools and the closure of local businesses. “This surge has made us less safe.”

A motion for a temporary restraining order will be filed today ahead of the lawsuit, said assistant attorney general Brian Carter.

Ellison described the federal agents as poorly trained, and contrasted them with the training of Minneapolis police, noting that local police have had to respond to 20 instances of ICE agents’ apparent abduction of Minneapolis residents.

“They’re making unconstitutional arrests and using excessive force,” Ellison said. “DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas. And when asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they respond, ‘We don’t need one.’ This has to stop. Let’s be clear; this should have never started.”

In the press conference, AC Thompson of PBS Frontline asked if the lawsuit aimed at restraining the use of crowd control weapons. “My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said. “Are you aiming to do anything about them?”

Ellison encouraged Thompson to file a complaint and “make sure people know what happened to you and your crew … The press is protected by the first amendment and is vitally important in this moment when freedom of the press and every first amendment right is under a threat.”

Ellison noted that Minnesota’s noncitizen immigrant population is just 1½ percent, “which is half the national average. Our state’s percentage is lower than Utah, Texas, and Florida’s,” he said, suggesting that the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota out of political bias.

Ellison also alluded to Minnesota and its Somali immigrant population coming under vitriolic attacks from the White House and rightwing media after a series of social services fraud cases drew conservative attention in recent weeks.

“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to like our state very much,” Ellison added.

The Twin Cities’ response to a surge of thousands of federal agents has taxed the law enforcement capacity of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, each of which has about 600 police officers, said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis.

“We don’t use the word invasion lightly,” he said. “The stated reason of this federal government for bringing in this full invasion of ice and border control is not safety. If it were safety, there would be other mechanisms to achieve safety.

“If this were about fraud, then you’d see an invasion perhaps of accountants. But that’s not what you see. What you see is people being indiscriminately taken off our streets.”

Kaohly Her, mayor of Saint Paul and a Hmong-American immigrant, also spoke at the conference and said she was now carrying her passport card and ID with her all the time.

“Because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained,” she said. “When I’m going to be approached, the fact is that the tactics don’t even at this point really matter right? It’s the fact that we are being attacked as American citizens right now.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7bc3582438a7018ee6707c3f4b655dd67290f4/83_0_4472_3577/master/4472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=418d3fe6e0a494a5f4126a455a043eee",N,,2026-01-12 21:56:51.763365

In December, those members of Congress won their lawsuit challenging a Department of Homeland Security policy from June that required a week’s notice from lawmakers before an oversight visit.
Now they’re accusing Homeland Security of having “secretly reimposed” the requirement last week.
In a Jan. 8 memorandum, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote that “Facility visit requests must be made a minimum of seven (7) calendar days in advance.

In December, those members of Congress won their lawsuit challenging a Department of Homeland Security policy from June that required a week’s notice from lawmakers before an oversight visit. Now they’re accusing Homeland Security of having “secretly reimposed” the requirement last week.

In a Jan. 8 memorandum, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote that “Facility visit requests must be made a minimum of seven (7) calendar days in advance. Any requests to shorten that time must be approved by me.”

The lawmakers who challenged the policies are led by Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) and include five members from California: Reps. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), Raul Ruiz (D-Indio) and Norma Torres (D-Pomona).

Last summer, as immigration raids spread through Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California, many Democrats including those named in the lawsuit were denied entry to local detention facilities. Before then, unannounced inspections had been a common, long-standing practice under congressional oversight powers.

“The duplicate notice policy is a transparent attempt by DHS to again subvert Congress’s will...and this Court’s stay of DHS’s oversight visit policy,” the plaintiffs wrote in a federal court motion Monday requesting an emergency hearing.

On Saturday, three days after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, three members of Congress from Minnesota attempted to conduct an oversight visit of an ICE facility near Minneapolis. They were denied access.

Afterward, lawyers for Homeland Security notified the lawmakers and the court of the new policy, according to the court filing.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs wrote that “rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

“This is unacceptable,” they said. “Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will.”

Congress has stipulated in yearly appropriations packages since 2020 that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens.”

That language formed the basis of the decision last month by U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, who found that lawmakers cannot be denied entry for visits “unless and until” the government could show that no appropriations money was being used to operate detention facilities.

In her policy memorandum, Noem wrote that funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which supplied roughly $170 billion toward immigration and border enforcement, are not subject to the limitations of the yearly appropriations law.

“ICE must ensure that this policy is implemented and enforced exclusively with money appropriated by OBBBA,” Noem said.

Noem said the new policy is justified because unannounced visits pull ICE officers away from their normal duties. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions,” she wrote.

The lawmakers, in the court filing, argued it’s clear that the new policy violates the law.

“It is practically impossible that the development, promulgation, communication, and implementation of this policy has been, and will be, accomplished — as required — without using a single dollar of annually appropriated funds,” they wrote.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a51b352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4876x2560+0+346/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F12%2Ff1119cbb464781ce238f7421b35a%2F1509457-la-me-protest-raids-jja-0015.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 20:57:12.159838

""And creates more, seems like more of a kind of a political conflict of all the appropriations bills.""","The Senate took its first step toward averting a government shutdown, but there’s still a long way to go on an increasingly shorter path to keep the lights on in Washington, D.C.

Lawmakers advanced a $174 billion, three-bill package through its first procedural hurdle on Monday evening with an 81-14 vote, teeing up a vote to send the tranche of funding bills, known as a minibus, to President Donald Trump’s desk later this week.

The package, which easily sailed through the House last week, similarly cruised through the key test vote on a wave of bipartisan support — a sign that neither party wants to thrust the government into another shutdown just months after the longest closure in history.

HOUSE PASSES NEARLY $180B FUNDING PACKAGE AFTER CONSERVATIVE REBELLION OVER MINNESOTA FRAUD FEARS

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., noted that Senate Democrats weren’t looking for another shutdown last week and said that ""Democrats want to fund the appropriations, the spending bills, all the way through 2026.""

""We want to work in a bicameral, bipartisan way to do it and the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us,"" Schumer told ABC Sunday morning.

While the successful procedural vote acted as a good sign for final passage of the package, it doesn’t mean that lawmakers are completely out of the woods when it comes to preventing another shutdown.

They have until Jan. 30 to fund the rest of the government, and some in the Senate believe that they won’t have time to finish their work before the deadline. That means another continuing resolution (CR) will likely be in the cards.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said a short-term funding bill is inevitable.

DEMOCRATS' LAST-MINUTE MOVE TO BLOCK GOP FUNDING PLAN SENDS LAWMAKERS HOME EARLY

He noted that, so far, the Senate has only passed three funding bills. If the latest package is successful, that would put lawmakers at the halfway mark of the dozen bills needed to avert a shutdown.

""Of course there's gonna be a short-term CR,"" Kennedy said. ""There's gonna be a CR, it's just a question of how big is the CR going to be?""

There is another, smaller funding package that could soon make its way through the House. But the $77 billion two-bill bundle that includes funding legislation for Financial Services and National Security still won’t be enough to prevent a shutdown.

Notably, the package lacks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill, which was supposed to be included. That bill is a perennial headache for lawmakers and often acts as a lightning rod for political enmity.

CONGRESS ROLLS OUT $174B SPENDING BILL AS JAN 30 SHUTDOWN FEARS GROW

""The DHS bill is always one of the most difficult ones,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. ""And creates more, seems like more of a kind of a political conflict of all the appropriations bills.""

Following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minnesota last week, that political division reached another level.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, argued that what happened to Good ""has crystallized for the American people the real danger that exists out there in the way that ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] are operating.""

Murphy suggested that he would want to see constraints built into the DHS bill that deal with CBP, such as beefed up training for officers.

""I understand we have to get Republican votes,"" Murphy said.

The Trump administration has said that fraud of public programs is a driving factor behind the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.","Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration to stop its latest immigration enforcement surge, alleging that the increased federal actions are unconstitutional and a violation of federal law.

Attorney General Keith Ellison at a Monday press conference called the immigration enforcement surge an “invasion.”

“The deployment of thousands of armed, masked (Department of Homeland Security) agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said.

Tensions between federal agents and protesters continue to escalate following the Wednesday killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross.

The suit alleges that the influx of federal agents under the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” harms Minnesota’s police powers and violates state sovereignty, according to the lawsuit. These rights are guaranteed under the 10th Amendment, the lawsuit states.

(The 10th Amendment argument was once used by Jim Crow states that resisted civil rights laws, but Ellison and the cities are seeking to use the oft-derided 10th as a tool to protect civil rights.)

Ellison and the cities are also alleging that the federal agents are using unreasonable force against Minnesotans and arresting people without warrants, regardless of their immigration status and based on their perceived race — violations of the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

Illinois and the city of Chicago on Monday also filed a similar lawsuit against the Trump administration. Illinois is suing over allegedly unlawful tactics used by Customs and Border Protection and ICE agents in the state.

The Trump administration will likely fight the Minnesota and Illinois lawsuits.

Cities and states in the past have sued the Trump administration to stop the deployment of National Guard troops. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that bars the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois.

But the high court has let immigration officials arrest people based on their appearance and what language they speak, with the court’s conservative super-majority consistently giving Trump wide latitude to exert executive power.

The Trump administration has said that fraud of public programs is a driving factor behind the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.

But Ellison said that stopping fraud is a pretext for the Trump administration to punish its political opponents.

“The real reason — it’s no secret. Donald Trump and his administration have been targeting people, cities and states that don’t agree with him politically,” Ellison said. “The Trump administration’s decision to target Minnesota and Twin Cities is motivated by a desire to retaliate against Trump’s perceived political opponents.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:57:59.478573

On Jan. 8, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a new, nearly identical policy reinstating the seven-day notice requirement for members of Congress to visit an immigration detention center.

A dozen House Democrats, led by Neguse, are continuing to argue in federal court that the new policy violates federal law. Neguse and his colleagues originally filed a lawsuit in July against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arguing that they have a constitutional duty to conduct oversight on how funds appropriated by Congress are spent.

“In December, a federal court acted to restore members of Congress’s ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people,” Neguse and his colleagues said in a statement. “Now, rather than comply with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

The new policy came days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis. Media reports have identified the woman as Renée Good, a U.S. citizen and 37-year-old mother of three who was born in Colorado.

Despite the federal judge’s order temporarily blocking the earlier policy, Neguse and his colleagues said they were only notified of the new policy after three members of Congress from Minnesota attempted to conduct oversight of an immigration detention facility near Minneapolis.

“This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly,” Neguse and his colleagues said. “It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, comes days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good in her car as she blocked the road.

State Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a press conference that federal agents during the surge have arrested peaceful bystanders, detained U.S. citizens and fired chemical irritants at demonstrators and others exercising their First Amendment rights, including outside a local high school. The lawsuit calls on the Trump administration to end its immigration crackdown in the state.

""Thousands of armed and masked DHS agents have stormed the Twin Cities to conduct militarized raids and carry out dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional stops and arrests in sensitive public places, including schools and hospitals—all under the guise of lawful immigration enforcement,"" the lawsuit says. The complaint also alleges that immigration agents have engaged in racial profiling.

In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Ellison of ""prioritizing politics over public safety,"" and called the allegations of racial profiling false, saying, ""Law enforcement uses 'reasonable suspicion' to make arrests, as protected under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.""

""President Trump's job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,"" McLaughlin said. ""That's what the Trump administration is doing; we have the Constitution on our side on this, and we look forward to proving that in court.""

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in Minnesota, and that number is expected to increase.

On Monday, an NPR reporter witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people about their immigration status. Some took place in the parking lots of big box stores.

""Are you a green card holder? Do you have it on you?""

Those were some of the questions federal immigration agents asked Joel Keleekai as he was charging his Tesla in a parking lot.

It's unclear why U.S. Border Patrol agents chose to question Keleekai and other drivers who were also charging their vehicles. All of them were people of color. All of them were able to prove they were in the U.S. legally after showing documentation.

Keleekai, who is a permanent U.S. resident, told NPR he knew this could happen given the number of immigration agents in the state and the amount of time he spends driving every day.

""We don't want this to escalate. As you see, ICE is going around and people are getting killed,"" he said. ""We just gotta do our best out here to make sure that we live to see tomorrow.""

In a statement, DHS's McLaughlin said, ""ICE does not randomly arrest people or conduct operations without specific objectives. Nor does federal law enforcement execute operations without undergoing proper procedure, such as securing warrants when necessary.""

These tactics are highly unusual. In the past, immigration enforcement agencies had focused on targeted operations. But the Trump administration has appeared to have shifted its tactics and, in Minnesota, become even more aggressive with its immigration crackdown.

Vice President JD Vance said in a press conference recently that immigration agents were also going door to door in an attempt to find undocumented immigrants.

The Trump administration's efforts are receiving fierce backlash from local public officials, and people in Minneapolis.

Residents are organizing in group chats and trailing immigration agents, honking their horns and making noise, alerting their neighbors of ICE's presence and migrants of their rights.

In a separate incident witnessed by an NPR reporter, a man who was on his way to work was briefly detained and asked questions about his legal status.

The man asked NPR to identify him by his initials of M.A. because he fears for his safety for speaking to the media. He said he was born in Somalia, but is a U.S. citizen. He was released by immigration agents.

""I know my rights here — I'm a U.S. citizen, I'm legal here, I've been over 25 years here,"" M.A. said.

Things seemed chaotic Monday in the Minneapolis region. Immigration agents could be seen in many places driving in unmarked vehicles.

A particularly tense exchange happened Monday afternoon in South Minneapolis. Immigration officers in a vehicle rear-ended a resident's car.

An NPR reporter was on the scene shortly after the incident and could see the rear left side of the car damaged.

The driver, Christian Molina, told NPR he and his wife Lorena, both U.S. citizens, were driving separate cars on their way to drop one off with a mechanic when he saw immigration agents engaging with another person.

Molina said he stared at them before they started chasing him.

""They don't have a reason to stop me, they are not the police,"" Molina said in Spanish.

After federal agents ran into his vehicle, Molina said the agents kept asking him about his immigration status. He refused to give them an identification;Molina told the federal agents he would only give his drivers license if Minneapolis Police officers showed up.

Molina said the federal agents left after running his license plate and confirming his identity.

Lorena, the wife, said she felt scared.

""I felt like I had the need to talk to the officers and say, 'Hey, please ignore whatever he's saying, let him live!'"" she said.

Christian Molina said he is not afraid of immigration agents.

""They are abusing their power,"" Molina said.

Trump administration increases migrant detentions, aims for more deportations

DHS says death rate aligns with historic norms amid rising detentions

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Four migrants died while in custody of U.S. immigration authorities over the first 10 days of 2026, according to government press releases, a loss of life that followed record detention deaths last year under President Donald Trump.

The deaths included two migrants from Honduras, one from Cuba and another from Cambodia, and occurred from January 3-9, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Trump administration aims to ramp up deportations and has increased the number of migrants in detention. As of January 7, ICE statistics showed that the agency was detaining 69,000 people. The numbers were expected to rise following a massive ICE funding infusion passed by the U.S. Congress last year.

At least 30 people died in ICE custody in 2025, the highest level in two decades, agency figures showed.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, called the high number of deaths ""truly staggering"" and urged the administration to shutter detention centers.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the rate of deaths had remained in step with historic norms as the detention population has climbed.

“As bed space has expanded, we have maintained (a) higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens — including providing access to proper medical care,"" McLaughlin said.

The Cuban detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration on the grounds of Fort Bliss in Texas.

ICE said it was investigating the death of Lunas, adding that officials said he had become disruptive and placed him in isolation. Officials later found him in distress, and emergency medical technicians pronounced him dead, ICE said.

The two Honduran men - Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, and Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, 68 - died in area hospitals in Houston and Indio, California, on January 5 and 6, respectively, both following heart-related issues, ICE said.

Parady La, a Cambodian man, 46, died on January 9 following severe drug withdrawal symptoms at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, ICE said. The administration began using that space last year, it said.

The Trump administration has greatly reduced the number of migrants released from detention on humanitarian grounds, a move critics say has driven some to accept deportation.

In addition to the in-custody deaths, an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota mother of three last week, an incident that sparked protests in Minneapolis and cities around the country.

Reports on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.","WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has threatened to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over Congressional testimony he gave last summer about a Fed building project, an action Powell called a ""pretext"" to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy.

The development in the long-simmering effort by President Donald Trump for greater control over the Fed had immediate fallout, with Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee that vets Presidential nominees for the Fed, saying in a statement on X that the threatened indictment puts the Department of Justice's ""independence and credibility"" in question. Tillis said he would oppose any Trump nominees to the Fed, including the president's coming choice of a new chair, ""until this legal matter is fully resolved.""

Powell revealed the subpoenas and threats in a Sunday night statement.

""On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June,"" Powell said. ""I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law.""

""But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure"" for lower interest rates and more broadly for greater say over the Fed, he said.

""This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role...Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.""

Trump told NBC News Sunday that he had no knowledge of the Justice Department's actions. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” Trump said.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the case but added: “The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.”

POWELL INQUIRY A 'LOW POINT' IN TRUMP PRESIDENCY

Trump has demanded the Fed cut rates sharply since resuming office in January, blaming its policy for holding back the economy and musing about firing Powell despite the legal protections ostensibly covering the Fed chair from removal. He is also trying to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in a case that is now pending before the Supreme Court.

The independence of central banks, at least in setting interest rates in order to control inflation, is considered a central tenet of robust economic policy, insulating monetary policymakers from short-term political considerations and allowing them to focus on longer-term efforts to keep prices relatively stable.

The inquiry into Powell “is a low point in Trump's presidency and a low point in the history of central banking in America,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “Congress did not design the Fed to reflect the president's daily fluctuations, and because the Fed has rebuffed President Trump's efforts to take the Fed down he is launching the full weight of American criminal law against its Chair.”

Financial markets reflected little change in near-term expectations for Fed policy even after Powell's term as chair ends in May, with rate-futures continuing to price in two rate cuts for the year.

The dollar fell and U.S. equity futures slid on the latest news, but the moves were relatively modest so far.

LATEST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES MARK TURNING POINT?

The subpoenas and statement by Powell mark a stark shift in the now longstanding battle between Trump and Powell. Trump elevated Powell to the chair's job during his first term, but quickly soured on him and made his opinions clear in a series of rebukes and threats.

Powell, for his part, had largely eschewed comment on the president's actions or statements, instead acknowledging that chief executives often express opinions about a variety of issues, and pledging, as he did in the Sunday statement, to ""continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do.""

However, the Trump administration's latest moves, coming within months of the end of Powell’s term as chair in May, appear to have marked a turning point, with Powell directly accusing the administration of using the legal system to try to achieve its goal of getting the Fed to lower interest rates further and faster than the central bank's body of 19 policymakers feels is appropriate.

While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he has the right to continue on the Fed board until January 31, 2028, depriving the president of an additional Fed appointment - what would be Trump's fourth on the seven-member board - until near the end of his term.

The White House began early last year criticizing the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two of its buildings in Washington, describing it as overly costly and ostentatious.

Some analysts at the time did call it a pretext for the Trump administration's pressure campaign for lower interest rates, but Powell did not. The Fed chair instead posted detailed explanations of the work on the central bank's website and sent letters to members of the Trump administration providing background.

In June, when Powell gave his usual twice-yearly testimony on monetary policy to Congress, he was asked repeatedly about the work, which he explained as being necessary updates to outdated infrastructure. In July Trump made a rare presidential visit to the site, and Powell gave him a tour.

“For months, I have sounded the alarm about threats to Americans’ private data,” said Larson. “It is not just external bad actors we have to fear. It is the Trump Administration itself.

The Boy Scouts organization, now called Scouting America, said after the court's action on Monday that it can now continue compensating abuse survivors and improving its scouting programs without the cloud of bankruptcy and litigation.

""When you're in bankruptcy, you don't do a lot of investment in anything but getting out of bankruptcy,"" Scouting America CEO Roger Krone said in an interview.

The Supreme Court turned away an appeal by 75 plaintiffs of a lower court's decision rejecting their claim that the bankruptcy deal ‌improperly prevented them from suing other organizations that were partly liable for the abuse.

The settlement already has paid about $300 million ​to abuse survivors, and work will resume on claims evaluation and payment now that the appeals are over, Krone said. Scouting America's settlement trustee, Barbara Houser, is working to add more funds to the total settlement by suing insurers and selling assets belonging to the organization that include paintings by Norman ‍Rockwell and Joseph Csatari.

""For the survivors who are worried about there being adequate funds, there are significantly more funds that will be available to the trustee than the $2.46 billion that she has today,"" Krone said.

Outside of bankruptcy, Scouting America also has worked to modernize its scouting programs and improve safety for the digital age by taking steps such as updating ⁠its training to prevent online predation and introducing more modern reporting tools such as an anonymous text hotline for abuse allegations, Krone said.

Joshua Schwartz, a ‍lawyer whose law firm Eisenberg, Rothweiler, Winkler, Eisenberg & Jeck is co-counsel to more than 9,500 Boy Scouts abuse survivors, said the Supreme Court's decision will allow the settlement trust ‌to access $1.65 ‌billion in funds that had been held in escrow during the appeal.

""Now that the appeals process is over, the plan of reorganization that was voted on and approved by survivors is no longer in jeopardy,"" Schwartz said.

An attorney representing the 75 petitioning abuse survivors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The settlement, reached in 2022 in bankruptcy court in Delaware, granted immunity from lawsuits to those organizations in exchange for contributions to the Boy Scouts bankruptcy settlement. ⁠The Supreme Court later ruled that bankruptcy ⁠courts lacked the power to ​wipe away lawsuits against organizations that contributed to settlements but did not file for bankruptcy themselves, but its decision did not apply retroactively to older cases like the Boy Scouts bankruptcy.

After a federal judge ruled against the plaintiffs, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.

Scouting America, as well as insurers and abuse survivors who ‍support the deal, had urged the Supreme Court not to take the case, arguing that upending the settlement would have devastating emotional and financial consequences.

The appeal was supported by other abuse survivors who did not join the petition to the Supreme Court. A group that said it represented 1,000 former Boy Scouts had urged the Supreme Court to take up the ​case and allow abuse survivors to have their day in court.

The Boy Scouts filed for ‍bankruptcy in 2020 after several U.S. states enacted laws allowing accusers to sue over decades-old abuse allegations, which led to a flood of new lawsuits.

The Supreme Court previously declined to halt the settlement ​in 2024, instead allowing the deal to move forward while the appeals proceeded in lower courts.

“Over the last week, we’ve seen federal agents arresting, threatening, and using force against innocent bystanders,” he said, via X.
“They have carried out enforcement actions in schools, at hospitals, and in one horrific instance, shot and killed someone.","(NewsNation) — Minnesota is suing the Department of Homeland Security to stop the surge of immigration officers being sent to the state, Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Monday.

The lawsuit comes as the Department of Homeland Security is preparing to send 1,000 additional immigration officers to Minnesota, with hundreds expected to be deployed as soon as Monday, sources told NewsNation.

“We believe the Trump administration is targeting Minnesota because of our political views,” Ellison said, calling the lawsuit a First Amendment issue.

The state is filing a temporary restraining order and asking for immediate relief in court on Tuesday, officials said.

Ellison said the targeting of Minnesota is unconstitutional and a violation of federal law that has caused harm to the state. The lawsuit asks the court to end the surge of agents to the state.

“The deployment of thousands of masked agents to Minnesota has done our state harm,” he said.

Ellison noted the impact on schools and local businesses amid the surge, along with the impact on local law enforcement, who have had to deal with the aftermath of ICE operations rather than focus on other public safety concerns.

“When asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they say we don’t need one,” Ellison said of the conduct of federal agents.

He pushed back on the Trump administration’s statements that deportations are targeting the worst of the worst, saying many of those arrested are not dangerous criminals. Ellison also pushed back on the idea that agents are there to help investigate fraud, noting that the state would accept the help of forensic accountants when it comes to combating fraud.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey joined Ellison to announce the lawsuit.

“What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement,” he said.

Frey pointed to videos he says show as many as 50 agents arresting one person, in what he called a disproportionate action. He pushed back on the administration’s justification for the agents, including public safety and fraud.

“If this were about fraud, you’d see perhaps an invasion of accountants,” Frey said.

In terms of fraud investigations, Ellison noted the fraud unit of his office was continuing to work on fraud investigations, acknowledging there is resource pressure, but said his office can “walk and chew gum” and is continuing fraud investigations along with fighting DHS actions.

Ellison and Frey called the actions political, noted that there are higher populations of people without documents in other states, including Florida, Texas and Utah, where there have not been similar actions.

“We will not stand idly by and let this happen,” said St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her. “We are fighting back in every way we can.”

She joined Ellison and Frey in condemning the actions and decrying the damage being done to Minnesota communities.

Noem rebukes Minnesota lawsuit

In a statement to X, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem rejected accusations by Minnesota’s Democratic leaders.

“For years, these corrupt, activist politicians have refused to protect Minnesotans and are now proposing illegal actions to keep their stranglehold on control and continue stealing from American citizens,” Noem wrote.

“We will root out this rampant fraud, we will arrest the criminal illegal aliens hurting Americans with impunity, and we will hold those who aid and abetted this criminality accountable.”

DHS has surged thousands of agents to Minnesota

There are already 2,000 agents in the North Star State responding to protests after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, a motorist who federal officials claim was trying to run over law enforcement.

But people contesting that narrative have taken to the streets in Minnesota — and across the nation. Lawmakers in Minnesota maintain Good was simply trying to leave the scene when Ross fatally shot her.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, barred from working alongside the FBI or accessing its evidence, was spotted at the scene of the shooting on Monday.

Local officials are helping “with the collection, cataloging and preservation of video or other evidence” related to the shooting, a bureau spokesperson said.

“What you are witnessing is part of that process and nothing more. The BCA is not conducting its own investigation,” the spokesperson continued.

Residents report ICE encounters on the street

Christian Molina told NewsNation he was taking his car to the mechanic when ICE hit his car to stop him.

“I took a left, and they turned the siren on, but I kept on going,” he said. “I took another left, and that’s when they hit my car.”

Molina, a U.S. citizen, said it didn’t feel safe in Minneapolis.

“They didn’t even run my plates. They saw me going back to the side, and they started chasing me for no reason,” he said. “That’s like an abuse of power. They can just pull up on anybody?”

After he was stopped, Molina said the officers ran his plates and released him.

Arrests ramp up as ICE presence interferes with schools

As of Monday, DHS has made more than 2,000 arrests since its “Operation Metro Surge” began in Minnesota. That’s up from 1,500 arrests three days prior, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

Increased ICE presence has led to canceled classes and remote learning options, and Education Minnesota, a union representing K-12 teachers, has demanded that enforcement take place far away from schools.

At Roosevelt High School on Monday, roughly 700 of the 1,400 students participated in a walkout.

“Yesterday’s actions by ICE in Minnesota — including the shooting of a community member, the unjust detention of a Minnesota educator, and the use of pepper spray on students — are unconscionable in a civil society,” union president Monica Byron said last week.

Renee Good’s death sparks continued protests across US

The fallout from Good’s shooting death has expanded from Minnesota to other U.S. metros, with more than 1,000 protests in small towns and big cities over the weekend. One hotbed for demonstration — Portland, Oregon — is still reeling from its own shooting by federal agents.

A day after Good’s death, federal border agents shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland during a traffic stop. The federal government said the pair were linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, but protesters have challenged those claims and the agents’ use of force.

In Minnesota on Sunday, officers deployed several rounds of flash bangs, pepper spray bullets and tear gas canisters into a crowd of protesters after giving a final warning to disperse.

“We just got pepper-sprayed. I can feel it in the back of my throat. I know we’re saying bad words and we’re screaming insults, but we’re not here to fight, we’re not here to throw hands, we’re not here to shoot people like they are,” protester Caroline Wilson told NewsNation.

Law enforcement arrested multiple people in Minneapolis over the weekend as protesters called for ICE to leave the city.

ICE ‘never about safety’: Walz

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized ICE operations in his state following the announcement of the lawsuit against DHS.

“Over the last week, we’ve seen federal agents arresting, threatening, and using force against innocent bystanders,” he said, via X.

“They have carried out enforcement actions in schools, at hospitals, and in one horrific instance, shot and killed someone.

In December, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb stayed a DHS policy that required members of Congress to provide seven-days notice before visiting such a facility after the group of lawmakers filed suit, pointing to a provision of law that prohibits immigration officials from requiring advance notice for congressional tours.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Jan. 8 issued a memo reinstituting a seven-day notice requirement. Department officials provided this document to the court on Jan. 10, which was the same day that three House Democrats from Minnesota were denied entry to an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis.

The lawmakers’ attempted visit followed the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.

Noem in the memo argued that the new policy does not conflict with the judge’s order because she specified that funding for its implementation should only come from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which provided billions for ICE. The statutory requirement regarding congressional access to immigration detention facilities, on the other hand, is part of appropriations bills that annually fund agency operations.

She also criticized surprise congressional tours of ICE facilities.

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” the secretary wrote. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions.”

Attorneys from Democracy Forward and American Oversight, two nonprofits that are representing the members of Congress, however, contended that DHS hasn’t proven that it is only using One Big Beautiful Bill Act funding to implement the seven-day notice directive.

Dozens of agents and officers wearing tactical gear and masks covering their faces fired pepper balls and tear gas to disperse a growing crowd of protesters chanting “shame, shame, shame” and telling agents to “get the f--- out.”

The scene showed how tensions are flaring up in a community grappling with Good's death as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to deploy hundreds of additional federal officers to Minnesota this week amid nationwide outcry and protests.

“We’re sending more officers today, and tomorrow they’ll arrive. There will be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,” Noem told Fox News.

The fatal shooting has aggravated tensions in Minneapolis and around the country and intensified scrutiny of federal government operations in the state.

Outside a growing makeshift memorial that sprouted on the exact spot where Good was shot, resident Mileesha Smith said, “I believe that my neighborhood is traumatized.

""We are hurting. We are mourning,” Smith said, describing fear and confusion among residents who were worried about what comes next amid an increase in immigration enforcement.

Community group chats alerted people near East 35th Street and Park Avenue of an incident involving immigration officers, Minneapolis residents at the scene told NBC News.

Crowds of observers quickly gathered at the intersection, blowing whistles and honking horns to warn others of the presence of Border Patrol agents at the intersection.

Minneapolis resident Maggie Wood was among them. She said that 20 minutes before she saw the alert on her community group chat, two immigrants approached her as she strolled around her neighborhood and thanked observers like her for the support.

“This is Minneapolis. We are here to support each other,” Wood said.

But on Monday afternoon, what initially started as an effort to monitor enforcement activity at the intersection turned into a protest, in which demonstrators were tear-gassed and pepper balls were used to break the crowds.

""I decided to not be a monitor anymore and just to be an active protester,"" Jamie Schwesmedl said.

Noem was clear that the operation in the state is now focused not just on finding immigration law breaches but also on tackling anti-ICE protesters.

“We’re going to continue to if they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that’s a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,” she said.

Separately, Noem defended her characterization of Good as a terrorist. Asked whether Good was, in fact, trying to flee, Noem said on CNN that video ""showed that this officer was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized it.""

Eyewitness videos show Good in her SUV on a suburban street in Minneapolis talking to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as her wife talks to officers outside the car. Video that appears to have been recorded on a cellphone belonging to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good, captures the moment he fires multiple rounds into the car just after it starts to move.

An eyewitness told NBC News last week that he was surprised to hear the shots and that he didn't think the car was going to hit anybody.

Minneapolis has become a key focus of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, driven by his dislike of local leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz; a years-old fraud scandal; and repeated derogatory comments about the local Somali population, which he has described as ""garbage.""

About 2,000 federal agents — more than three times the number of officers in the Minneapolis Police Department — have already deployed to the state.

Noem, Trump and other government figures have maintained that the ICE officer who shot Good was acting in self-defense and within the law.

Noem accused local leaders of corruption Sunday and said Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were not cooperating, prompting the surge in ICE officers.

Walz said in the aftermath of the shooting that people shouldn't believe the government's ""propaganda machine,"" and Frey told NBC News on Sunday that the evidence contradicts the government's claims.

Both men have expressed doubts that the FBI investigation into the incident will have a fair outcome after local law enforcement officials were removed from the process.

Asked whether he believed deadly force was necessary, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Good was ""highly disrespectful of law enforcement"" and part of a group of ""professional agitators.""

NBC News contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to request any further comment; neither agency had replied by the time of publication.

The state and cities filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday, along with a request for a temporary restraining order to halt the enforcement action or limit the operation.

The Department of Homeland Security says it's surging more than 2,000 immigration officers into Minnesota, and that it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the city since the push began last month. ICE has called the Minnesota surge its largest enforcement operation ever.

The lawsuit alleges that Operation Metro Surge violates federal law because it's arbitrary and capricious, since it says other states aren't seeing commensurate crackdowns. And while the Trump administration says it's about fighting fraud, the lawsuit says ICE agents have no expertise in combatting fraud in government programs.

The lawsuit says the federal government is really targeting Minnesota over politics, which it says is a violation of the First Amendment.

Also, Monday federal officers fired tear gas to break up a crowd of whistle-blowing bystanders in Minneapolis who showed up to see the aftermath of a car crash involving immigration agents, just a few blocks from last week's fatal shooting.

A crowd emerged to witness a man being questioned by agents who had rear-ended his car. Agents used tear gas to try to break up the group, then drove off as people screamed, ""cowards!""

It was another tense scene following the death of Renee Good on Jan. 7 and a weekend of more immigration enforcement sweeps in the Minneapolis area. There were dozens of protests or vigils across the U.S. to honor Good and passionately criticize the Trump administration's tactics.

Gov. Tim Walz and his wife Gwen visited the memorial to Good, 37, on the street where she was shot in the head and killed while driving her SUV.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot her, saying Good and her vehicle presented a threat. But that explanation has been widely panned by Walz and others based on videos of the confrontation.

Christian Molina, a U.S. citizen who lives in Coon Rapids, said he was driving to a mechanic Monday when agents in another vehicle followed him, even turning on a siren.

Molina said his rear bumper was hit as he turned a corner. He refused to produce identification for the agents, saying he would wait for local police.

""I'm glad they didn't shoot me or something,"" Molina told reporters.

Standing near the mangled fender, he wondered aloud: ""Who's going to pay for my car?""

Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, federal authorities filed charges against a Venezuelan national who was one of two people shot there by U.S. Border Patrol on Thursday. The U.S. Justice Department said the man used his pickup truck to strike a Border Patrol vehicle and escape the scene with a woman.

They were shot and eventually arrested. Their wounds were not life-threatening. The FBI said there was no video of the incident, unlike the Good shooting.

For the Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, it was a tragedy foretold. Just 24 hours before Renee Good was shot to death inside her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, Chief O’Hara had warned that the combustible relationship between federal immigration officers and the residents of his city could end in tragedy.

He was right.

For today’s episode of “The Daily,” I spoke with Chief O’Hara about his experience with ICE in Minneapolis, which significantly changed in early December when the Trump administration began its immigration operation in the city. The presence of ICE agents, O’Hara told me, immediately complicated policing in a city where the relationship between the police and the community is notoriously difficult — the same city where, nearly six years ago, a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, setting off a wave of national protests against police brutality. In the interview, Chief O’Hara describes how his department has tried to navigate the aggressive tactics of ICE agents — and the fallout from the shooting of Ms. Good.

This conversation was edited for clarity.

Chief O’Hara, thank you for making time for us on a Sunday.

Sure, thank you for having me.

The past 48 hours have been pretty extraordinary. There were these enormous protests. I believe you yourself ended up in the middle of one of them. What has this been like for you?

So, what happened was that we had a protest start outside a hotel where people believed federal law enforcement might be staying.

They believed ICE agents were staying there.

Right, exactly. During the course of that protest it sort of transitioned into an unlawful assembly. And a woman drove her car onto a sidewalk, and the police were called to respond. So while the police were there dealing with regular police work, suddenly they realized they had become surrounded by this crowd and were unable to drive out.

I was in the area with other police officers, and we quickly ran in to back the crowd out and make a path for the police car, and I think that may have contributed to emboldening an already unruly crowd. We quickly called more than 200 additional police officers, and then ultimately wound up placing 30 people under arrest for unlawful assembly and later releasing them.

But this is a situation that has been building up for several weeks. A lot of the disturbances and chaos that have been happening here, as a result of the manner in which some federal enforcement activity is happening, is requiring our officers to respond to situations and try and restore the peace — situations where oftentimes they themselves then become the target of people’s frustration.

The reason we’re talking to you specifically is because of what an ICE agent did in Minneapolis last week: shot and killed a Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. At this point, millions of people have watched the video of that shooting. But there was a lead up to it that a lot of us didn’t watch, and that was the arrival of a large number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents starting in early December.

So that’s where I want to begin. Take me back to that period for you as police chief. What was your understanding of why the president decided to send these agents to your city?

At the time, in early December, it seemed like the public messaging was largely political. And it was a result of a real problem that does exist in the state, and that is a problem with fraud. Dozens of people have been prosecuted by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney’s office here in Minnesota.

You’re referring to the fraud that had been specifically highlighted in the Somali community in Minneapolis, and I do want to talk about the president’s message when he decided to send specifically immigration officers to Minneapolis. He was pretty explicit about his thinking. In his mind, the Somali population in the city, which is sizable and well known — he said it was a community of troublemakers who should be deported. And I wonder what you made of that, and if it felt like that had been your experience as chief.

Well, I grew up in New York, and I was a police officer for over 20 years in Newark, New Jersey. But I had not known any Somali Americans until I moved to Minnesota.

And the Somali Americans that I have met here, including many of whom are police officers in this city, have been incredibly welcoming of me. So from a personal perspective it was just bizarre, because the overwhelming majority of people from that community are American citizens.

From a crime perspective, was anything the president was saying true?

Well, there is a real problem with fraud in this state, and unfortunately that is sort of lost now in all of this political rhetoric and extreme reactions that occur.

You’re drawing a distinction between fraud and traditional street crime.

Yeah. Those cases of fraud that were brought about led to dozens and dozens of prosecutions, which were led by the U.S. attorney’s office here in Minnesota, as well as the F.B.I.

Got it. So in your mind, was this planned deployment, specifically of the ICE agents that the president asked for — was it warranted?

I mean, there has been immigration enforcement conducted in Minnesota as long as there has been ICE. I think the problem is what gets lost in this is — it’s not necessarily about which laws are being enforced, it’s about how that enforcement is happening.

To the extent that there are well planned, preplanned, targeted enforcement against people who are violating the law — I think all of law enforcement can very clearly get behind that. But to the extent that things are being conducted that may not be well planned — using tactics that generally are not viewed as sound — that may unnecessarily endanger the lives of both law enforcement officers and the community.

So it sounds like for you, it’s not the fact of ICE coming, it’s the way that ICE came.

Correct.

Let’s talk about that. After the president deployed immigration agents to Minneapolis, how did their operations start to affect the police department that you run?

So we’ve just gotten a pretty dramatic increase in 911 calls from people in the community related to a lot of the street enforcement that’s happening. And it’s things like: People are being arrested, and their cars are left — sometimes left in the roadway, sometimes blocking the street, and in one case left when it wasn’t even placed in park and was rolling down the road. We had another time where there was a dog in the car, and they left the dog in car.

Wow.

Even this morning, we’ve gotten calls for individuals who were pepper-sprayed by ICE. It’s just a variety of calls that we then have to manage and triage that were not happening before.

And how does that sudden influx of 911 calls complicate your policing?

It complicates things because we remain significantly understaffed. This is the Minneapolis Police Department. The majority of the cops that worked here in 2020 have left. We remain one-third below what had been typical of staffing for the police department here today, while at the same time dealing with a much higher level of serious street crime than what had been normal in the past.

I mean, you’ve been talking around this, and I think we should just make this extremely explicit: that you become police chief in Minneapolis just two years after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd — a moment of extremely low morale for the department and really high levels of distrust of the police department by the community,

Yes.

And when you took this job, you called Minneapolis “ground zero for a global reckoning on policing,” and put in place sweeping reforms to try to rebuild trust, to try to repair relationships between the police and residents. Give us a couple of examples of the reforms that you put in place and that are presumably being challenged by ICE’s presence.

So, we have placed an emphasis on use-of-force, on employing de-escalation and on the use of critical decision-making practices. We have held dozens of community meetings to get input as we revise our policies. And I think it all boils down to trying to fight crime in a way that earns community trust, as opposed to alienating people.

And from what you’re saying, suddenly all of that work is confronted with an outside group of federal law enforcement officials complicating this entire project that you have overtaken as police chief.

Absolutely. And we’re trying to heal this community, we’re trying to heal the men and women officers who remain here. It’s already the most scrutinized police department in the nation. And I can tell you, the cops here? We’re human beings. And I worry that we might hit a breaking point.

It feels as if the residents of Minnesota are taking it upon themselves to monitor ICE agents and their activity; they’re shadowing ICE agents, they’re texting each other, they’re blowing whistles. And it’s amounting to a pretty meaningful effort to counter these enforcement operations. Do you find yourself wishing that the residents were not doing that? Do you try to discourage it?

Well, I can tell you — the role of the police and law enforcement in the United States is first off to protect life, but it’s also to ensure people’s human rights and their constitutional rights. And people in this country have a First Amendment right to observe, record and object to government activity, and that includes the activity that Minneapolis police officers do. So it is a challenge, but it’s a challenge that policing in America has been dealing with and trying to improve upon. It does add a level of complication to our work.

I want be clear though: I’m not asking for federal law enforcement to do anything differently than what I expect the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department to do.

What you’re describing clearly sounds like a pretty combustible combination. There are ICE agents who are operating with their own systems and set of rules, and then there are residents, in your words, operating under the First Amendment. It’s a very delicate situation.

Absolutely.

There’s a moment that I want to ask you about, because it felt oddly prescient. In the last week or so, you stood up at a news conference and said, I am worried. You told ICE agents: You have your job to do, but please do it lawfully. You told residents: You can protest, but please do it peacefully. And you said that somebody could get seriously hurt or killed. You seemed to kind of know that something awful was coming.

This was predictable and preventable. I had been saying it for weeks. I literally said it at a press conference the day before.

When you found out that there was a shooting involving an ICE agent, what was your first thought?

I mean — I’m having a hard time describing it. I just thought, [expletive], this is it. You know? This is potentially 2020 all over again.

George Floyd all over again?

The destruction of the city.

I understand that an investigation is still underway of what happened in this shooting. But I want to focus for a minute on the shooting itself. Have you watched the videos?

Yes, I’ve seen the videos that are available online.

What is your understanding of how this unfolded?

My understanding is that there was a woman who was in her car and was blocking the street, likely because immigration agents were present. She was likely protesting immigration officials being present. And ultimately, some confrontation occurred where federal law enforcement shot into the vehicle, killing her.

Having watched the videos and spoken, perhaps, to responding officers, does this strike you as a lawful interaction between the ICE officer and the resident?

Well, I can tell you — as a police officer for 25 years — that any time you hear of a situation where a cop shoots an unarmed motorist, it’s very concerning. Our policies and training are to try to do everything possible to prevent those situations from occurring in the first place. But there are times, unfortunately, where law enforcement cannot avoid those situations from occurring.

You mentioned training. My sense is that there are some pretty universal rules around policing.

The No. 1 is you don’t place yourself in the path of the vehicle. That’s like Traffic Stop 101. You don’t do that.

So in your mind, that’s a flag for the ICE agent who ended up shooting Renee Good.

Absolutely. And then the other flag is, what exactly is the mission here? Because if this person isn’t the target of a preplanned enforcement action, then what are we doing? Are we trying to de-escalate and resolve the situation? What exactly is the goal?

I want to ask you about the driver’s decision-making at this moment, and her refusal to get out of the car even after ICE agents demanded that she get out of the car. She appears to disobey spoken orders from these officers. As somebody who thinks about this stuff, was she in the wrong?

I can only speak to conducting the traffic stop from my perspective as a police officer. What is our policy, what is our training? No. 1, you approach the driver, you introduce yourself by rank, by name, by what agency you work for, and you tell the person why they’re being stopped.

You do these sorts of things to try to ensure a level of professionalism, and to try to de-escalate. If the person asks you a question that’s reasonable, you respond to it reasonably. That is the expectation.

And did the ICE agent do any of that?

I didn’t see any of that. It just seems like there’s confusion, and it’s not clear to me whether the officers in the video were working together and understood what each other was trying to accomplish.

Do you feel that this would have ended differently had this been handled entirely by the M.P.D., not ICE?

No question.

Do you have any empathy for the ICE officer?

Yes, absolutely.

Law enforcement leaders have an obligation to their people. We have an obligation to ensure that our people have sufficient policies, training and experiences for the challenges that we are placing them into. And considering that this agent was seriously injured in a stop somewhat recently, it certainly raises questions as to what the agency did to protect their person.

You’re referring to the fact that this officer was involved in an incident where he was dragged by a car.

Yes. He sustained significant bodily injury. What did the agency do to ensure that officer would not be unsafe in similar situations?

You’re basically raising questions about whether ICE agents are sufficiently trained to handle these kinds of encounters.

Yes.

Do you think they are?

I don’t have specific information about that. But I do think they are being forced into situations in which they are not well prepared to deal with.

I want to ask you about the investigation of this shooting. Local officials have been blocked from participating in the investigation by the federal government, which argues that local officials can’t be objective based on comments from the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey. You’ve also got the Trump administration saying that Renee Goode is entirely at fault and the ICE officer did nothing wrong here. How are you making sense of what has become an incredibly messy and contentious situation?

I think the loss here is the loss of any trust that the investigation would be legitimate. I know a lot of the F.B.I. agents here, and I believe the F.B.I. will still do a thorough investigation, because that’s what they do. That’s what they do every day.

But will Minneapolis residents believe that it’s a serious investigation?

That’s the problem. The way this has played out has taken all sense of legitimacy away from many people, and that’s very unfortunate.

What happens next in Minneapolis? Because in the wake of this shooting and these protests, your governor has dispatched the National Guard — at the same time the president is dispatching more federal agents. Is that just going to magnify all the challenges that we have been talking about here?

I had asked the mayor to have the National Guard on standby as this was initially unfolding because it was so unpredictable. Going forward, it’s my understanding that there is additional federal law enforcement being added to conduct more of these operations. That is concerning.

If this escalates, are you worried, Chief O’Hara, that all of this will erase the work you’ve done over the years to rebuild and repair the community’s trust in the Minneapolis Police Department?

The No. 1 priority that I worry about is erasing the gains that we have made rebuilding the department and being able to reduce crime in the city.

In June of 2020 — immediately after the destruction of the city — Minneapolis had about as many shootings in that one month as the city used to have in half a year, and that level of crime stayed very high. That has started to come down, despite not having enough officers. But I’m just afraid if we have another large-scale unrest that we are both going to have a dramatic increase in crime and another mass exodus of the department. We just cannot sustain that.

I mean, is there any part of you that feels that this moment could strengthen the relationship between the community and the police, and test this work you’ve done and reveal that you all have made progress — that people will see a distinction between the M.P.D. and the federal government?

I know that is true. I’ve had many people reach out, and activists reach out who typically have nothing good to say about the Minneapolis police, and they have been incredibly complimentary.

But it’s not universal. We haven’t accomplished winning trust with all levels of the community. That was obvious with all the hate and vitriol that was directed toward our officers. But there’s certainly been progress.

How do you think you get back to a simpler time in your policing? And in your mind, do all these federal agents need to leave the city for you to do that?

I think everybody wants to get back to some sense of normalcy, and I think that does involve some level of returning to some basic things that we accepted as normal. You know, that obviously isn’t, federal law enforcement stops enforcing federal law. That’s not the answer. But it does have to do with having an honest conversation about reality. We’ve had many instances of people being stopped, family members of police officers being stopped that are American citizens. And they’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish. That’s not happening.

Just to return to that question, can your work at its best coexist with the work of an organization like ICE?

We are doing it right now, and we are proving to the world that this is possible, that this is not the same police it used to be. But it is an unbelievable stress on everyone involved. Everybody needs to turn the heat down in order to get some sense of normalcy, for some basic things to return.

Chief O’Hara, thank you very much for your time. We really appreciate it.

Thank you, Michael.

DOJ says withdrawal aligns with federal civil rights law

Critics say move motivated by anti-immigration sentiment

Change may freeze out credit-worthy immigrant applicants

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ​the Department of Justice withdrew, opens new tab guidance expressly prohibiting lenders from discriminating against immigrants and ‌non-citizens on Monday, potentially denting immigrants' legal ability to access loans.

Democratic former President Joe Biden issued the guidance in 2023 to clarify that lenders could use immigration or citizenship status when deciding loan applications, as long as it was not the only factor nor lead to bias or discrimination.

Although the underlying ‌law already bars lenders from discriminatory practices, the guidance sought to expressly ​clarify and enforce it to avoid discrimination.

Withdrawing the guidance further whittles away the remnants of any and all Biden-era regulations and fulfills President Donald Trump's immigration policies, two key priorities of the ‍administration, according to Lori Sommerfield, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke in the law firm's consumer financial services practice.

""The withdrawal of this joint guidance really underscores the Trump administration's two key priorities: A harder line on immigration and ⁠a continued effort to scale back enforcement of the federal fair lending laws,"" Sommerfield said.

Assistant ‍Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, said in a joint statement with the CFPB ‌announcing ‌the policy that the Biden-era guidance had been ""ideologically-driven,"" adding that the withdrawal restored alignment with established federal civil rights law.

ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT

The withdrawal has an anti-immigration subtext in line with the broader Trump administration's goals of a more aggressive immigration crackdown in the new year, according to former CFPB ⁠officials and consumer finance ⁠lawyers like Kris Kully, ​a partner at law firm Mayer Brown.

It could be interpreted as a wink and a nod to lenders, Kully said.

Last April, the administration began deploying tactics to encourage immigrants without legal status to self-deport. One such ‍tactic voided Social Security numbers issued while under temporary protected status.

A lender may simply implement a blanket policy requiring an active Social Security number to apply for credit that's in line with the Trump administration's policy, but could ​run afoul of the law as a pretext to ‍reject immigrants.

""That may be all part of the same thrust to just make it unpalatable and unaffordable, and in other ways ​just difficult to stay,"" Kully said.

Trump cited immigration, health care and paring down energy prices among his priorities, but paramount was maintaining GOP control of the House.","For congressional Republicans, the year’s big question is how aggressive should they be in trying to advance President Donald Trump’s policies as the midterm elections approach as opposed to making the sales pitch for what’s already become law.

The immediate challenge facing Congress is once again funding the government, with only three of the dozen regular fiscal 2026 appropriations bills — Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs enacted. Stopgap funding for everything else expires on Jan. 30.

As the calendar flipped to 2026, there have been no immediate signs of another looming partial government shutdown. The House on Thursday passed the next three measures — Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water and Interior-Environment — and the Senate is taking up that legislation this week.

House and Senate appropriators on Sunday unveiled compromise versions of the fiscal 2026 Financial Services and National Security-State bills but had to punt on releasing a Homeland Security measure as they sought time to resolve differences.

Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said the bill was affected by the fatal Jan. 7 shooting of a woman in Minnesota by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

Even before that shooting, many acknowledged that finding agreement on Homeland Security spending would be a heavy lift.

“Some of these bills are going to be very, very challenging,” a senior administration official said before Christmas. “It’s hard to see how you get a full-year appropriations bill for DHS at this point.”

Venezuela

Meanwhile, international affairs have drawn a renewed focus after the Trump administration opted to oust and capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during the first week of the year, with the president hinting at possible moves to gain control over Greenland and Cuba as well.

On Thursday, the Senate advanced a joint resolution aiming to bar Trump from further military action against Venezuela, setting up a potential flashpoint between the president and the handful of Republican senators who backed the move to take up the measure as the year begins.

Trump, meanwhile, also continues to push the Senate GOP to get rid of the legislative filibuster, though there’s been no sign of any groundswell of support for such a move. That means the path to getting any additional partisan agenda items into law in 2026 would likely run through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires simple majority support.

Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Senate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and House Budget Chairman Jodey C. Arrington of Texas are among those wanting the Republican majorities to take another bite at the reconciliation apple.

Graham said he wants to offer a package that includes “affordability” measures, for example. He also said he wants to target fraud in schemes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps.

Despite the push to end the legislative filibuster, there are opportunities for bipartisanship. One of the big outstanding items is a potential deal on cryptocurrency market structure legislation, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune is also talking about wanting to move a housing package.

“There are a number of bills that I’d like the Senate to take up, including ROAD to Housing — legislation that addresses housing affordability and availability — and market structure legislation that builds on the success of the GENIUS Act and provides long-overdue clarity on digital asset regulation,” the South Dakota Republican said on the Senate floor to open 2026.

The Senate housing package was included in the chamber’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act, but it was not included in the final bill agreed upon by the House and Senate, which became law last month.

Sen. Tim Scott, the chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, announced last week that the panel would mark up a crypto market structure bill on Jan. 15. Advancing the measure would help ensure that 2026 is “the year of affordability,” the South Carolina Republican said.

The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which shares jurisdiction with the Banking panel, also plans to hold its markup during the last week of January.

Republicans on the Banking Committee initially wanted to mark up a crypto market structure bill in September. But negotiations with Democrats on bipartisan legislation to become the foundation for a markup continued through the fall and into December.

Health care priorities

Another looming issue is how or whether to extend expired Affordable Health Care Act health insurance subsidies, and for how long to do so. The House on Thursday passed a Democrat-led bill to extend lapsed tax credits for three years. Seventeen Republicans backed the measure. The Senate tried but fell short of mustering the 60 votes necessary to advance similar legislation last month.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both chambers hopes to reach a deal next week to extend the subsidies for a more modest two years. The enhanced credits expired Dec. 31, meaning roughly one-third of individuals who get coverage through the ACA marketplace face significantly higher costs for 2026. Open enrollment for these plans closes Jan. 15.

Democrats have signaled that the fight over the health care subsidies, as with the affordability issue, will factor heavily in their midterm messaging as Republicans defend their razor-thin House majority.

A week ago, House GOP lawmakers huddled for their policy retreat at Washington’s Kennedy Center, whose building now also bears Trump’s name. They heard from the president, who discussed the 2026 agenda ahead of the November elections. Trump cited immigration, health care and paring down energy prices among his priorities, but paramount was maintaining GOP control of the House.

“You got to win the midterms, because if we don’t win the midterms,” he said, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the House vote-counting became more difficult for Republicans last week with the resignation of Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene becoming official just before the passing of California Republican Doug LaMalfa.

Other matters

There’s plenty of other work to look ahead to in 2026 — including some recurring classics.

For instance, lawmakers are expected to grapple again this year over the reauthorization of a powerful but contentious surveillance authority, an issue that bitterly divided privacy hawks and intelligence-focused members last Congress.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. government to collect digital communications of foreigners located outside the country, is set to expire in April. This time, that will likely not align with a funding deadline.

One debate that will line up with a big funding deadline? The highway bill. The 2021 surface transportation law expires on Sept. 30, giving lawmakers until the end of fiscal 2026 to pass a new reauthorization or extend the current one.

House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves plans to introduce a surface transportation reauthorization bill in the first few months of 2026, the Missouri Republican said in a December interview.

Graves and Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., have both indicated a willingness to move some discretionary funds in the 2021 law to formula grants for states. And it’s not clear whether they will keep the funding levels. Graves voted against the 2021 law; Capito voted for it but criticized the Biden administration’s implementation.

The expiration of farm programs will also align with the end of the fiscal year, though funding for many of the programs won’t dry up until the end of December.

Sex work and its decriminalization were a hot-button point of debate during the course of the mayoral election.
Importantly, this framing also suggests that all sex workers are victimized, ignoring the fact that sex trafficking and consensual sex work are profoundly distinct.
Arrests disproportionately affect sex workers of effectively excluding undocumented and other at-risk workers from the protections it aims to establish.","“I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” New York City’s new mayor Zohran Mamdani announced to vigorous applause at his inaugural speech on January 1, 2026. “I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical.”

The Mayor’s speech touched on the primary question at play in New York City, a familiar one for progressives nationwide: Will this elected leader be able to translate campaign rhetoric into material changes after entering the court of real-world politics?

When it was reported in December that Jessica Tisch would be retained aspolice commissioner, some speculated that Mamdani was making, as many New York City mayors have made before him, significant concessions to the political concrete wall of the NYPD. But maintaining a decarceral ethic is crucial to defending those most at risk in New York City, particularly amid Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. Mamdani has repeatedly stated that he is “ready for any consequence” in resistance to the president’s deportation regime. In the leadup to his inauguration and following anattempted ICE raid on Canal Street in December, Mamdani posted a brief “know your rights” video toYouTube, a brief primer addressing the basic tools of citizen resistance. Mamdani’s posting of the video also came on the heels of the detention and separation of aChinese father and his son after a scheduled immigration hearing at 26 Federal Plaza, the site of a substantial number ofrecent deportations just around the corner from Manhattan’s City Hall. In the video, Mamdani walks through the minimum standard of legal paperwork required for ICE to gain entry into a private residence, listing what can be done in the case of an interaction with agents (filming is permitted; resisting arrest is not), and expresses unequivocal support for the city’s immigrant community. “I’ll protect the rights of every single New Yorker,” he says, “and that includes the more than 3 million immigrants who call this city their home.”

Mamdani’s vocal resistance to Trump’s immigration policy is admirable. What his messaging does not address, however, is another community whose criminalization is deeply entangled with immigration enforcement: sex workers. Migrants and sex workers share a sphere of legal vulnerability, and for many New Yorkers, particularly Asian and Latino undocumented workers, the policing of immigration and sex work operates as a single apparatus. Groups likeRed Canary Song,Make the Road New York, and the coalition I organize with,Decrim NY, see the issue of sex work criminalization as, in part, a question of immigration policy. In some contexts, the continued criminalization of sex work is a tool of the state that is used to target workers whose immigration status may limit their access to legal employment. Mamdani cannot meaningfully protect migrants while enforcing the criminalization of work that some rely on to survive.

Sex work and its decriminalization were a hot-button point of debate during the course of the mayoral election. Mayoral candidate and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a press conference in August 2025 to assert that if Mamdani were elected, New York would become the “prostitution capital of the country.” As the local news outlet Hell Gate explained at the time, Cuomo based this assertion on Mamdani’s past “support for state-level legislation that would decriminalize sex work in New York … a bill supported by over a dozen other state legislators in the city.”

A couple of months later, scaremongering about the possible decriminalization of sex work also featured prominently in theAI-generated anti-Mamdani ad that Cuomo’s campaign released and then rapidly removed from its official X feed on October 22. The ad deployed a slew of racist and sexist tropes, including an AI-generated simulation of Mamdani throwing rice into the air and consuming it with his hands, and AI-generated characters concocted to raise fears that Mamdani’s platform could unleash violence and crime in the city, including a Black man in a keffiyeh shoplifting, a white man terrorizing a woman in a rundown apartment, and a caricatured pimp wearing a cartoonish fur jacket, purple silk shirt, and black fedora. In one scene, the AI-generated pimp – a Black man who appears to be a mish-mash of tropes from 1970s crime films and racist tabloid fantasies — says, “Sure, [Mamdani] said multiple times we need to defund the police, but that was just a metaphor.” Later, the pimp flings open the door of an unmarked white van to reveal a group of slumped, light-skinned women, mascara running down their faces, red lipstick smeared, covered in bruises, one with a cigarette drooping from her fingertips.

This scene directly employs the centuries-old stereotype of “white slavery,” the myth that men of color (in the U.S., particularly Black men) threaten the sexual purity of white women, and further, that they enable and perpetrate sex trafficking. The trope and its variants – for example, the hypersexualization of Asian women – have been utilized for political purpose since at least the late 19th century, directly leading to the passage of the Page Act in 1875, the first legislation to restrict immigration in United States history. As a result of its implementation, Chinese women were nearly unilaterally barred from entry into the U.S. on the presumption that they were sex workers and, in the minds of legislators, carriers of disease. Cuomo’s usage of this specific stereotype, not to mention the bald bigotry of the rest of the ad, showed a campaign comfortable embracing the racist political strategies that have repeatedly been used in this country since its inception. Importantly, this framing also suggests that all sex workers are victimized, ignoring the fact that sex trafficking and consensual sex work are profoundly distinct.

In response to Cuomo’s scaremongering, Mamdani softened his rhetoric on sex work rather than doubling down on his earlier support for decriminalization. In an interview with Urdu News on October 11, Mamdani reiterated that he has never supported legalization of sex work, but declined to endorse its decriminalization. “What I have spoken about,” he clarified, “is the need for us to focus on tackling sex trafficking across the city and ensuring that there is no tolerance for violence against women.” While these are commendable goals, they are misdirections that fail to acknowledge that consensual sex workers deserve adequate labor conditions and protections, which are primary goals of decriminalization legislation.

Mamdani has historically been an outspoken endorser of one of the decriminalization movement’s main rallying cries, asserting in a 2021 video from his tenure as councilmember thatsex work is work. In the same video, in which he cast his vote for the repeal of theWalking While Trans law, he stated with conviction: “Our streets are not dirty because of sex workers,” clarifying instead that “our streets are dirty because our city and state has systematically been cutting the budget of our brothers, sisters, and family beyond the binary in the sanitation department.”

In the lead-up to the election, however, Mamdani’s record on sex work was patchwork regarding his position on the decriminalization of sex work, despite the fact that he had previously been a sponsor ofCecilia’s Act. Though he appeared to support decriminalization in a September GoodDay New York interview, he has skirted overt endorsement in later statements. In response to a direct question about decriminalization during the second mayoral debate, Mamdani declined to affirm that he would support a legislative shift regarding sex work. He answered more ambiguously that he “[does] not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling who are currently being thrown in jail, and then being offered job opportunities. I think we should be actually providing those kinds of opportunities at the first point of interaction.”

Though in generalarrests of sex workers have declined over the past decade, those workers who have remained the most visible, street-based and undocumented workers, particularly those in Queens, have been repeatedly targeted by “public safety” campaigns. In October 2024, former Mayor Eric Adams and Councilmember Francisco Moya launched “Operation Restore Roosevelt” as part of the Adams administration’s “Community Link” initiatives. Though the stated goal of Operation Restore Roosevelt is improved “quality-of-life” along the Roosevelt corridor, it has primarily targeted consensual sex workers, nearly 400 of whom were arrested and stripped of income between the launch of the initiative in October 2024 and June 2025. Though the administration claims to provide, as Adams has suggested, “the resources [sex workers] need as they move from a life of [sic] on the street,” in reality, many are simply cast into the city’s underfunded shelter system. Arrests disproportionately affect sex workers of effectively excluding undocumented and other at-risk workers from the protections it aims to establish.

Mamdani, like Hochul, sits at a crossroads regarding policing of sex work. It is an open question whether or not he will avoid the trap into which many progressive politicians have previously fallen: the abandonment of the vulnerable constituencies when faced with the task of governance. What history makes clear is that progressive platforms often struggle to convert to policy for their voters on the margins. But Mamdani’s election was an obvious marvel, a sign that the political imagination of New Yorkers is alive and well.

Though the mayor cannot rewrite state law, his forthcoming administration has an opening to demonstrate that when he says he speaks for the city’s 3 million immigrants, he means migrants of all professions – an opening to protect those at the ledge of precarity, workers whose human rights are assailed along multiple vectors. In practice, Mamdani can discontinue policies like Operation Restore Roosevelt, and he can make good on promises to follow the direction of Brooklyn and Manhattan District Attorneys in minimizing sex worker arrests. He can hold firm to rhetoric that unequivocally supports the need for rights, not rescue, and he can unambiguously endorse the decriminalization movement.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254291564.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:58:34.806595

Renee Nicole Good should still be alive today. Last Wednesday, she was shot and killed by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis, one day after the federal government deployed over 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis – building on our president’s obsession with our state and political retribution.

That same day, ICE agents came onto school property at Roosevelt High School, also in Minneapolis, tackling people, handcuffing two staff members, and releasing chemical weapons on bystanders. MPS had to close schools for the rest of the week to protect kids from the dangerous actions of ICE in our communities. Think about that – public schools being closed because of fear from our federal government.

Regardless of how you feel about ICE’s deportation goals, I hope everyone can recognize that ICE’s approach is just bad public safety. It doesn’t appear they have proper training to de-escalate situations, their racial profiling sweeps up many who are not their targets and creates fear and distrust in law enforcement, and wearing masks is just chilling and further erodes trust.

And now, in a highly unusual move, the federal government has shut out Minnesota from the investigation into Renee’s killing. This is such a tense situation. And it is absolutely critical that there be a fair and impartial investigation. Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has experience in dealing fairly with difficult and emotionally-charged investigations involving law enforcement. How can we trust the federal government to be unbiased, when the President and the head of the Department of Homeland Security have already made false statements pre-judging what happened? How will any result be viewed as legitimate?

ICE needs to leave our state. None of this is about public safety — in fact, ICE is destabilizing our communities and making us all less safe. Masked men are coming in, arresting people without cause, racially profiling our neighbors, and wreaking havoc. We have seen residents kidnapped, a pregnant woman dragged across the pavement, and a baby pepper-sprayed.

Please stay safe and look out for one another. I am so thankful for the Minnesotans who have shown up, peacefully protested, and lifted up Renee’s legacy. We should not have to fear exercising our first amendment rights.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly violated the law and undermined public trust,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson.
“We will pursue every remedy available to safeguard the public.” Federal immigration operations have forced the City to divert resources to address problems created by federal immigration authorities, damaged the City’s ability to protect residents who fear immigration enforcement, undermined trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, and reduced use of vital City services.

To date, the City’s Law Department has filed more than 40 legal actions against the Trump administration, including 10 lawsuits and more than 30 amicus briefs rebuking harmful federal action.","CHICAGO — Today, the City of Chicago joined Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to file a federal lawsuit alleging the Trump administration has overseen unlawful actions, abusive enforcement tactics, and repeated rights violations committed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during their militarized immigration campaign in Chicago. In partnership with the Attorney General’s office, the Johnson administration is moving swiftly to hold the federal government accountable for its reckless overreach which has put families at risk, undermined public safety efforts, and sparked chaos and fear within communities across the city.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly violated the law and undermined public trust,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “These actions weren’t just unlawful; they were cruel, needlessly inflicting fear and harm on our communities. My administration will forcefully protect our residents’ rights and hold anyone accountable who abuses their power. Nobody is above the law. This lawsuit is about ensuring there is accountability for the lawless actions of the Trump administration and justice for the Chicagoans who have been wronged.”

“Border Patrol agents and ICE officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” said Attorney General Raoul. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers. I filed this lawsuit to stand up for the safety of the people of Illinois and the sovereignty of our state.”

Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois – Eastern Division, the lawsuit challenges policies under which federal immigration agents have interrogated residents about their citizenship status without any basis to believe they are in the U.S. unlawfully, make civil immigration arrests without a warrant and without probable cause, and deploy tear gas and other noxious chemicals without warning against persons who are not resisting.

The lawsuit also challenges the defendants’ arbitrary enforcement actions at or near sensitive locations such as schools and shelters as well as the defendants’ trespass on private and government-owned property, among other unlawful actions. The lawsuit alleges that the Trump Administration has implemented these policies to coerce the plaintiffs to abandon their policies, which value and respect immigrants, and devote their resources to further the immigration policies of the current administration.

The City is seeking, among other remedies, to prohibit the defendants from engaging in the challenged practices.

“Our legal team has compiled substantial evidence of these unlawful actions,” said Corporation Counsel Mary B. Richardson-Lowry. “We will pursue every remedy available to safeguard the public.”

Federal immigration operations have forced the City to divert resources to address problems created by federal immigration authorities, damaged the City’s ability to protect residents who fear immigration enforcement, undermined trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, and reduced use of vital City services.

“We have taken a multi-faceted approach to pushing back against the reckless federal immigration enforcement in our city,” said Deputy Mayor of Immigrant, Migrant, and Refugee Rights Beatriz Ponce de Leon. “These actions have caused real harm in communities across Chicago and this lawsuit is another important step towards accountability and justice.”

Today’s filing presses forward the Johnson administration’s fight to protect Chicagoans from the worst excesses of the Trump administration.

Since being deployed to Chicago, CPB and ICE agents shot and killed one resident, shot another five times, and carried out a militarized raid of an apartment building in South Shore, detaining all its residents, including children. Agents have arrested hundreds without warrants, randomly questioned hundreds more, and unleashed chemical weapons outside schools and in residential communities.

To date, the City’s Law Department has filed more than 40 legal actions against the Trump administration, including 10 lawsuits and more than 30 amicus briefs rebuking harmful federal action. These legal actions have pushed back against the withholding of SNAP benefits, attempts to end birthright citizenship and DEI programs, restrictions on transgender rights, and more.

These were not bureaucrats or smugglers deciding who arrived—it was neighbors expressing their willingness and capacity.
The communities mobilizing across this country right now understand something essential: defending their immigrant neighbors means defending themselves.","I am the son of two Greek immigrants who came to the United States to study and ended up staying when a military dictatorship seized power in their homeland. They were able to remain here thanks to a compassionate senator and a country that was open and welcoming to newcomers. I grew up as a beneficiary of that generosity. So when I see what is happening across America today—masked agents smashing car windows and racially profiling people on our streets, families separated without due process, and entire communities living in fear—I feel it not as an abstraction but as an assault on the very idea that shaped my life.

This past year, the administration has transformed immigration enforcement into something unrecognizable. Hundreds of thousands have been deported or pressured to leave. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents now operate in places that were once considered off-limits—courthouses, hospitals, churches, and schools. A new law has poured $170 billion into detention and deportation infrastructure. In cities across the country, from Los Angeles to Chicago, people are afraid to go to work, to take their children to school, to seek medical care, or to report a crime. The cruelty is not incidental; it is the point—to drive immigrants out of our country.

Migrants are being blamed for problems they did not cause. The housing crisis is not a function of immigration—it is a result of decades of underinvestment and undersupply. Overcrowded schools are not the fault of newcomers—they reflect policy choices made long before any migrant arrived. Yet because the immigration system appears chaotic and uncontrolled, it becomes easy for politicians to point fingers and stoke fear. When people come across borders in disorderly ways, it scares communities. And authoritarians exploit that fear, scapegoating the vulnerable to seize power. This dynamic is not unique to America—we see it across Europe, Latin America, and beyond.

But here is what the headlines often miss. Even in this darkness, extraordinary acts of solidarity are happening every day. Parents in Washington, D.C. are escorting their neighbors’ children to school. Priests and ordinary people are showing up to support their neighbors in immigration courts, their presence changing how judges and ICE agents behave. Veterans are passionately defending the Afghan interpreters who once fought alongside them. Faith communities of every denomination are coming together to accompany people facing deportation—to sit with them, walk with them, and witness what is being done in our name.

When you attack migrants, you attack entire communities. You cannot simply separate out ten or a hundred people without damaging everyone around them. We are witnessing something remarkable: neighbors standing up—not just for migrants, but for themselves and for the places they call home.

At Open Society, we believe one critical answer to chaotic immigration is not cruelty—it is giving communities control. This means giving communities real power over who comes and how they are welcomed: through sponsorship programs, through local labor partnerships, and through civic integration systems that treat newcomers as neighbors rather than numbers. The research is unambiguous: when migration happens in an orderly way, when communities are invested in the process, public support increases dramatically. In the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, over 200,000 British citizens volunteered to sponsor Ukrainians into their communities. In the United States, Americans submitted more than 3 million applications to sponsor migrants from Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and other countries. These were not bureaucrats or smugglers deciding who arrived—it was neighbors expressing their willingness and capacity.

Community control transforms the politics of immigration because it transforms who holds power. Instead of top-down systems where distant officials or criminal networks determine who enters a country, it gives that authority to the people who will actually live alongside newcomers. It works across faiths and across political divides. It creates what isolation and fear destroy: human connection, purpose, community. Through the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative, which Open Society helped launch with the Government of Canada and the United Nations Refugee Agency, this model is now taking root in more than 20 countries—from Brazil to Spain to Australia. What works in Texas can work in São Paulo. What works in rural Connecticut can work in rural Ireland. We are committed to expanding this model as the foundation for a more humane and sustainable approach to migration.

These are hard times. The institutions we have built to protect the vulnerable are under sustained attack. But courage and compassion are contagious. When one person stands up, others follow. The communities mobilizing across this country right now understand something essential: defending their immigrant neighbors means defending themselves. It means defending the schools their children attend, the businesses where they work, the fabric of places they love. This fight is not only about immigration. It is about what kind of country we want to be.

The willingness of a country to welcome newcomers is a test of its humanity—and a test of its ability to succeed in the future. We live in an interconnected world. If we shut ourselves off, we lose access to the talent, energy, and ideas that will shape the century ahead. I was the beneficiary of an America that believed in that promise. I still believe in it. And I see, in communities standing together from Texas to Georgia to Maine, that millions of others believe in it too.",https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32.png,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:43.442260

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” Noem wrote.","House Democrats renewed their legal challenge Monday to the Trump administration’s restrictions on congressional oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, after the Department of Homeland Security released new guidance requiring a seven-day wait period.

In a court filing Monday, attorneys representing the lawmakers called on Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to seek clarity from DHS on why the newest guidance does not violate Section 527 of the appropriations law for the department, which spells out the authority for members of Congress to make unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities.

Cobb sided with Democratic lawmakers last month, in an opinion that found a previous Trump administration policy first announced in June is likely contrary to Section 527 because it effectively required members of Congress to give a seven-day notice before making a visit.

The lawmakers in the Monday filing point out that DHS says the newest guidance uses a different funding source and “therefore purports not to be subject to the limitations of section 527,” but adds that argument doesn’t hold up.

“[I]t is practically impossible that the development, promulgation, communication, and implementation of this policy has been, and will be, accomplished — as required — without using a single dollar of annually appropriated funds subject to section 527,” the lawmaker filing states.

In a group statement, Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado and the other lawmakers said they are going back to court because DHS is attempting to get around the prior order “by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

“This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will,” the group said.

The Justice Department notified the court Saturday about the new guidance, which was dated Jan. 8 and signed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

That notification came the same day members of a Minnesota congressional delegation, consisting of Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, said they were denied access to the Whipple federal building in Minneapolis, an immigration detention facility.

Morrison, in an interview on MS NOW on Saturday, said local officials initially granted lawmakers access to the facility, but their visits were ended “very abruptly.”

“We were told to leave,” Morrison said. “We met with two of the commanding officers, and they told us the reason we were not able to stay and meet with any detainees is because the funding for ICE came from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill.'”

The incident comes on the heels of outcry over an ICE agent fatally shooting Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis after a highly disputed interaction that resulted in calls for an independent investigation. Defenders of the ICE agent say he acted in self-defense, while critics say the level of force was unjustified.

Noem in the new guidance bases DHS authority for a new seven-day wait period for lawmakers to gain access to immigration facilities on funding for the facilities coming from the reconciliation law President Donald Trump signed on July 4, which she refers to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The guidance cites a line from the Cobb’s order that those funds “are not subject to Section 527’s limitations.”

“Given the extent of the funding made available to ICE through the OBBBA, I anticipate that there is more than sufficient funding available for the limited expenses associated with implementing and enforcing these policies,” Noem said.

Noem said the basis for the policy is that advanced notice is necessary to “ensure adequate protection” for members of Congress, their staff, detainees and ICE employees.

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” Noem wrote. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions.”

Attorneys with the Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight, who are representing House Democrats, say the Trump administration “secretly” imposed the new guidance and it came to light after ICE denied lawmakers access to the facility in Minnesota.

“Only after this denial, and following outreach from Plaintiffs’ counsel to Defendants’ counsel, did Defendants notify Plaintiffs and the Court of the duplicate notice policy,” the filing states.

Three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near Minneapolis on Saturday, three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in the city.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked ICE from enforcing policies limiting Congress members’ access to immigration detention facilities. In a court filing on Monday, plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to hold an emergency hearing and decide if the duplicate notice policy violates her order.

Cobb ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities. The judge said the seven-day notice requirement likely exceeds the Department of Homeland Security’s statutory authority.

The attorneys asking Cobb for an emergency hearing say the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire on Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Cobb didn't immediately rule on the plaintiffs' hearing request. Government attorneys also didn’t immediately respond in writing to it.

On Saturday, U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building. They initially were allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

Officials who turned them away cited a newly imposed seven-day-notice policy for congressional oversight visits. Last Thursday, a day after Good's death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement, according to the plaintiffs’ lawyers.

Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden, ruled last month in favor of 12 other members of Congress who sued to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

Government attorneys had argued that the plaintiffs didn't have legal standing to bring their claims. They also said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” Cobb wrote.

The motion asks the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain “how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities.” The lawsuit comes nearly a month after a federal judge sided with the group of Democratic lawmakers, including Congressmen Neguse and Jason Crow, ruling members of Congress could resume unannounced visits and tours of detention centers and field officers run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including the ICE facility in Aurora.

That previous lawsuit was brought on by Rep. Crow last summer, who claimed he was denied entry into the GEO facility in Aurora during an unannounced congressional visit in July, and told he needed to give a seven-day notice to the Department of Homeland Security before conducting an oversight visit.

In an interview with Denver7's Shannon Ogden shortly after that lawsuit had been filed, Crow said that unannounced visits at ICE detention facilities by members of Congress are not only legal but necessary because scheduled visits are ""dog and pony shows.""

The came a day after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman who was born and raised in Colorado Springs.

“The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand,” said Grace Martinez, a spokeswoman for Neguse, in a statement Monday.

In a joint statement, Neguse and the 12 other Democratic lawmakers suing the Trump administration, said the reintroduction of this policy was “unlawful.”

If the edited version of Trump’s speech is not appreciably more harmful to Trump’s reputation than his actual speech, Trump’s defamation claim would likely fail.","In December 2025, President Donald Trump filed a US$10 billion lawsuit against the BBC in a federal court in Florida. It was only the latest in a long series of high-dollar legal challenges Trump has brought against prominent media organizations, including ABC, CBS, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, among others.

Trump has won some sizable settlements in cases legal scholars had dismissed as largely lacking in merit. But as media scholars, we believe prevailing in court is not necessarily his primary goal. Instead, Trump appears to use lawsuits as a strategic weapon designed to silence his enemies and critics – who sometimes seem to be one and the same in his eyes.

Trump has always been litigious. Over the course of his life, he has been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits. Many of these involved Trump suing for defamation over perceived threats to his reputation. Relatively few, however, have been successful, if success is defined as prevailing in courts of law.

But using litigation as a tool for intimidation can produce other results that can count as victory. We are concerned that the president may be using the courts as a tool not to correct the record but to muzzle potential watchdogs and deprive the public of the facts they need to hold him accountable.

Winning Major Settlements

Trump claims the BBC attempted to interfere with the 2024 election by misrepresenting statements he’d made. As with Trump’s other defamation suits, the odds appear long against the president winning his case against the British broadcaster in court.

Just after Trump’s election in 2024, ABC, whose parent company is Disney, promised to make a $15 million contribution to the Trump presidential library to settle a defamation suit many experts said had dubious merit.

CBS and its parent company Paramount Global settled an arguably weaker defamation suit involving editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris that Trump said was done “to make her look better.” Paramount contributed $16 million to Trump’s presidential library and his legal fees in order, the company said, to avoid the “uncertainty and distraction” of litigation. That same month, the Federal Communications Commission approved the $8 billion acquisition of Paramount by Skydance Media.

Those two defamation suits were filed while Trump was still a presidential candidate. Weeks after winning reelection, Trump sued The Des Moines Register for publishing a preelection poll that suggested he might lose the swing state of Iowa. Instead, he carried the state by 13 percentage points.

Trump could have just gloated over his victory, as President Harry Truman did when he famously posed holding the Chicago Tribune’s “Dewey Beats Truman” headline the day after his reelection. Instead, Trump went to court, accusing The Des Moines Register and its pollster, J. Ann Selzer, of violating Iowa’s consumer protection laws by fraudulently deceiving consumers and campaign donors.

Even if Trump loses this suit, he has inflicted expensive litigation costs on a news organization.

The Considerable Costs of Defense

From the 1960s until the late 1990s, leading media outlets, rich from advertising dollars, could afford to hire lawyers to defend against governmental overreach and protect their role in the U.S.’s democratic order. Those fights led to Supreme Court decisions shielding media outlets from most libel complaints and government censorship prior to publication.

But the rise of the internet and then social media led to the collapse of the economic model supporting traditional news production. As audiences and advertisers have fled traditional media outlets, including newspapers and broadcasters, the money to hire lawyers to defend against expensive defamation suits or fight for access to government information is much harder to find.

If even media giants such as ABC and CBS are settling rather than fighting, what local news editor is going to assign a story that might trigger a presidential lawsuit? That’s why Trump’s suit against The Des Moines Register is such an ominous development.

Giving Up Without a Fight

What’s disheartening about the media giants’ capitulation is that they are at risk of squandering the protections afforded by the Constitution and the courts.

In medieval England, criticizing the king or peers of the realm was a crime. But early in U.S. history, attempts to enforce seditious libel laws by the British government and later by President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress generated public outcry and rebuke. This was based in part on the understanding that in a democracy the people must be free to criticize those who govern them, a principle enshrined in the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court ratified this understanding of press freedom in its 1964 decision New York Times v. Sullivan. In a resounding victory for free expression, the justices held that government officials cannot prevail in defamation cases unless there is clear and convincing proof that their critics knowingly or recklessly disregarded the truth. Careless errors are not enough.

Under these protections, even Trump’s case against the BBC – where the network has admitted an ethical lapse – is not a certain winner, especially since the contested content didn’t air in Florida, where the lawsuit was filed.

Although Trump claims the BBC’s misleading edits implied that he directly incited protesters to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the network can argue in court that the inaccuracy is only technical, given that Trump truly did give a firebrand speech that was widely criticized as at least indirectly leading to the violence that followed . If the edited version of Trump’s speech is not appreciably more harmful to Trump’s reputation than his actual speech, Trump’s defamation claim would likely fail.

Trump is the first U.S. president to use the weight of his office to extract private settlements from news outlets tasked with holding him accountable. Ostensibly, these suits are to recover monetary damages for harm to his reputation, but they are part of a broader attack on what Trump perceives as hostile media coverage.

New Limits from States

Some of Trump’s targets are fighting back.

One is the Pulitzer Prize Board, the defendant in yet another Trump defamation suit – in this case, over the awards the board gave for reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In December 2025, the Pulitzer Prize Board asked the judge in the case to force the president to hand over tax and medical records to prove that he had suffered the financial and emotional harm he is claiming.

Another key development: Most states have enacted anti-SLAPP laws. SLAPP stands for “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” referring to cases filed to intimidate and discourage public criticism. Thirty-eight states, plus the District of Columbia, now have anti-SLAPP laws in place. It’s probably not a coincidence that Trump filed the latest iteration of his suit against The Des Moines Register on June 30, which happened to be one day before Iowa’s anti-SLAPP law took effect.

The US revoked the visas of more than 100,000 foreign nationals last year, the State Department said on Monday, as the Trump administration continues to enforce stricter immigration curbs.

“In less than one year, the State Department revoked over 100,000 visas from foreign nationals, marking a new record and more than a 150% increase in revocations since 2024,” deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said in an emailed statement to Anadolu.

He added that the revocations included thousands of foreign nationals charged or convicted of crimes, including assault, theft, and driving under the influence.

“The State Department's recently launched Continuous Vetting Center works to ensure that all foreign nationals on American soil comply with our laws — and that the visas of those who pose a threat to American citizens are swiftly revoked,” Pigott said, “The Trump administration will continue to put America first and protect our nation from foreign nationals who pose a risk to public safety or national security.”

The statement came amid the administration’s broader crackdown on immigrants, which has extended to international students and activists critical of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Legal challenges have pushed back against these actions.

Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested on the street by plainclothes ICE agents after co-authoring an op-ed on Gaza, was later released from ICE detention, and a federal judge restored her student record in December.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits.
Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities?
“A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped.
We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.” ###","Washington, D.C. — Today, Colorado Congressman and Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, alongside twelve of his colleagues, have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The Representatives filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order(link is external) affirmed all Members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

The lawsuit, Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum(link is external) reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

In a joint statement, Assistant Leader Neguse and his fellow plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

Turning hyped-up, poorly trained agents onto the streets to pursue civilians is, contrary to Trump administration propaganda, making America much less safe.
“And now carved into the same, sorrowful stone is the name of Renee Nicole Good,” Mitchell said.
The Trump administration is using this newly empowered militarized police force to target civilians the administration characterizes as enemies.","At a vigil outside the Wisconsin State Capitol Friday evening, a few days after a federal agent shot and killed Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good, hundreds of people held candles and raised their voices in a call and response song led by Madison Community Singing leader Julia Coehlo: “This is way too big for you to carry it on your own … you do not carry this all alone.”

Tiny lights flickered in the darkness. “This is not a rally centered on chants or speeches,” an organizer from the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera told the crowd. Instead, it was a moment to acknowledge our collective shock and grief, to support each other as we face the sickening and disorienting shift in the world around us, and to try to hold onto a protective sense of community.

It was a needed respite from watching the video, obtained by the Minnesota Reformer, of the shooting of Good in broad daylight as she sat at the wheel of her minivan on a Midwestern residential street, apparently trying to move away from the agent who shot her. The horror of that scene was compounded by the propaganda from the Trump administration that followed, immediately blaming Good for her own death and calling her a “domestic terrorist,” while claiming that the real victim was the ICE agent who, after he shot her, walked away unhurt.

Stoking political division and hate, justifying murder, treating people’s real lives like a video game — our poisonous political atmosphere is overwhelming. We need to put down the screens and restore our sense of human connection if we are going to overcome it.

Dane County Judge and Pastor Everett Mitchell, speaking at the vigil, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s eulogy for the three little girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Their deaths, King said, “have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. They have something to say to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism,” as well as to those who “stood on the sidelines in a mighty struggle for justice.”

“Madison,” Mitchell said, “we can no longer stand on the sideline and feel like we are protected. We must substitute courage for caution.”

Here in Wisconsin, the Minneapolis shooting hits close to home. Minnesota is our near neighbor. My daughter, who lives in the Twin Cities, was driving past the area of the ICE surge when Good was shot. She texted us about the unfolding chaos in real time, as ICE vehicles sped past her — putting our whole family on edge.

Maybe we have had the false sense, as Mitchell said, that we were protected.

The “Midwest nice” culture of Minnesota and Wisconsin — whether that describes taciturn conflict avoidance or genuine warmth — doesn’t fit with political violence.

It’s impossible to see ourselves in Trump’s heated rhetoric about the “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.” Nicole Good, whose last words were, “I’m not mad at you,” certainly doesn’t fit that profile.

The killing of a U.S. citizen by federal agents, justified after the fact by the president, vice president, and secretary of Homeland Security, is a turning point for all of us. As investigative reporter Ken Klipperstein points out, Trump’s national security order targeting so-called leftwing domestic terrorist groups, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s tag-along directive, “Ending Political Violence Against ICE” broadly justify the targeting of Americans who protest Trump’s immigration crackdown or attempt to help their immigrant neighbors who are being terrorized.

In a video filmed by the agent who shot Renee Good, released by a right-wing news outlet that tried to spin it as exonerating him, you can hear a man’s voice, immediately after the shooting, cursing Good, calling her a “f-ing bitch.”

A Customs and Border Patrol Agent who shot Chicago resident Marimar Martinez five times and bragged about it in text messages, also allegedly used the word “bitch” as he rammed into her car, according to Martinez’s attorney. The Justice Department initially claimed Martinez, who survived. was the aggressor, saying she used her car to try to harm the agents — the same dubious claim made against Good — but then dropped all charges after Martinez challenged the government’s evidence.

Turning hyped-up, poorly trained agents onto the streets to pursue civilians is, contrary to Trump administration propaganda, making America much less safe. And pouring fuel on the fire with hateful rhetoric about “the radical Left” and the need to round up immigrant “criminals” — a majority of whom have committed no crimes — is exacerbating this disaster.

The Trace puts the number of ICE shootings at 16, four of them fatal, since the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown began — including Silverio Villegas González, a father from Mexico who worked as a cook, killed just after he dropped off his children at school, while reportedly trying to flee from ICE officers during the Midway Blitz in Chicago. At the vigil Friday night, Mitchell connected those killings to racist violence from the Civil Rights era to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. “And now carved into the same, sorrowful stone is the name of Renee Nicole Good,” Mitchell said.

People are struggling to figure out what to make of our frightening new reality. At the Madison vigil, one activist declared that the escalating ICE crackdown “is not because they are inevitably powerful. It is because we are powerful.” But the escalation, which is targeting people who are decidedly not powerful, is coming directly out of the more than $170 billion allocated to immigration enforcement in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — more than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. combined, according to the Brennan Center. The Trump administration is using this newly empowered militarized police force to target civilians the administration characterizes as enemies.

Most of the people I know are aghast at this scary turn of events. But one Wisconsinite I spoke with waved away the shooting, saying, “Minneapolis has a lot of problems.” There’s that false sense of being protected Mitchell called out. It’s really just denial — a powerful wish to believe that bad things only happen to other people, that violence is far away and somehow the fault of people who are different from us and who bring it on themselves.

But this touches all of us. And it won’t go away unless we get to the root of the problem — the unAmerican national security directives, the insane ICE budget, the lack of accountability — what Vice President JD Vance, astoundingly, asserted was “total immunity” for the rogue, masked agents targeting people in a political crackdown that has nothing to do with keeping us safe.

We have to see this for what it is. We need members of Congress to demand a rollback of the massive funding for Trump’s unaccountable police force. We need leaders who will state clearly, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have done, that political violence against civilians waged by the Trump administration is immoral, illegal and has to stop.

Most of all, we need each other. This is too heavy for one person to carry. We need to connect, to combine all of our efforts and to build a massive popular movement to take care of each other and reject the hateful forces that are trying to tear us apart.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0635-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 13:58:35.718738

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz said on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

“We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,” Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump’s administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he’s frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

The Fourth Amendment generally requires the government to get a warrant before searching your private information, but government agencies are circumventing the intent of the Constitution by simply buying sensitive, personal data from private companies. Today, the ACLU published documents obtained from the Department of Homeland Security shedding light on how ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and other parts of DHS have bought access to huge amounts of highly sensitive location data harvested from people’s cell phones that enables government tracking of our movements over time.

We filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against DHS in 2020 for records about its practice of purchasing bulk access to cell phone location information gathered from smartphone apps. In 2022, we posted thousands of pages of previously unreleased documents, but our litigation continued, and today we are publishing the additional records we’ve obtained over the last several years. Although DHS announced in 2024 that it was ending its contracts with data brokers for access to bulk cell phone location data, recent reporting indicates that the agency is getting back in the business of mass tracking of Americans’ phones, giving these records renewed relevance.

In fact, just last week, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to a social media and phone surveillance system that is “designed to monitor a city neighborhood or block for mobile phones, track the movements of those devices and their owners over time, and follow them from their places of work to home or other locations.”

When we published the first set of records we obtained from DHS, we highlighted some major revelations from the documents, including the huge volumes of location data at issue, how revealing that data can be about individuals’ lives, and the self-serving attempts of government contractors and DHS itself to minimize the quite obvious privacy implications of this surveillance. The new batch of documents further underscores the privacy concerns and legal questions raised by this practice, and reinforces the pressing need for strong legal protection, like the bipartisan Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would end the government’s pattern of circumventing constitutional protections by purchasing the data instead of obtaining a warrant from a judge.

Among the new documents is a two-page legal memo from ICE, providing our most detailed look yet into the agency’s attempt to craft a legal justification for purchasing access to highly sensitive location information without a warrant. The memo claims that the purchased location information is different from the cell phone location data at issue in Carpenter v. United States, an ACLU case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government needs a warrant to obtain cell phone location history directly from cellular service providers because of the “privacies of life” those records can reveal. The ICE memo, which is heavily redacted, appears to attempt to distinguish the purchased location data from the cell phone location data at issue in Carpenter on a ridiculous technicality: that this newer data is tied to phones’ Mobile Advertising IDs (known as MAIDs or AdIDs) instead of to phone numbers or names. But that is a distinction without a difference.

AdIDs are unique alphanumeric codes assigned to each device. Although some have described these identifiers as a way to target advertisements without identifying individuals, that promise of privacy is illusory. An entire industry now exists to “enrich” the AdID-linked location data with personal and historical information. The combined data reveals highly sensitive information about users’ lifestyles, their routines, and the people they meet. And the companies selling this location data to the government know this—they plainly say so in their marketing materials: “What you do and where you do it defines who you are,” according to a Gravy Analytics solicitation that ICE received. Because our patterns of movement between home, work, school, and other frequently visited locations are unique, government agents can easily identify us by tracking our phones—indeed, that’s the entire point of this surveillance. Substituting AdIDs for phone numbers does little to prevent such tracking.

Similarly, nothing prevents federal agencies from identifying and linking this location information to PII they obtained separately. Indeed, the DHS Privacy Officer raised this exact concern: “CBP should address how AdIDs become linked to an individual during the CBP analysis process, as well as the retention of AdID in the vendor system and within CBP systems with the associated linked PII.” In another document, Secret Service personnel also voiced privacy concerns, pointing out that one of the cell phone location data tools might in fact contain PII.

Government records illustrate how invasive the tracking can be:

In one document in ICE’s possession, the data broker Venntel explains how its data aided in “tracing one device observed at multiple locations throughout the U.S. and Mexico.”

In multiple cases, Venntel provided “geofence” capabilities, which enable law enforcement agencies to identify every device in a specified area. CBP tracked phones to “locations of law enforcement interest” and monitored “travel patterns.”

A Secret Service email exchange explains how the data could be used by investigators to identify “mobile devices carried near popular border crossing points into the U.S. and pull up the historical location data for those devices, viewing where they've been in the preceding months.”

And DHS pays handsomely for all of this with taxpayer money, according to the released records. Customs and Border Protection entered into contracts with one company, Venntel, in 2019 and 2020, totaling over two million dollars. A renewal subscription with another platform, Babel Street, in 2020 came to nearly 3 million dollars. The Secret Service entered into a 12-month contract with Babel Street for over 600,000 dollars in 2019. Recent reporting indicates expenditures have continued, with ICE signing up with yet another surveillance vendor, Penlink, this year.

Nobody expects that by carrying a phone, they are somehow consenting to let the government make a record of their every move. The government’s scrabbling about for legal loopholes should not be allowed to cover for the massive privacy violation that this technology enables. Congress can end this warrantless mass surveillance now, through passage of the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would require the government to obtain a warrant from a judge before getting access to this invasive data. That commonsense protection is within reach. The legislation passed the House in 2024 with strong bipartisan support, and there’s no good reason it couldn’t advance further this year. State legislatures can also take up the fight, to ensure that state and local police can’t pay their way to pervasive location surveillance. Montana did so last year, and other states are poised to follow.

The government should not be allowed to purchase its way around bedrock constitutional protections against unreasonable searches of our private information. There should be no end run around the Fourth Amendment.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/11/apple-touch-icon.png@2x-150x150.png,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:48.671540

What Is Happening

ICE’s recent actions go far beyond ordinary immigration enforcement. Federal agents have used violence against legal observers and peaceful protesters, most shockingly in Minneapolis where ICE agents shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. Despite video evidence and expert criticism of the use of force, federal leaders have defended the agent’s actions as “self-defense,” fueling national outrage and protests demanding accountability and transparency.

Across the country, the administration has singled out Democratic-led cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and Portland for politically motivated operations, and targeted specific immigrant communities like the Somali population in Minnesota.

Tens of thousands of people have been swept up in mass enforcement actions where individuals effectively disappear into detention with no clear information for their families.

Hundreds of U.S. citizens have also been wrongfully detained, often due to racial profiling, and family separation policies have been revived. Surveillance technologies, from facial recognition to phone hacking and license-plate tracking, are being used to monitor immigrants and activists.

At the same time, the administration has paused green cards and citizenship applications for people from dozens of countries and canceled naturalization ceremonies nationwide.

Why This Matters

This is not immigration enforcement. It is authoritarian power being tested in real time.

When federal agents can detain citizens, disappear people into detention, spy on protesters, and use violence without accountability, everyone is at risk.

For Americans living abroad, the danger is deeply personal. Our international families are terrified of returning to the United States. Parents fear putting their children at risk. Spouses worry that travel could lead to detention, separation, or worse. People are being forced to choose between their country and their family’s safety.

Congress has the authority to stop this. Demand they use it now.

More than 100 people attended the gathering near the Freedom Fountain in downtown to hear about Good’s life as a poet, spouse and mother of three children. Organizers also read out loud one of the poems that Good authored.

“I do not like what ICE is doing or what the administration is doing,” said Traci Benefield, an Auburn resident who attended the vigil. “It is not a left or right thing; it is a human decency thing. They are killing people.”

She added that, “I feel like if something doesn’t change, we are seeing the downfall of America.”

Good’s shooting sparked protests around the country.

ICE agents were conducting immigration raids in Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Prior to the raid, residents gathered on the scene and blew whistles to alert the community of their presence.

Good and her spouse were in their car on Wednesday when Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent walked toward her and tried to grab the car door as Good appeared to make an attempt to leave. Ross fired three shots into the driver side windshield, eventually killing Good.

“It was all on video, multiple videos from multiple angles,” said Rachel Turner, one of the lead organizers of the event, of the incident that led to Good’s death. “There were also multiple eyewitnesses who came forward and vigorously rejected the government’s claims about what actually had taken place.”

Those who attended the event spoke out against the administration’s efforts to dispatch hundreds of additional immigration agents to Minneapolis.

“It is time for us to take a stand,” said DaQuon Allen, a Montgomery resident who attended the event. “We can’t just sit down and let what is going on in America just happen. We need to let the people know that this is not right.”

But legislating is hard, rulemaking can be a lengthy process fraught with legal pitfalls, and the midterm elections loom. Set forth below is a preview of what employers can expect from a federal policy standpoint in 2026.

The 119th Congress

Federal lawmakers returned to Washington, D.C., this week for the second session of the 119th Congress. In the U.S. Senate, Republicans have a 53–47 majority, and in the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans currently have a 218–213 majority (with four vacancies). These slim margins in both chambers mean that Republicans will need the assistance of Democrats to pass most legislation, unless the Republicans take another crack at the reconciliation process, which they used in 2025 to pass the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on a party-line basis.

To make things more complicated, the 2026 federal midterm elections will be held on November 3, 2026. The impending elections will heavily influence the Republicans’ legislative agenda in the coming months, as they look to move legislation that they believe will benefit them on Election Day. The midterm elections also create a truncated legislative calendar, as, in addition to their traditionally scheduled August recess, incumbent legislators seeking reelection are currently scheduled to spend nearly all of October campaigning in their districts. The post-election “lame-duck” session of Congress could also present an opportunity for rare moments of bipartisanship.

Here is what to watch:

As a Republican alternative to Hawley’s framework, Senate HELP Committee chair Bill Cassidy introduced a slate of bills that would enhance employees’ rights vis-à-vis their labor unions. A similar series of bills was introduced in the House. Employers may hear more about these bills in 2026, though they are not expected to pass as long as the legislative filibuster remains intact.

Other bills to watch include the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2025 (H.R. 2870) (allowing employees to choose paid time off in lieu of overtime pay), Tipped Employee Protection Act (H.R. 2312) (providing a more specific definition of “tipped employee”), the Save Local Business Act (H.R. 4366), the Employee Rights Act, as well as bills relating to independent contractors.

The politics surrounding this bill are particularly interesting. Colloquially referred to as the “Durbin/Grassley” bill, besides original co-sponsors Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), other co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)—strange political bedfellows, indeed. Grassley and Durbin have also joined together in demanding that tech companies answer questions about their hiring of H-1B visa holders. The two senators first introduced the bill nearly twenty years ago. With Durbin not seeking reelection and Grassley being ninety-one years old, 2026 might be their last opportunity to push for passage of the bill. All of these factors could provide this bill with traction in the Senate.

Other immigration bills to watch include the Halting International Relocation of Employment (HIRE) Act, the American Tech Workforce Act, “Strengthening Accountability for Employers Hiring Individuals and Reforming Enforcement Act (SAFE HIRE) Act,’’ Colleges for the American People Act (“CAP Act”), and the Pause Admissions Until Security Ensured (PAUSE) Act (prohibits issuance of visas and status adjustments until various changes are made to federal law, such as elimination of the Optional Practical Training Program and codification of President Trump’s H-1B proclamation).

Another Shutdown? At the start, Congress faces issues that carry over from 2025: how to address healthcare insurance premium subsidies and a January 30, 2026, federal government funding deadline. As of now, neither party is indicating that they have an appetite for another government shutdown, but that can always change as the deadline approaches. The deal that reopened the federal government in November 2025 after a record-breaking forty-three-day shutdown included three of the twelve spending bills. The clock is currently ticking for Congress to do something about the remaining nine bills.

Big-Ticket Items. Republicans will likely turn their attention to bills addressing surface transportation and water infrastructure projects, permitting reform, and perhaps another reconciliation bill that would include remaining fiscal goals that would be permitted under the arcane legislative process. The Senate will also focus on confirming nominees to both the executive branch and the federal bench.

Labor/Employment Legislation. In 2025, Republican Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) caused a stir with the introduction of his labor reform framework. Hawley promoted these ideas at multiple hearings of the Senate HELP Committee, and he can be expected to continue to push elements of the framework throughout 2026. The question is, will other Republicans jump on board?

Immigration Legislation. Republicans in Congress are taking their cues from the administration when it comes to scrutiny of immigration policy, as they’ve introduced dozens of bills that would dramatically reform our immigration laws. One bill in particular that employers should monitor is the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act.

Federal Agencies

Rather than appearing in June or even July of 2025, the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (“Spring Regulatory Agenda”) was not released until September 4, 2025. It is, therefore, not surprising that the issuance of the fall 2025 regulatory agenda—often released in November or December—has been delayed. Once the administration releases an updated agenda, it will provide stakeholders with notice of the expected regulatory landscape for approximately the next six months. Until then, the following regulatory forecasts are based on the existing agenda and informed political and policy analysis.

U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)—Wage and Hour Division (WHD)

In 2025, the WHD took steps to implement the administration’s new policy agenda. Examples include the resuscitation of the Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program, issuing several new Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) opinion letters, and walking back enforcement of the Biden-era independent contractor regulation. In 2026, however, the WHD can be expected to accelerate its rulemaking agenda, particularly now that Andrew Rogers has been installed as wage and hour administrator. Examples of rulemakings that WHD can be expected to pursue in 2026 include the independent contractor and joint-employer tests under the FLSA, as well as the rescission of the December 2024 dual jobs rule for tipped employees. Proposed regulations relating to exemptions from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for certain employees are categorized as “long-term actions” in the most recent regulatory agenda.

DOL—Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, David Keeling, was not confirmed by the U.S. Senate until October 2025, and he has not had a lot of time at the helm of the workplace safety agency. However, in 2025, OSHA took steps to reduce penalties for small businesses, proposed revisions to twenty-six standards, and relaunched its opinion letter program. What is on Keeling’s agenda for 2026?

Perhaps the most significant policy question facing OSHA in 2026 concerns the fate of the Biden-era heat injury and illness prevention standard proposal. Rather than pausing the proposal or scrapping it altogether, OSHA has actually moved forward with the proposal, holding public hearings on the matter during the summer of 2025. But while OSHA pushes ahead with the proposal, the Spring Regulatory Agenda has provided no further updates on next steps. Will OSHA issue a final rule, presumably with changes based on the public feedback? If so, will it be a logical outgrowth of the proposal, or will the agency have to issue an entirely new proposal? The next regulatory agenda should provide some clues as to where the proposal is heading.

In 2026, employers can also expect OSHA to move forward with proposed modifications to the general duty clause, the lock-out/tag-out standard, walking-working surfaces, as well as a potential proposed standard relating to tree care work. There was no entry in the Spring Regulatory Agenda regarding OSHA’s controversial “walkaround rule,” which has been challenged in federal court.

Although independent of OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) plays an important role in adjudicating workplace safety disputes between OSHA and employers. Unfortunately, OSHRC still lacks a quorum and won’t be able to issue decisions until another commissioner is appointed—perhaps in 2026.

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

In 2025, under the leadership of now-Chair Andrea Lucas, the EEOC made it clear that it prioritizes investigations of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)–related discrimination and “anti-American” national origin discrimination, ensuring religious liberty in the workplace, and preserving women’s rights to single-sex spaces, among other areas. However, for much of the year, the Commission lacked a quorum. And it still lacks a Senate-confirmed general counsel (though President Donald Trump has nominated management attorney M. Carter Crow to fill that role). However, on October 27, 2025, Brittany Bull Panuccio was sworn in as commissioner, restoring a quorum to the EEOC. In 2026, she is likely to join Chair Lucas in revisiting regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, as well as the Commission’s guidance on harassment in the workplace.

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)

Lacking a functional quorum for nearly all of 2025, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) failed to address any of the numerous Biden-era Board policies that tilted the labor-management landscape in favor of labor unions. Those policies included ambush election regulations, as well as decisions limiting employers’ abilities to communicate with employees, a lowered standard for the issuance of bargaining orders, expanded remedies, and a second-guessing of commonsense workplace rules, among others.

With Scott Mayer and James Murphy joining lone Democrat David Prouty on the Board, there is now a quorum. However, as the Buzz has discussed on multiple occasions, overturning that Biden-era precedent might not happen so quickly. That’s because the Board traditionally does not overturn existing law unless there are three affirmative votes. So, it is very likely that a third Republican member will need to be confirmed and appointed before the case rollback can really begin. That said, Mayer and Murphy have the authority to amend or address the ambush regulations or engage in other rulemaking. The Board can also begin addressing the current backlog by ruling on noncontroversial cases.

The Board also faces external legal pressures that potentially jeopardize its continued validity.

Federal district courts in New York and California have ruled that recently passed laws in each state that grant authority to state public employment boards to intervene in private-sector labor matters are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. The lack of a Board quorum was likely a motivating factor in enacting those laws; now that there is a quorum at the Board, combined with the courts’ decisions, we are unlikely to see similar efforts in the future.

However, whether statutory removal protections for both Board members and NLRB administrative law judges are unconstitutional has been addressed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

How—and if—these issues are resolved will have a significant impact on how the Board operates and makes policy, which will clearly have an impact on employers.

Immigration (DOL, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security)

2025 was clearly a year of massive upheaval in the immigration policy arena.

I am an Australian citizen who has lived in the UK for half my life and was naturalised as a British citizen almost 20 years ago. I obey the law, work, pay taxes and do not claim any benefits. For people in my position, stripping Ms Begum of her British citizenship set a dangerous precedent.

Nigel Farage and Reform UK continue to blur the distinctions between “asylum seeker”, “illegal immigrant” and “foreign-born national” (a category that includes naturalised citizens like me) and have even threatened mass deportations for those with indefinite leave to remain. This “fudge”, borrowed from the playbooks of would-be authoritarians throughout history, is deliberate.

The Labour government and our hapless Tory opposition are sleepwalking our country into a future far-right takeover of British politics. They have normalised much of this rhetoric as the “legitimate concerns” of “ordinary” people.

The YouGov poll, conducted on Jan. 7 and released the following day, showed that 40% of respondents ""strongly disapproved"" and 12% ""somewhat disapprove"" of how the agency is operating.

A separate poll from YouGov asking respondents to describe how they would describe ""the tactics currently used by ICE"" released Jan. 8 showed that 51% said they were ""too forceful."" The polls each surveyed 2,686 U.S. adults.

A YouGov poll taken in February 2025, just after President Donald Trump took office, showed ICE had a net favorability of 16 percentage points.

The killing of Good and the injury of two people by Customs and Border Protection agents in Portland, Oregon on Jan. 8 sparked a wave of protests across the country that started Jan. 10.

The Department of Homeland Security and Trump administration officials have claimed both shootings were done in self-defense. Analysis of video from the scene of the shooting in Minneapolis done by the New York Times shows Good's vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer.

Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, previously told USA TODAY a full investigation into the killing of Good is needed, but said the video appears to contradict the Trump administration's description of the incident. ""It clearly looks like she was driving away,"" Alpert said. ""She turned her wheel and looked like she was trying to escape.""

Local officials in Minnesota and Oregon have called for state investigations into both shootings.

The shootings in the first full week of 2026 were the latest involving federal agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive – and often contentious approach – to immigration enforcement. Trump ran on a promise to enforce mass deportations and has deployed heavily-armed federal agents to cities to carry out his plans.

The court’s December order affirmed all members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.
“The law is crystal-clear: the Trump administration cannot block Members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities.
“A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped.
Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities?","Twelve members of Congress have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The members filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order affirmed all members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

Joe Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al. was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

Democracy Forward and American Oversight represent plaintiffs in this case, including Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

“The law is crystal-clear: the Trump administration cannot block Members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities. Instead of complying with the law, DHS is abrogating the court’s order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. Their actions are outrageous and subverting the law, which is why we are going back to court to challenge it — immediately,” said Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, lead plaintiff.

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said our Executive Director Chioma Chukwu. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration’s attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/AODF-Neguse-press-release-image-1.12.26.png,N,,2026-01-12 14:57:17.589621

Residents pushed back, led by a growing network of rapid responders hounding U.S. ICE and Border Patrol vehicles and agents across the metro area.

Thousands marched peacefully in Minneapolis Saturday to remember Good and protest the Trump administration’s expanding immigration crackdown. Many marchers stopped to pay their respects as the procession moved from Powderhorn Park past the intersection where the fatal shooting occurred.

Saturday’s protest, the largest since Good’s killing, was more subdued than a Friday evening gathering outside downtown Minneapolis hotels where ICE agents were said to be staying.

Protesters blew whistles, banged drums and shouted taunts outside the hotels for hours before some tried to force their way into the Canopy by Hilton at 700 Third Street South, causing about $6,000 in damage, the Star Tribune reported. City and state police ordered protesters to disperse around midnight and arrested about 30 people without incident, officials said Saturday.

Near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, a smaller group braved chilly winds to maintain a near-permanent presence outside an ICE operations hub and detention center.

U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building shortly after arriving for what they called an oversight visit on Saturday morning.

Later in the day, Politico reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — who oversees ICE and said this weekend she’d ordered hundreds more agents to join at least 2,000 already in the Twin Cities — signed an order on Thursday requiring a week’s notice for Congressional visits to immigrant detention centers.

Multiple people released from Whipple told independent journalists that they’d been verbally or physically abused in or en route to detention there. Two said agents used demeaning language to describe Good and suggested she’d deserved her fate.

The Reformer has not independently verified the Whipple detainees’ claims. In a separate video posted on Sunday by a Minneapolis Reddit user, an ICE agent tells a driver to “[g]o home to your children…have you not learned from what just happened?”

Sunday saw more reports of federal law enforcement activity in St. Paul. One bystander video purported to show agents going “door to door” on Thomas Avenue near Victoria Street, possibly making good on Vice President JD Vance’s promise earlier this week of house-by-house immigration operations. Armed personnel questioned shoppers at a nearby Target. And a crowd heckled agents as they appeared to pull a man out of his car at a gas station on Snelling Avenue.

A multi-agency operation that at times felt like an outright occupation had many Twin Cities residents — not just hardened activists — calling for ICE to withdraw and deeper reform of federal immigration policy.

On Sunday, outgoing U.S. Sen. Tina Smith told CNN that she was listening, but stopped short of promising to lead the “abolish ICE” movement in Washington.

“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community,” she said. “I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:57.899231

Trump’s comments come days after the president told reporters that if Tehran engaged in deadly violence against protestors, the US would “get involved.”

CNN reported Sunday that Trump is considering various intervention options, from military strikes to new sanctions against regime figures, or sectors of Iran’s economy like energy or banking.

Jerome Powell responds to criminal investigation into him and the Fed

01:55

Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC.

In an extraordinary video posted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, on Sunday night, he called the investigation “pretext” resulting from his ongoing struggle with the administration over interest rates, saying it was a consequence of broader “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration.

The probe sends a potentially chilling message to Powell – and to whomever might next lead the Fed. President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Fed chair have hammered on the Fed’s traditional political independence, suggesting whomever he selects to replace Powell when his term ends in May will face continuing pressure.

Video footage shows a chaotic scene as federal agents outside a Minneapolis home encounter activists before detaining someone inside the house.

In one part, agents are seen spraying what appears to be a chemical irritant from a vehicle at activists.

People are then seen asking for water after apparently being sprayed, with one person shouting, “Who has water? Somebody please get water. F**ing A. Are you okay? We need water!” video shows.

Later in the video, armed federal agents approach a home and use a ramming tool to force open the door as other agents encounter activists in the front yard.

President Donald Trump says the US is “talking to Cuba” hours after he ramped up pressure in a social media post where he said he “strongly suggests” the nation make a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

“We’re talking to Cuba and you’ll find out pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Sunday night when asked what kind of a deal he is seeking.

“One of the things I want taken care of, and one of the groups I want taken care of are the people that came from Cuba that were forced out or left under duress and they are great citizens of the United States right now,” Trump said. “You have a lot of people forced out of Cuba unfairly.”

Trump did not answer directly when asked if there were plans to seize any oil tankers headed to Cuba.

President Donald Trump said Sunday that his administration is monitoring the deadly protests in Iran and is continuing to weigh potential military options.

“There seem to be some people killed that aren’t supposed to be killed. These are violent, if you call them leaders. I don’t know if their leaders are just they rule through violence, but we’re looking at it very seriously,” Trump told reporters. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make it determination.”

CNN previously reported Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran and was briefed in recent days on different plans for intervention.

Trump also said that his administration may speak to Elon Musk about getting Iranians access to Starlink, the tech billionaire’s satellite internet service.

When asked how the United States would react if Iran were to strike American military bases, Trump said, “We will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before.”

CNN reported earlier Sunday that there are concerns inside the administration that military strikes could backfire and undermine the protests. The concerns, the officials said, are that strikes could have the unintended effect of rallying the Iranian people to support the government, or lead Iran to retaliate with military force of its own.

President Donald Trump said he “did not like” ExxonMobile’s response when asked by reporters Sunday night on whether any oil companies have pledged commitments to Trump’s decision to rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry. Trump’s comments come after ExxonMobil’s CEO warned that the country is “uninvestible” in its current state.

“No, I didn’t like Exxon’s response,” Trump said. “We would probably be inclined to keep Exxon out.”

ExxonMobil CEO Darren Wood stated at a White House gathering of oil executives Friday that the company would not be diving headfirst into Venezuela, saying the current situation on the ground presents an unacceptable risk to the company.

Trump said he will personally decide which US companies can enter Venezuela and rebuild its oil industry. Oil executives largely declined to commit to such a deal during Friday’s meeting.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s demand to make a deal on Sunday, saying the country is an independent and sovereign nation that won’t be bossed around.

“No one dictates what we do,” the Cuban leader said on X. “Cuba does not aggress; it is aggressed upon by the United States for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood.”

He also said those who turn everything into a business, “even human lives,” have no moral authority to point fingers at his country.

Earlier, Trump ramped up pressure on the communist island, saying he “strongly suggests” making a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the Caribbean country has an “absolute right” to import fuel from economic partners without US pressure.

He also rejected Trump’s claim that Cuba provided “security services” to Venezuela in exchange for oil and money.

“The US is behaving like a criminal and uncontrolled hegemon that threatens peace and security not only of Cuba and this hemisphere but of the entire world,” Rodriguez said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem barred lawmakers from visiting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities without a week’s notice, as political tensions mount following the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent.

Noem issued the directive on Thursday, according to a statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, due to “escalating riots and political violence targeting buildings and facilities used by ICE.”

Protests have broken out in Minneapolis and around the country after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent on Wednesday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Saturday that most demonstrators have acted peacefully, but warned that those who damaged property or endangered others would be arrested.

McLaughlin argued that Noem is acting to “ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike.”

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers from their normal duties. This guidance has been issued to protect all parties and ensure that ICE and DHS are fully cooperating with lawful court orders,” the statement continues.

Though a federal court in DC ruled late last year that US lawmakers have the right to visit facilities funded by Congress, DHS said ICE detention facilities are funded by President Donald Trump’s domestic policy law, which is exempt from that mandate.

Recent ICE operations across the US have seen a “radical shift” in tactics that remove agents from their core missions and training while exposing them to greater danger, former Acting ICE Director John Sandweg said on Sunday.

“What I’m looking at generally in this is wondering, how did we get ICE officers in a position where we are today? We have seen a shift in tactics at ICE that has increased the number of assaults on the agents themselves, exposing them to greater danger,” Sandweg said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

Sandweg’s comments come in the wake of Wednesday’s ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Sandweg, who was the acting director from 2013-2014, said in the past the majority of ICE’s arrests would be of individuals already in custody by other agencies.

“We’ve shifted ICE to where they’re doing a lot more at-large street operations. We’ve pulled these Border Patrol up off the street, outside their normal operating environment. Instead of the Southwest desert, they’re now in these urban cities. And then we’ve preannounced that we’re coming, thus giving these protesters an opportunity to get organized and forcing these agents to have to deal with this,” he added.

“All of this is a radical shift, and when you take these officers out of their core experiences, and really different than their core training, unfortunately, what happened in Minneapolis and what’s happening kind of writ large with these use of force incidents, is really what you have to expect,” Sandweg said.

President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post today ramped up the pressure on Cuba, saying he “strongly suggests” the nation make a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided “Security Services” for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” Trump wrote.

The post continued: “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last weeks U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!”

“I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he added.

Cuba for decades has relied on massive aid packages from its ally, oil-rich Venezuela, for its survival. Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s capture during a US operation, and Trump’s announcement that Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, could therefore lead to economic trouble for Cuba’s communist government.

The Cuban government, in a post on Facebook, said 32 of its citizens were killed during the US operation to capture Maduro “in combat actions, performing missions on behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, at the request of counterparts of the South American country.”

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called Vice President JD Vance a “great” option for a 2028 presidential nominee, while still not ruling out his own bid for the 2028 GOP ticket, in a new interview.

“I think as people speculate on what’s going to happen down the road in 2028, I agree with President Trump and Marco Rubio,” the Republican governor said in an interview on “FOX News Sunday.” “I think JD Vance would make a great, great presidential nominee.”

Youngkin’s term as Virginia governor concludes this week as the one-term position will turnover to Democrat Gov.-elect Abigial Spanberger on Saturday. Youngkin said in November that he will not run for US Senate, but he has been rumored as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.

While supporting Vance, the governor did not rule out the possibility of his own run for president. He instead said he is focused on finishing out his term in Virginia and stressed the importance of Republicans maintaining both majorities in Congress later this year with victories in the 2026 midterm elections.

“I think the most important thing we can do, just like Vice President Vance said recently, is stay focused on the here and now.” Youngkin said when asked if he would run. When pressed again for a yes or no, he just reiterated that Vance would be a great nominee.

Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, of Minnesota, said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement should be “reformed, not abolished,” after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in her home state, and she added that she’s willing to withhold her vote on a key funding bill in Congress over the issue.

“Clearly, I see a role in our country for strong border security, but we need to get serious about what is actually happening with this unaccountable agency that is not abiding by any of the laws or the procedures that we would expect to see from professional law enforcement,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”

Smith, who is retiring after this term, left the door open to joining her progressive colleagues who have urged the party to draw a “red line” over demands to include ICE restrictions in ongoing negotiations to pass funding bills to avert a shutdown by the end of the month.

“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community. I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE,” she said.

Smith also cast doubt on the federal government’s ability to conduct a legitimate probe of the shooting, as administration officials blame rhetoric by Democrats for the violence.

“I don’t see how we can trust the outcome of this probe when they are blocking out state investigators and when the people that are in charge, that are in power in the Trump administration, have already said what they think has happened here,” she said. “It seems clearly that it would be a prejudiced investigation to me.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week, when she said Renee Good committed an act of domestic terrorism by trying to run over an ICE agent.

“If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,” Noem told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

She added: “This individual, as you saw in the video that we released just 48 hours after this incident, showed that this officer was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.”

Pressed on how she could have asserted that there’s no ambiguity in the situation or Good’s motives before an investigation plays out, Noem said she had spoken to the officers and their supervisors and watched videos before she went to speak at the press conference after the shooting.

Noem did not acknowledge the possibility that Good could have been fleeing the scene.

“The facts of the situation are that the vehicle was weaponized, and it attacked the law enforcement officer. He defended himself, and he defended those individuals around him,” Noem said.

Context: On the day of the shooting, Noem held a press conference where she said good “refused to obey (the ICE officer’s) commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents; an act of domestic terrorism.”

When confronted on CNN’s “State of the Union” with a video of January 6, 2021, rioters, who were pardoned by President Donald Trump, attacking law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that laws are equally enforced under the Trump administration.

Anchor Jake Tapper asked Noem if she believes that law enforcement would have been justified in using deadly force against those attacking them on January 6, based on her assessment of the Minneapolis shooting.

“Every single situation is going to rely on the situation those officers are in,” Noem said. “But they know that when people are putting hands on them, when they are using weapons against them, when they are physically harming them, that they have the authority to arrest those individuals, and make sure they’re facing the consequences.”

Pressed on Trump pardoning people who assaulted police officers that day, Noem said Trump is focused on equally enforcing laws.

“Every single one of these investigations comes in the full context of the situation on the ground,” Noem said. “That’s one thing that President Trump has been so focused on, is making sure that when we’re out there, we don’t pick and choose which situations are and which laws are enforced and which ones aren’t. Every single one of them is being enforced under the Trump administration.”

Tapper responded, “I showed you video of people attacking law enforcement officers. Undisputed proof, undisputed evidence, and I just said, ‘President Trump pardoned all of them,’ and you said that President Trump is enforcing all the laws equally. It’s just not true.”

Noem responded: “These instances and these investigations all have to be taken and done and done correctly in context of every situation that is happening on the ground,” adding that her department is making sure it is “targeting the worst of the worst, and that we’re talking factually about each situation.”

Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said the federal government is stoking “chaos” with its heavy-handed immigration enforcement efforts in the wake of last week’s shooting death of a US citizen.

“What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they’re wearing a mask. They’re approaching, running towards cars. They’re pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens,” Omar said Sunday on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”

“What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would,” she added.

Omar’s comments come in the wake of Wednesday’s ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Omar said it is important for Americans to “create the level of accountability and transparency that we need” when it comes to ICE-involved activities.

“Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place,” Omar said.

“There is no reason to have over 2,000 people coming into our city and creating the level of terror that they have,” she added.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2254503071.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-12 15:58:02.155176

Federal courts in 2025 raised the bar on who can bring FCA cases and when, strictly enforcing government dismissal authority, the first-to-file rule, and the public disclosure/original source bar — meaning many follow-on or copycat healthcare qui tam suits are being dismissed before reaching the merits.

Heightened pleading and proof standards now dominate FCA healthcare litigation, with courts repeatedly throwing out complaints that allege broad “schemes” without tying them to specific false claims, particularized facts of falsity, scienter, and materiality, and reliable indicia that the government actually paid because of the alleged misconduct.

Substantive FCA theories are being narrowed, especially around AKS causation, reverse false claims defenses, and retaliation, as courts demand but-for causation for AKS-based FCA claims in some circuits, a clear “obligation” for reverse false claims, and concrete notice and causation for retaliation. This reinforces the need for rigorous compliance programs, careful documentation, and early case assessment in FCA risk matters.

The False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on anyone who knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government. 31 U.S.C.S. § 3729 (a)(1)(A). In 2025, federal appellate courts refined how FCA claims must be properly partied, pled, and proved. This survey of key decisions underscores courts’ increasing emphasis on procedural bars, heightened pleading requirements, and rigorous proof of falsity, scienter, and materiality in healthcare cases. If you have questions about how these developments affect your compliance strategy, our team is ready to explore strategies to help you navigate the risks.

Government Dismissal

Under § 3730(c)(1), when the government intervenes, it retains primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and is not bound by the relator’s acts. The relator may continue as a party — filing motions and conducting discovery — but only “subject to the limitations set forth in [§ 3730(c)(2)].” § 3730(c)(1). In Vanderlan v. United States, 135 F.4th 257 (5th Cir. 2025), the court reasoned that the statutory scheme shows that the government retains ultimate authority over qui tam litigation and affirmed the district court’s grant of the government’s motion to dismiss the relator’s action.

First-to-File Bar

The FCA bars anyone other than the government from bringing “a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(5). In United States ex rel. Rosales v. Amedisys N.C., L.L.C., 128 F.4th 548 (4th Cir. 2025), Relator Rosales’s FCA claims against multiple defendants (Amedisys Holding, a North Carolina subsidiary, and others), were barred by the first-to-file rule because they alleged the same nationwide fraudulent scheme as a different relator’s earlier complaint against Amedisys Holding and a South Carolina subsidiary. The earlier complaint alerted the government to the same alleged fraud against the North Carolina subsidiary. Rosales’s amendment adding claims against a specific medical director and his medical practice did not salvage Rosales’ claims, as the prior relator’s complaint included allegations against Amedisys Holdings’ medical directors.

Public Disclosure Bar

A court must dismiss an FCA action “if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed . . . unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A). An “original source” is “an individual who either (i) prior to a public disclosure under subsection (e)(4)(a), has voluntarily disclosed to the Government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or (2) [(ii)] who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section.” Id. § 3730(e)(4)(B). Courts continued to apply the public disclosure bar strictly, as shown in the following cases.

United States ex rel. Winnon v. Lozano, 146 F.4th 1197 (D.C. Cir. 2025). Relator Winnon’s claims overlapped with a prior complaint that alleged that the defendants’ facility, RehabCare, ordered its program directors to assign ultra-high resource utilization group (“RUG”) levels to all new patients — without regard to clinical need — because higher Medicare reimbursements meant higher profits. Winnon’s complaint additionally claimed that the scheme spread to several SNFs where RehabCare systematically steered patients into inflated RUG levels. The court affirmed application of the public disclosure bar, finding that the central actor and scheme Winnon alleged were materially identical to the prior complaint and that Winnon’s “additional examples of an already exposed scheme [did] not breathe life into an otherwise barred claim.” Further, Winnon was not an original source because she did not allege with any specificity that she voluntarily provided the relevant information to the government before the prior action or filing her qui tam suit.

United States ex rel. Sam Jones Co., LLC v. Biotronik, Inc., 152 F.4th 946 (9th Cir. 2025). The plaintiff alleged that Biotronik had hired Brian Goodman as a sales representative because his brother, Dr. Jeffrey Goodman, was then implanting an extremely high volume of cardiac devices at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. According to the complaint, Brian recommended Biotronik devices to his brother, who implanted the devices at Cedars-Sinai, Cedars-Sinai billed federal public health insurance programs for the devices, and Biotronik paid Brian a commission on each sale. The district court dismissed the action as barred by prior New York Times’ reporting that Biotronik used various financial incentives to encourage physicians to use its cardiac rhythm management devices rather than devices sold by Biotronik’s competitors. Reversing, the appellate court found that the complaint included new, specific allegations not previously reported, such as Biotronik’s employing doctors’ family members as sales representatives and violations of the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”). The court observed that while the news article generally suggested the practice alleged in the qui tam suit, it did not disclose the “critical mass of the underlying facts” in the plaintiff’s complaint.

United States ex rel. 3729, LLC v. Express Scripts, Inc., No. 23-55645, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 2453 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2025) (unpublished). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that a whistleblower action accusing Express Scripts Inc. (“ESI”) of defrauding the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) out of billions of dollars in unnecessary medications for military personnel wasn’t barred by any public disclosures of the alleged fraud. Under the regulations that apply to ESI’s participation in Tricare (DOD’s health insurance program), “fraud” presumptively includes billings or claims that involve flagrant and persistent overutilization of services without proper regard for results, the patient’s ailments, condition, medical needs, or the physician’s orders, or that are for services that would be covered except for the frequency or duration of the services. The district court barred relator’s complaint due to a military publication’s prior report that Tricare’s pharmacy benefit was wasting money by shipping unnecessary drugs or dispensing 90-day refills instead of 30-day refills. The report also described beneficiaries with drugs piled up in medicine cabinets. But the appellate court reasoned that the practices described in the report were not substantially similar to the transactions the relator alleged, which involved systematically shipping needed refills too early. Moreover, statements in the report did not disclose facts sufficient to infer that ESI was flagrantly or persistently overfilling prescriptions, without regard to need, by deliberately using a systematic practice of shipping 90 days’ worth of refills after 60 days.

Failure to Plead With Particularity

Because FCA claims allege fraud, they must meet heightened pleading standards beyond those that apply in ordinary civil actions. Specifically, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires plaintiffs to state with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud, a showing that generally requires details about the time, place, and manner of the fraud.

United States ex rel. Winnon v. Lozano, 146 F.4th 1197 (D.C. Cir. 2025). Relator Winnon alleged that the defendants schemed their way to improper reimbursement by: (1) paying off doctors and hospital discharge planners for patient referrals to skilled nursing facilities; and (2) inflating therapy patient classifications to maximize reimbursements. The court found that Winnon’s allegations regarding inducements to personnel lacked critical details necessary to state a plausible claim. She had failed to identify any specific agreements conditioning payment on referrals or connect any payments to actual claims submitted to Medicare or Medicaid. Without the missing details, the court could only “glean inferences — faintly, with squinted eyes.” Regarding Winnon’s inflated therapy billing claims, the court concluded that her reliance on statistical anomalies fell short of satisfying Rule 9(b)s heightened pleading standard, as she failed either to provide specific examples of improperly classified patients or explain how the fraudulent scheme was executed.

United States ex rel. Flanagan v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc., 142 F.4th 25 (1st Cir. 2025). Relator alleged that Fresenius contracted to provide inpatient dialysis services to hospitals below cost to help secure outpatient dialysis patients after their hospital discharge. Fresenius also engaged hospital nephrologists who were in positions to refer high numbers of patients to Fresenius to serve as medical directors at Fresenius outpatient facilities, often paying them more than twice the salary as paid by Fresenius’s primary competitor in the same localities. According to Flanagan, Medicare regulations required that medical directors “devote sufficient time” to this position. Fresenius did not require its medical directors to document their time. Flanagan argued that Fresenius made false records by falsely certifying compliance with the AKS and listing the number of hours that medical directors worked. However, the Court found that Flanagan’s Complaint did not address what Fresenius actually submitted in the reports, either as to certifications or as to hours worked by medical directors, and failed to plead with particularity that Fresenius made false statements or records with intent that the government rely on them as a condition of payment.

United States v. Bracco USA, Inc., No. 24-1668, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 10505 (3d Cir. May 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that Bracco provided free power machines to medical facilities in exchange for their agreement to purchase 90% of their imaging agents from Bracco for 30 years. The agreements required the providers to comply with the antikickback disclosure rules by accounting for the free machines in their cost reports to federal payors. The providers billed federal payors for imaging services and agents used with the free machines. The court found that though the relator had alleged in detail how the free machines could have been used to defraud the government, describing a mere opportunity for fraud would not suffice, and the relator did not plead with particularity any reliable indicia that the free machines were not disclosed to the government.

United States v. Fillmore Capital Partners, LLC, No. 24-1606, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7502 (3d Cir. Apr. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that the defendant’s nursing home schemed to overbill federal payors by admitting high-acuity residents while understaffing facilities. But his allegations (supported by expert reports, affidavits from other nurses, and personal experience) did not provide reliable indicia of fraud. The court recognized that the nursing home had a financial incentive in minimizing, to the extent permitted by law and regulation, staffing and overhead costs to maximize its profits. Thus, the existence of a legitimate business explanation for the nursing home’s low staffing decision militated against any “strong inference” of fraud as required by the the court’s precedent.

Bennett v. Bayer Corp., No. 24-1807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8423 (3d Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that pharmaceutical companies Bayer Corp. and Johnson and Johnson “had to have known” that certain antibiotics they manufactured caused serious side effects (including neurological and psychiatric damage), but misrepresented information about these side effects to the FDA. Per the relator, this fraudulently induced the FDA to approve the drugs without appropriate warning labels, leading to false claims being submitted to federal payors. The court observed that the relator failed to allege what, if anything, the defendants knew or withheld, offering only a “textbook Rule 9(b) pleading deficiency in the form of speculation.”

United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472 (4th Cir. 2025). Wheeler alleged that Acadia falsified therapy notes for group and individual sessions that were never provided. She provided multiple examples of false therapy notes that were repeatedly used to falsify patient records, identified Acadia staff who created and signed the notes, and specified the dates and descriptions of the fictitious therapy sessions. But the court only approved Wheeler’s claims regarding Acadia’s North Carolina facilities where she worked. In contrast, she failed to allege with sufficient particularity that any facilities outside of North Carolina were falsifying therapy notes­ — her mere allegation that a corporate-wide policy existed, without more, was insufficient.

United States ex rel. Gentry v. Encompass Health Rehab. Hosp. of Pearland, L.L.C., 157 F.4th 758 (5th Cir. 2025). Gentry alleged physicians admitted patients to inpatient-rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) by rubberstamping the non-clinical judgment of sales representatives, in violation of CMS’ requirement that clinicians exercise their medical judgment in making admission decisions. The court found that Gentry’s allegations were facially benign because Medicare allowed nonclinical personnel to gather data for IRF preadmission screenings, so long as a clinician evaluates the information and makes the final admission decision. Gentry’s inference that the physicians did not evaluate the screening information was based on timing alone, and was speculative at best. Also, her conclusory allegation about Medicare billing lacked the particularity required to infer submission of false claims.

United States ex rel. VIB Partners v. LHC Grp., Inc., No. 24-5393, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 9027 (6th Cir. Apr. 14, 2025) (unpublished). The relators alleged that a home healthcare provider submitted false patient data to exaggerate patient needs, thereby inflating Medicare reimbursement rates. The relators argued that their allegations described a systemic scheme of fraud. But the court reasoned that relators cannot survive a Rule 9(b) challenge by alleging a systemic scheme alone, but must also identify at least one false claim submitted to the government.

United States v. Tenet Healthcare Corp., No. 24-1785, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 9727 (6th Cir. Apr. 22, 2025) (unpublished). The relators alleged that Tenet and its subsidiary fraudulently billed the government for inpatient care that the patients did not and could not receive. The relators offered representative samples of patients who had inpatient admission orders but were instead held in emergency room facilities and therefore should have been billed as outpatients. The court concluded that each of the relators’ examples described egregious lapses in patient care, but fell short of the specificity pertaining to filing a fraudulent claim for payment required to satisfy Rule 9(b). General policies and practices, as troubling as they may be, cannot satisfy Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirements without further detail.

Childs v. SEIU, No. 23-4334, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 15352 (9th Cir. June 23, 2025) (unpublished). The relator challenged the defendants’ use of state-controlled Medicaid funding allocated to trusts intended to benefit home care workers. The court affirmed the dismissal of the relator’s case because he failed to allege that any false “claim” had been submitted to the federal government, as required under the Act. The relator had merely alleged that in certain reports, filed with the government pursuant to federal reporting laws had misrepresented how trust funding was used. Such reports, regardless of their truth or falsity, are not “claims” as they are not requests for money or property from the federal government.

Vargas ex rel. Alvarez v. Lincare, Inc., 134 F.4th 1150 (11th Cir. 2025). The relators alleged systemic upcoding of durable medical equipment, improper kickback arrangement, waiver of co-pays, and shipment of unordered supplies. The relators provided specific allegations to support the upcoding claims, identifying patients, billing codes, and reimbursement amounts. The court found that the relators alleged a scheme, identified specific claims allegedly paid by the government, and explained why the defendant’s coding was improper, therefore dismissal of the upcoding claim was error. But the relators’ remaining claims failed to meet Rule 9(b) particularity standards because they did not identify specific false claims submitted to the government or a link between the alleged schemes and actual claims.

United States ex rel. Plaintiffs v. Atlanta Primary Care Peachtree, PC, No. 23-13845, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 16311 (11th Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The relator’s allegations related to self-referral and kickback schemes involving genetic testing met Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirements because the relator provided details about a representative claim, including the “who, what, where, when, and how” of the allegedly fraudulent scheme. However, her allegations regarding the other schemes failed to meet Rule 9(b)’s requirements because she lacked sufficient details about representative false claims submitted to or paid by the government.

United States v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., No. 24-12998, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 17583 (11th Cir. July 16, 2025) (unpublished). The relator provided an exemplar sample of a false claim that she alleged supported liability under multiple theories. The court concluded that no matter which theory she pursued, her complaint rose and fell with the fact that she failed to plead with particularity that a false claim was submitted to the government. The relator had access to the defendant’s billing system and confirmed that the defendant was submitting claims to the government, but failed to provide any specific details regarding either the dates on or the frequency with which the defendants submitted false claims, the amounts of those claims, or the patients whose treatment served as the basis for the claims.

Falsity

The FCA, codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-33, forbids knowingly submitting a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government.

United States ex rel. Montcrief v. Peripheral Vascular Assocs., P.A., 133 F.4th 395 (5th Cir. 2025). Peripheral Vascular Associates, P.A. (“PVA”), a vascular surgery practice, utilized technicians to perform ultrasounds, which would then be read and interpreted by a physician. PVA would bill Medicare for both services under a single code. At least some of these “globally” coded claims were submitted before the physician reviewed the ultrasounds. This was therefore a “paradigmatic case” involving “a request for reimbursement for goods or services” that had not yet been furnished, rendering the claims factually false.

United States v. Fillmore Capital Partners, LLC, No. 24-1606, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7502 (3d Cir. Apr. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that the defendant’s nursing home schemed to overbill federal payors by admitting high-acuity residents while understaffing facilities. Nonetheless, the court affirmed that the relator’s claims failed to allege factual falsity on an “inflated claims” theory or a “worthless services” theory because he failed to allege that the nursing home submitted false claims.

Scienter

The FCA imposes liability on anyone who “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval” to the federal government. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A). Either actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or recklessness regarding the claim’s falsity will suffice to show scienter. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(1)(A)(i)-(iii).

United States ex rel. Omni Healthcare Inc. v. Md. Spine Sols. LLC, No. 25-1110, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 31085 (1st Cir. Dec. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator ordered assistants in his seven-office medical practice to order only polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) urinary tract infection tests from the defendant, even if the ordering physician had specified a less-expensive bacterial urine culture test. The relator then alleged that the defendant knowingly submitted false claims for more expensive PCR tests that were not reasonable and necessary. As a matter of first impression, the court held that in FCA cases alleging Medicare fraud based on laboratory testing, generally a laboratory can rely on a doctor’s order to show that the test is “reasonable and necessary.” Further, the relator failed to rebut this presumption by showing that the defendant knew or should have known the PCR tests were unnecessary.

Materiality

The FCA imposes liability where a person “knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(B). The statute defines “material” as “having a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(4). A misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the government’s payment decision in order to be actionable under the FCA. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 181 (2016).

Bennett v. Bayer Corp., No. 24-1807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8423 (3d Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that pharmaceutical companies Bayer Corp. and Johnson and Johnson “had to have known” that certain antibiotics they manufactured caused serious side effects (including neurological and psychiatric damage), but misrepresented information about these side effects to FDA. Specifically, the relator alleged that the defendants disaggregated data, allowing them to report relatively low rates of multiple side effects instead of grouping them together as manifestations of a broader condition. Per the relator, this fraudulently induced FDA to approve the drugs without appropriate warning labels, leading to false claims being submitted to federal payors. The court held that the relator failed to plausibly allege that the data presented was misleading or that the data aggregated as the relator suggested would have led FDA to disapprove the drug or take other action.

United States ex rel. O’Laughlin v. Radiation Therapy Servs., P.S.C., 148 F.4th 791 (6th Cir. 2025). The relator alleged that the defendants fraudulently billed federal programs for radiation services that were not performed by radiation oncologists or radiologists. The court found that the relator did not show that a specific type of physician must perform the radiation services as a material precondition of payment for the claims.

United States ex rel. Streck v. Eli Lilly & Co., 152 F.4th 816 (7th Cir. 2025). The court upheld a $183 million jury verdict against Lilly regarding a relator’s allegations that the company knowingly miscalculated drug rebates owed to Medicaid. Under a deferential standard of review, the court concluded that because Lilly deprived the government of over $60 million in rebates while amassing over $600 million in revenue from subsequent price increases during the relevant period, the jury reasonably concluded the false prices reported to the government were material.

United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472 (4th Cir. 2025). Wheeler alleged that Acadia falsified therapy notes for group and individual sessions that were never provided for patients of its opioid treatment program (“OTP”). The court observed that OTPs are required to provide adequate substance use disorder counseling in order to obtain authorization to participate in government healthcare programs and remain in compliance. The court concluded that “compliance with federal methadone-assisted treatment regulations is ‘so central’ to Acadia’s methadone-assisted treatment that the government would not have paid the claims had it been aware of the violations.”

Anti-Kickback Statute

The AKS states that “[w]hoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person . . . to purchase . . . any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of a felony . . . .” Furthermore, “a claim [for payment by a federal healthcare program] that includes items or services resulting from a violation of [the AKS] constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of” the FCA.

United States v. Regeneron Pharms., Inc., 128 F.4th 324, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 3667 (1st Cir. 2025). The government alleged that, in violation of the AKS, Regeneron knowingly induced prescriptions of a drug by covering copayments for certain patients who received the payment, and therefore Medicare claims for the drug as prescribed to those patients “resulted from” an AKS violation, whether or not those claim would have been made had Regeneron not covered the co-pay. The government urged the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to adopt the causation standard espoused by the Third Circuit — that is, that “resulting from” merely requires some connection between kickbacks and claims. The First Circuit disagreed. Joining the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, the First Circuit held that the phrase “resulting from” in the AKS imposes a requirement of but-for causation to treat an AKS violation as a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA.

United States ex rel. Flanagan v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc., 142 F.4th 25 (1st Cir. 2025). Relator Martin Flanagan, a former Fresenius employee, alleged that Fresenius created a kickback scheme to wrongfully induce referrals to its dialysis services. Fresenius allegedly contracted with hospital nephrologists who were in positions to refer high numbers of patients to Fresenius to serve as medical directors at Fresenius outpatient facilities, often paying them more than twice the salary as paid by Fresenius’s primary competitor in the same localities. Flanagan argued that he adequately pled but-for causation by articulating specific compensation relationships with specific physicians that were intended to and did result in referrals. Flanagan provided details about a particular physician who held two medical director positions with Fresenius, including the number of patients the physicians referred, and an internal Fresenius report describing the physician’s dominant role in providing referrals and stating that his contract renewal was critical. But the court concluded that these allegations did not indicate that the physician’s referrals resulted from the alleged kickback scheme, or would not have been made had the physician not been given the medical director positions.

United States ex rel. Sisselman v. Zocdoc, Inc., No. 24-2807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8719 (2d Cir. Apr. 14, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that Zocdoc’s “booking fee” for each new patient appointment booked through its platform violated the AKS, as the fee was calculated on the estimated annual reimbursement value of the referral to the provider’s medical specialty, as opposed to fair market value. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“OIG”) had issued two advisory opinions (“AOs”) to Zocdoc, concluding that Zocdoc’s practices implicated the AKS but did not violate it. The relator’s complaint failed because he did little more than apply conclusory labels to the exact practices and fees discussed by the OIG. The relator also did not plausibly allege that Zocdoc misled the OIG, implemented its fees in a manner inconsistent with either AO, or acted with the scienter required by the FCA and the AKS.

Reverse False Claims

A reverse false claim flips the typical claim under the False Claims Act: “Direct false claims cause the United States to remit money directly to claimants, whereas reverse false claims facilitate the improper withholding of money or property to which the United States is legally entitled.” United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472, 495 (4th Cir. 2025); 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(G). In its first reverse false claim case since the FCA was amended in 2009, the Wheeler court held that the relator adequately pled her reverse false claim because the stipulated penalties in Acadia’s corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) with the government would constitute an “obligation” under the FCA. The obligation accrued automatically upon Acadia’s alleged breach of the CIA, even though the government’s enforcement of the CIA was discretionary. The relator sufficiently alleged that the CIA’s penalties had accrued and were knowingly and improperly avoided.

Retaliation

Under 31 U.S.C. §3730(h), an employer cannot retaliate against an individual in any matter “because of lawful acts done by the employee . . . in furtherance of an [FCA enforcement] action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations” of the FCA.

Morgan-Lee v. Therapy Res. Mgmt., LLC, 129 F.4th 93 (1st Cir. 2025). The court held that 2009 FCA amendments did not undercut the court’s prior precedent that “where an employee’s job responsibilities involve overseeing government billings or payments, h[er] burden of proving that h[er] employer was on notice that [s]he was engaged in protected conduct should be heightened.” In such cases, employees should clearly show that their actions “go beyond their regular duties” so employers are only held accountable for adverse actions when aware of protected conduct. The First Circuit further affirmed that FCA retaliation claims require proof that protected activity was a but-for cause of termination.

Lewis v. AbbVie Inc., 152 F.4th 807 (7th Cir. 2025). The relator alleged that AbbVie promoted a drug for off-label use, and that he had complained to supervisors and HR regarding noncompliance regarding off-label marketing. The court observed that the relator never suggested he feared AbbVie was defrauding the government, and affirmed dismissal of the relator’s FCA retaliation claim.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15541_4759.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:58:42.610325

Andreano, John L. Culhane",,,,,https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2026/01/12/cfpb-and-doj-withdraw-joint-statement-on-consideration-of-immigration-status-under-ecoa/,"As previously reported, in October 2023 the CFPB and DOJ issued a joint statement regarding “the potential civil rights implications of a creditor’s consideration of an individual’s immigration status under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).” We were critical of the joint statement, and observed that: “By not providing clear guidance on when the consideration of immigration status can cross the line into improper discrimination based on race or national origin, the agencies make it difficult for us to avoid the conclusion that the agencies’ primary goal in issuing the statement is to scare creditors away from using immigration status in credit decisions.” The agencies have now withdrawn the joint statement.
In withdrawing the joint statement, the agencies correctly observe that “[n]othing in ECOA or Regulation B prohibits the consideration of an applicant’s immigration or citizen status.
The overbroad consideration of certain criteria, such as how long a consumer has had a Social Security Number.
This could implicate or serve as a proxy for citizenship or immigration status, which in turn, can implicate a protected characteristic under ECOA like national origin or race.
]” The joint statement provided that this statute “has long been construed to prohibit discrimination based on alienage” and that except to the extent consideration of immigration status is permissible under ECOA and Regulation B, creditors must comply with both statutes.","As previously reported, in October 2023 the CFPB and DOJ issued a joint statement regarding “the potential civil rights implications of a creditor’s consideration of an individual’s immigration status under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).” We were critical of the joint statement, and observed that:

“By not providing clear guidance on when the consideration of immigration status can cross the line into improper discrimination based on race or national origin, the agencies make it difficult for us to avoid the conclusion that the agencies’ primary goal in issuing the statement is to scare creditors away from using immigration status in credit decisions.”

The agencies have now withdrawn the joint statement. The withdrawal was based on concerns that the joint statement (1) “may have created the impression that either ECOA or the statement itself imposes limitations on the consideration of immigration or citizenship status when evaluating an application for credit [when] [n]o such limitation exists” and (2) was not consistent with the CFPB’s revised policy on issuing guidance documents that was announced in May 2025.

In withdrawing the joint statement, the agencies correctly observe that “[n]othing in ECOA or Regulation B prohibits the consideration of an applicant’s immigration or citizen status. To the contrary, Regulation B permits the consideration of ‘any information obtained, so long as the information is not used to discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis.’” The agencies also note that a Regulation B Commentary provision states that a “creditor may take the applicant’s immigration status into account” and another Regulation B provision states that a creditor “may consider the applicant’s immigration status or status as a permanent resident of the United States, and any additional information that may be necessary to ascertain the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment.” The agencies then state that “[t]he joint statement’s exclusive emphasis on the risks of such consideration, however, may have created the misimpression that ECOA or Regulation B prohibit or otherwise limit the consideration of immigration or citizenship status by a creditor evaluating an application for credit.”

The joint statement included the following examples of creditor practices that could risk violating ECOA and Regulation B:

A blanket policy of refusing to consider applications from certain groups of noncitizens regardless of the credit qualifications of individual borrowers within that group. Compliance risk could arise because some individuals within those groups may have sufficient credit scores or other individual circumstances that may resolve concerns about the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment.

The overbroad consideration of certain criteria, such as how long a consumer has had a Social Security Number. This could implicate or serve as a proxy for citizenship or immigration status, which in turn, can implicate a protected characteristic under ECOA like national origin or race. Any claims that such policies are necessary to preserve the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment or to meet other binding legal obligations should be supported by evidence and cannot be a pretext for discrimination.

Requiring documentation, identification, or in-person applications only from certain groups of noncitizens, and this requirement is not necessary for assessing the creditor’s ability to obtain repayment or fulfilling the creditors’ legal obligations.

The agencies now criticize the first two examples. The agencies state that the first example “could be read as positing a bright-line, one-size-fits-all approach to underwriting noncitizens as necessary for ECOA compliance [when] [t]here is no such requirement in ECOA or Regulation B” and that a “credit applicant’s immigration or citizenship status may present underwriting risks that typical assessments of financial capacity alone will not fully resolve.” Addressing the second example, the agencies state that the “example may have been perceived as discouraging the collection and assessment of [Social Security Number] information when in fact it can be important to a creditor’s compliance with anti-money laundering or Know Your Customer requirements.”

The joint statement also cautioned creditors to be mindful of their obligations under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Section 1981 provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens[.]” The joint statement provided that this statute “has long been construed to prohibit discrimination based on alienage” and that except to the extent consideration of immigration status is permissible under ECOA and Regulation B, creditors must comply with both statutes. Addressing this aspect of the joint statement, the agencies state that their “withdrawal of the joint statement serves to address any misimpression that the joint statement has interpreted section 1981 to confer any liability under the statute that has not already been recognized by courts.”

Addressing the CFPB’s revised policy on issuing guidance, the agencies note that the “revised policy is to issue guidance only where necessary and where doing so would reduce compliance burdens.” The agencies then state that “[g]iven that it is the responsibility of Congress and the President in the legislative process to define or expand the contours of civil rights protections, the agencies have determined that the joint statement is not necessary” and that “the joint statement does not meet the Bureau’s current standards for the issuance of guidance.”

While the withdrawal of the joint statement is a positive development, the agencies could have, but did not, sought to reduce compliance burdens by providing helpful guidance on how creditors may appropriately consider an applicant’s immigration status under ECOA. For example, it would be helpful to receive guidance on the consideration of an applicant’s immigration status in assessing the likelihood of continuation of income in the context of specific ability to repay determination requirements, particularly the requirements of the Regulation Z ability to repay rules for credit cards and for mortgage loans.",https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/124/347/210/nGPeXKvLJY7Dejo7zd81p93OM/f227eff55e00dd1fd2026724135fb784841f6e1c.png,N,,2026-01-12 11:58:38.748817

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month.
Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded.
There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday.
The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.","More than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in one week last month, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The arrests were made Dec. 16-21 during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched in Dec. 16.

Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people were arrested and were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. They said the actual number is likely higher.

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month. “They are bringing violence. When Columbus leaders said ICE makes our communities less safe, that is exactly what they meant.”

An ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good was a U.S. citizen who, according to reports, was operating as a “legal observer.”

“We said ICE brings violence to our communities, and this is exactly what we meant,” Tramonte said in a statement Wednesday.

ICE did not respond to questions sent by the Ohio Capital Journal, but listed ten people who had been detained in the Columbus area with criminal charges through Operation Buckeye in a news release.

The homeland security department listed eight people who had been detained with criminal backgrounds.

“We operate in Ohio every day, but we recently surged our resources there under Operation Buckeye,” ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement. “Since Jan. 20, we’ve arrested drug traffickers, spousal abusers, thieves and worse.”

However, it’s unclear how many people ICE has detained have a criminal background.

“The facts really bear out that who they’re picking up are people with no criminal records,” said Angela Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee & Immigration Services.

Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said there are typically a few ICE reports every day, but there were more than 19 reports on Dec. 16.

“ICE has always been here in Columbus, but we’ve never seen anything like that,” she said.

Legal Immigration Services in Dublin began realizing an ICE operation was underway when calls started coming in from people saying their husbands never came home or their their spouse’s car was found abandoned, Eldredge said.

One of their clients was detained in Dublin when ICE officers pulled her over, she said.

“They don’t have any probable cause to pull over someone just because you have brown skin,” said Walter Messenger, a lawyer at Legal Immigration Services. “It’s just ridiculous that people have to go through this.”

ICE took a break over Christmas and New Year’s, but have started detaining people in the Columbus area again, Eldredge said. There were three ICE reports on Monday last week and five on Tuesday, she said.

“They’re still here,” Eldredge said. “They’re still detaining people. We have clients being very afraid of going to their ICE visits and getting detained. But if they don’t go, they are considered absconder.”

Some of their clients have stopped sending their children to school, she said.

“They cannot go pick up the kids at school, or they’re afraid they’re just gonna take their kids,” Eldredge said. “It’s a tragedy. I don’t know how we’re gonna make it.”

Lack of space in detention centers became a problem for ICE last month, Plummer said.

“The practicalities became a problem because there wasn’t enough place to put people they were detaining,” she said.

There are six Ohio detention facilities that contract with ICE to hold people who have been detained: Butler County Jail in Hamilton, the Seneca County Jail in Tiffin, the Geauga County Safety Center in Chardon, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, and the Mahoning County Justice Center in Youngstown.

Of those who were detained in Operation Buckeye, 137 were taken to the Butler County Jail, 61 went to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, 10 went to the Seneca County Jail, three went to the Mahoning County Justice Center, one went to the Calhoun County Jail in Michigan, one went to the Hamilton County Jail, and one went to the Miami Valley Jail, according to an analysis by the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded.

“They cry,” she said. “They say there’s no food, too many people in the same cell.”

A few Ohio Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Director Annette Chambers-Smith asking the department to make sure there are safe conditions for people detained by ICE at Butler County Jail.

There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday. The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.

“This continued practice of exceeding safe capacity limits represents a fundamental failure to meet the state’s duty of care to those held in its facilities,” according to the letter, which was written by Ohio state Reps. Christine Cockley and Mark Sigrist, and Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora.

Chen told DW that he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling on Monday ""unless the authority dropped the case.""
Arriving in the US 'at the wrong time' The Xinjiang video also burned Guan's bridges back home.
She told DW that relatives in China had been questioned by authorities and have since cut off contact with Guan.
""I'm not disappointed,"" Guan told DW.","Heng Guan, a Chinese national who documented a network of detention facilities in China's northwestern Xinjiang province, has spent months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody as the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attempted to deport him.

Guan's second court hearing is set for Monday after a DHS prosecutor asked a court in December to deport him to Uganda under a third-country migrant deal.

That request was later withdrawn amid concerns raised in Washington, D.C., but ICE continued to push for Guan's deportation to China, according to his attorney, Chuangchuang Chen.

""I would jump off the plane if deported,"" Guan told DW in an exclusive interview from an ICE detention facility. ""I would rather die than face imprisonment in China.""

The 38-year-old amateur photographer from China's central Henan province entered the United States in 2021 by boat from Freeport in The Bahamas after producing a 20-minute vlog from Xinjiang, accusing the Chinese government of mass incarceration of Muslim Uyghurs.

Guan said he would face imprisonment if returned to China.

""I'm not disappointed with the US,"" he said, yet he believed remaining in America was his only protection against any retribution from Beijing.

Chen told DW that he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling on Monday ""unless the authority dropped the case.""

Asylum-seeker caught in legal limbo

Before the ICE raid on his apartment building in August 2025, Guan had been working as an Uber and truck driver in New York state.

""I thought I was legal before I was arrested. At least I was legal while waiting for my asylum,"" Guan said.

Guan was authorized to work while his asylum case was pending. Asylum interviews typically take years to schedule, on top of other legal procedures.

""I didn't expect to be arrested,"" Guan said. ""It's a change under this administration.""

Guan said he presented his Employment Authorization Document and driver's license to ICE agents, but he was still handcuffed and moved through several detention facilities.

He said that following his arrest, ICE served him with an administrative warrant stating that he was inadmissible to the US.

Guan has been detained ever since. An immigration judge denied his request for bail in December.

The case raised alarm in Washington about the high risk of persecution if Guan is deported.

Public support for Guan, including in Congress, escalated after Human Rights in China, an NGO, publicized his case.

Chen said the political support is helpful, but Guan's fate ultimately lies with the immigration judge.

DW requested a comment from ICE but received no response.

Filming Xinjiang's detention network

Guan was a factory and oil field laborer born and raised in Central China. He developed a hobby in photography in college and started producing travel vlogs in 2018.

A motorcycle ride through Xinjiang in 2019 shifted his focus.

""I didn't know about the ... camps against Uyghurs then, but I sensed an abnormal social climate, seeing the tight regulations and control there,"" Guan said.

After reading a 2020 investigation by US news outlet BuzzFeed News that used satellite images to geolocate the mass internment of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, Guan decided to revisit there.

He filmed a 20-minute video of several detention sites by following the American outlet's information.

""When I realized that foreign journalists are not allowed to freely enter places like Xinjiang, I felt a very strong sense of civic responsibility and wanted to go there to document and bear witness,"" he said.

To release the footage, Guan concluded he had to leave China.

The US was not his first stop. Guan flew to Ecuador and then The Bahamas, countries that allowed Chinese passport holders to enter without visas.

""Because not all countries can guarantee freedom of expression or offer protection to dissidents, and some even have precedents for deporting dissidents back to China, I weighed my options,"" he said.

""In the end, out of sheer necessity, with no other choices and nowhere else to go, I had no option but to find an unconventional way to come to the United States.""

He bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor in the Bahamas before setting off for Florida, according to the NGO Human Rights in China.

After stepping onto US soil in 2021, Guan released his Xinjiang footage online.

The video quickly drew the attention of researchers specializing in China's alleged human rights abuses.

Alison Killing, one of the authors of the BuzzFeed News investigation, told DW in 2021 that Guan's on-the-ground video helped confirm whether many of the facilities were prisons or detention centers.

Arriving in the US 'at the wrong time'

The Xinjiang video also burned Guan's bridges back home.

Yun Luo, Guan's mother, moved to Taiwan years ago and recently traveled to the US for her son's hearings. She told DW that relatives in China had been questioned by authorities and have since cut off contact with Guan.

""It was heartbreaking. We used to catch up on the phone every week,"" Luo said. ""Now they don't reply to my messages.""

Guan's personal information was also leaked online after he uploaded the Xinjiang video to YouTube.

Luo said that they ""won't stop going after him after the video was released.""

""He came to the US at the wrong time,"" Luo said. ""This wouldn't be the case if he had come decades earlier.""

Even so, Guan said he cherished the freedom he has experienced in the United States, even if he had not fully ""exercised"" it. ""It's not something I had in China,"" he said.

""It's just that, right now, we happen to be going through the president's radical anti-immigration policies.""

""I'm not disappointed,"" Guan told DW. ""I see it as a natural fluctuation within the way the political system works. It's just that I happened to experience it at an unlucky time.""

REICHARD:And that’s this week’s Legal Docket.","Editor's note: The following text is a transcript of a podcast story. To listen to the story, click on the arrow beneath the headline above.

NICK EICHER, HOST: It’s The World and Everything in It for this 12th day of January, 2026. We’re so glad you’ve joined us today. Good morning! I’m Nick Eicher.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: And I’m Mary Reichard. It’s time for Legal Docket.

Today, two cases that go to the heart of immigration and civil justice—and they matter well beyond the courtroom. What the court decides will shape asylum claims, affect the work of advocacy groups, and test the authority of a government elected on promises of tighter borders and enforcement.

We begin with oral arguments.

EICHER: Case one is Urias-Orellana v. Bondi.

It’s about asylum—and about how much power federal judges should have to second-guess immigration courts.

Here’s how the attorney for the asylum seeker framed the case. Nicholas Rosellini.

ROSELLINI: Deciding whether undisputed facts qualify as persecution under the law involves legal interpretation, not fact finding.

REICHARD: That distinction is the fulcrum here. We usually think of fact-finding as the job of juries or trial judges, and legal interpretation as the work of higher courts.

But in this case, the asylum seeker wants federal judges to step in and decide whether the facts already found by immigration courts rise to the legal level of “persecution.” If they do, he stays.

EICHER: Here’s the background. Douglas Urias-Orellana left El Salvador with his wife and child and entered the United States illegally in 2021.

Back home, a hitman for a drug trafficker had shot two of his half-brothers and threatened to kill the rest of the family. Urias-Orellana moved within El Salvador for a time, but eventually fled north and applied for asylum.

REICHARD: The immigration judge believed his account—but still denied asylum, ruling that the threats did not meet the legal standard for persecution.

That standard is high. Courts have said persecution must be severe—more than threats alone—and tied to membership in a protected group, with the home government unable or unwilling to stop it.

EICHER: The Justice Department says that judgment call belongs to the immigration system. It argues courts should defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which heard the case and weighed the evidence firsthand.

But Urias-Orellana’s lawyer says this is not just about facts—it is about how the law defines persecution, and who gets to apply that definition.

Here’s Rosellini again:

ROSELLINI: And courts have repeatedly established auxiliary legal principles on things like sexual violence, religious persecution, economic deprivation, and beyond. But courts did not establish those principles by pondering the term ""persecution"" in the abstract. They interpreted the law by applying the persecution standard to particular sets of undisputed facts.

Rosellini pointing out there’s no way to draw a principled line between fact and law here.

REICHARD: The government disagrees. Here’s Assistant to the Solicitor General Joshua Dos Santos. (You’ll hear him use the term “sicario.” He means the hitman.)

DOS SANTOS: Petitioner appears to have been fine when he moved away from the hometown and he lived for years in peace in other parts of El Salvador. Then --then Petitioner talks about the threats, but, on the other hand, the threats demanded money. So whether you infer from that was it just intimidation, were they even connected with the sicario, I mean, these are all questions of the kind that go to juries. The juries draw inferences that can cut in different directions.

EICHER: Justice Sonia Sotomayor pushed back on that, referencing another case:

SOTOMAYOR: …the question was whether those undisputed facts met the standard of persecution ‘because of’ political opinion. So I don't see how that's not a mixed question of law and fact …

Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to favor the opposite view.

ROBERTS: The sort of finding that we typically leave to a district court or another fact finder involving credibility, weighing of facts, and all that sort of thing, to — to reach a particular determination it seems to me a prototypical case for the B-I-A.

And Justice Elena Kagan seemed to agree with the Chief while bemoaning the work load involved should the asylum seeker here win the case:

KAGAN: What’s going to happen in this case is we're going to have to look at all this evidence, all these facts, and decide whether these threats were indeed that level of menacing, and that sounds like really weighing evidence to me. That sounds really factual.

EICHER: The asylum seeker’s lawyer summed it up this way, essentially sending up an SOS to please clarify the path:

ROSELLINI: The case law as it is now is a muddle, so I'm not going to pretend that there is some consensus going in our favor, but we don’t need to show that.

So the question for the justices isn’t whether this man and his family can remain in the US. It’s how much authority federal judges have to second-guess immigration courts.

And make no mistake, there’s a political angle here, too:

Half-a-dozen advocacy groups filed friend of the court briefs on this one, and each one of them is actively involved in pushing the courts to override the executive branch on immigration.

REICHARD: This last case today also turns on who gets the last word, but this time it’s not immigration courts and federal judges. It is state legislatures versus the rules that govern federal courts—and the answer will shape who gets into court at all.

EICHER: For patients who believe they were harmed by medical negligence, the stakes are obvious. For doctors and hospitals, it’s the cost of defending lawsuits. And for the states that have tort reform to limit malpractice claims … this case is a test of how far tort reform can reach.

REICHARD: The case is Berk v Choy.

Harold Berk is a Florida man who was staying in his second home in Delaware when he suffered a foot and ankle injury.

He went to the emergency room and says he received negligent medical treatment that made matters worse. He filed a medical malpractice suit in federal court under what is called “diversity jurisdiction.” That’s a federal rule that lets you file a case in federal court when the parties are from different states and enough money is at stake.

EICHER: But Delaware requires something extra in medical malpractice cases: an affidavit of merit. That’s a sworn statement from a medical expert that certifies the claim is reasonable. More than half the states have that rule.

REICHARD: Berk’s orthopedist declined to make the affidavit. So Berk just submitted his medical records instead.

But in Delaware? No affidavit, no case.

So the federal district court dismissed Berk’s lawsuit.

EICHER: And it did so on the basis that the affidavit rule is considered substantive law. That’s different from procedural law, things like how to file a lawsuit and when. Substantive law is about what you’re legally entitled to, like the standard of medical care.

And that difference matters here, because substantive state law applies in federal court.

REICHARD: Berk wants that affidavit requirement gone. Delaware insists on it. Berk’s lawyer, Andrew Tutt:

TUTT: That requirement conflicts with more than a half dozen Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It conflicts with Rules 8 and 9, which set forth what a plaintiff must do to state a claim in federal court, and it conflicts with Rule 11, which bars verification and affidavit requirements unless a federal rule or statute provides otherwise.

Tutt went even further. The doctors call Delaware’s rule substantive …

TUTT: But Delaware's law is procedural from tip to tail. It designates when a complaint can be docketed, what it must say, and when the defendant must file a responsive pleading. It doesn't define malpractice or alter any substantive standard of care….This is a procedural law.

EICHER: The medical providers disagree, obviously. They want the affidavit rule to stay—because it’s an obstacle to filing a lawsuit against them. The providers’ lawyer is Frederick Yarger. He says Berk, the injured man, is taking an extreme position:

YARGER: That a federal court must ignore the entirety of a state statute if any part of it might conflict with a federal rule in some case. This court has rejected that approach which is why Petitioner in this briefing effectively concede that to prevail he has to convince the Court to overrule at least three of its decisions.

In this complex case, there was a light moment, if you can call it that: Justice Samuel Alito invoked a famous idea from physics:

ALITO: Schrodinger’s cat ……

For an explanation, we turn to a movie from 2013, the movie Coherence in which actor Hugo Armstrong plays a character who explains the concept well.

KEVIN: It's a thought experiment. There's a, there's a cat in a box that has, like a 50-50 chance of living, because there's a vial of poison that's also in the box. So regular physics would say that it's one or the other, that the cat is either alive or dead. But Brian would argue that quantum physics says that both realities exist simultaneously, and it's only when you open the box that they collapse into a single event.

So with that background, you will now understand constitutional law that much better.

ALITO:I don't know that we've ever invoked Schrödinger's cat in — (Thomas laughing) — our analysis of statutes or rules, but what are you saying? Is the affidavit of merit a pleading for purposes — we've got Rule 8 and Rule 11. Is it a pleading for one and not a pleading for the other?

REICHARD: So it’s up to the justices to open up that box and see if the cat or pleading or affidavit is alive or dead.

If the court upholds the affidavit requirement, then states can impose higher pleading requirements on federal courts, and just call them something else. That raises costs for plaintiffs, but doctors argue it smokes out meritless claims.

So here as in the asylum case, a seemingly simple question: Who decides the rules and who must defer to whom?

EICHER: Before we go, one decision—the Supreme Court’s first opinion of the term in an argued case. It’s Bowe v. United States.

Michael Bowe is serving a 24-year federal prison sentence, including ten years for using a gun in what the law calls a “crime of violence.”

Later court rulings narrowed that definition, and Bowe asked to have his sentence reduced.

REICHARD: Lower courts said no to that, pointing to a rule that generally blocks repeat challenges to prison sentences.

But that rule applies to state prisoners, not federal ones.

EICHER: In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with Bowe.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the Court’s liberals to say the state-prisoner rule does not apply to federal inmates—and if Congress wants it changed, it has to do the work itself.

REICHARD:And that’s this week’s Legal Docket.

The court is hearing oral arguments in two cases brought by trans students who challenged Republican-backed laws in West Virginia and Idaho prohibiting trans girls from participating in girls’ athletic programs.

Those bans were both previously blocked by federal courts, but the states appealed to the supreme court, which is hearing a case on trans people’s access to sports for the first time. If the court’s conservative supermajority sides with the states and upholds the bans, the rulings could have significant ripple effects, paving the way for the enforcement of a range of anti-LGBTQ+ policies.

If the rulings are broad, civil rights advocates warn, the supreme court could make it easier for lawmakers and school officials to ban trans students’ access to appropriate bathrooms and facilities, restrict LGBTQ+ youth’s ability to use chosen names and pronouns, enforce strict dress codes, limit protections against anti-LGBTQ+ harassment, and further deny access to accurate identification documents.

“It’s really scary. The supreme court is poised to tell us whether dislike and moral disapproval of a specific group can be a real basis to make law,” said Cathryn Oakley, senior director of legal policy for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ rights group.

‘This isn’t just about me’

In Little v Hecox, Lindsay Hecox, a trans college student, challenged Idaho’s first-in-the-nation law categorically banning trans women and girls from women’s sports teams, which passed in 2020, blocking her from track at age 19. She has since sought to have the case dismissed, arguing she is no longer pursuing sports and doesn’t want to be subjected to ongoing harassment. But the court decided to hear the case, anyway.

In the second case, West Virginia v BPJ, 15-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson has challenged her state’s law banning her track participation, saying in a recent statement: “This case isn’t just about me, or even just about sports. It’s just one part of a plan to push transgender people like me out of public life entirely.”

In the last five years, 27 states have restricted trans children and teens’ access to school sports – most targeting trans girls, but some applying to all trans youth.

The anti-LGBTQ+ legal movement shifted its focus to trans athletes after the supreme court legalized marriage equality in 2015. Supporters of bans on trans athletes, including the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the major Christian legal group defending the state laws this week, argue they are promoting fairness and safety in women’s sports.

LGBTQ+ rights advocates counter there is no credible evidence that inclusive sports policies have endangered cis girls and women, and the controversy is manufactured by anti-trans activists; one conservative group, for example, acknowledged in 2019 that its polling suggested people could be swayed to support Republicans with ads raising fears about trans girls in sports.

The GOP’s escalating campaign against trans youth athletes is directed at a minuscule fraction of the population. The National Collegiate Athletic Association president testified in 2024 he was aware of fewer than 10 trans college athletes, and Republican legislators have at times struggled to identify any trans girls playing sports in their states.

Meanwhile, states such as California have long allowed trans youth to play on teams that match their gender with little pushback – until the issue became subject to national debate.

While there are few out trans youth on sports teams at all levels, advocates note the bans have been devastating for those directly affected and LGBTQ+ youth who may be avoiding athletics due to the climate.

Potential outcomes

Lawyers for Hecox and Pepper-Jackson argue the bans violate the equal protection clause of the constitution, and in the West Virginia case, attorneys also argue the ban violates Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools.

One crucial question the court will consider is whether the laws are discriminatory against trans people and merit what’s known as “heightened scrutiny” – a more rigorous review, meaning the government has a higher burden to justify the bans. The court has never issued a ruling addressing whether it considers trans people a class that deserves this protection.

If the court were to use the sports cases to rule that laws targeting trans people do not warrant heightened scrutiny, then “any type of law discriminating against trans people is going to be presumptively constitutional”, said Joshua Block, senior counsel for the LGBTQ and HIV projects at the ACLU, which is representing both students.

“These laws were passed to establish a legal principle that transgender girls and women shouldn’t be treated like other girls and women, and then to use that principle as a jumping-off point for rolling back protections for transgender people more generally,” said Block, who is presenting oral arguments.

At least one prominent campaigner for trans sports bans has made this point explicitly, saying last year: “The gender ideology movement is a house of cards, and I believe it’s lying on that sports issue. This will be the card that makes all of it crumble.”

Scott Skinner-Thompson, a Colorado law school professor, said he feared the ruling could leave trans people with “minimal constitutional protections” from laws explicitly targeting them: “That would further embolden legislators to continue to pass laws that exclude transgender people from public life.”

In addition to bolstering laws banning trans people from bathrooms, that outcome could also make it even harder for incarcerated trans people to access critical healthcare and safe housing, said Skinner-Thompson, who signed an amicus brief arguing the bans should remain blocked.

“The broad question in these cases is: are we a society that’s interested in recognizing people’s common humanity, or are we more interested in excluding people for the purpose of a particular version of what counts as ‘fair’?”

The ruling could also establish that trans people are not protected under Title IX, which could be catastrophic, said Block. A school could deny admission to or expel a student on the basis of them being trans and it wouldn’t be considered a Title IX violation, he said.

In one particularly damaging outcome, which he hoped was unlikely, Block said the court could support the Trump administration’s assertions that Title IX requires that schools ban trans girls from sports. That would potentially invalidate policies in Democratic-run states that allow or mandate trans inclusion in youth athletics.

“West Virginia’s law is not discriminatory – it treats all students equally and represents a common-sense approach to a complex issue,” a spokesperson for the state’s attorney general said in an email. “It advances Title IX’s core mission to ensure that women and girls have access to athletic and academic opportunities that were long reserved for men.” The law, the spokesperson continued, “does not ban anyone from playing sports based on gender identity” and addresses “legitimate questions about competitive fairness and safety”.

A spokesperson for Idaho’s attorney general did not respond to an inquiry.

An ADF spokesperson said in an email: “Men and women are different, and those differences matter in sports. When you let males into women’s sports, it harms women … causing women to lose their dignity, privacy, and equal opportunities.” The spokesperson said the harm was “undeniable” and it was “vital to make sure our laws can acknowledge reality and protect women”.

‘The bans endanger all girls’

Advocates are not optimistic the court will block the sports bans, but hope the decision will be narrow. Last year, the court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors. The ruling was a devastating blow for access to vital medical treatments, but was limited to healthcare and did not, as some had feared, establish a broader precedent supporting anti-trans legislation.

“BPJ is about a 15-year-old kid that the entire state of West Virginia has brought to the supreme court to continue to fight to exclude her from the track-and-field team,” said Karen Loewy, interim deputy legal director for litigation at Lambda Legal, a rights group also representing Pepper-Jackson. “The question before the court is narrow … and there are ways to answer that question narrowly.”

Shayna Medley, senior staff attorney at Advocates for Trans Equality, noted that sports bans have a record of harming both trans and cisgender girls. To enforce restrictions, some states allow invasive forms of sex testing, which invite community members to scrutinize individual girls if they have any suspicions about their identities.

“These bans endanger all girls by empowering adults, parents, politicians, coaches to investigate anyone who they suspect to be trans on the basis of how they look and subject them to invasive sex-testing procedures,” they said. “We’ve seen cis girls with short hair be accused of being trans and asked to turn over medical records. It really creates a climate of gender policing of anyone who doesn’t conform to stereotypes. These cases are part of a broader project to erode bodily autonomy principles that are supposed to be embedded in our constitution.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da6735ae6780754f634de147c54ef44b52417c3/495_0_3493_2795/master/3493.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c88e4c2f30ab53f876e6bbe997d688f3",N,,2026-01-12 11:00:02.437060

For an annual fee of roughly $200,000 SANDAG grants immigration enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), access to the database, which is known as ARJIS.

The database contains information from every law enforcement agency in San Diego County — which includes traffic citations, arrest records, field interviews, a local jail census and some driver license records.

Local police agencies have shared data with their federal counterparts through ARJIS for decades. But now, the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics are raising new questions about what exactly is being shared with the federal government.

“It is not always great to share data because sometimes you don’t know what the motivations of those people might be,” said Seth Hall, a privacy advocate with the TRUST SD Coalition.

Advocates are particularly worried that ARJIS does not have enough independent oversight protections in place to prevent agencies like CBP from using it to go after San Diego’s immigrant population.

“We are at a time where the Trump administration is attacking all immigrants — people with status, people without status, with no criminal record,” said Homayra Yusufi, a senior policy strategist for the Partnership of the Advancement of New Americans (PANA). “CBP and HSI are literally just out there to find as many individuals to detain and deport as possible.”

Lack of protection

During the first Trump administration, CBP agents used surveillance technology to spy on U.S. citizens — immigration lawyers and human rights advocates — working with migrants from the Central American caravans.

Last year, Border Patrol agents gained backdoor access to license plate reader databases across the country, including El Cajon, which they used to track down immigrants. In Chicago, a federal judge wrote that Border Patrol leadership was “outright lying” about the agency’s use of force tactics in her injunction limiting those practices.

Yusufi argues those incidents show CBP isn’t a trustworthy law enforcement partner. She and other advocates also argue that ARJIS undermines sanctuary laws by granting access to CBP without enough oversight.

“Our local law enforcement agencies are able to say, ‘Yeah, we don’t directly share this,’” said Erin Tsurumoto-Grassi, associate director of Alliance San Diego. “But if you are sharing it through your ARJIS database and then ARJIS is selling that information — you may not be directly sharing it, but that information is still being shared, and I think that’s something we should be concerned with.”

In a recent statement to KPBS, a CBP spokesperson said agents use ARJIS in the vast majority of their criminal cases and said the database improves the agency’s cooperation with “partner agencies.”

“Without ARJIS, we would face significant delays in obtaining time-sensitive information, impacting operations and regional cooperation,” the spokesperson wrote.

But the spokesperson did not respond when asked whether CBP uses ARJIS for immigration enforcement.

SANDAG has several restrictions in place aimed at preventing federal agents from using the database for immigration enforcement. The database requires users to enter a valid reason for each search, like a case number. And ARJIS added a disclaimer on the login screen telling users not to use it for immigration enforcement purposes.

But it’s unclear whether federal agencies are following those rules because SANDAG does not have the authority to run independent audits.

SANDAG declined to make Anthony Rey, the director of ARJIS, available for an interview. A spokesperson told KPBS that ARJIS’s user agreement prevents SANDAG from conducting independent audits. Instead, audits only happen when agencies voluntarily audit themselves or when the California Department of Justice requests one.

The spokesperson said the last time CBP requested an audit was in 2017. When KPBS asked for a copy of that audit, SANDAG said it could not release it because it didn’t have CBP’s approval.

Who will be next?

The SANDAG board consists of elected officials from each of San Diego’s 18 cities and the county. None of the board members agreed to an interview with KPBS.

Yusufi says the lack of oversight from SANDAG should be raising alarm bells in immigrant communities throughout the county.

“It’s time for us to get our heads out of the sand and recognize the reality of the threats that are facing all of our communities right now,” Yusufi said. “And we have to reconsider selling this data with agencies that we know will harm San Diegans.”

Hall, from TRUST SD, said this goes beyond immigration — that future administrations can easily use these mass data surveillance systems to target other “disfavored populations.”

“If you’re not an immigrant, then maybe this doesn’t really bother you,” he said. “But you better pay attention to who else is being disfavored.”

Other privacy advocates say it’s time for other local jurisdictions to act if SANDAG won’t.

“What accountability measures are you going to put in place? Can you get those audits? How else can you make it transparent and accountable?” Tsurumoto Grassi said.

One of the SANDAG board members is San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria.

Gloria’s office sent a statement that touted his commitment to strengthening local projections for immigrant families. And it referenced an executive order the mayor signed in July reaffirming that city resources will not be used for immigration enforcement.

“The order makes clear that City personnel, property, and resources will not be used to assist immigration enforcement unless expressly required by law, helps ensure accurate multilingual information about rights and services, and enhances coordination so that residents can live without fear while public safety is upheld for all,” Gloria’s spokesperson wrote.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/6515ff5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4458x2340+0+316/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fimg%2Fphotos%2F2015%2F11%2F06%2FAP_865917545946.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 10:59:50.600438

SCOTUS Quick Hits

The Supreme Court released an opinion on Friday, but perhaps not the one you were expecting. The 5-4 ruling was in Bowe v. United States, a case on a federal prisoner’s efforts to obtain post-conviction relief. In an opinion from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court held that a federal law instructing courts to dismiss a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application does not apply to motions filed by federal prisoners. Justice Neil Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, joined in full by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and in part by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Also on Friday, the court indicated that it may announce opinions on Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST. SCOTUSblog will be live blogging any opinion announcements beginning at 9:30.

Friday afternoon, the court announced that it had granted review in five cases. For more on these disputes, see the On Site section below.

This morning, the court is expected to release an order list with denied petitions and other case updates at 9:30 a.m. EST.

The justices will hear argument today in Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on the circumstances in which a federal contractor can transfer a case from state to federal court. Justice Samuel Alito will not participate because he has a financial interest in ConocoPhillips, which is the parent company of one of the defendants.

Tomorrow, the justices will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., on laws barring transgender athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams. We will be live blogging the arguments beginning at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Morning Reads

Eyes are on Gorsuch as Supreme Court weighs rights of trans athletes (Julian Mark, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — In 2020, Justice Neil Gorsuch “wrote one of the Supreme Court’s most consequential rulings expanding legal rights for gay and transgender people” in a case on employment discrimination. Now, “Gorsuch is again in the spotlight,” according to The Washington Post, as the court considers two disputes over laws preventing transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports. The law’s opponents are drawing on that 2020 ruling as they try to persuade Gorsuch to protect transgender athletes, per the Post, while the law’s supporters argue that “sports is different from the workplace.”

Supreme Court, Swamped by Emergencies, Neglects Rest of Docket (Adam Liptak, The New York Times)(Paywall) — The court’s Friday ruling in Bowe v. United States has the distinction of being the first opinion in an argued case to be released this term. The fact that it didn’t arrive until January is notable, because “[o]ver the last 80 years, the Supreme Court has only once before waited until January to issue its first opinion in an argued case,” according to The New York Times. Experts specializing in Supreme Court advocacy told the Times that “a spike in action on the court’s other docket,” where the justices address requests for interim relief, “seems to have diverted the court from its merits docket,” slowing the pace of opinions.

These are the books families opted-out of after Supreme Court fight (Talia Richman, The Baltimore Banner) — In a June 27 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor, the “Supreme Court sided with a group of parents [in Montgomery County, Maryland] who sought the right to opt-out of lessons that included LGBTQ storybooks,” holding that refusing such opt-out requests violates religious freedom. Since then, according to The Baltimore Banner, “[i]n a district of more than 156,000 students, just 56 families asked Montgomery County school leaders to excuse their child from reading books that conflict with their religious beliefs.” These requests mostly came from “the parents of elementary schoolers” and “generally centered around books with LGBTQ characters, as well as those that included themes of diversity.”

Lawsuits by Trump allies could shape how the 2030 census is done and who will be counted (Mike Schneider, Associated Press) — “The next U.S. census is four years away,” but legal battles over it have already begun, according to the Associated Press. “Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau,” including the inclusion of noncitizens. “The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.”

Supreme Court Clerk Hiring Watch: Happy New Hires (David Lat, Original Jurisdiction) — In a post for his Substack, David Lat offered an update on Supreme Court clerk hiring and highlighted recent research on the jobs clerks typically have before and after working for a justice. He also highlighted various studies about clerkships, including investigations into what factors contribute to judges becoming feeder judges for the Supreme Court, such as the training they offer their clerks, personal relationships, and ideological compatibility.

A Closer Look: When the News Is that There’s No News

Friday was the court’s first day of opinion announcements for the 2025-26 term, and it served as a reminder that there really are no guarantees when it comes to which rulings are released on a given opinion day. After many news outlets focused their court coverage throughout the week on the tariffs case, the one ruling released on Friday was in Bowe v. United States, a dispute over a federal prisoner’s efforts to obtain post-conviction relief.

Friday was also a reminder that even top government attorneys are left in the dark as to what’s coming on an opinion day. As Mark Walsh noted in his latest View from the Court column, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer and others from his office were in the courtroom that morning. When Chief Justice John Roberts gave Justice Sonia Sotomayor the floor to discuss her majority opinion in Bowe, she began by saying, “Seeing who’s here, it’s not the case you thought.”

Several outlets treated the lack of news on tariffs as news in its own right. A headline from Reuters read “US Supreme Court: No ruling on Trump tariffs Friday.” CNBC’s headline was “Supreme Court holds off on Trump tariff ruling for now — what’s at stake for economy.” And Bloomberg TV did a segment titled “Supreme Court Skips Trump Tariff Ruling on Friday.”

The court then sparked a new wave of speculation about the tariffs case when, about an hour after the release of the Bowe decision, it indicated that it may release opinions on Wednesday, Jan. 14. (Of course, we don’t know what rulings – if any – will come that day, just as we didn’t know what was coming on Friday.)

As we await the opinion day on Wednesday, we’ll be reflecting on these words of wisdom from Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University School of Law who contributes to SCOTUSblog’s Interim Docket Blog: “When you’re waiting for huge opinions, never, ever underestimate the Court’s ability to disappoint you.”

Supreme Court agrees to hear case on violations of international law

The Supreme Court on Friday added five cases to its oral argument docket (two of which will be argued together). Among the cases granted was Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Doe I, on whether two federal laws that allow lawsuits in U.S. courts for torture and serious violations of international law permit private lawsuits for aiding and abetting such conduct.

One of the largest local actions was planned from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday at West Hollywood Park, across from the Pacific Design Center, as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” Weekend of Action.

The demonstrations follow a tense Saturday night in downtown Los Angeles, where crowds gathered near Pershing Square, City Hall and the Metropolitan Detention Center to protest federal immigration enforcement.

LAPD said a dispersal order was issued around 6 p.m. for Alameda Street between Aliso and Temple streets after protesters refused to leave the area. A police skirmish line was later set up outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, where officers were seen pushing back crowds and several people were arrested before the streets were cleared around 10 p.m.

The protests are part of a growing national backlash following two federal officer-involved shootings — one in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Good and another in Portland that left two people hospitalized.

According to organizers, those incidents sparked what has now become one of the largest coordinated protest efforts against ICE in years.

In a statement released Sunday, the ICE Out For Good coalition said nearly 1,200 protests were planned across the country this weekend, with about 500 expected to take place Sunday alone.

“This weekend, in nearly 1,200 cities and towns across the country, people are peacefully joining together… to honor the lives lost at the hands of ICE, demand accountability, and make visible the human cost of this administration’s actions,” the coalition said.

The group includes Indivisible, MoveOn Civic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union, Voto Latino, United We Dream and Popular Democracy, among others.

Organizers say Sunday’s actions were intended to be nonviolent and centered on public mourning, accountability and community solidarity, even as protests have increasingly drawn large crowds and law-enforcement responses in major cities.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

IRAN

President Trump said on Saturday that his administration is ready to help the anti-government protestors in Iran, saying “Iran is looking for FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump also said several times over the weekend that he will use military force if the Iranian regime uses force against protestors. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Trump said yesterday that Iran proposed negotiations after his threat to strike the Islamic Republic over its crackdown targeting anti-government protestors in Iran, as the U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency reports that the death toll has risen to at least 544 people. Trump added, “the meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what’s happening before the meeting.” Trump and his national security team have been weighing up a range of responses, including cyberattacks and direct strikes by the United States or Israel, according to two sources. U.S. officials said that they had to be careful to ensure that military strikes did not galvanize the Iranian public to support the government in Tehran or trigger retaliatory strikes. John Gambrell and Julia Nikhinson report for AP News; Tyler Pager, Eric Schmitt, and Edward Wong report for the New York Times.

“The communication channel between our Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and the U.S. Special envoy [Steve Witkoff] is open and messages are exchanged whenever necessary,” a spokesperson for the Iranian foreign ministry said today, adding that “contradictory messages” from the United States showed a lack of seriousness. Araqchi reiterated in a briefing to foreign ambassadors in Tehran that the Islamic Republic was ready for war but also open to dialogue. Jana Choukeir, Nayera Abdallah, and Tala Ramadan report for Reuters.

Trump is scheduled to be briefed on Tuesday on options for responding to protests in Iran, including boosting anti-government sources online, deploying secretive cyber weapons, placing more sanctions on the regime, and military strikes, according to U.S. officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan. Caine are expected to attend the meeting. Alexander Ward and Lara Seligman report for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

“The U.S.A. and Venezuela are working well together,” Trump said on Friday, adding “because of this cooperation, I have canceled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as this week to facilitate oil sales, and that he will meet with the heads of the IMF and World Bank to discuss their re-engagement with Venezuela. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO; David Lawder reports.

Venezuela is exploring restoring diplomatic ties and sending a delegation to Washington to check on its long-closed embassy, according to a statement from Venezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said that U.S. diplomats visited Caracas on Friday to assess the potential resumption of embassy operations. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

The United States seized another oil tanker in the Caribbean early on Friday, U.S. Southern Command said on social media. The Olina was detained “without incident,” becoming the fifth Venezuelan-linked tanker seized by the Trump administration since December. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

Trump on Friday signed an executive order aimed at blocking courts or creditors from impounding revenue tied to the sale of Venezuelan oil held in U.S. Treasury accounts, the White House said on Saturday. Several companies, such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, have longstanding claims against the country. The order declares that the revenue is the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic purposes and is not subject to private claims. Ernest Scheyder reports for Reuters.

Trump said yesterday that he is inclined to keep Exxonmobil out of Venezuela after its top executive was skeptical about oil investment efforts in the country. “If we look at the commercial constructs and framework in place today in Venezuela, today it’s uninvestable,” Exxonmobil CEO Darren Woods said. Seung Min Kim and Julia Nikhinson report for AP News.

Trump said yesterday on social media that “no more oil or money” would be going to Cuba from Venezuela, adding that the United States would be enforcing distance between the two countries. Trump urged Cuba “to make a deal, before it is too late,” though it is unclear what he meant by this. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel responded to Trump that his country was prepared to defend itself against U.S. threats, adding “no one tells us what to do.” Katie Rogers reports for the New York Times.

While U.S. intelligence shows that key sectors of the Cuban economy are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions, and other problems, recent CIA assessments were inconclusive on whether the worsening economy would destabilize the government, sources said. This is notable as Trump and other U.S. officials suggested that shutting Cuba off from Venezuelan oil could topple the Cuban government. Reuters could not determine if the CIA had produced an updated assessment since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week. Gram Slattery, Humeyra Pamuk, and Jonathan Landay report for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said yesterday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents in Kyiv were still without power, following the Russian bombardment overnight into Friday. AP News reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli fire yesterday killed at least three Palestinians in two separate incidents in Gaza, according to local health authorities. Medics said one Palestinian was killed in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, in an area under Palestinian control, while two others were killed in southern Gaza in the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, an area Israel still occupies. Nidal al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

Hamas said yesterday that it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as per the U.S.-brokered peace plan, but the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur. An Egyptian official said that Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalise the technocratic committee’s formation. Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

More than 26 families from the Palestinian Bedouin village Ras Ein el-Auja in the West Bank have packed up and fled their homes in recent days as a result of harassment by Jewish settlers, according to rights groups. Julia Frankel reports for AP News.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“Female-headed households [in Sudan] are now three times more likely to be food insecure. Three quarters of these households report not having enough to eat,” a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Friday. More than 21 million people are currently estimated to be acutely food insecure across the country. Some 34 million people are in need of humanitarian support, half of whom are children, according to the U.N. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

A delegate from the Southern Transitional Council, a separatist faction in Yemen, said on Friday from Riyadh that the group was disbanding. However, a senior STC official said on social media that “the delegation was coerced, in a disgusting and farcical display, into announcing the dissolution.” Mohammed al-Sahmi, a representative for the STC in Britain, said by phone that the decision to dissolve the separatist group was not valid because it was done in Saudi Arabia without the full council’s vote. Ismaeel Naar, Saeed Al-Batati, and Vivian Nereim report for the New York Times.

The final fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have withdrawn from Aleppo, Syria, after the announcement of a ceasefire deal early yesterday morning. Buses carrying the last Kurdish-led SDF members were seen leaving the Kurdish majority neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud, according to local media reports. Tabby Wilson reports for BBC News.

Hearings on whether Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya ethnic minority began today at the International Court of Justice. The case was first filed at the ICJ in 2019 by Gambia, arguing a so-called “clearance operation” by Myanmar’s military in 2017 violated the 1948 Genocide Convention. Molly Quell reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Malaysia and Indonesia over the weekend blocked Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, as authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images. “The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,” Indonesia’s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement Saturday. Eileen NG and Edna Tarigan report for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States on Saturday carried out major airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command said that about 20 Air Force attack planes, including F-15Es, A-10s and AC-130J gunships, as well as MQ-9 Reaper drones and Jordanian F-16 fighter jets fired more than 90 bombs and missiles toward at least 35 targets. The targets included weapons caches, supply routes, and other infrastructure used by the Islamic State. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

A group of 15 former senior U.S. officials sent a memo to the White House, State Department, and members of Congress warning against the use of military force to take over Greenland, according to the memo shared with Axios. “The current President’s threats to use military force or other coercive measures to take Greenland away from our ally Denmark is strategically foolish in both the near and longer term,” the memo reads, warning that “our adversaries are salivating at the opportunities that such a rupture would create for them to replace us. Barak Ravid reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday quietly ordered new restrictions on congressional visits to immigration detention facilities. The restrictions, revealed in court on Saturday, force lawmakers to seek a week’s advance notice before conducting oversight of ICE facilities. They are virtually identical to a policy that a federal judge halted last month after ruling that it appeared to violate a provision of the appropriations law that funds ICE. Noem said she would bypass the ruling by using the injection of funds given to ICE through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act instead. Kyle Cheney, Ben Johansen, and Gregory Svirnovskiy report for POLITICO; Michael Gold reports for the New York Times.

The Homeland Security Department announced on Friday that it was reviewing around 5,600 refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting individuals who have already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Madeleine Ngo reports for the New York Times.

The Trump administration will send “hundreds more” federal agents to Minneapolis “today or tomorrow” to support the work of ICE agents, Noem said yesterday, citing a major welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota as the reason. Noem also said some nonprofits in Minnesota were being investigated for their funding sources, and claimed they had trained protestors in impeding law enforcement operations and “weaponizing” vehicles against ICE agents. Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened an investigation into the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Powell lied about the scope of the project, according to officials. Powell yesterday acknowledged that the Justice Department had served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas in recent days. Stock futures fell, the dollar weakened, and gold prices jumped to a record after Powell said that Trump was seeking to press the central bank into cutting interest rates with the threat of a criminal indictment. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a swing vote on the Banking Committee, said in a statement, “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” adding “it is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.” Glenn Thrush and Colby Smith report for the New York Times; the Wall Street Journal reports.

Christopher Raia, the long-serving head of the FBI’s New York field office and a career agent, has been appointed as the bureau’s new deputy director, succeeding Dan Bongino and expected to start next week. Devlin Barrett, William K. Rashbaum, and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing part of an executive order directing the government to withhold federal election funds to states that do not alter their voting procedures in line with Trump’s demands. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing $10 billion in welfare funds planned for five Democratic-led states. Rachel Bluth reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge on Saturday paused a Trump administration policy halting an immigration program that allowed migrants from some Central and South American countries to reunite with their family members in the United States while awaiting visas. The order extends the “family reunification parole” status of immigrants who were set to see it expire on Wednesday. Adam Sella reports for the New York Times.

The black-and-white pins displayed slogans like “BE GOOD” and “ICE OUT,” introducing a political angle into the awards show after last year’s relatively apolitical ceremony.

Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne wore the pins on the red carpet, while Jean Smart and Ariana Grande donned them once inside the ballroom. Smart had the pin on her dress as she accepted the award for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy series.

Since the shooting Wednesday, protests have broken out across the country, calling for accountability for Good’s death as well as a separate shooting in Portland where Border Patrol agents wounded two people. Some protests have resulted in clashes with law enforcement, especially in Minneapolis, where ICE is carrying out its largest immigration enforcement operation to date.

“We need every part of civil society, society to speak up,” said Nelini Stamp of Working Families Power, one of the organizers for the anti-ICE pins. “We need our artists. We need our entertainers. We need the folks who reflect society.”

Congressmembers have vowed an assertive response, and an FBI investigation into Good’s killing is ongoing. The Trump administration has doubled down in defending the ICE officer’s actions, maintaining that he was acting in self-defense and thought Good would hit him with her car.

Just a week before Good was killed, an off-duty ICE officer fatally shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Porter in Los Angeles. His death sparked protests in the Los Angeles area, calling for the officer responsible to be arrested.

Organizers bring grassroots push to Golden Globes parties

The idea for the “ICE OUT” pins began with a late-night text exchange earlier this week between Stamp and Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director of a Latino advocacy group called Maremoto.

They know that high-profile cultural moments can introduce millions of viewers to social issues. This is the third year of Golden Globes activism for Morales Rocketto, who has previously rallied Hollywood to protest the Trump administration’s family separation policies. Stamp said she always thinks of the 1973 Oscars, when Sacheen Littlefeather took Marlon Brando’s place and declined his award to protest American entertainment’s portrayal of Native Americans.

So, the two organizers began calling up the celebrities and influencers they knew, who in turn brought their campaign to the more prominent figures in their circles. That initial outreach included labor activist Ai-jen Poo, who walked the Golden Globes’ red carpet in 2018 with Meryl Streep to highlight the Time’s Up movement.

“There is a longstanding tradition of people who create art taking a stand for justice in moments,” Stamp said. “We’re going to continue that tradition.”

Allies of their movement have been attending the “fancy events” that take place in the days leading up to the Golden Globes, according to Stamp. They’re passing out the pins at parties and distributing them to neighbors who will be attending tonight’s ceremony.

“They put it in their purse and they’re like, ‘Hey would you wear this?’ It’s so grassroots,” Morales Rocketto said.

The organizers pledged to continue the campaign throughout awards season to ensure the public knows the names of Good and others killed by ICE agents in shootings.

A former officer in the Marines, Zarkades said he is thinking of moving to Orange to escape the presence of so many Trump supporters in Huntington Beach.
Large protests against ICE occurred in the Bay Area as well as Sacramento and other California cities over the weekend.
In Huntington Beach, the coastal community has long had a reputation as a Southern California stronghold for Republicans, though its politics have recently been shifting.","More than 60 largely peaceful protests took place this weekend against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, including several in Southern California.

But while many protests were without incident, they were not short on anger and moments of tension. Organizers called the gatherings the “ICE Out for Good” weekend of action in response to the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.

In Huntington Beach, Ron Duplantis, 72, carried a diagram to represent the three shots fired at Good, including one through her windshield and two others that appeared to go through her side window.

“Those last two shots,” he said, “make it clear to me that this is murder.”

Huntington Beach has seen past clashes between Trump supporters and anti-racism activists, but as of mid-afternoon, Sunday’s protest was tense at times, but free of violence. About 300 people — and two dozen counterprotesters — stood outside City Hall, with protesters carrying anti-ICE signs, ringing cowbells and chanting “ICE out of O.C.”

As cars sped past them on Main Street, many motorists honked in a show of solidarity, while some rolled down their windows to shout their support for ICE, MAGA and President Trump.

“The reason why I’m here is democracy,” said Mary Artesani, a 69-year-old Costa Mesa resident carrying a sign that read “RESIST.” “They have to remember he won’t be in office forever.”

The Trump administration has largely stood behind the ICE agent, identified as Jonathan Ross, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem saying he acted in self-defense. Democratic officials and many members of the public have said the videos of the shooting circulating on social media appear to contradict at least some of the administration’s assertions.

“I’m outraged a woman was murdered by our government and our government lied to our faces about it,” said protester Tony Zarkades, 60, who has lived in the Huntington Beach area for nearly 30 years. A former officer in the Marines, Zarkades said he is thinking of moving to Orange to escape the presence of so many Trump supporters in Huntington Beach.

Large protests against ICE occurred in the Bay Area as well as Sacramento and other California cities over the weekend. In Oakland, hundreds demonstrated peacefully on Sunday, although the night before, protesters assembled at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and left graffiti, according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle.

In Los Angeles on Saturday night, protesters marched through the downtown area to City Hall and past the Edward Roybal Federal Building, with the L.A. Police Department issuing a dispersal order at about 6:30 p.m., according to City News Service.

While many of the protests focused on what happened to Good in Minnesota, they also recognized Keith Porter Jr., a man killed by an off-dutyICE agent in Northridge on New Year’s Eve.

In Huntington Beach, the coastal community has long had a reputation as a Southern California stronghold for Republicans, though its politics have recently been shifting. Orange County has a painful legacy of political extremism, including neo-Nazism. In 2021, a “White Lives Matter” rally in the area ended in 12 arrests.

On Sunday, a small group of about 30 counterprotesters waved Trump and MAGA flags on a corner opposite from the anti-ICE rally.

“We’re here to support our country and president and support ICE,” said Kelly Johnson, who gave his age as “old enough to be your sugar daddy.”

Wearing an “ICE Immigration: Making America Safe Again” T-shirt, Kelly said the protesters were “paid agitators” who had been lied to by the media.

“Look at the other angles of the [shooting] videos,” he said. “She ran over the officer.”

Standing with him was Jesse Huizar, 66, who said he identifies as a “Latino for Trump” and was here to “support the blue.”

The Chino resident said he came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 5, but that he has no fear of ICE because he “came here legally.”

Huizar said Good’s death was sad, but that she “if she had complied, if she got out of her car and followed orders, she’d be alive right now.”

But their voices were largely overpowered by those of the anti-ICE protesters. One of the event’s organizers, 52-year-old Huntington Beach resident Denise G., who declined to give her last name, said they’ve been gathering in front of City Hall every Sunday since March, but that this was by far one of the largest turnouts they have seen.

She felt “devastated, angry, and more determined than ever” when she saw the video of Good’s shooting, she said.

“It could be any one of us,” she said. “The people not out here today need to understand this could be their family member, their spouse, their children. The time is now. All hands on deck.”

Nearby, 27-year-old Yvonne Gonzales had gathered with about 10 of her friends. They said they were motivated to come because they were outraged by the shooting.

“I wish I was surprised by it,” Gonzales said, “but we’ve seen so much violence from ICE.”

She suspected that race was a factor in the outpouring of support, noting that Good was a white woman while many others who have been injured or killed by immigration enforcement actions have been people of color, but that it was still “great to see this turnout and visibility.”

A few feet away, 41-year-old Christie Martinez stood with her children, Elliott, 9, and Kane, 6. She teared up thinking about the shooting and the recent ICE actions in California, including the killing of Porter.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f89e567/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7945x4171+0+564/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F24%2F6f0c6ea14a598570445cd1d91182%2F1537581-me-ice-out-for-good-huntington-beach-klb-351.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 11:58:34.411425

In a dramatic scene similar to those playing out across Minneapolis, agents captured a man in the home just minutes after pepper spraying protesters outside who had confronted the heavily armed federal agents. Along the residential street, protesters honked car horns, banged on drums and blew whistles in attempts to disrupt the operation.

Video of the clash taken by The Associated Press showed some agents pushing back protesters while a distraught woman later emerged from the house with a document that federal agents presented to arrest the man.

Immigrant advocacy groups have conducted extensive “know-your-rights” campaigns urging people not to open their doors unless agents have a court order signed by a judge.

But within minutes of ramming the door in a neighborhood filled with single-family homes, the handcuffed man was led away.

More than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News on Sunday that the administration would send additional federal agents to Minnesota to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.

Minneapolis still tense after Renee Good shooting

The Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — is bracing for what is next after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer on Wednesday.

“We’re seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighborhoods,” said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city councilmember. “They’ve definitely been out here.”

Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents an area with a growing immigrant population, said he is closely monitoring information from chat groups about where residents are seeing agents operating.

People holding whistles positioned themselves in freezing temperatures on street corners Sunday in the neighborhood where Good was killed, watching for any signs of federal agents.

More than 20,000 people have taken part in a variety of trainings to become “observers” of enforcement activities in Minnesota since the 2024 election, said Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos MN, a local human rights organization.

“It’s a role that people choose to take on voluntarily, because they choose to look out for their neighbors,” Argueta said.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but residents remained anxious. On Monday, Minneapolis public schools will start offering remote learning for the next month in response to concerns that children might feel unsafe venturing out while tensions remain high.

Many schools closed last week after Good’s shooting and the upheaval that followed.

Questions about who should handle investigation

While the enforcement activity continues, two of the state’s leading Democrats said that the investigation into Good's shooting death should not be overseen solely by the federal government.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in separate interviews Sunday that state authorities should be included in the investigation because the federal government has already made clear what it believes happened.

“How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation, without prejudice, when at the beginning of that investigation they have already announced exactly what they saw — what they think happened,"" Smith said on ABC’s ""This Week.""

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, defended the officer on Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

""That law enforcement officer had milliseconds, if not short time to make a decision to save his life and his other fellow agents,” he said.

Lyons also said the administration’s enforcement operations in Minnesota wouldn't be needed “if local jurisdictions worked with us to turn over these criminally illegal aliens once they are already considered a public safety threat by the locals.”

The killing of Good by an ICE officer and the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, led to dozens of protests in cities across the country over the weekend, including New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Oakland, California.

(WBOY) — As the Harrison County community made their voices heard on Sunday, many Hispanic West Virginians took the time to share the fear they are experiencing.
“We’re just here to support our community, the Hispanic community to show them that they are not alone, we fight for them.
“I think many people think that will not be happening here in Clarksburg, West Virginia, but it’s happening.
“We don’t have a high percentage of Hispanic community.
I think everyone is still in shock that this can happen in such a small community,” Strauss said.","CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (WBOY) — As the Harrison County community made their voices heard on Sunday, many Hispanic West Virginians took the time to share the fear they are experiencing.

Following anti-ICE protests and rallies across the country, this small community says they have been the target of many raids and have received a lot of hate online.

12 News spoke with 3 protesters, Nury Ruble, Nina Strauss and Daisy Rivera, each belonging to the Hispanic community, about why they chose to attend the protest.

“We are in favor of human rights; we are here to support people that are scared and they don’t want to leave their houses. We are in very tough times right now, but we are here,” said Ruble.

“We’re just here to support our community, the Hispanic community to show them that they are not alone, we fight for them. Obviously, they cannot be here for being scared of the citation that we’re living here in Clarksburg right now. But we are here for them,” said Strauss.

“We just want ice to go away because our community is scared,” said Rivera.

Hispanic people living in the area believe that much of the tension comes online from many immigrants being labeled as criminal or illegal. They say these misconceptions can be harmful to those who have settled in the mountain state.

Ruble says she has been teaching here for more than eight years.

“We are adding many things to this community. I’ve been here serving as a teacher, a Hispanic teacher for 8 years. I’ve been working, I do as best as I can for this community, so we are not here, we are not criminals like many people think.”

Rivera told 12 News that her family has lived here for more than 20 years.

“Our families need us to work. We are not criminals. I myself, I went to college, Fairmont State, and my family, they have a business here,” Rivera said.

Now, those concerns about misconceptions have turned to fear. Ruble and Strauss say that it has been difficult to process ICE’s presence in north central West Virginia.

“I think many people think that will not be happening here in Clarksburg, West Virginia, but it’s happening. It’s what I know that people know. It’s happening, people are scared, and it’s a small community. There is not much diversity in this area, but we are scared,” Ruble said.

“We don’t have a high percentage of Hispanic community. There is not a lot of us here and it is shocking. I think everyone is still in shock that this can happen in such a small community,” Strauss said.

White, Nick Reisman",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/brace-for-impact-trump-turns-fraud-into-new-weapon-against-blue-states-00719401,"“He told us he was going to punish blue states.
While hostilities between Trump and Democratic-led states on immigration intensify following shootings in Minnesota and Oregon, he is now moving more aggressively on a separate track to cut off states’ funding.
“He’s attacking blue states out of revenge,” said Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois.
That choice drove a wedge between prominent California Democrats even before Trump moved to cut off funds.
Still, some New York Democrats wish the state were more aggressive in counteracting Trump’s efforts to mold blue states’ political destinies.","“I’ll say one thing about our president: He told us he was going to do this,” Manhattan Democrat Liz Krueger, the influential chair of the New York Senate Finance Committee, said of the administration’s funding cuts. “He told us he was going to punish blue states. We have to brace for impact, we have to use our legal skills, our amazing attorney general, and endless lawsuits to at least hold them back.”

The spending-focused line of attack from Trump marks an escalation in Trump’s already red-hot war on blue states. While hostilities between Trump and Democratic-led states on immigration intensify following shootings in Minnesota and Oregon, he is now moving more aggressively on a separate track to cut off states’ funding. And if “waste, fraud and abuse” is a familiar rallying cry for Republicans, it is now serving as fresh ammunition for Trump’s targeting of his political adversaries.

“He’s attacking blue states out of revenge,” said Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois. “If that’s in the form of sending in ICE, he sends in ICE. If it’s denying food and education to their children, which to be clear are America’s children, he’s gonna do that. What he is doing is seeking revenge at the cost of America’s most vulnerable people, putting those communities at risk.”

Trump’s offensive is already roiling politics in targeted states, where Democrats have largely chosen between two approaches to fending off the administration: casting the allegations as baseless or leaning into the risk of fraud and vowing to police it themselves.

That choice drove a wedge between prominent California Democrats even before Trump moved to cut off funds. Rep. Eric Swalwell, while saying that “Donald Trump looking for fraud is like OJ looking for the real killer,” nevertheless incorporated the issue into his campaign for governor by proposing a program rewarding state employees who identify misspending.

Meanwhile, Newsom’s office pushed back after Rep. Ro Khanna asserted, with dubious evidence, that California had lost $72 billion to fraud and called for more federal scrutiny. Khanna, also a potential presidential contender, has argued Democrats must crack down on wasteful spending if they are to build public trust.

“My view is there is mismanagement and inefficient spending that we need to account for, in California and in states across the country,” Khanna said in an interview.

From the Newsom administration’s perspective, Khanna was unhelpfully amplifying a conservative talking point underpinned by questionable math. Republicans at the highest level have hammered the $72 billion figure, which appears to be an amalgam of previously reported unemployment fraud, high-speed rail expenditures and spending programs flagged by the state’s auditor for being vulnerable to fraud or poorly tracked.

Newsom has worked to flip the script by arguing Trump squandered taxpayer money with a National Guard deployment blocked by the courts, while his office posted an AI-generated image of the governor punching a man wearing a shirt reading “FRAUD” and mocking Vice President JD Vance for labeling as fraud the state’s provision of health insurance to undocumented patients.

In New York, Democrats were alarmed by the Trump administration’s decision to yank funding and have already signaled plans to file legal challenges. But the president’s broadside is scrambling the fraught election-year politics facing New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.

A moderate Democrat who speaks frequently with the president, Hochul condemned the move and vowed to fight it in court.

“It’s this depth of cruelty,” she told MSNOW. “They think they’re going to get to me, but the kids are the political pawns in this process, and they’re not doing that calculation.”

Hochul has already tangled with Trump over his administration’s unsuccessful efforts to kill a controversial Manhattan toll plan, which is meant to generate cash for New York City area mass transit projects.

Still, some New York Democrats wish the state were more aggressive in counteracting Trump’s efforts to mold blue states’ political destinies. And Trump’s cuts are bolstering calls to hike taxes on rich people in California and New York, a move both states’ governors oppose.

“It’s going to require us to really do what we should be doing, which is sharing our prosperity here in New York,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is challenging Hochul in a June primary, said in an interview. “Obviously his decision is disgusting, immoral and deeply regrettable. That being said, New York has a responsibility to step up and do what we can. If that means raising revenue, we should.”

The development arrives at a delicate time for Hochul and newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. The two Democrats are pursuing the creation of a free child care program — a politically popular, but expensive measure that’s expected to cost $15 billion once fully phased in.

Mamdani, who had a surprisingly chummy visit with Trump after his election last year where they bonded over sharing voters in the Big Apple, called the cuts “a cruel decision.”

In Colorado, the Trump administration is threatening a $24 million cut over commercial drivers licenses it says were illegally issued to immigrants. The state’s Democratic attorney general in a court filing Thursday accused the president of waging a “revenge campaign” by withholding funding and declining to release a pardoned elections clerk from prison, according to local media reports.

The state was also targeted with the child care funding freeze, as were Illinois, New York, Minnesota and California. All five states are suing in an attempt to access the money, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the cuts on Friday in response.

For Republicans, the scandal in Minnesota served not only as fresh justification for cuts targeting blue states, but also demonstrated the effectiveness of a fraud-focused line of attack.

“There’s no bigger political target on the landscape than Gavin Newsom,” said Jon Fleischman, a former executive director of the California GOP. “So if you go into Minnesota and uncover this kind of fraud, why wouldn’t you want to look at whether or not this kind of fraud is going on in California?”

A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

In the wake of Walz dropping his reelection campaign, Democrats are laboring to contain the blast radius, fearing that even unsubstantiated allegations could resonate with voters.

“The withholding of funds, that’s a huge headache. But the other headache is that when the president says stuff like this, it undermines people’s confidence in government,” said California state Sen. Tom Umberg, a Democrat and former federal prosecutor. “It creates unnecessary turmoil based on nothing but fabricated allegations.”

In response, some Democratic operatives are warning against being drawn into a debate about public spending that focuses on potential fraud rather than on the people who benefit from a robust social safety net.

“Donald Trump is weaponizing the federal government in order to harm poor people and exert dominance over his foes,” said Mike Shimpock, a Los Angeles based consultant. “The debate isn’t: ‘Is there fraud in social services?’ The debate is: Are you creating a government that’s run for billionaires and corporations?”

Elizabeth Ashford, a consultant whose clients include California’s Assembly speaker, Robert Rivas, argued California’s extensive system of budget oversight committees and audits is effectively policing the system.

“Trump is in panic, wag-the-dog mode, and of course he is only going after Democratic governors — that’s how he operates,” Ashford said, drawing a parallel between Trump threatening childcare funding and California struggling to wring more wildfire assistance out of the federal government.

“We’ve already paid for this stuff,” Ashford said. “Now he’s going to take this money and move it around to red states? It’s disgusting.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F44%2F31%2Fd6c8060041b0ac54bb98481006ee%2Ftrump-30700.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 10:59:40.998433

But, I would rather say we were dealing with the Justice Department, and the leading office in the Justice Department was the Office for Civil Rights, and the Justice Department was represented by an assistant attorney general … There was a representative from the White House, and then there were, at different times, the Department of Education — the secretary and the general counsel of Education. While they were involved, if you asked me who I think was making decisions about this, I think it was the Justice Department.

The Daily: How many versions (of the deal) did you see that you said you would never sign?

Bienen: More than one, a couple of versions, but they didn’t change very often. One of the problems, I think, and why I don’t like the term ‘negotiation.’ Most people would understand by negotiation, you give me a list of things you want. I reply to it. I say what I don’t like about your list, and we go back and forth. I would say that that would not characterize the dealings with the federal government. Because we would say something, then we wouldn’t hear anything … We had different sets of lawyers, and you know, that was frustrating …

And finally, we had something that I was willing to put my name on, and at the very last minute after the federal government said, ‘Okay, we have a deal,’ … And then they sent in two new provisos, which were not part of (the deal), and I said I wouldn’t sign them.

The Daily: And what was on those?

Bienen: I’m not going to say what was on them, but I will say only one general thing about it: Part of the deal which was very important to me was, you can’t look back and put something in the agreement which allows the federal government to relitigate with us all the aspects of the deal. … And the other thing that was really important to me was not to have an outside monitor, not to have somebody the federal government would appoint, or have somebody we would jointly appoint, that was outside the University, which is what they did with Columbia. … It was really important to me just to have a certainty we were done with this, not for anybody to go back and say, “Oh, well, what about that?” So, there was a new paragraph that, as I read it — I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t think you had to be a great lawyer to read this paragraph — it looked to me like it could open up everything, and I would never sign it. And I told Mr. Barris, you know, I wouldn’t sign it. Get another president. But Mr. Barris had the same view. …

It wasn’t something terrible in the other paragraph. What I found objectionable is that they were asking us to do it. It’s not up to the federal government to tell us, as I’ve said over and over again, who we can hire, who we can fire, what we teach, what organizations we affiliate with, and this proviso overstepped the line in that regard. … We said, “That’s it. I mean, we’re just not going to sign this stuff.” And then two hours later, they took all that out of the proviso.

The Daily: Some students and faculty expressed concern about the fact that the deal with the government followed the Executive Order’s definition of gender as gender assigned at birth. Why was that explicitly included in the agreement?

Bienen: The federal government was, to my view, unmovable in those conversations. As I said the other day at the State of the University, I don’t like any of the language that has to do with gender or transgender, and I think most of it is irrelevant to what we do. The federal government disagreed.

The Daily: Also in the deal, the University is supposed to review its business practices related to international students. How is the University going to do that? And if it finds an “overreliance” on international student admissions, will the University change anything?

Bienen: We are not dependent on international students. Just to speak about undergraduates for a minute — it’s good for the University to have international students. It’s good for the world that we train people in the things we’re good at, whether it’s mathematics or chemistry or history, whatever. A great university should have a diverse population in it by every way you can figure it to my mind, including people who want to come here from different countries. It’s a good thing for us, it’s a good thing for them.

The Daily: There’s particular language about treating international students, what it means to “socialize international students to the norms of a campus dedicated to inquiry and open debate.” Is that something new? Or, has that always been there?

Bienen: No, that’s new that they insisted on this. Again, I think all the training stuff, I’m on record as saying I don’t love these training programs. I think they’re silly. That’s another thing they wanted. Doesn’t mean somebody has to do something. They just have to listen to somebody say something. If that’s improved the quality of humankind, it’s news to me — that somebody was forced to go someplace, to sit and listen to something they didn’t want to listen to. And once in a while, I suppose you’ll learn something under those conditions. I doubt it’s a maximal use of time. However, that’s part of the deal.

The Daily: The University agreed not to provide permanent housing for Middle Eastern and North African students and to take away their temporary space —

Bienen: One of the things we would like is, we’re working on it now, is to try to provide different kind of housing for people, so for Islamic groups, not necessarily MENA. But I’ve met with folks, and we want to help provide housing which is off-campus, which is what we do for Chabad and what we do for Hillel.

The Daily: Does the Northwestern University Police Department have a response plan in place in case some of that enforcement activity (by ICE) does manage to happen on campus?

Bienen: Good question that I don’t know the answer to.

The Daily: What would the University’s response be if, for example, a student or faculty or staff member were to be detained or questioned by federal immigration enforcers on campus?

Bienen: I think we would try to provide help, legal assistance, to faculty or staff. If you’re asking the hypothetical, would we fight with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on campus? They’ve never asked to come to campus. The federal government can come onto your campus. It has the right to do that. I wouldn’t like it very much.

Last week’s fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer in Minneapolis turned the city into a symbol of national resistance to federal immigration enforcement. The tragedy also thrust deteriorating relations between state leaders and President Donald Trump into the spotlight.

State and federal officials say an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot Ms. Good on a residential street during a surge of immigration arrests in the city. Beyond those facts, reaction stands sharply divided: Senior Trump administration officials likened the woman killed to a domestic terrorist and claimed she attempted to kill officers with her car. Minnesota officials vehemently reject that account, arguing video footage shows the U.S. citizen and mother of three tried to leave the scene. The Minneapolis mayor has told ICE to leave, but more federal law enforcement personnel are on their way.

Under the United States’ federal system, set up by the Constitution, states and the federal government are given their own spheres of influence – and an expectation of collaboration. The friction in Minnesota highlights how, at a time of deep political division, the risks of intensifying confrontations are heightened, analysts say. And the divide is not just among political leaders. In Minneapolis and across the U.S. this weekend, thousands of protesters gathered to honor Ms. Good and decry the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics – echoing protests in 2020 after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by a local police officer.

“Certainly Minnesota and the federal government, or the Trump administration, has had some difficulties, but it really seems to have hit an inflection point and heated up,” says Amy Koch, a Republican political strategist and former Minnesota Senate majority leader. “Both sides have become so divided that they can’t even agree on things that seem obvious.”

Separate investigations into Ms. Good’s death by officials in Washington, D.C., and in Minnesota, breaking from tradition, mirror the split-screen political fissure of the broader United States. The showdown here builds on power struggles between Mr. Trump and other Democratic strongholds, like in California, Illinois, and Oregon, where the administration has sent or attempted to send National Guard troops in recent months.

On the ground in Minneapolis, the immigration enforcement surge looks disproportionate to the size of the immigrant population, says Ryan Allen, associate dean for research at the University of Minnesota. About 2% of the state’s population is made up of immigrants without legal status, according to the Pew Research Center, much lower than some other states including California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

Sanctuary policies versus federal law

Yet nationwide, the conflict between federal and local government over immigration has long roots. For decades, Congress has failed to agree on comprehensive policies to address border security and unauthorized immigrants. Some largely Democratic states and cities, Minneapolis among them, developed what are often called sanctuary policies for immigrants.

In turn, the Trump administration has targeted those states and cities, with Minnesota in its sights long before this winter. Sanctuary status lacks a firm definition, but suggests a city, county, or state that limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. In Minneapolis, one recently revised city ordinance underscores the tension. The policy says no government entity is authorized to use city-owned parking lots, vacant lots, or garages for immigration operations.

Still, ICE has law-enforcement allies in the state. Out of Minnesota’s 87 counties, seven sheriffs have cooperative agreements with the agency, which deputize state and local law enforcement for certain immigration actions. Those seven counties voted for Mr. Trump in 2024, and inked their ICE agreements after his return.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also pledged to target Minnesota over pandemic-era fraud in social services programs, over which several people of Somali descent have been convicted or charged. (The White House says the Department of Justice so far has charged 94 people in fraud cases tied to Minnesota, 85 of whom are of Somali descent.) A top U.S. prosecutor estimates fraud from Medicaid programs in the state could top $9 billion. After the yearslong fraud investigations resurfaced through right-wing media attention, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to send 2,000 federal agents to the state in early January.

While the state’s Somali population was impacted by a travel ban under Mr. Trump’s first term, the current crackdown in Minneapolis is a “much more focused attention that has been, if anything, ramped up over the past month,” Professor Allen says.

A divide over the shooting investigation

One sign of the breakdown in trust is the dissolution of a partnership between state and federal officials on investigating Ms. Good’s death.

Minnesota investigators initially worked on the case of Ms. Good’s shooting in collaboration with federal investigators. But that process halted, according to the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which said the FBI would take over the investigation. The state and Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, have put out calls to crowdsource evidence for their own investigation.

Data sharing is a key part of federal-state cooperation, says Paul Nolette, professor of political science at Marquette University. The absence of that sharing, in the Good case, “really is an escalation of tensions,” he says.

“Typically the baseline, regardless of the administration, usually is cooperation,” says Dr. Nolette. That means “state and federal agencies – as well as local agencies and prosecutors – working to build cases against the accused and carry out justice.”

At an anti-ICE march in Minneapolis on Saturday, where thousands faced subfreezing temperatures, a woman named Sarah called for the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to be included by the FBI in the shooting investigation. The high school teacher, like others interviewed, declined to share her full name for privacy concerns.

“When we all stand together, it feels really powerful,” Sarah says as the chanting crowd passes by.

Some Minnesotans worry about how to address fraud – and keep people safe amid the federal-state tension.

In a parking lot in Blaine, a suburb north of Minneapolis, a man named Tim says he is concerned about fraud in the state, and supports more immigrant arrests. “You want to be humanitarian. At the same time, what can we afford?” he asks.

The Minneapolis shooting last week was “tragic,” says the construction worker who also drives semitrucks, though it seems she “put herself in that situation by interfering and obstructing ICE.” He expects more people to get hurt on “both sides.”

Before thousands marched Saturday, anti-federal fervor in Minneapolis had turned aggressive late in the week. The city announced an unlawful assembly, with 30 people detained for blocking roads and damaging property downtown. Near the airport, clashes between federal agents and protesters have continued at a federal building.

Trump and Walz at odds since 2024

Disputes between President Trump and Minnesota politicians – including Gov. Tim Walz – aren’t new.

The May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer – about a mile from Ms. Good’s killing – sparked countrywide protests and a national reckoning over race. Local demonstrations at times turned violent, with arson, looting, and property damage, which Mr. Trump and fellow Republicans condemned. Governor Walz declared a “peacetime emergency” at the time and called up the Minnesota National Guard. In recent days, the governor asked those service members to prepare in case they’re tapped again.

In 2024, Mr. Trump and Governor Walz faced off on the campaign trail, with Vice President Kamala Harris picking Mr. Walz as her running mate. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the governor incompetent.

Governor Walz has taken heat for calling immigration officers “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.” The administration says such language incites violence, and affirms agents’ use of masks to hide their faces.

“The vice president candidate usually becomes the chief attack dog. And so Governor Walz started doing that job,” says Ms. Koch. “Postelection, Governor Walz continued to be a really vocal, outspoken detractor of this administration.”

In June, political violence rocked the state with the fatal shooting of Minnesota’s Democratic state representative and former state House Speaker Melissa Hortman, along with her husband. A Democratic state senator and his wife were also shot. President Trump, himself a survivor of political assassination attempts, posted a conspiracy video insinuating the governor’s involvement in Ms. Hortman’s death, which her children have asked the president to remove.

Federal action meets grassroots activism

The White House has seized before on serious but isolated incidents involving immigrant suspects to justify crackdowns on broader groups. In Minnesota, federal goals include investigating people for fraudulently acquired lawful status, including some admitted as refugees.

Meanwhile, grassroots anti-Trump activism has surged in response to more immigration enforcement in Minnesota, including information networks on federal sightings, anti-ICE signs at businesses, and meal deliveries to families who fear leaving home. While local activists have learned from other cities responding to upticks in immigrant arrests, Minneapolis also has experience building organizing networks around the protests of 2020, says Professor Allen.

“I think part of what we’re seeing is a reliance on some of that knowledge and infrastructure that has been built over a number of years,” he says.

Some efforts are more recent. The nonprofit COPAL, an advocacy group for Latino families, started training legal observers, who monitor federal law enforcement, after the 2024 election. The group trained around 400 people the night after Ms. Good’s death. Trainees are told to record arrests in public spaces while keeping several feet from officers, says Francisco Segovia, the executive director.

“We are not going to obstruct or intervene,” he says. Local documentation of Ms. Good’s killing on a residential street proves that videos are key “to make our government accountable,” he says. Activism aside, however, many immigrants live with fear of arrest.

“We know people who have documents, but they are afraid to go out or go to work,” says Mr. Segovia. “The psychological impact of this is huge.”

Nationally, beyond scenes of division, Americans may actually want compromise on immigration. Polling suggests strong support for strong border security and easier paths to citizenship for immigrants already here. Last year, concern about immigration’s effects on the U.S. also declined.

“They can’t come out”

How big a blow Mr. Trump will land in Minnesota remains to be seen. For now, a federal judge in New York has stopped his plan to freeze federal child care funding there and in four other Democrat-led states.

Still, citing fraud concerns and anti-ICE hostility, several agencies are tightening the vise. The Treasury Department has said it will ramp up fraud investigations. The Small Business Administration announced the relocation of its Minneapolis office. And the Agriculture Department pledged to pause financial awards to the city and the state.

On the ground, immigration arrests continue, with more agents on the way. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that “hundreds” more federal officers were headed to Minnesota to boost the safety of officers already present. Many lawfully present Minnesotans – and U.S. citizens – carry their passport or other paperwork in case officers stop them on the street. Others have retreated from public view.

On Saturday, a Minneapolis school bus driver named Luis marched alone on his family’s behalf. The U.S. citizen says several loved ones fear arrest.

“My mom, my dad, my nephews, my wife – they’re at home,” says Luis. “They can’t come out.”

This is the third year of Golden Globes activism for Morales Rocketto, who has previously rallied Hollywood to protest the Trump administration's family separation policies.
That initial outreach included labor activist Ai-jen Poo, who walked the Golden Globes' red carpet in 2018 with Meryl Streep to highlight the Time's Up movement.
Allies of their movement have been attending the ""fancy events"" that take place in the days leading up to the Golden Globes, according to Stamp.","Some celebrities donned anti-ICE pins at the Golden Globes on Sunday in tribute to Renee Good, who was shot and killed in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer last week in Minneapolis.

The black-and-white pins displayed slogans like ""BE GOOD"" and ""ICE OUT,"" introducing a political angle into the awards show after last year's relatively apolitical ceremony.

Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne wore the pins on the red carpet, while Jean Smart and Ariana Grande donned them once inside the ballroom. Smart had the pin on her dress as she accepted the award for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy series.

Since the shooting Wednesday, protests have broken out across the country, calling for accountability for Good's death as well as a separate shooting in Portland where Border Patrol agents wounded two people. Some protests have resulted in clashes with law enforcement, especially in Minneapolis, where ICE is carrying out its largest immigration enforcement operation to date.

""We need every part of civil society, society to speak up,"" said Nelini Stamp of Working Families Power, one of the organizers for the anti-ICE pins. ""We need our artists. We need our entertainers. We need the folks who reflect society.""

Congressmembers have vowed an assertive response, and an FBI investigation into Good's killing is ongoing. The Trump administration has doubled down in defending the ICE officer's actions, maintaining that he was acting in self-defense and thought Good would hit him with her car.

Just a week before Good was killed, an off-duty ICE officer fatally shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Porter in Los Angeles. His death sparked protests in the Los Angeles area, calling for the officer responsible to be arrested.

Organizers bring grassroots push to Golden Globes parties

The idea for the ""ICE OUT"" pins began with a late-night text exchange earlier this week between Stamp and Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director of a Latino advocacy group called Maremoto.

They know that high-profile cultural moments can introduce millions of viewers to social issues. This is the third year of Golden Globes activism for Morales Rocketto, who has previously rallied Hollywood to protest the Trump administration's family separation policies. Stamp said she always thinks of the 1973 Oscars, when Sacheen Littlefeather took Marlon Brando's place and declined his award to protest American entertainment's portrayal of Native Americans.

So, the two organizers began calling up the celebrities and influencers they knew, who in turn brought their campaign to the more prominent figures in their circles. That initial outreach included labor activist Ai-jen Poo, who walked the Golden Globes' red carpet in 2018 with Meryl Streep to highlight the Time's Up movement.

""There is a longstanding tradition of people who create art taking a stand for justice in moments,"" Stamp said. ""We're going to continue that tradition.""

Allies of their movement have been attending the ""fancy events"" that take place in the days leading up to the Golden Globes, according to Stamp. They're passing out the pins at parties and distributing them to neighbors who will be attending tonight's ceremony.

""They put it in their purse and they're like, 'Hey would you wear this?' It's so grassroots,"" Morales Rocketto said.

The organizers pledged to continue the campaign throughout awards season to ensure the public knows the names of Good and others killed by ICE agents in shootings.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3370x1896+0+176/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff1%2F22%2Fc9ac79294078b8744132f9527e28%2Fap26011833210577.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 05:58:14.069457

He said involving state agencies in the probe wouldn’t necessarily lead to criminal charges against the ICE officer, but would lead to a fair, impartial investigation.
That’s part of my role as mayor,” he told Welker, before placing the majority of the blame for rising tensions on federal officials.","Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Sunday called for the federal government to allow state agencies to help investigate an ICE officer’s fatal shooting of a woman in his city last week, citing a “deep mistrust” of federal agencies in Minnesota.

Asked by “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker if he would accept the results of an FBI investigation of the incident, Frey said, “If it was an FBI investigation that was done jointly with an investigation from the [Minnesota] Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, we could have some trust that there were entities and individuals at the table that were properly reviewing the evidence.”

The mayor said he didn’t have preconceived notions about what conclusion an investigation by any agency would reach, but “there is deep mistrust” of federal agencies in Minnesota, “because so many of the things that we are hearing are not true.”

His comments come days after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

Federal officials, including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, have claimed that Good was driving her car at ICE agents, intent on ramming into them. Local officials, including Frey, have said that she was just trying to leave the scene and that no ICE officers were in harm’s way at the time of the shooting.

“The ICE agent was not run over, as Trump stated,” Frey said Sunday. “You had a person that was definitively trying to just get out of there. They were trying to leave the scene.”

The mayor pointed to multiple publicly available videos of the shooting, including a cellphone video taken by the officer who shot Good.

“You don’t need to take my word for it. You don’t need to take their word for it. Watch the video,” Frey said.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the agency was informed by federal investigators that it “would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.”

Asked by reporters about the decision to freeze the state out of the probe, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday that state investigators were “not doing their work” following the shooting.

Like Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz last week said he had doubts about the federal government’s investigation, telling reporters, “It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome.”

Walz added that he felt that way “because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem.”

The governor accused federal officials of lying, saying they “have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate.”

On Sunday, Frey also blamed federal officials for publicly passing judgment too quickly. He said involving state agencies in the probe wouldn’t necessarily lead to criminal charges against the ICE officer, but would lead to a fair, impartial investigation.

“Let’s have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn’t biased. Let’s not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice. Let’s have it with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at the state level,” the mayor told “Meet the Press.”

“This is an entity that has expertise. They have a long history of investigating cases just like this, and they have had investigations come, by the way, to both conclusions: with a charge and without a charge,” he added.

Frey blamed federal officials for building “a narrative that had jumped to the conclusion right from the get-go.”

“When you’ve got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,” he added.

Frey also spoke to Welker about whether he has any responsibility to help lower the temperature in his community when it comes to tension between federal agents and community members, who participated in peaceful protests against ICE en masse last week.

Frey on Wednesday told ICE agents to “get the f--- out of our city.”

“Of course, I bear responsibility to bring down the temperature. That’s part of my role as mayor,” he told Welker, before placing the majority of the blame for rising tensions on federal officials.

“To those that are offended, I’m sorry I offended their delicate ears. But as far as who inflamed the situation, you know, I dropped an f-bomb and they killed somebody. I think the killing somebody is the inflammatory element here, not the f-bomb,” Frey said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260110-Jacob-Frey-ch-1338-78f68a.jpg",N,,2026-01-12 05:58:19.168284

Portland City Councilor Angelita Morillo made an Instagram post reacting to the aforementioned video of the officer's comments.","A Portland police officer has been reassigned following the emergence of a video showing him stating he would shoot someone if they drove their car at him during a protest.

The incident sparked reactions from city officials and the community.

Mayor Wilson expressed the community's shock and grief over the situation, referencing the ""tragic and preventable death"" of Renee Nicole Good as an example of the chaos and violence attributed to federal overreach in Portland.

Good was a U.S. citizen who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer (ICE) in Minnesota on Wednesday.

The Department of Homeland Security described the shooting as an act of self-defense after Good began to drive toward officers, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey argued otherwise.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,"" Frey said in a press conference on Jan. 7. ""Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bull***.""

The video was posted just days after a U.S. Border Patrol officer shot and injured two people in a traffic stop in Portland.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said officers in Portland shot at the couple because they were afraid they were going to be run over; a similar statement to the one issued after the shooting and killing of Good in Minneapolis.

DHS and PPB both also said that the two people shot were connected to a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.

Portland City Councilor Angelita Morillo made an Instagram post reacting to the aforementioned video of the officer's comments.

In her video post, she calls on Portlanders to contact Mayor Wilson about the incident.

""I was extremely frustrated that a representative of our police department would feel comfortable speaking to protestors in that way,"" Morillo told KATU. ""We need them to be in a neutral de-escalatory position, and what I saw there was our police acting as counter-protestors, frankly.""

She went on to say, ""when [officers] start using indiscriminate force against entire crowds, that actually agitates our Portlanders who are trying to exercise their First Amendment rights, and it just puts people in a tense position between the city and our constituents.""

Morillo said she and her fellow city council members are monitoring what's happening on the ground as protests outside of the ICE facility in South Portland, as well as across the city, continue.

""People's emotions are heightened and rightfully so,"" Morillo said. ""We are seeing their neighbors get kidnapped and taken, and we need our police to be a peacemaking force, not a force that is going to escalate tensions.""

KATU has reached out to the person who posted the video of the officer on TikTok for additional information, awaiting response.",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/1320/center/90/631da3c7-557e-4003-a9a9-59404e3bf3f9-PolicedetainsomeoneoutsideoftheICEfacilityinSouthPortlandonJanuary82026KATUimage.png,N,,2026-01-12 05:58:25.189868

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly said she has “had enough” following the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer during a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis, calling the incident further evidence that ICE has become “a rogue force” operating without accountability in American cities.

“I will be filing Articles of Impeachment against Kristi Noem,” Kelly said in a statement released Wednesday, January 7, 2026. “She has turned ICE into a rogue force, violating the Constitution, tearing families apart, and leaving death in her wake. From Chicago to Minneapolis, her recklessness cost lives.”

The shooting occurred shortly after 9:30 a.m. in a residential neighborhood south of downtown Minneapolis, where federal immigration agents were conducting an enforcement operation. According to bystander videos and national reporting, ICE officers approached a woman seated inside an SUV stopped in the middle of the street, ordered her to exit the vehicle, and attempted to open the driver’s door. Moments later, an ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle fired multiple shots at close range, killing the driver.

Video footage posted online shows the vehicle beginning to pull away just before shots were fired. It remains unclear whether the vehicle made contact with the officer. The SUV later crashed into parked cars a short distance away as witnesses screamed in shock.

The woman was identified by her family as Renee Nicole Good, 37, a Minneapolis resident who lived just blocks from where she was shot. Her mother, Donna Ganger, told reporters that the family was notified of Good’s death late Wednesday morning.

“That’s so stupid,” Ganger said after learning some of the circumstances. “She was probably terrified.”

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” Ganger added. “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”

Family members said Good was a wife and mother. She shared a 6-year-old child with her late husband, Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023. Macklin’s father said Good also had two additional children believed to be living with extended family.

Neighbors described Good as a warm and engaged presence in the community. One neighbor said she often saw Good and her young son outside playing. “It’s a beautiful family,” the neighbor said. “They’re always outside.”

At an evening vigil near the site of the shooting, hundreds of mourners chanted Good’s name. Community leaders rejected federal claims that she posed a threat. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-Minnesota, said Good “died because she loved her neighbors.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the shooting as an act of self-defense, alleging that the woman “weaponized her vehicle” and attempted to run over federal agents—language the Department of Homeland Security has used in prior ICE-related shootings. President Donald Trump echoed that assessment on social media.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly disputed that account after reviewing the video footage.

“Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly—that is bullshit,” Frey said during a televised press conference, criticizing the federal government’s rapid characterization of the shooting.

The killing sparked protests in Minneapolis and across the country, including solidarity demonstrations in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, where residents and activists have spent months organizing against aggressive federal immigration enforcement actions.

Chicago activists and elected officials drew direct parallels between the Minneapolis killing and multiple ICE-related shootings that occurred in the Chicago area during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” a months-long immigration crackdown that flooded the region with federal agents.

In September, Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican-born father and restaurant worker, was fatally shot by ICE during a traffic stop in suburban Franklin Park. Federal officials initially claimed the agent fired in self-defense after being dragged by the vehicle, but body camera footage later contradicted those claims. One month later, Marimar Martinez was shot multiple times in Chicago’s Brighton Park by a Border Patrol agent; federal prosecutors later dropped all charges against her.

Kelly referenced those incidents in her statement Wednesday, accusing Secretary Noem of misleading the public and attempting to conceal misconduct by federal agents.

“The city of Chicago knows all too well that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem only lies,” Kelly said, pointing to prior cases where video evidence contradicted official accounts.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, the Senate Democratic Whip and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, also condemned the shooting and called for a full investigation. He described the loss of life as “tragic, heartbreaking, and enraging,” while urging protesters to remain peaceful.

“Video of the incident starkly contradicts DHS’s narrative, and the fact that DHS has jumped to characterize this shooting in ‘self-defense’ is rushed, at best, and a lie, at worst,” Durbin said. He cited previous federal court rulings criticizing the use of force by immigration agents.

Durbin noted that he and Senator Tammy Duckworth have already referred potential violations of federal civil rights law by immigration agents to the U.S. Department of Justice following enforcement actions in Chicago.

Civil rights organizations also responded swiftly. Refuse Fascism organized emergency demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, calling the killing “cold-blooded murder” and demanding the removal of ICE from U.S. cities.

As investigations continue, Kelly said her decision to pursue impeachment is about more than a single incident.

“It’s one thing to be incompetent and dangerous,” she said. “But it’s impeachable to break the rule of law.”",https://chicagocrusader.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hq720-2-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 06:57:57.926914

Protesters screamed at heavily-armed federal agents and honked car horns, banged on drums and blew whistles in attempts to disrupt their operations in one Minneapolis neighborhood filled with single-family homes.

There was some pushing and several people were hit with chemical spray just before agents banged down the door of one home on Sunday. They later took one man away in handcuffs.

“We’re seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighborhoods,” said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city councilmember. “They’ve definitely been out here.”

Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents an area with a growing immigrant population, said he is closely monitoring information from chat groups about where residents are seeing agents operating.

People holding whistles positioned themselves in freezing temperatures on street corners in the neighborhood where 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed Wednesday, watching for any signs of federal agents.

More than 20,000 people have taken part in a variety of trainings to become “observers” of enforcement activities in Minnesota since the 2024 election, said Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos MN, a local human rights organization.

“It’s a role that people choose to take on voluntarily, because they choose to look out for their neighbors,” Argueta said.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but the Twin Cities remained anxious. On Monday, Minneapolis public schools will start offering remote learning for the next month in response to concerns that children might feel unsafe venturing out while tensions remain high.

Many schools closed last week after Good’s shooting and the upheaval that followed.

While the enforcement activity continues, two of the state’s leading Democrats said that the investigation into Good’s shooting death should not be overseen solely by the federal government.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in separate interviews Sunday that state authorities should be included in the investigation because the federal government has already made clear what it believes happened.

“How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation, without prejudice, when at the beginning of that investigation they have already announced exactly what they saw — what they think happened,” Smith said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, defended the officer on Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

“That law enforcement officer had milliseconds, if not short time to make a decision to save his life and his other fellow agents,” he said.

Lyons also said the administration’s enforcement operations in Minnesota wouldn’t be needed “if local jurisdictions worked with us to turn over these criminally illegal aliens once they are already considered a public safety threat by the locals.”

More than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the operation began at the beginning of December, said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

The killing of Good by an ICE officer and the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, led to dozens of protests across the country over the weekend.

In Elk Grove Village, a moment of silence kicked off the day. In Arlington Heights, protesters lined the road, taking their encouragement from passing motorists.

Through conversations with activists and organisers, Sam Gonçalves explores the power and limits of protest in the 21st century. From landless workers in Brazil to unionising chefs in Glasgow, he traces stories of collective struggle and resistance, challenging the idea that making a positive impact is an individual act and revealing the ways communities create change together.

​​My first conversation with Pinar Aksu happened in the Summer of 2024. We picked up some coffees and walked over to Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Park to find a bench. She is a community organiser and educator, involved in several campaigns and deeply engaged with key movements in the city and beyond.

It was one of those days when you can’t quite tell if it’s warm or if you have been in Scotland long enough for your concept of ‘cold’ to be skewed. Either way, we were going to talk about the hostile environment in the UK for refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants, as well as some of the organising that has been done to combat it – a tough topic to discuss comprehensively. In the first half of the 2020s alone, you can talk about immigration detention centres, dawn raids, low quality housing, and an openly racist atmosphere in the national media. Key legislation was passed, like the Nationality and Borders Act, the Illegal Migration Act, the Safety of Rwanda Act, all making life significantly harder for many people.

An incident at Glasgow’s Park Inn Hotel in June 2020 was a particular low point for Pinar, when an asylum seeker was shot dead by police after stabbing six individuals. “I would have assumed after [Park Inn] they would have maybe stopped using hotels or they would have changed something but no, they didn’t.”

The use of hotels to house asylum seekers has been criticised by campaigners due to the isolation, poverty and poor mental health it generates. They argue asylum seekers should be housed in communities, where they can integrate in ‘dignified, safe, habitable, and fit for purpose accommodations.’ Still, nothing’s changed.

It all contributes to a paralysing sense that things could not possibly get better, she continued. “People feel defeated because we are like, Okay what’s the worst that could happen that’s going to make things U-turn? Then worse things happen and things do not change.”

It’s not difficult to lose any sense of hope in a situation like this. “Sometimes I’m like, what’s the point?” Pinar explained, “because the laws are getting worse and worse.”

Governments May Use Different Words

Pinar came to Scotland from Turkey when she was eight years old. When you move countries at that age, you often don’t understand what is going on but Pinar has positive memories of her school and the community around her. At fourteen, she was taken to an immigration detention centre along with her parents and siblings.

Pinar’s community rallied around her family, gaining support from politicians, charities and campaign groups. Their efforts resulted in a positive outcome. After more than two months in detention, her family were one of the few to be released. Pinar, being the eldest of the siblings, became the translator for her parents. She had a front seat to the impact a grassroots campaign could have.

In a piece for the End the Immigration Detention of Children campaign, she wrote, ‘I don’t see any difference between a detention centre and a prison. Governments may use different words to make these policies sound acceptable, however it is the same as I was being deprived of my liberty without cause. Our rights as citizens were taken away. As a child at the time, I saw many things that no child should see.’

She didn’t always want to be organising around these issues. Pinar was going to study chemical engineering at university, but at a certain point realised she might feel more at home pursuing a place in community development after spending her whole life witnessing campaigns and activists first hand. “I think all these things added lots of experience and I was able to see different issues in different communities and how communities come together, the importance of dialogue, not judging one another.”

Currently, as the Human Rights Advocacy Coordinator for Maryhill Integration Network, Pinar is part of a number of campaigns for the rights of asylum seekers including the Right to Vote campaign, advocating for asylum seekers to be able to vote on Scottish elections and the Our Grades Not Visas campaign, which identified the barriers for refugees to access further education. Both were clear and recent successes. Then there is the on-going Right to Work campaign, advocating for asylum seekers to be granted permission to find employment – which they are currently not allowed to do, and the End Hotel Detention campaign, backing community-based residential accommodation for asylum seekers.

Sat on the park bench, I was keen to ask her about two things that stick out to me about these campaigns. On the one hand, they seem to be moving fast. In the last few years there have been many legislative wins that had a direct impact on people’s lives. In early 2024, a campaign for free bus travel for asylum seekers received a positive response from the Government and looked like it would be implemented rapidly. On the other hand, the barrier to these campaigns is the immigration policy in the UK, the aforementioned ‘hostile environment’. Can the monumental weight of anti-immigration media coverage, public sentiment and policy ever be shifted?

Pinar seemed to agree with these two elements of the organising she’s involved in. One of the main reasons it can be so difficult to effectively bring about change around this issue, she believes, is that the racism and hostility are deeply structural. They imbue the system. Even in administrations that are not openly aggressive in their discourse.

Her point seems to bear out within that very same summer in 2024. After fourteen years of a Conservative government that was not only aggressive in the policies but used immigration as a regular rhetorical tool, Labour came into power with a campaign accusing the incumbents of being too ‘liberal’ on immigration. While they eventually scrapped the Rwanda deportation plan, the new government soon committed to reopening Immigration Detention Centres that were closed.

Pinar uses the example of the Right to Work campaign. It has been going for over five years, she has seen it all, been part of it for the whole time and nothing has changed. Recently, at a strategy meeting, one of the campaigners voiced their frustration saying, ‘What’s the point? I still can’t work, and this is so stressful for me.’

Pinar described responding to the sentiment. ‘I go speechless and I’m like, You’re right. It’s frustrating, isn’t it? So, I’m not going to go and lie to you and say, No, don’t be silly. It’s going to be fine. Things are probably going to get worse, but we need to talk about what we are going to do when things are going to get worse.’

It’s a difficult reality to take in, especially after years of campaigning, but accepting that truth and reflecting on the circumstances as they are is often the way through. As disputes like Right to Work and Free Bus Travel get more protracted, and decision makers more impenetrable, the ability to look at the issue from new angles is essential. Pinar believes there is a way to make it past these challenges: ‘We must think creatively about how we reflect the truth.’

In these moments that feel like dead ends, education becomes a vital tool.

“People need to know that this is seriously not OK,” Mia said, who asked that her last name be withheld out of fear of retaliation. “People are being murdered in broad daylight. We voted this into power, and we need to advocate for change.”

Mia, who was visiting Fresno from Las Vegas, said she is not used to seeing large protests where she lives. While visiting her mother, she heard about the demonstration and decided to attend.

Protesters lining the streets carried signs with messages such as, “Deport white supremacy,” “Fuck ICE,” “Human rights belong to everyone” and “Resist Fascism.” Many also drew their signs with caricatures of President Donald Trump as a king clutching money stained with blood.

Organizers initially estimated the crowd at around 500 people, but that number grew throughout the morning. They reported a small group of pro-Trump protesters early in the demonstration, who they said did not cause any trouble. Fresnoland did not locate them.

The protest remained peaceful, and unlike past demonstrations in Fresno, no police presence was reported on site.

There has been a growing sense of frustration among protesters in Fresno over the past year. Many chanted, yelled, and played music or clips from news broadcasts, creating a noticeably more vocal and expressive atmosphere compared with previous demonstrations.

This frustration stems from reports last year that immigrants attending permanent residency appointments were being detained at Fresno’s USCIS office. Tensions also rose after video emerged showing masked federal agents arresting two men outside an office in downtown Fresno on Father’s Day.

Many of Sunday’s demonstrators traveled from Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and even out of state to join Fresno’s protest, drawn by the city’s reputation as a political “red” area.

While Trump lost Fresno County in 2016 and 2020, local voters supported him in 2024, when he collected 50.89% of the vote.

Advocates say Good’s death represents an escalation in ICE’s use of force, including a separate fatal shooting of an immigrant during a federal operation in Chicago in September and the off-duty killing of a Black man by an ICE agent in Northridge, California on New Year’s Eve. These events follow the 32 people who died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the agency’s deadliest year in over two decades.

Protesters and community organizers have criticized what they see as unchecked violence and abuse by federal immigration authorities amid President Donald Trump’s administrations’ aggressive deportation efforts.

“The world as we knew it is rapidly disintegrating,” Naomi said, a frequent attendee of Fresno protests who asked that her full name not be used for fear of retaliation.

The killing of Good marked a turning point for her.

She said Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was doing nothing more than exercising her First Amendment rights, and described the video of the death as both horrific and impossible to ignore.

Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer while in her car on Wednesday morning. Federal officials have described the incident as self-defense, but local officials, witnesses, and human rights groups dispute that characterization based on video and testimony.

“To me, this murder was so obvious,” Naomi said, “I can’t, in good faith, not be here. I can’t live in a world like this.”

Naomi criticized the government’s response to the tragedy, which she described as an effort to double down on false narratives and gaslight communities and for “taking actions without accountability.”

This was the second protest in Fresno this week. On Thursday, demonstrators rallied at ICE’s downtown office, which culminated in an impromptu march through downtown Fresno. Numerous protests against the Trump administration and immigration enforcement took place last year, including the “No Kings,” demonstrations, which also drew large crowds.

The Sunday demonstration, ICE Out For Good, was organized by Central Valley Indivisible, a local chapter affiliated with the national Indivisible movement.

Patty Cappelluti, lead organizer with Central Valley Indivisible, said the protest was organized because “we can’t just let it pass by.”

“We want to show our emotion,” Cappelluti said. “We are watching what’s happening, the brutality of ICE, and it’s just not OK.”

Cappelluti said she hopes people leave the protest with a strong sense of community because there are others who see what’s happening and agree that the atrocities must be confronted.

Other groups supporting coordinated actions nationwide include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Voto Latino, United We Dream, 50501, and a broad coalition calling for a weekend of protests to “demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.”

Sandra Ruth said she attended the protest because she feels constitutional rights, particularly freedom of speech, are being eroded.

“What’s been happening has been heartbreaking,” Ruth said.

She added that while she feels connected to others at the protest, who seem to be following the news and social media closely, those conversations are difficult in her workplace.

Ruth said she wanted to speak out against what she sees as a deeply divisive political climate under the current presidential administration.

Rebecca Castro drove from Coarsegold to attend the protest on behalf of her family, who were unable to be there. Castro said she is a member of the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California, a federally recognized tribe, who are used to the injustices of people in power.

She described the killing as “a morally wrong violation of everything that’s right,” adding that innocent people are being harmed.

“I don’t want to be silent,” Castro said. “They’re trying to make us afraid.”",https://fresnoland.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9299-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 01:56:56.016827

Mullin told host Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer Jonathan Ross “had the right to defend” himself once Macklin Good drove forward.

“Did she know [Ross] was in front of her? We don’t know, but we do know that she accelerated and she hit the [officer]. At that point, that vehicle is a lethal weapon,” the Oklahoma Republican added.

Videos of the incident show masked officers approaching Macklin Good’s red Honda — parked perpendicularly across the street — and instructing her to get out of the car multiple times, with one grabbing the driver’s side door handle. At that time, Macklin Good backed up the car.

Upon Macklin Good driving forward — after turning her wheel — at the urging of her partner, Ross fires multiple shots at her. The car then accelerates, making contact with the officer and crashing into a car parked on the side of the street.

The Trump administration has defended Ross, saying he acted out of self-defense and that Macklin Good, 37, had “weaponized” her vehicle. ICE has also said that the officer was injured while being dragged by a car during an apprehension in June.

Vice President Vance told reporters Thursday that Ross received more than 30 stitches after the incident and suffered “very serious injuries to his legs.”

Local Democratic officials, notably Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have disputed the administration’s self-defense argument. Frey also asked immigration officials to leave the city in remarks on Wednesday.

“We do not want you here,” the mayor said. “Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/mullinmarkwayne_060325gn02_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-12 05:58:34.269037

CLOUD — Federal immigration officials were confirmed by witnesses to be operating in St. Cloud and Waite Park over the weekend, just days after a woman was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Malik Stewart told St. Cloud LIVE on Saturday, Jan. 10, about an interaction with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent behind the District 742 administrative building in Waite Park, in which Stewart described threatening behavior by the agent.

“I drove over by the district office and I saw an SUV parked there and I just drove by slowly,” he said. “I could see the driver was an ICE officer, and I slowed to a stop about a car length away. When he saw me, he turned and drove straight at my car. I rolled the window down and he said, ’Who are you and what are you doing?’ I thought of the first thing I could say, considering I’m behind a building and no one else is around to see what’s happening. I said, ’I’m looking for a gym,’ knowing Anytime Fitness was nearby. He said, ’Get the (expletive) out of here or I’ll arrest you, you piece of (crap).’ ”

Stewart, whose parents are biracial, said the officer he encountered behind the building asked if he was a citizen and repeated his order to leave.

“I could see he had an elderly Hispanic man in the back seat and he sure didn’t look like anyone who would be a threat to me, but I figured it was best to just move on at that point,” Stewart said. “But the officer was immediately aggressive with me. I wasn’t aggressive. And the fact that he asked me the question he did is why so many people are scared right now. If you’re a person of color in this country, you’re a second-class citizen. And the people in power are just fine with that.”

Stewart, a 38-year-old St. Cloud resident who serves on the St. Cloud Civil Service Board, said he is one of hundreds of people loosely organized in recent weeks to act as observers to potential ICE activity in the area.

“They’ve been in town for a bit,” he said of the federal agents, dispensed as part of “Operation Metro Surge” in Minnesota.

Stewart and other observers encountered the same agent later Saturday near 33rd Street and Third Avenue North, by a Somali market.

Attina Notch, a 35-year-old St. Cloud woman who lives near the intersection, said she was getting into her car near Star City Mall when “a big SUV pulled up with two individuals who had masks above their noses.”

“They got out of the vehicle and looked like they were going to go inside,” said Notch, whose descriptions of what happened appeared to align with a video posted by online TV station XIDIG TV . “It’s obvious who they were, because they were wearing the olive-green vests we’ve seen on TV. At first, I was like, ’Holy (crap)! I’ve got to call my husband. But then I was startled because this mass of people, about 40 or 50 members of what looked like the Somali community, came out the door and started screaming at them to leave. Then after a moment or two, they (the agents) got back in their SUV and left.”

Notch said she was not acting as an ICE observer and that it was a chance occurrence, which she described as “jarring.”

“It’s scary,” she said. “After the shooting (in Minneapolis) on Wednesday, I certainly don’t want to be anywhere near them, and I wouldn’t want to be near them without someone else to see what was happening, too.”

Notch, who described herself as biracial and “white-passing,” said she was approached by members of the crowd and asked whether she was with ICE.

“They’ve just got everyone on edge, no matter what color you are,” she said. “Most people I know have nothing to worry about from them, but I worry for people who can be wrongly accused and I worry for my friends who are here legally.”

In addition to those reports, protests have been held near the St. Cloud Holiday Inn on 37th Avenue, where protesters believe agents are staying, and two statements in as many days from the two cities about federal activity.

The Waite Park Police Department issued a statement Saturday addressing reports of a shooting involving ICE agents. Waite Park police were able to identify and locate the complainant; however, there were no witnesses or evidence that a shooting occurred, the statement said. Law enforcement will continue to investigate.

St. Cloud Police on Saturday acknowledged an informal contact between an officer in a patrol car and a federal agent. City Administrator Tracy Hodel said Friday in a statement that the city had not had any “notifications, directives, or coordination requests” about federal immigration activity in central Minnesota.

Minnesota Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, and Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) Commissioner Matt Varilek visited Kalsan Cuisine, a Somali restaurant in St. Cloud, on Saturday to show support for immigrant-owned businesses and check on their employees.

While staff declined to comment or appear in photos for St. Cloud LIVE, one of the patrons, Abdi Aden, who has lived in St. Cloud since 2015 and been in the country for many years before that, spoke freely to the two officials.

Many Somalis immigrated to Minnesota because they were told it was one of the most welcoming states, Aden said. However, that’s changed with recent anti-Somali sentiments from President Donald Trump and U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, as well as the state fraud investigations and influx of ICE agents.

“It’s hard when the most powerful person in the world is focused on you,” Aden told Putnam and Varilek.

Recent events have also affected Aden’s six children, the oldest of whom is 14.

“They’re on social media, so they see everything, and they ask a lot of questions — and it’s hard,” Aden said. “I have to tell them that we are so much more, much better than what they all make us out to be.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/bd1d8b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x2100+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F3a%2Fe3e9cfac4820a76607ea40dc94e0%2F052025-ice-at-gov-center-06098-copy.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 23:57:22.529481

DRIVING THE DAY

ICE IN THE SPOTLIGHT: The aftermath of the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis at the hands of an ICE officer shows no signs of abating as the divide between the Trump administration and Democrats over the incident continues to grow.

Meanwhile, Democrats are ramping up the pressure as they try to conduct oversight on a sprawling immigration enforcement operation, “raising tensions between local leaders and the Trump administration,” POLITICO’s Daniel Han and Shia Kapos report.

“From California to New York and Illinois to New Jersey, they’re pushing a range of bills aimed at limiting enforcement and protecting people targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while turning up the rhetoric with comparisons to the Gestapo,” they write. Though some of the policies being pushed were on the table before Good was killed, her death has been cited as a reason for the various efforts.

The state of things: The policies being pushed by state leaders vary, but all are intended to throw up roadblocks for federal immigration authorities as the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown continues.

In Illinois: A Dem state senator has filed legislation that would bar anyone hired by ICE under Trump from obtaining employment in state or local law enforcement.

In Tennessee: A lawmaker has filed legislation that would prohibit federal immigration enforcement actions on school property.

In New York: Gov. Kathy Hochul signaled she’ll support legislation to allow residents to bring civil lawsuits against federal immigration officials for constitutional violations.

In New Jersey: Lawmakers are pushing to codify the state’s practice that limits state and local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities; bar the government and hospitals from collecting immigration information; and set up guidelines on how health care facilities, schools and other institutions should respond to federal immigration authorities.

The admin approach: Trump administration officials have long opposed local Democratic leaders restricting cooperation with ICE. President Donald Trump and other top White House officials have defended the agent who shot Good, arguing that he acted in self defense — an account that has been contested by local Minneapolis officials.

In a statement to POLITICO, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended ICE activity and pushed back against state Democratic lawmakers. “ICE officers are facing a massive increase in assaults against them because of dangerous, untrue smears from elected Democrats,” Jackson said. “ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism. Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens.”

The rhetorical response: Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) accused the administration of an “attempt to cover up” the shooting. “Hours after Renee Good was shot and killed by federal agents, Kristi Noem was already telling us exactly what had happened,” Smith told ABC’s “This Week.” “They were calling her a domestic terrorist before they even knew what her name was.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey took responsibility for bringing down the temperature. But he also sharply criticized top Trump officials: “When you’ve got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,” Frey told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There is deep mistrust because so many of the things that we are hearing are not true.”

Noem appeared this morning on CNN’s “State of the Union,” where she underscored her defense of the ICE agent’s actions and indicated to Jake Tapper that there is additional footage that supports her explanation of the shooting. “Why are we arguing with the president who’s working to keep people safe?” Noem said. She also said Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz need to “grow up.”

Despite the defense that Noem and other officials have mounted for the agent, “former law enforcement officials who reviewed the footage and spoke to The Washington Post faulted the officer’s actions,” WaPo’s Mark Berman and colleagues report. “They said the officer — identified through court records as Jonathan Ross, an employee of the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division — placed himself at needless risk, escalated the situation and went against best law enforcement practices during the incident. Law enforcement officers should not position themselves in front of vehicles, and they need to try to de-escalate confrontations and must generally avoid shooting into moving vehicles, these officials said.”

Oversight operation: The day after Good’s death, Noem “quietly ordered new restrictions on congressional visits to immigration detention facilities,” POLITICO’s Kyle Cheney and colleagues report. “That order, put into effect Thursday by the Trump administration and revealed in court late Saturday, forces lawmakers to seek a week’s advance notice before conducting oversight visits to ICE facilities.

“That new policy appears to explain a conflict that unfolded Saturday, when three House Democrats from Minnesota were denied entry to a detention facility in the Whipple federal building in Minneapolis. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison rebuked the agency after they were denied entry, saying their visit was intended to check on detainees amid the heightened tensions that followed Wednesday’s shooting,” they write.

Thousands gathered yesterday afternoon in Minneapolis near where Good was killed, protesting ICE’s operations in the city, WaPo’s Molly Hennessy-Fiske and colleagues report. “Protesters turned out in cities across the country, including Boston, New York City and Philadelphia, many organized by progressive group Indivisible and titled ‘ICE Out For Good.’”

Elsewhere: DHS has now “changed its account of an immigration enforcement-related shooting in Maryland that left two men injured on Christmas Eve, a move prompted by a local police account that contradicted the federal agency’s initial statement,” WaPo’s Juan Benn Jr. reports.

SUNDAY BEST …

— Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on the potential contenders for the 2028 presidential race, speaking on “Fox News Sunday”: “As people speculate on what’s going to happen down the road in 2028, I agree with President Trump and Marco Rubio: I think JD Vance would make a great, great presidential nominee. … I just deeply respect the vice president’s reminder that we have to stay focused on today. And if we stay focused on today and deliver results, then Americans will continue to extend our license to lead.” More from Fox News’ Paul Steinhauser

— Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on the growing protests in Iran and the possibility of U.S. strikes, on ABC’s “This Week”: “We’ve had various times through the years protests in Iran. We’re always hopeful that, you know, a freedom movement will develop and overwhelm the authoritarian government there. The only problem I have with saying, ‘Oh, we’re going to bomb Iran’ is that sometimes it has the opposite effect. So, when you bomb a country, then people tend to rally around their own flag. … I hope that the Iranian government, you know, doesn’t kill the protesters, but it sounds like they already have. But I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended.”

On Trump’s push for the U.S. to “buy” Greenland: “I think you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in Greenland for it, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find somebody in Washington who’s for a military invasion on either side of the aisle. So, I think there’ll be enough pressure to stop it. But the problem is they keep rattling the saber. They keep saying we’re going to do this. We keep this in our armamentarium that we will, you know, reserve the right to invade Greenland. And that gets back to the War Powers Act. That’s why this debate is so important, because it’s not just about Venezuela.”

— Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) on Trump’s threats against Greenland and NATO, on “Fox News Sunday”: “If he were to take an action against Greenland, that would completely destroy NATO. And it’s a little ironic that the president is citing Russia, since the president has basically been cutting back on our assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting Russia tooth and nail to try to push back [Russian President Vladimir Putin’s] aggressive war. How does he, on one hand, say he’s concerned about Russia in Greenland, but not concerned about Russia in Ukraine, where the Ukrainians are fighting, in many ways, the NATO’s fight?”

— Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on whether Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did enough to combat fraud in the state, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “Look, obviously everybody could have done more to prevent fraud. And I think that’s a fair point to make. … The fraud’s real. We’ve all got to acknowledge it. The fraud is very real. And by the way, when somebody commits fraud, and there are many that have done that, you investigate it. You charge. You prosecute…. You do not hold an entire community, any community, accountable for the actions of individuals.”

— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on the health care debate over the ACA subsidies and a potential bipartisan deal, on “Fox News Sunday”: “If the president weighs in, I think we can get something done. As always, the president on an issue like this, as Reggie Jackson, the baseball player, once said, is the straw that stirs the drink. … He did say that you might have to be a little flexible on Hyde to get a compromise bill, but there was also pushback from the White House that that was any sort of a change in the administration’s policy. So, some members are still wondering what exactly he meant by that.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. KNOWING HELENA MORENO: POLITICO’s Jonathan Martin is up with his latest column this morning, zooming in on New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno and the trials-by-fire she’s already weathered before her term officially begins tomorrow. JMart writes how “rarely has there been such heightened anticipation and expectation for a new mayor here,” even as the spectre of the city’s problems loom. “Yet nationally, in an election year dominated by a trailblazing young, Muslim socialist in New York and a pair of East Coast women who won larger-than-expected gubernatorial victories, Moreno’s success was largely overlooked. It shouldn’t be.”

2. MIDDLE EAST LATEST: The U.S. launched large-scale strikes inside Syria yesterday, targeting the Islamic State in retaliation for the killing of two American soldiers and a civilian last month, POLITICO’s Gregory Svirnovskiy and Paul McLeary report. The roughly 90 bombs dropped across the country were part of operation “Hawkeye Strike,” which has been targeting ISIS infrastructure.

Iran death toll rises: The anti-government protests in Iran have taken a deadlier turn following an internet blackout this week, WaPo’s Yeganeh Torbati reports, with the Center for Human Rights in Iran warning that “a massacre is unfolding.” New estimates from the Human Rights Activists News Agency report that clashes with Iranian security forces have left over 200 dead, possibly more, per AP. Trump has been briefed on new options for military strikes that follow through on his threat to defend protesters, and he’s considering authorizing one, NYT’s Tyler Pager and colleagues report. Trump will be briefed on more specific options on Tuesday alongside his top national security aides, WSJ’s Alex Ward and Lara Seligman scoop.

How Iran is responding: Iran’s army said yesterday that it would get involved in the crackdown against protesters, but now the country’s leaders are going further. The parliamentary speaker warned this morning that Iran will attack the U.S.’ military bases if the U.S. strikes first, also levying threats at shipping lanes and at Israel, per WSJ’s Benoit Faucon. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on the situation in Iran yesterday, per Axios’ Barak Ravid. For a look at how the currency crisis set off angry crowds across Iran, NYT’s Erika Solomon and colleagues have a thorough read inside the protests.

3. BIG READ: “Unexploded missiles, witnesses undercut Trump account of Nigeria strike,” by WaPo’s Abiodun Jamiu and colleagues in Offa, Nigeria: “[Warheads] in four of the 16 Tomahawk missiles that were fired that night appeared not to explode … Residents said one of the unexploded munitions landed in an onion field in the village of Jabo, in northwest Nigeria, while another hit residential buildings in Offa, around 300 miles to the south. The third Tomahawk crashed in an agricultural field outside Offa … [The] first strikes in the campaign illustrated the limits of American intelligence and military capabilities in West Africa.”

Bad news for Trump: “Given the location, Nigerian and Western analysts said, it was unlikely that the strikes hit high-level members of the Islamic State, who are most active in the northeast of the country. More likely, they said, the attack targeted lower-level militants associated with a newer Islamist group called Lakurawa, whose relationship with the Islamic State is disputed by researchers.”

4. VEXING VENEZUELA: The Trump administration is doubling down on its quest to get oil up and flowing out of Venezuela — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters’ David Lawder that more sanctions on the country could be lifted as soon as this week and that he’s planning meetings with the IMF and World Bank as they brainstorm ideas to help rebuild the country’s economy. Trump also signed an executive order yesterday blocking courts and creditors from seizing funds from Venezuela to pay back oil companies with longstanding claims, which the order says would “undermine critical U.S. efforts to ensure economic and political stability,” per Reuters.

All about the oil: The push on oil could pose a big risk for OPEC countries that are already facing falling oil prices and potentially upend the global power balance, per WSJ. The U.S. intercepted its fifth sanctioned oil tanker in the Caribbean Sea yesterday, per AP, but there’s at least 11 tankers that have traveled well beyond Venezuelan waters and Trump’s blockade — carrying a collective 9.4 million barrels of oil, WaPo’s Samuel Oakford and colleagues report.

The investment push: While the largest oil companies are still wary of Trump’s multibillion-dollar investment aspirations, hedge funds and other investment firms are preparing to capitalize on the moment and planning trips to Venezuela, WSJ’s Caitlin McCabe writes. “Now, investors reckon a combination of political change, U.S. intervention and American investment into Venezuela’s vast oil resources could put a debt restructuring within reach.”

The peace push: Venezuela’s prisoner releases entered their third day yesterday, as families gather outside of prisons in Caracas waiting to see who will be released, AP’s Regina Garcia Cano reports. As of last night, 16 political prisoners have been released. … Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado could be heading to Washington this week with plans to present Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize, but the Nobel Institute said Friday that sharing the prize is not allowed, per NYT.

5. 2028 WATCH: “GOP talk of Rubio 2028 heats up in wake of Venezuela op,” by POLITICO’s Samuel Benson and Nahal Toosi: “Donald Trump has handed Marco Rubio the keys to Venezuela. It could make or break the secretary of State should he run for president in 2028.” But, but, but: “The potential chaos ahead could leave Rubio on the outs with key GOP voting blocs. Those include anti-interventionist conservatives, who remain wary of Rubio’s neoconservative instincts, and Republican Latino voters, especially in Florida, some who desperately want regime change.”

The flip side: “Iraq War critic, Venezuela mission defender: Vance’s foreign policy journey,” by WaPo’s Michael Birnbaum and Natalie Allison: “Vice President JD Vance served in the Iraq War and came home a sharp critic of foreign military interventions … Now he is defending [Trump’s] decision to conduct a daring raid this month in a country closer to home … But as the vice president eyes his 2028 presidential prospects while also wanting to appear in lockstep with the president, Vance has claimed no contradiction at all.”

6. HEALTH OF A NATION: HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins are on an anti-sugar kick with their new food guidelines, calling on parents to keep their kids from eating added sugars until they turn 11. But some parents say that objective is “completely unrealistic” and would require an overhaul of most children’s diets, POLITICO’s Carmen Paun and Grace Yarrow write. And on the political front, RFK Jr.’s rise and his MAHA-minded policies are having an unintended effect — pushing Democratic doctors to run for Congress to fight back, WSJ’s Anvee Bhutani and Sabrina Siddiqui report.

7. STATE OF PLAY ON THE HILL: “Why lawmakers are looking to trade Washington for governors’ mansions,” by POLITICO’s Faith Wardwell: “A flood of lawmakers eyeing off-ramps from Washington are launching bids for governor — a record-setting exodus of congressional incumbents vying to be their states’ next chief executive. … Of the 12 active candidates who won’t be seeking reelection to pursue bids for governor, 11 are Republicans, adding to a growing tally of GOP lawmakers who won’t be defending their party’s majority in the midterms.”

8. CUTTING DEEP: New data reveals that a staggering 335,000 federal workers left government work last year, with the vast majority quitting or retiring — only 11,000 were a result of layoffs from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, WaPo’s Meryl Kornfield and Clara Ence Morse report. While the database doesn’t specify how many people took buyouts, the number of workers bought out by DOGE are counted among the roughly 154,000 who quit. It’s the biggest overhaul of the federal government since the 1990s, with the heaviest workforce hits happening at Veteran Affairs and Treasury.

Meanwhile on the Hill, Congress is trying to reverse cuts to federal science programs that Trump called for last year, NYT’s William Broad writes. The new appropriation bills in Congress largely scrap the plan that would have cut science research by 22 percent.

9. OUT OF THE [DOGE] HOUSE: “Pentagon Chooses DOGE Official and Former Trader to Head Innovation Unit,” by WSJ’s Heather Somerville and Lara Seligman: “The Defense Department has selected Owen West, a former Wall Street trader and Marine, to lead its Defense Innovation Unit, the department’s highest-profile unit tasked with bringing startup technology into the U.S. military … The appointment of West brings some stability to a unit that had been left in flux. … West is a familiar figure around the Defense Department: He began working there early last year as the lead Pentagon staffer with [DOGE].”

TALK OF THE TOWN

PLAYBOOK ARTS SECTION — The National Portrait Gallery removed text that referenced Donald Trump’s two impeachments and the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, when it swapped in a new portrait of him this week, WaPo’s Samantha Chery and colleagues write. “The placard has been replaced with one whose caption is so short that the outline of the old sign was visible on the wall beneath it, simply noting Trump’s years in office. It now contrasts with portraits of other former presidents … which all hang alongside wall text highlighting events during their time in office. [Bill Clinton’s] notes his impeachment.”

MEDIAWATCH — “Tony Dokoupil sets new tone for ‘CBS Evening News’ in first week as anchor,” by WaPo’s Laura Wagner and Scott Nover: “[Tony Dokoupil’s] vision for a more populist and personal version of the news broadcast started to come into focus during the first week as anchor. His debut has come under special scrutiny as the most visible personnel shift made by CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss … The political color of Dokoupil’s anchoring is likely to remain closely watched as CBS’s owner, Paramount Skydance, pursues its hostile bid for CNN owner Warner Bros. Discovery.”

OUT and ABOUT — Ezekiel Emanuel celebrated the debut of his latest book, “Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules for a Long and Healthy Life,” ($24.67) at Dolcezza in Union Market last night. SPOTTED: Teasel Muir-Harmony, Andrea Mitchell, Dan Diamond, Michael Osterholm, Laura Meckler, Julie Rovner, Mark Furstenberg, Farzad Mostashari, Will Shrank, Miriam Vogel, Ken Baer, Robert Gordon, Michael Beschloss and Jane Mayer.

Still, Mr. Moran said he planned to wear his cow outfit at future demonstrations.","Thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully in New York City on Sunday to protest the Trump administration and the killing of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week in Minneapolis.

The crowd gathered on Sunday afternoon at the southeast corner of Central Park, many of them holding signs condemning President Trump’s mass deportation efforts and his recent military actions in Venezuela.

Local politicians joined the rally to show their support.

“It’s a damn shame we’re out here in 2026 fighting against a fascist government,” said Alexa Avilés, a City Council member from Brooklyn. Brad Lander, the former city comptroller, and Jumaane Williams, the public advocate, stood nearby.

The protest then made its way south on Fifth Avenue, soon arriving at Trump Tower. Demonstrators blocked traffic as many chanted, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”

One demonstrator, Carla Shotwell, stood in front of the glassy high-rise building holding a sign that read “Deport Kristi Noem Back to Hell,” in reference to the homeland security secretary, who has defended the ICE agent who shot Ms. Good.

President Trump and other federal officials have said that the agent was acting in self-defense after Ms. Good tried to hit him with her car; Minnesota officials have rejected that account, calling it “propaganda.” A video analysis by The New York Times shows that the car appeared to be turning away from the agent when he opened fire.

Ms. Shotwell said she had protested against Mr. Trump before, and that she was moved to show up again on Sunday by the killing of Ms. Good.

“I hope more people who are in the city, who are shopping, who are not paying attention, see how many people think this is wrong,” she said.

The protesters on Sunday continued marching south and west before dispersing at West 42nd Street and Broadway around 4 p.m. A few dozen people who remained had a brief confrontation with a small group of pro-Trump counterprotesters, and at least one person was detained by the police.

Among the sea of signs — including “Don’t Tread on N.Y.C.,” “Melt ICE” and “Went to Sleep in 2025, Woke Up in 1984” — Edna Gomes, of Manhattan, said Mr. Trump should shift his focus away from Venezuela to issues in the United States.

“I wish he would put America first,” said Ms. Gomes, 65, who is the mother of an Iraq War veteran. “He should be thinking about the American economy and the American health care system.”

Nearby, Ben Moran was dressed in an inflatable cow costume with floppy ears and a pink udder. Mr. Moran said he had searched for a frog costume — which became popular at “No Kings” protests in recent months after demonstrators in Portland, Ore., wore them to poke fun at the Trump administration — but they were sold out at every store.

Still, Mr. Moran said he planned to wear his cow outfit at future demonstrations. “I think it’s going to be a long game,” he said.

The march followed the killing of an American citizen by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday and, a day later, the shooting of two Venezuelan nationals in Portland.

The shootings spurred a weekend of nationwide protests, including in Pittsburgh and elsewhere in the region, against a “pattern of unchecked violence, impunity and abuse” by federal immigration enforcement agencies, according to a statement by organizer Indivisible Pittsburgh.

Nationwide, organizers held protests “to demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions,” according to Indivisible Pittsburgh.

Locally, ICE arrests under the second Trump administration through mid-October were more than triple those of the prior year, according to data from the Data Deportation Project and analyzed by Public Source.

The protests have intersected with ongoing debate in the Pittsburgh region over cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Newly inaugurated Pittsburgh Mayor Corey O’Connor said a day after the Minneapolis shooting that the City of Pittsburgh will not cooperate with ICE. Several Allegheny County municipalities, though, including Stowe Township and Springdale, have recently signed agreements to partner with ICE on local immigration enforcement.

In a statement, the City of Pittsburgh Republican Committee wrote that local police have a “clear legal duty” to assist federal agencies. “Any attempt by elected officials to blur that obligation undermines the rule of law and places officers — and citizens — in an impossible and potentially dangerous position,” said Todd McCollum, chairman of the City of Pittsburgh Republican Committee and a former Pittsburgh police officer, in a statement.

The surge in local immigration enforcement has led hundreds in the Pittsburgh area to sign up for rapid response teams that deploy to arrests and raids to record ICE actions and accompany vulnerable people to court.

“Public protest is a constitutional right, but elected officials have an obligation to be absolutely clear that violence, obstruction of law enforcement, and intimidation will not be tolerated,” McCollum said.",https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/L1001762.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 22:56:24.002945

Cloud today.","ST. CLOUD — If the Minnesota Vikings had made the NFL playoffs, Adam Hainlin might not have been tailgating along Division Street on Sunday, Jan. 11, near the St. Cloud Library.

He has season tickets and would have loved to be at U.S. Bank Stadium instead of standing outside in the frigid air.

But he feels it's a small price to pay to help ""save democracy,"" and a lot of people would've been disappointed to not partake in the free coffee, hot meatballs and cocktail wieners he served up as thousands of protesters lined both sides of the city's main drag for several blocks in a demonstration against federal immigration activity and the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Central Minnesota in recent days.

""I don't mind the cold if this is the price we have to pay to make a difference,"" said Hainlin as thousands of people hoisted signs, chanted slogans and waved in response to countless horns honked as traffic rolled past in both directions. ""This is the first time I've been out here. I didn't come to the 'No Kings' protests they've had here before, and I thought, 'If the Vikings aren't playing, why not bring some food out here and show some support?'""

The sidewalks were lined several people deep and others stood on snowbanks on both sides of Division, solid between 12th Avenue and 14th Avenue South.

Stragglers stretched near Lake George to the east and past Papa Murphy's to the west. All manner of vehicles honked in support, from the tiniest cars to the largest 18-wheelers. Conversely, there was the occasional extended middle finger, some booing and even a truck that cruised with a bevvy of flags in support of President Donald Trump.

But the overwhelming feeling for those who helped organize the event — and others who participated — was relief in a surprising and unexpected outpouring of support for the local immigrant community.

Americans For Democracy, which cultivated No Kings protests earlier this year in coordination with others all across the country, organized Sunday's gathering.

Volunteers, including Rose Thelen, a retiree from Clearwater, manned a table near the library handing out materials, donuts and coffee. The organization's count estimated more than 3,000 people participated, which was about half the total from the largest No Kings rally, but those had weeks of preparation and promotion, budgets of several thousand dollars — and they took place in the spring and summer.

""I would say this rivals the No Kings rallies we've had if it's not even better,"" Thelen said as she shifted from one foot to the other in an effort to keep warm behind the chanting crowd. ""We're just one of six groups in the Sixth (Congressional) District dedicated to making our voices heard. We wouldn't have been out here today if it wasn't for what happened to Renee Good.""

That's in reference to a shooting on Wednesday, Jan. 7, in Minneapolis by an ICE agent in which a woman was killed in front of dozens of monitors and observers who recorded what happened on video.

Since, tensions have ratcheted to a new height across Minnesota and the nation, leading to thousands of protests Saturday, Jan. 10, when area city officials and other civilians finally confirmed federal immigration enforcement activity in St. Cloud after it had been making headlines for weeks elsewhere.

""(Saturday), we had more than 200 people at St. Cloud State for training by Fe y Justicia on how to take non-violent direct action,"" Thelen said. ""What do you do if you get pepper-sprayed? How do you resist? It's so ridiculous that the president and others have called people like (Good) and the rest of us 'terrorists.' Really? We're mostly a bunch of retired old ladies. But we're out here because we love our country and we reject the actions of our government.

""I'm really encouraged by what I see today. If we can get just 3% of the people to rise up, and that's 12 million people across the United States, we can overturn these things that we see are wrong.""

It's a difficult argument, however. Some volunteers with Thelen didn't want to go on the record out of fear for their safety. Several Somali-Americans passing out free sambusa to the crowd also shrank from any media inquiry. Others, however, stepped up to communicate for them.

""This is incredible,"" said Jill Kelly, who had a hard time holding a cup of hot chocolate without getting jostled in the crowd as she stood with a two-way radio and a megaphone strapped around her back. ""Our immigrant community has been feeling so scared and alone, and to see all these people come out here today is really heartening. This is the first time a protest like this (in St. Cloud) has been dedicated to their cause, and I think it's going to do a lot for them to see that there's really not very much opposition and there are way many more allies than what they probably thought.""

Mohamed Jama thinks so. He emigrated to the United States in 2005 and then moved from Fargo, North Dakota, to St. Cloud a year later. He was in middle school at the time and went on to graduate from SCSU with a communications degree.

On Sunday, he was recording the event and interviewing bystanders for XIDIG TV, of which he is owner and founder. A day earlier, he recorded evidence of an ICE raid in St. Cloud — something he said has been common in recent days even though many people don't witness the events.

""This means a lot,"" said Jama, 33, as he paused and perhaps even felt a little emotion. ""I almost don't recognize St. Cloud today. There are way more good people here than I thought.""

It's unclear how long ""Operation Metro Surge"" will continue. It has brought more than 2,000 agents to Minnesota in recent weeks and, while most of the activity and high-profile events associated with the influx have happened in the Twin Cities, it's perhaps inevitable that it was going to reach a little more than 70 miles up Interstate 94 to St. Cloud.

Regardless of what may transpire, organizers say there will continue to be a weekly ongoing demonstration in the parking lot near Barnes & Noble on Saturdays from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. AFD organizers also say anyone wanting more information about No Kings messaging, becoming a trained ICE monitor or observer or otherwise getting involved in protests like Sunday's are asked to email afdstcloud@gmail.com.

""We need people to be trained rapid responders and we need help,"" Kelly said. ""We need gas to be able to travel around. We need GoPros to be able to record what's going on. We can use goggles in case we get attacked. We can even use water. Anything to help our volunteers do this work. And there's a lot more work to do.""

Winter is unpredictable, and so is the news. So it's hard to say when there might be another demonstration in St. Cloud. But based on Sunday's turnout, it appears as long as one isn't planned during the Super Bowl, chances are good that people in Central Minnesota will turn out if they're motivated.

""I'm just on such a high right now that I'm still coming down,"" Kelly added late Sunday afternoon after the crowds dispersed. ""For No Kings, we had six weeks to get ready and attract people. We had money to spend. This came together without much more than word of mouth in two days.

""It gives us all great hope.""",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/e05e7c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F70%2F0fc1bfd444e293d6bca46c5dcf8f%2Fimg-0324.jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 22:56:29.595339

Go deeper: What DHS' own rules say on the deadly ICE shooting in Minneapolis","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem doubled down Sunday on her defense of the fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting and vowed to send in ""hundreds"" more agents.

But critics accuse the administration of hiding what actually happened to Renee Nicole Good and dictating what Americans should believe.

The big picture: Within hours of the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security and Noem labeled Good's actions an ""act of domestic terrorism"" before any investigation.

The administration now controls the probe into the shooting after state investigators say they were blocked from case materials and scene evidence.

Noem and other officials swiftly defended the officer and claimed videos support their claim the agent acted in self-defense.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called that a ""garbage narrative.""

Between the lines: While Noem did not identify the shooter, the Minnesota Star Tribune, the N.Y. Times and other outlets identified him as Jonathan Ross.

Driving the news: Noem denied Sunday that she rushed to judgment.

Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" why she didn't wait for an investigation, Noem claimed ""everything that I've said has been proven to be factual, and the truth.""

Tapper disputed Noem's account, relaying her Jan. 7 claim that Good ""attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle"" as they were ""attempting to push out their vehicle"" from the snow.

Noem shot back, ""It absolutely is what happened.""

Reality check: Video analysis of footage from different angles contradicts Noem. Clips show Good waving vehicles past her. One pulled up, and agents got out. None appeared to be pushing a stuck car.

Even a video DHS reposted from conservative outlet Alpha News that shows the shooting from Ross' perspective appears to undermine the administration's narrative.

""That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you,"" Good says from behind the wheel of her car, which was parked perpendicular to the road, partially blocking traffic. Ross, trailed by Good's wife who was also filming, makes his way around the car toward the driver's side.

Good's wife calls out, ""You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.""

After an agent yells ""get out of the f---ing car,"" Good appears to reverse, turn her wheel away from Ross and pull away. Shots ring out as the shaky camera jerks skyward, and a male voice calls her a ""f---ing b---.""

Context: The shooting sparked anti-ICE protests across the nation as Americans sour on the agency.

It's also further inflamed tensions between Minnesota and federal officials over ICE's unprecedented enforcement in the Twin Cities.

What they're saying: Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) told ABC's ""This Week"" that what ""we are seeing here is the federal government, Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, Donald Trump, attempt to cover up what happened here in the Twin Cities.""

She added, ""I don't think that people here and around the country are believing it.""

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who was blocked Saturday alongside other lawmakers from touring an ICE detention facility, called Noem's and President Trump's rhetoric ""unjustifiable"" on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

""If they're saying we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist,"" she said.

Zoom out: Tapper asked Noem how she could be so certain Good was trying to hurt the officer, rather than flee. She offered no new evidence, again saying Good ""weaponized"" her car and the officer ""defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.""

Minneapolis' mayor previously called that ""bulls--t.""

""Am I biased in this? Of course. And I'm biased because I got two eyes,"" Frey told Tapper on Sunday. ""Anybody can see these videos. Anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist.""

Noem said she had spoken to the officers' supervisors and seen videos before she spoke about the incident at a press conference that day.

What's next: Noem, also appearing on Fox's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" said she'll send ""hundreds"" more officers, arriving Sunday and Monday.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday the government is sending additional federal agents to Minnesota to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement operations amid rising tensions following the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen.

Noem told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo that DHS will be sending hundreds more agents on Sunday and Monday to Minneapolis to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents to do their work ""safely.""

""If they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,"" she said, referring to clashes between some protesters and federal agents outside an ICE facility and the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building over the weekend.

The protests, which have spread to other cities, including Los Angeles, Portland and New York, come after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, who DHS alleges ""weaponized her vehicle"" and ""attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.""

Video of the shooting has become a political flashpoint, with some saying it supports the government’s position that the agent acted in self-defense and others saying the footage calls into question DHS’ explanation and raises broader concerns about the use of force by ICE officers.

The shooting remains under federal investigation.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times that the Trump administration pushed a ""false narrative"" about the shooting and demonized Good.

BG Independent News

Frigid weather did not deter about 40 Bowling Green residents Sunday from joining communities across the nation outraged over an ICE agent’s killing of a woman in Minneapolis last week.

The citizens spread out along North Main Street, in front of the district office of U.S. Rep. Bob Latta, R-Bowling Green.

Jan Morse, of Bowling Green, came prepared for the cold, showing her thick mittens from the Vermont Mitten company – the same type of handwear U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders wore as he sat in the cold for Joe Biden’s inauguration. Morse said she and her husband had been given the mittens by their children.

Morse, who held a sign stating, “I want my democracy with no ICE,” said she could not stay in the warmth and comfort of home after the events of last week.

“It was shocking,” she said of the masked ICE agent shooting and killing a 37-year-old woman in her vehicle. That was followed soon after by ICE agents shooting two other people in Portland, Oregon.

“I’m very concerned about the increasing violence with the ICE deployments,” Morse said. “I fear for our democracy. There’s too much to list.”

But others at the protest Sunday afternoon had lists.

Logan Propst, of Bowling Green, came with three demands. First, a moratorium on more data centers in Ohio. Second, a free Palestine. And third, “we want ICE out of our communities.”

Rumors had circulated, Propst said, that ICE agents had picked up someone on Saturday at the Kroger store less than a block from the protest on Sunday.

“All of these issues are connected,” she said. “All are a result of the two-party system. We have the power to demand what’s right.”

Brittney Klockowski, of Weston, resurrected a sign she used last year at a protest against President Donald Trump’s policies. The sign read, “It has to start somewhere. It has to start sometime. What better place than here? What better time than now? Rage against the regime.”

Christina Guenther, of Bowling Green, had dual reasons for joining the protest.

“I’m here to protest ICE and its overreach as we express our First Amendment rights,” Guenther said. And she voiced concern about the lack of sufficient transparency surrounding data centers in Ohio and their drain on the resources.

“This is the time to stand up,” she said.

Across the nation, many were feeling the same urgency to protest the excesses of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

The “Ice Out for Good” campaign held demonstrations in small towns and major cities, including some that have been central targets of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Almost immediately after Good’s death, conflicting interpretations of the killing — which was captured in video from several angles — divided the country along ideological lines. State leaders in Minnesota described the ICE agent’s action as an unjustifiable use of lethal force against a civilian who was trying to leave the scene. The Trump administration officials claimed that Good was a left-wing domestic terrorist who tried to run over the ICE agent, and that the agent acted in self-defense.

In light of the killing in Minneapolis and another shooting in Portland, Oregon, where Border Patrol agents shot and wounded two people in a car on Thursday, activist groups, including the organizers of the “No Kings” and “Hands Off” demonstrations last year, called for a weekend of “nationwide mobilization.”

While Bowling Green’s protest on Sunday paled in comparison to the massive rallies held in the downtown during warm months last year, Propst said she was pleased with Sunday’s turnout.

“It’s freezing out. It’s biting. Considering the weather, this is a great turnout,” she said.",https://bgindependentmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-BGIN_logo_blue_square_300px-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 01:57:00.428987

Earlier in the day, more than a hundred demonstrators chanted and carried signs along Geyer Springs Road in southwest Little Rock, expressing their disapproval of ICE tactics and the use of force by federal agents. Renee Good’s fatal shooting in Minneapolis, according to participants, was the catalyst for the protest.

“It’s just heartbreaking, tragic, and very upsetting,” said Emma Field, an Arkansan who attended the protest.

Several demonstrators criticized what they described as inadequate training and oversight of ICE officers. George Ferguson, another participant, said the incident raised serious questions.

“How can they — they’re hiring and throwing them out there, and I think what happened in Minneapolis shows a very lack of training,” Ferguson said.

Some claimed that the amount of force employed was excessive. The victim should be remembered as more than just a statistic, according to Victoria Bravo.

“That’s an unnecessary amount of force. I don’t think that was necessary at all,” Bravo said. “She was a mother, she was a person, she was a daughter, she was a wife.”

Not all locals were in favor of the protest. A woman from southwest Little Rock, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed discomfort with some of the language used on protest signs as well as interactions she encountered while walking by.

“The language is the same and I just don’t agree with that,” she said, calling the area a family community. She added that she was flipped off and called names while driving past the demonstration.

Demonstrators said the event was an exercise of First Amendment rights, and say that people on both sides expressed their opinions throughout the day.

“Everyone has the right to freedom of speech,” Field said. “Even standing here today we’ve had people drive by or park on the other side and say some kind of nasty things, but they have the right to speak as well.”

Later on Saturday night, hundreds more people gathered for a candlelight vigil in remembrance of Good on the Broadway Bridge. In her honor, attendees observed a moment of contemplation while holding candles.

“Words can’t describe just how sad and tragic the loss of her life was,” Field said.

The big picture: As ICE's detention population swelled in 2025, so did the number of congressional visits, despite the administration's attempts to banunannounced drop-ins. But on Saturday, three Minnesota Democrats were blocked from a facility.

A federal judge in December already stopped an essentially identical policy, citing federal spending law that mandates access to such facilities.

""Members of Congress have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) posted on Saturday confirming she had been denied access. ""The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities.""

Driving the news: The new policy, outlined in a DHS memo and confirmed by the department, once again requires lawmakers to request visits seven days in advance. Shorter-notice requests need Noem's personal approval.

Noem contended the new version of the policy is allowed under U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's conclusion that funds from the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" are not subject to the same limitations.

""ICE must ensure that this policy is implemented and enforced exclusively with money appropriated by the OBBBA,"" Noem's memo reads. She alleged visits were becoming ""circus-like"" rather than constituting legitimate oversight.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Axios the change ensures ""the safety of staff, law enforcement, visitors, and detainees alike.""

The other side: Rep. Kelly Morrison (D-Minn.), who was turned away over the weekend, said commanding officers cited the OBBBA funding workaround.

""We are grieving here in Minnesota — people are afraid,"" she said on MS NOW.

The lawmakers attempted to visit the facility after Renee Good was shot and killed in her car by ICE in an incident that's inflamed tensions locally and nationally.

Catch up quick: Cobb ruled that lawmakers can visit detention facilities unannounced because the appropriations law funding ICE prohibits DHS from using those funds to restrict access.

""The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,"" Cobb said in her order granting a stay sought by lawmakers.

What we're watching: Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), one of the lawmakers who joined the lawsuit, described the policy as ""a clear attempt to subvert the ruling"" Saturday.

He vowed to challenge it in court ""immediately.""

But with homemade sambusas and canisters of coffee ready to be dispensed, she stepped out into the pale winter day and headed to a suburban street where mourners were gathering to remember Renee Nicole Good.

""She was a mother, she was respected. She tried to help the people,"" Hassan said, standing on an icy footpath at the memorial. ""It's very, very sad.""

Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was monitoring an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation when she was fatally shot through the windshield and open window of her car by an immigration officer earlier this week.

She was what is described as a legal observer, someone who volunteers their time to document ICE operations and warn communities when officers are nearby.

Her killing has ignited nationwide protests and further entrenched deep political divisions over the Trump administration's increasingly violent immigration crackdown.

The nature of her killing, and the aggressive political rhetoric that quickly ensued, has enraged a city still scarred by a recent string of tragedies, and where the memory of murdered African American man George Floyd looms large.

Since December, immigration officers, known as ICE, have conducted sweeping operations across the city, deploying 2,000 masked and armed officers in what it described as its largest operation to date.

The actions in Minneapolis have targeted undocumented migrants with a particular focus on Somalis — a group that President Donald Trump has referred to as ""garbage"" while criticising a federal fraud scheme involving Somali Americans in the state.

At the memorial site, Hassan shifts uncomfortably, scanning the crowd.

When she arrived in the US in 2005, she was welcomed with typical Midwestern charm — a community of cheery, unpretentious and neighbourly people.

Now, she said hostility towards her community had become common, leaving her fearful to go to work in an aged care home.

""Anytime I go outside, I'm very scared. [We are] physically attacked. They say, 'Go back to your country, this is not your country'. It's very sad,"" she said.

A city targeted

Many in Minnesota feel the state and its Democratic governor, Tim Walz — who ran against Donald Trump as vice-presidential nominee in the 2024 election — have been singled out by the Trump administration over his handling of the fraud scandal that has plagued the state.

It comes after a viral video by a 23-year-old MAGA content creator alleged, with little evidence, to have uncovered rampant fraud in Somali-run daycare centres — claims that were amplified by senior administration officials.

The allegations, which date back to 2020, involve federally funded non-profit childcare and social service providers, with prosecutors estimating the fraud could reach $US9 billion ($13 billion) — a figure state officials reject as exaggerated.

A 2021 federal investigation into a series of schemes resulted in charges against 92 people with 62 convicted — many of them Somali, according to CBS News.

Trump has since sought to portray Minnesota and its Somali population as a hotspot for fraud.

Immigration rights groups have accused the administration of using the scandal as a scapegoat to target Somali immigrants.

Attacks on the Somali community followed after a recent string of racist remarks by Donald Trump, describing them as ""garbage"" and saying he did not want them ""in our country.""

Kathryn Johnson, a podcaster and spokesperson with Minnesotan Republican think tank the Center of the American Experiment, said there was a perception illegal immigrants were implicated in the scam.

""It feels really disrespectful to the taxpayers and the people of Minnesota that so much was stolen, and they went to such minimal lengths to hide it,"" she said.

Johnson said the scandal had appalled Minnesotans and led to ""a lot of resentment"".

Governor Tim Walz said those involved would be prosecuted and pushed back on the federal politicisation of the issue, criticising the administration for demonising an entire community.

Old wounds reopened

Good was fatally shot four blocks from where African American man George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in 2020.

Five years on from his murder, the memory of that historic turning point still weighs heavy in the collective psyche of many in Minneapolis.

It ignited a national reckoning over race and police brutality and left deep scars across the city.

For many, those wounds were reopened this week as Minnesotans again mobilised in protest to demand accountability for an officer's actions.

""We have been here before,"" Minneapolis Reverend Kenny Callaghan said.

""We know what to do as a city, we know how to raise ourselves up to protest against marginalisation and intimidation and abuse of human life and dignity.

""We will be out in the streets protesting this insanity until we don't need to anymore.""

Some hope Good's death will serve as a watershed moment in the administration's immigration campaign, much like George Floyd's murder did for police brutality.

Anger and distrust of authorities can be felt across Minneapolis, with acrimony occasionally levelled at members of the press.

In the aftermath of her death, the ABC approached the scene where Good was killed and was met with hostile local activists who had barricaded the streets with wooden pallets, skip bins and witch's hats.

Red spray paint spelled out ""ICE KILLS GOOD PEOPLE"" on the frosty sidewalk, the letters blurring and running in the snow like blood.

The memorial site of Good's death had shifted into a community event with a charged atmosphere. An abrupt noise nearby was enough to make everyone jump.

Smoke rose from a bin fire into the grey winter sky as residents and activists huddled around, eyeing passers-by and handing out food.

A series of barbed comments from activists made it clear the press were perceived as a hindrance to their cause.

The few network journalists on the scene were closely trailed by stern-faced security details with searching eyes.

To the left, conservative Fox News host Laura Ingraham was encircled by a group in a tense exchange.

To the right, a large sign painted in angry scrawl read: ""Dear press, you're pointing your cameras at the wrong people. Film the fascists.""

News had filtered through that the Department of Justice had blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from working with federal authorities on the investigation into Good's death.

The move is considered highly unusual and has contributed to the growing mistrust in any federal investigation into the incident.

""There is no accountability in this administration,"" a woman said at the memorial when the ABC returned the following day, adding that she had no faith in a fair FBI probe.

""I felt immense anger. I wanted to vomit,"" the woman recalled of the footage, having flown in from Montana to pay her respects.

""I wanted to go into a cave and come out in three years and see if we still have a country.""

'They're here for sport'

The events in Minneapolis are the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has sparked widespread condemnation.

The New York Times reported that this week's deadly shooting marked the ninth time immigration officers fired on people in US cities since September — in all cases, agents fired on people in vehicles and in each case, the agents claimed self-defence.

Within 48 hours of Good's killing, another two people were shot in their car by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Portland, Oregon. The Department of Homeland Security described the action as being a ""defensive shot"".

As Americans watched the same footage of Good's death, two starkly different narratives quickly emerged.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem quickly defended the officer's actions, describing the incident as an act of ""domestic terrorism"".

Trump went further, posting that Good had ""violently, wilfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer"".

Loading...

Democratic local and state leaders quickly condemned that characterisation, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey dismissing it as ""bullshit"", instead describing the officer's actions as a ""reckless abuse of power"".

Kathryn Johnson said she was careful not to jump to any conclusions too quickly but believed the ICE officer was ""in fear for his life.""

She blamed Governor Tim Walz for inflaming tensions with political rhetoric, although she conceded that Trump had done the same.

""He [Walz] had hardly any information and he declared that this officer had essentially murdered a woman in cold blood,"" she said.

She accused Walz of calling for civil war when he mentioned he was preparing the National Guard for deployment.

Reverend Callaghan rejected that characterisation categorically, describing the administration's narrative as blatant lies.

Having had his own interaction with ICE, he believes their operations are driven entirely by systemic racism.

At the same time and on the same street as Good was shot dead, Callaghan had noticed ICE agents harassing a Hispanic woman.

""I said to them, 'Arrest me, take me, I'm not afraid of you' … They pointed a gun at me and before I knew it they had me in handcuffs,"" he said.

""They said, 'Are you afraid yet?' And I said, 'No'. And then they said, 'Well, you're white. You wouldn't be any fun anyway.'""

The comment left him aghast.

""I couldn't believe it. I could not believe my ears or my eyes what I was witnessing firsthand happening in this country,"" he said.

With Donald Trump’s return to the White House in early 2025 for a new term, Washington’s aggressive policy of more than 25 years is taking an even more pronounced turn.

Éric Toussaint: The publication of this document [1] in early December 2025 must be seen in the context of what Gilbert Achcar calls the New Cold War, which he analysed in his book of the same name [2]. Gilbert Achcar traces the beginning of a new Cold War back to the late 1990s, when the United States embarked on NATO NATO

North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO ensures US military protection for the Europeans in case of aggression, but above all it gives the USA supremacy over the Western Bloc. Western European countries agreed to place their armed forces within a defence system under US command, and thus recognize the preponderance of the USA. NATO was founded in 1949 in Washington, but became less prominent after the end of the Cold War. In 2002, it had 19 members: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK, the USA, to which were added Greece and Turkey in 1952, the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955 (replaced by Unified Germany in 1990), Spain in 1982, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic in 1999. expansion by accelerating the integration of former Eastern Bloc countries and extending its area of intervention to include the countries of the former Yugoslavia and, a few years later, Afghanistan. Gilbert Achcar clearly shows that the choices made by Washington were debated among US strategists and that the hawks prevailed, knowing that their actions could only provoke negative reactions from the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin, at the head of Russia, developed a Great Russian chauvinism with the desire to increase his sphere of influence or control over former parts of the USSR, with references to the past greatness of Tsarist Russia.

With Donald Trump’s return to the White House in early 2025 for a new term, Washington’s aggressive policy of more than 25 years is taking an even more pronounced turn. The dramatic increase in military spending, which started internationally more than a decade ago, is currently undergoing a significant transformation.

Those on the left who, over the last few decades, have claimed that the global capitalist system had moved beyond the classic stage of imperialism [3] and that we had entered a new era of super-imperialism led mainly by multinationals, whose ties with their countries of origin had been profoundly altered and weakened, were mistaken.

The policies of the most powerful states continue to dominate the evolution of the capitalist world. The so-called virtuous phase of globalisation (according to the apologetic version, popularised in particular by the Davos Forum and most governments), with the internationalisation of production chains including China and the G7 powers (and partially Russia, which was part of the G8 G8 Group composed of the most powerful countries of the planet: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA, with Russia a full member since June 2002. Their heads of state meet annually, usually in June or July. until 2014–2015), and the increase in free trade, is behind us.

Numerous armed conflicts have punctuated history since the Second World War, including during the short period (part of the 1990s) following the Cold War, and they have intensified during the new Cold War that began in the late 1990s.

The major imperialist powers, led by the United States, have resumed the path that leads to international, even global, wars. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has provided Washington with arguments to accelerate and intensify its war policy.

Russia, led by Vladimir Putin—a second-tier capitalist and imperialist power with nuclear weapons and vast fossil fuel resources— could take advantage of the failures of the United States and NATO in Afghanistan and the Middle East to carry out a massive invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But he miscalculated from his perspective and did not foresee that the Ukrainian people would resist massively. Putin thought that Zelensky’s regime (which is a neoliberal regime applying the recipes of the IMF IMF

International Monetary Fund Along with the World Bank, the IMF was founded on the day the Bretton Woods Agreements were signed. Its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates.

When the Bretton Wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971, the main function of the IMF became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital: it acts as policeman when it enforces its Structural Adjustment Policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments.

As for the World Bank, a weighted voting system operates: depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state. 85% of the votes is required to modify the IMF Charter (which means that the USA with 17,68% % of the votes has a de facto veto on any change).

The institution is dominated by five countries: the United States (16,74%), Japan (6,23%), Germany (5,81%), France (4,29%) and the UK (4,29%).

The other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country. The most important one (6,57% of the votes) is led by Belgium. The least important group of countries (1,55% of the votes) is led by Gabon and brings together African countries.

WB The World Bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at Bretton Woods in 1944. Its capital is provided by member states’ contributions and loans on the international money markets. It financed public and private projects in Third World and East European countries.

It consists of several closely associated institutions, among which :

1. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, 189 members in 2017), which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy ;

2. The International Development Association (IDA, 159 members in 1997), which provides less advanced countries with long-term loans (35-40 years) at very low interest (1%) ;

3. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries.

As Third World Debt gets worse, the World Bank (along with the IMF) tends to adopt a macro-economic perspective. For instance, it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries’ payments. The World Bank advises those countries that have to undergo the IMF’s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits, round up savings, enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders, or free prices and exchange rates.

) would collapse and that military victories would be quick and irreversible.

The Western imperialist powers prioritised their own interests, leading to the strengthening of NATO with the accession of Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024. On the other hand, sanctions against Russia have had little effect, and the ongoing war is being used to justify a massive increase in military spending by Central and Western European countries and a reactivation of their armies’ combat and deployment capabilities abroad, all under the unchallenged and arrogant leadership of Washington.

For their part, the United States, under Trump’s leadership during his second term, considered that their offensive should not be directed against Russia but rather against China, which represents a competing power that is far more powerful economically and politically than Russia. This is clearly stated in the National Security Strategy document released in early December 2025 by the government in Washington.

How do economic problems exacerbate tensions?

Éric Toussaint: Global capitalism is in crisis and has been unable to return to a sustained pace of growth, to the point where we can speak, as economist Michael Roberts does, of a long depression. We are not at all advocates of growth, but from the point of view of capitalism, the inability to return to sustained growth is a real problem in terms of ensuring the massive accumulation of profits. This crisis, particularly acute in the former imperialist powers (the G7), exacerbates tensions between the bloc dominated by Washington and China, which is maintaining sustained growth, even if it is slowing down.

The preparation (and execution) of international armed conflicts is one of the responses that the capitalist classes of the various powers periodically use to find a solution to economic crises and to seek to expand or maintain their influence. We saw this repeatedly in the 19th and 20th centuries.

What does Trump’s strategy document say about the US military and the use of force?

Éric Toussaint: Trump does not hesitate to adopt a belligerent tone:

""We want to recruit, train, equip, and field the world’s most powerful, lethal, and technologically advanced military to protect our interests, deter wars, and—if necessary—win them quickly and decisively, with the lowest possible casualties to our forces. And we want a military in which every single service member is proud of their country and confident in their mission.

We want the world’s most robust, credible, and modern nuclear deterrent, plus next-generation missile defences—including a Golden Dome for the American homeland—to protect the American people, American assets overseas, and American allies”. NSS 2025, p. 3.

In several places in the text, it is stated that the United States reserves the right to conduct military operations wherever it sees fit and to continue to use force to defend its interests. Trump also boasts in the introduction to the document about the military intervention in Iran against civilian nuclear facilities. He writes, ’We obliterated Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity.’

During 2025, in violation of international law, he systematically resorted to force, whether in the Caribbean Sea against Venezuela (under the pretext of fighting drug trafficking), in Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, etc., not to mention, of course, his unwavering support for the Israeli army and Netanyahu’s neo-fascist government in carrying out a veritable genocide against the Palestinian people. In early January 2026, he ordered a large-scale military attack against Venezuela, kidnapped the presidential couple, had them taken to New York to be tried in the United States on false charges, and announced that he was taking control of the country’s oil resources.

When the Trump administration addresses the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, it is obvious that the United States is threatening to use force against China if Washington considers that its interests are at stake. We can see that it is preparing, as one of the possible pretexts for justifying military action, the need to maintain freedom of movement in the China Sea and elsewhere.

Does Trump not claim that the United States has footed the bill for the defence of its allies, particularly NATO member countries?

Éric Toussaint: Indeed, Trump adopts a completely false narrative when he writes that previous administrations ’allowed allies and partners to offload the cost of their defense onto the American people (NSS 2025, p. 1).”

This is factually incorrect and serves to justify the pressure Trump is exerting on his allies, whom he treats as vassals, to accelerate the increase in military spending that they had already begun a decade ago. The statement appears on page 12 of NSS 2025:

Indeed, as the public saw, NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Rutte said, more or less, to Trump at an Atlantic Alliance summit in The Hague in June 2025: ’Grandpa is right to get angry with his family members when they misbehave.’ This was a prime example of European vassal behaviour towards the president of the United States. And a month later, at the end of July 2025, EU President Ursula von der Leyen herself made a show of submission by visiting her suzerain’s lands in Scotland. She met with Trump on a golf course he owned to promise him that the EU would indeed buy more fossil fuels and more weapons from Uncle Sam and to submit to his will regarding the increase in customs tariffs.

A major misconception is that the United States’ allies, particularly NATO members, have benefited financially from Washington’s generosity. In fact, the United States maintains more than 220 large permanent military bases outside its territory in order to exert its dominance over a large part of the planet. In total, according to the Pentagon, the United States has more than 700 military sites in 80 countries, including more than 220 permanent military bases with a significant number of military personnel. US bases abroad account for 80% of foreign bases worldwide. This percentage is far more than any other country. For example, Russia has around 20 permanent military installations abroad, either in former Soviet countries or in Syria, with a total of 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers. China has only one permanent military base abroad, in Djibouti, with an official contingent of 400 Chinese soldiers.

The United States maintains more than 250,000 military personnel outside its territory at any given time, including more than 50,000 in Japan, 35,000 in Germany, 22,000 in South Korea, 12,000 in Italy, 10,000 in Great Britain

The United States maintains more than 250,000 military personnel outside its territory at any given time, including more than 50,000 in Japan, 35,000 in Germany, 22,000 in South Korea, 12,000 in Italy, 10,000 in Great Britain, and so on. As military personnel rotate, their presence represents a much larger total volume. Large capitalist companies in the United States derive enormous profits from this, particularly those in the military-industrial complex, as they supply military equipment and maintenance services.

Trump is lying to the American people by trying to make them believe that Washington has financed the protection of foreign allies with US taxpayers’ money. To calculate the net cost of the US presence abroad, we must consider what the United States actually spends on its military presence, including personnel, operations, and armaments. Many countries pay part of the cost of the US presence on their territory. Japan finances 70% of the US presence (or US occupation of its territory), Germany pays between 20 and 30%, Italy 30 to 40%, and the United Kingdom 20 to 25%. It is also essential to take into account the purchases of arms from American companies made by countries where US troops are present. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), 64% of European allies’ arms imports will come from the United States for the period 2020-2024 (Source: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, https://www.sipri.org/publications/2025/sipri-fact-sheets/trends-international-arms-transfers-2024).

In any case, US military spending abroad directly serves its interests and does not represent any form of generosity or solidarity. The United States has carried out numerous military aggressions and interventions around the world, always in the interests of its large private companies and the US capitalist class. These interventions have served to overthrow or attempt to overthrow progressive regimes (Cuba, Santo Domingo, Vietnam, Grenada, etc.) or governments that have become inconvenient, such as Noriega’s in Panama, Saddam Hussein’s in Iraq, or the Taliban’s in Afghanistan. US military interventions since the end of the Second World War have been responsible for millions of deaths. They have enabled the United States to take control of territories that are particularly rich in raw materials, especially oil.

Japan finances 70% of the US presence (or US occupation of its territory), Germany pays between 20 and 30%, Italy 30 to 40%, and the United Kingdom 20 to 25%

At the same time, how is it that Trump presents himself as a peacemaker?

Éric Toussaint: Indeed, Trump presents himself as the president of peace, and it is worth starting with the passage in his text where he lists his supposed successes in order to compare the facts with his lies.

“President Trump has cemented his legacy as a president of peace. In addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has used his negotiating skills to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts around the world during the last eight months of his second term. He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with the return of all hostages alive to their families.”

In reality, the Abraham Accords in 2020 enabled Netanyahu’s neo-fascist government, with Washington’s help, to strengthen its international position by normalising relations with several Arab states: the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. This has allowed Israel to strengthen the apartheid regime and further oppress the Palestinian people before moving on to the phase of ethnic cleansing and genocide.

While Netanyahu’s neo-fascist government is perpetrating genocide against the Palestinian people, which began in late 2023 with Washington’s full support (it started under the Biden administration), Trump has the audacity to claim that he has achieved peace in Gaza.

Trump’s claims of achieving other peace agreements are false; peace has not been established between Thailand and Cambodia, the DRC and Rwanda, or Israel and Iran. We also know that India does not accept the role Trump attributes to himself in the provisional end to the conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025. We can’t say Egypt and Ethiopia are at peace since they never fought.

And in this passage, Trump does not mention the parts of the world where he is directly responsible for aggression, as is the case in Yemen, Venezuela, and Nigeria... Finally, he remains silent on the war between Ukraine and Russia, even though he promised that if elected, he would bring about peace in record time.

What is Trump’s stance on globalisation and free trade?

Éric Toussaint: Right from the introduction, Trump criticises previous administrations and what he calls ’the American foreign policy elites’, who:

""placed hugely misguided and destructive bets on globalism and so-called ‘free trade’ that hollowed out the very middle class and industrial base on which American economic and military preeminence depend.” NSS 2025, p. 1

Trump is so protectionist and aggressive on tariffs because the US economy has lost a great deal of competitiveness, and, on the global and domestic markets, local industries are no longer able to compete with products from China and other countries. China has structural competitive advantages, including decisive cost advantages (due in part to Chinese wages being lower than US wages) and economies of scale. In certain key sectors, it has acquired a partial or sectoral technological advantage (e.g., electric vehicles). These advantages enable it to charge lower prices than US producers. China wins its trade with the US by selling cheaper products than equivalent ones made in the United States. This is the case in areas such as electric vehicles, solar panels, computer equipment, etc.

President Trump’s actions during his first term in office have paralysed the WTO WTO

World Trade Organisation The WTO, founded on 1st January 1995, replaced the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). The main innovation is that the WTO enjoys the status of an international organization. Its role is to ensure that no member States adopt any kind of protectionism whatsoever, in order to accelerate the liberalization global trading and to facilitate the strategies of the multinationals. It has an international court (the Dispute Settlement Body) which judges any alleged violations of its founding text drawn up in Marrakesh.

. The Trump administration declined to appoint new judges to the WTO’s Appellate Body in 2017. This kind of ’supreme court’ of international trade settles disputes between states once an initial panel has ruled. Since 2017, the block on this body has rendered the WTO inoperable.

For its part, China has become a fervent advocate of free trade, free trade agreements, WTO rules, and free competition, while the United States, followed by the EU, UK, and Canada, has become increasingly protectionist and is using tariffs to make Chinese and other competitors’ products more expensive.

What is Trump’s position on the ecological crisis?

Éric Toussaint: As the ecological crisis and its climate-related aspects become increasingly catastrophic, Trump, along with other far-right governments, remains in a state of complete denial:

“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies that have so greatly harmed Europe, threaten the United States, and subsidise our adversaries."" NSS 2025, p. 14

Trump does not mince his words and states that he wants to

“Restoring American energy dominance (in oil, gas, coal, and nuclear) and reshoring the necessary key energy components is a top strategic priority. Cheap and abundant energy will produce well-paying jobs in the United States, reduce costs for American consumers and businesses, fuel reindustrialisation, and help maintain our advantage in cutting-edge technologies such as AI. Expanding our net energy exports will also deepen relationships with allies while curtailing the influence of adversaries, protect our ability to defend our shores, and—when and where necessary—enable us to project power..."" NSS 2025, p. 14

The Trump administration’s policy of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and boycotting COP30 in Brazil in November 2025 will exacerbate the ecological crisis by increasing the extraction and production of fossil fuels.

Does Trump refer to ’human rights’ in the NSS 2025?

Éric Toussaint: In the NSS 2025, there is no reference to the promotion or respect of human rights. This was already the case in the NSS 2017 of Trump’s first term.

In the NSS 2025 document, the words ’human rights’ do not appear once, nor do ’social protection’ or ’social rights.’ The authors of this strategic document have deliberately omitted these concepts from it altogether.

It is clear that, systematically, successive US administrations, whether Democratic or Republican, have used the pretext of promoting human rights to carry out actions that trampled on human rights and violated the United Nations Charter. It should be noted that in the2015 NSS published by the Obama administration, ’human rights’ appeared nine times, and in Joe Biden’s 2022 NSS, ’human rights’ appeared 20 times.

In his criticism of China or Russia, Trump no longer uses hypocritical human rights rhetoric. In the case of the United States, Trump refers only to ’the God-given natural rights of its citizens’ (NSS 2025, p. 3). In the same vein, further on in the document, he states that ’all human beings possess God-given equal natural rights’ (NSS 2025, p. 9). And in the case of the dictatorial monarchies of the Gulf, there is no longer a question of democratisation. NSS 2025 states that it ’will require dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations—especially the Gulf monarchies—into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government” NSS 2025, p. 28.

In short, what is new about Trump’s approach is the outright abandonment of rhetoric regarding the promotion of human rights, respect for international law, and adherence to international human rights treaties.

This is consistent with the attacks contained in NSS 2025 against UN institutions...

On page 2 of the NSS 2025, Trump denounces previous administrations that

“they lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty.”

Although they are not named in this document, we know that Trump regularly attacks the UN, the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNESCO, UNRWA (the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees), OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Court of Justice in The Hague, etc. He also decided that the United States would withdraw from several of these institutions, cut their funding, and/or no longer recognise their competence. On 7 January 2026, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from 66 international organisations, including 31 UN organisations [4] (Source: White House).

It should also be noted that the 2025 NSS makes no reference to the rights of peoples to self-determination or to exercise sovereignty over the natural resources of their territories, as these universal rights enshrined in various United Nations treaties are in direct contradiction with Trump’s international policy.

On the subject of human rights, what is Trump’s position on the rights of migrants?

Éric Toussaint: Unsurprisingly, the administration has adopted a totally reactionary position on migration, which is completely at odds with the spirit of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

“We want full control over our borders, over our immigration system, and over transportation networks through which people come into our country—legally and illegally. We want a world in which migration is not merely “orderly” but one in which sovereign countries work together to stop rather than facilitate destabilising population flows, and have full control over whom they do and do not admit.” NSS 2025, p. 3

""The Era of Mass Migration Is Over – Who a country admits into its borders—in what numbers and from where—will inevitably define the future of that nation. Any country that considers itself sovereign has the right and duty to define its future. Throughout history, sovereign nations prohibited uncontrolled migration and granted citizenship only rarely to foreigners, who also had to meet demanding criteria. The West’s experience over the past decades vindicates this enduring wisdom. In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion, distorted labour markets, and undermined national security. The era of mass migration must end” NSS 2025, p. 11

Trump’s brutal neo-fascist policy against migrants and refugees has reached catastrophic proportions. During 2025, the US authorities carried out mass round-ups and arrests, resulting, according to statements by the Trump administration, in more than 2.5 million departures (including deportations and voluntary departures) and a significant increase in arrests and criminal prosecutions for illegal immigration offences aimed at creating a climate of fear, even terror, among the immigrant population. In terms of outright deportations, some sources indicate a figure of over 600,000 (Source:https://cis.org/Arthur/DHS-600000-Deportations-Inauguration-Day). Trump uses racist and dehumanising language towards migrants that is similar to that used by ministers in Netanyahu’s neo-fascist government towards Palestinians.

During a Cabinet meeting, Trump attacked the Somali community (particularly in Minnesota) with harsh words:

“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in rubbish into our country. Ilhan Omar is rubbish, just rubbish. These are people who do nothing but complain... We don’t want them in our country.” (Source:https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/07/trump-immigration-ice)

Ilhan Omar, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, is an American politician, member of the Democratic Party, and representative for Minnesota in the United States Congress since the November 6, 2018 federal elections.

Agents from the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency use very violent arrest methods during raids on workplaces, public transport or even near sensitive locations (schools, churches, hospitals). On 7 January 2026, an ICE agent killed a woman who posed no danger in Minneapolis.

For several months, ICE has been carrying out mass arrests in certain cities. Prison conditions are terrible and regularly deliberately inhumane to provoke fear and terror. However, research indicates that the vast majority of foreigners imprisoned by ICE have no criminal record (Source:https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/ice-detention-statistics/).

It should be noted, by way of comparison, that between 1 October 2023 and 30 September 2024, during Joe Biden’s term of office, 271,484 people were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a sharp increase compared to the beginning of Biden’s term. ICE reported 545,252 official deportations during Biden’s entire term (2021-2024). It should also be noted that during Barack Obama’s two terms in office, the number of deportations was very high: 2,749,706 deportations in eight years (2009-2016), an average of 942 per day. Obama’s first term (2009-2012) saw an average daily deportation rate of 1,088; during his second term (2013-2016), this figure dropped to 794. The website factchequeado.com has published a detailed summary of deportations carried out by the various administrations that have been in power in Washington since 1993; see:https://factchequeado.com/teexplicamos/20250820/obama-deportations-trump-biden-numbers/

Is it true that NSS 2025 effectively echoes the conspiracy theory and the far-right theory of civilised warfare?

Éric Toussaint: Trump’s document clearly contains far-right ideas. Without explicitly referring to it, Trump adopts the theory of ’great replacement,’ which is a far-right conspiracy theory. In the United States, it is known as the theory of ’white genocide’ [5] . In another form, this is also the thesis of Steve Bannon, who was one of the main ideological architects of Trumpism, particularly in its nationalist, authoritarian, and far-right dimensions. Steve Bannon talks mainly about ’civilisational warfare,’ ’the destruction of the West,’ and ’mass immigration as a political weapon.’ He denounces the ’globalist elites who are betraying the people.’ French political figures such as Éric Zemmour have popularised the theory of the great replacement. According to the theory of the ’great replacement,’ European populations are gradually being replaced by non-European populations (often Muslim) as a result of immigration, differences in birth rates, and policies pursued (whether deliberately or not) by political, economic, and media elites. This theory refers to cultural, civilisational and demographic replacement, which it attributes mainly to non-European immigration and Islam. It presents this phenomenon as an existential threat to European identity, culture and civilisation. This sentiment is echoed in Trump’s document published by the White House on 4 December 2025.

Regarding Europe, Trump’s document states:

“We want to support our allies in preserving the freedom and security of Europe, while restoring Europe’s civilisational self-confidence and Western identity”.NSS 2025, p. 5

Trump asserts that Europe’s economic decline:

“is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure. The larger issues facing Europe include activities of the European Union and other transnational bodies that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies that are transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition (Trump and his administration are referring to policies restricting the actions of far-right parties and their racist or anti-immigrant propaganda, note by Éric Toussaint), cratering birth rates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.” NSS 2025 , p. 25

In summary, these two passages contain the key arguments of the far-right conspiracy theory of the great replacement and civilisational war.

The following passage explicitly endorses far-right parties:

“America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism.” NSS 2025, p. 26

What is the policy on promoting the right to diversity (in terms of race, gender, origin, etc.)?

Éric Toussaint: Trump has made a point of abolishing so-called DEI (Diversity, Equity Equity The capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders. Not to be confused with ’hard capital’ or ’unsecured debt’. , Inclusion) policies, and he has put this approach into practice by issuing various executive orders (see in particular:https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-removes-dei-from-the-foreign-service/ ) and he reiterates this in the strategic document , published in early December 2025, stating that he is implementing initiatives that:

“Re-instilling a culture of competence, rooting out so-called “DEI” and other discriminatory and anti-competitive practices that degrade our institutions and hold us back.” NSS 2025, p. 6.

The DEI practices that the Trump administration has eliminated may include quotas, preferential policies, recruitment or promotion priorities for ’underrepresented’ groups, ’inclusion’ programmes or diversity training, etc. Trump has banned any consideration of race, gender, origin, or any form of preference based on these criteria in recruitment, promotion, hiring, or retention in public services (including the armed forces, the diplomatic corps, etc.).

Trump reaffirms his position very clearly with regard to the armed forces:

’We got radical gender ideology and woke lunacy out of our armed forces and began strengthening our military with a $ 1 trillion investment."" (Introduction signed by Donald Trump, NSS 2025)

In summary, what policies does Trump announce for the different major regions of the world?

Éric Toussaint: The Trump administration is asserting its desire for total domination of the Western Hemisphere (i.e., the Americas from Patagonia in the south to Canada and Greenland in the north), where it is conducting aggressive military operations, starting with targeting oil-rich Venezuela. The NSS 2025 states the following with regard to the Western Hemisphere:

“We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere. This “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine is a common-sense and potent restoration of American power and priorities, consistent with American security interests.” (NSS 2025, p. 15)

With regard to China, the 2025 strategy document marks a new stage: it no longer merely notes the rivalry but explicitly points to the historic mistake made by US elites in promoting China’s rise. China is now perceived not only as a competitor but as a direct threat to the US economy, social cohesion, supply chains, national security and even cultural stability. Thus, without formally committing to a direct military option, the conflict extends to all economic, technological, ideological, and societal spheres. Trump decides to increase military presence, strengthen military capabilities, and expand economic interests in the Indo-Pacific [6], where he confronts China.

With regard to Europe, Trump decides to demonstrate strong support to far-right parties, some of which are already in power (Italy and Hungary, for example), and demands that European governments behave as docile vassals of Washington, in particular by significantly increasing their military spending, which directly benefits the US arms industry. In this vein, the NSS 2025 contains the following sentence about Europe: ’We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness.’ NSS 2025, p. 26. The selection of the term ’aligned’ speaks for itself.

With regard to the Middle East, Trump claims that this region is less important than in the past and that he will respect the political regimes in place in the dictatorial monarchies of the Gulf.

Regarding Russia, Trump is in favour of sharing influence if Moscow does not take any initiatives outside a perimeter that includes some of the former USSR member countries, including Ukraine. Trump is seeking to convince Russia to distance itself from China.

Trump devotes very little attention to Africa, viewing it solely as a continent from which to extract raw materials and protect US interests. The aim is to ’harness Africa’s abundant natural resources and latent economic potential’. NSS 2025, p. 29.

What is the conclusionof your analysis?

Éric Toussaint: The international policy doctrine made public by the White House in early December 2025 is not simply a temporary shift in US foreign policy but the logical outcome of a process that has been underway for more than a quarter of a century in the context of the ’new Cold War.’. This document marks a qualitative radicalisation: it now openly embraces the logic of imperial dominance, systematic use of force, and explicit rejection of international law, multilateral institutions, and universal human rights. Under Donald Trump, this orientation takes on an unprecedented ideological form that is openly predatory, violent, reactionary, authoritarian, and neo-fascist.

Where previous administrations combined the exercise of imperialist violence with deeply hypocritical liberal and humanitarian rhetoric, the Trump administration has broken with this façade. Human rights, social rights, the protection of migrants, the self-determination of peoples and even the minimal reference to multilateralism have completely disappeared from official strategic discourse. They have been replaced by a worldview based on ’God-given natural rights,’ the absolute sovereignty of dominant states, the hierarchy of civilisations, and the legitimisation of permanent military coercion.

This doctrine exists within a context of structural crisis in global capitalism, characterised by a prolonged depression, increased competition among major powers, and the failure of the former imperialist G7 countries to sustain their economic hegemony. Washington, confronted with the United States’ relative decline, has consciously chosen to adopt a militaristic strategy that propels it forward and engages in harsh protectionism. China is designated as the main adversary, not because it challenges global capitalism, but precisely because it has successfully integrated with it, challenging US economic, technological and geopolitical supremacy. Russia, a second-tier imperialist power, serves as a foil and justification for the accelerated militarisation of Europe under NATO control but is no longer considered an enemy.

The NSS 2025 also reveals a profound convergence between external imperialism and internal authoritarianism. The denunciation of liberal globalisation is accompanied not by a project of social emancipation, but by aggressive economic nationalism, an offensive against migrants, the implicit adoption of conspiracy theories about the ’great replacement’ and an ideological war against policies of equality, diversity and inclusion.

Military domination, economic predation, fossil fuel productivism and climate denial form a coherent whole, serving the interests of the military-industrial complex and the US capitalist class.

Finally, far from being a ’peacemaker,’ Trump appears to be the architect of a more unstable, violent, and unequal world where force takes precedence over law and war becomes a common tool for managing capitalism’s crisis. In this sense, the new doctrine of US foreign policy not only threatens the peoples directly targeted by US imperialism – in Palestine, Latin America, Africa and Asia – but also poses a major danger to humanity as a whole. It increases the risk of major international conflicts, even a global conflagration, in a context where the ecological crisis already makes the future deeply uncertain. Faced with this neo-fascist drift at the head of the world’s leading military power, the challenge for progressive, anti-militarist, anti-fascist, anti-racist, feminist, and internationalist forces is more than ever: to rebuild transnational solidarity, oppose all forms of imperialism, and defend a radically alternative project based on peace, equal rights, social justice, the rights of people, and the preservation of the very conditions of life on Earth.",https://www.cadtm.org/local/cache-vignettes/L814xH427/38425c577c920f72aa1c60c29fe90e-9f063.webp,N,,2026-01-11 21:56:44.649837

In Fargo, an estimated 500 people gathered for a demonstration organized by Red River United Indivisible.

Jerrod Baetsch stood with an American flag upside down — a sign of distress — as a north wind blew in the face of protesters lining a Red River bridge connecting Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota.

“To stay at home felt useless,” Baetsch said of joining Saturday’s protest of the shooting of Renee Good, a mother who was killed Wednesday by Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

The demonstrations follow thousands of ICE agents deployed to neighboring Minnesota. Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post they were supporting neighbors before the ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. Video of the incident shows Renee Good’s vehicle blocking traffic and ICE officers approaching the vehicle, with one officer ordering her to exit her vehicle. Ross fired as Good pulled the vehicle forward.

Baetsch said any actions by Good in her vehicle did not justify the use of deadly force.

The crowd observed a moment of silence for Good after gathering near a Statue of Liberty replica on the Fargo end of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Minnesota begins collecting evidence into ICE shooting following ousting by feds

Speaking to the crowd, Colby Montigue of Fargo, urged people to continue to protest, organize and run for office.

“This doesn’t stop until we do the work,” said Montigue, a member of the Red River Valley Democratic Socialists of America.

Minnesota officials announced Friday they’re collecting evidence in an investigation of the shooting and are asking the public to submit information.

In Bismarck, demonstrators lined Boulevard Avenue on Sunday to rally outside the Capitol during an event called ICE Out for Good.

Cherie Schumacher, a volunteer organizer for Missouri River Indivisible, said there were a lot of hateful comments made on social media ahead of the Bismarck event, to the point that “it was actually kind of scary to go.”

Most people driving by had positive responses, Schumacher said, except for someone who drove by and fired what she described as foam BBs at participants as the event was ending. Schumacher said she was hit in the shoulder and someone else was hit in the back.

“They were just these little tiny foam things, so there was no harm to us,” she said. “But it’s sending a message anytime someone points anything at you to target you.”

Another event was held Saturday in Grand Forks, with the Grand Forks Herald reporting a crowd of about 150 people.

The North Dakota Human Rights Coalition was among groups that condemned the killing of Good last week.

“We urge residents to contact their representatives to demand oversight of federal enforcement actions, protections for freedom of speech and the right to protest, and policies that prioritize life, dignity, and community-based safety,” the organization said in a statement.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NDMONITOR-ICE-JAN11-2026-058-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 19:57:13.425697

Good was killed the day after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota set to deploy 2,000 immigration officers to the state.
There were no arrests during the protests, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department told NPR on Sunday.","People took to the streets in cities across the country this weekend to protest the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics following the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week.

At least 1,000 events across the U.S. were planned for Saturday and Sunday, according to Indivisible, a progressive grassroots coalition of activists helping coordinate the movement it calls ""ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action.""

Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible, said people are coming together to ""grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long.""

""Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,"" Greenberg said in a statement on Friday. ""ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent.""

Large crowds of demonstrators carried signs and shouted ""ICE out now!"" during protests across Minneapolis on Saturday. One of those protesters, Cameron Kritikos, told NPR that he is worried that the presence of more ICE agents in the city could lead to more violence or another death.

""If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there's very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I'm nervous that there's going to be more violence,"" the 31-year grocery store worker said. ""I'm nervous that there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day I think that's not what anyone wants.""

The night before, hundreds of city and state police officers responded to a ""noise protest"" in downtown Minneapolis. An estimated 1,000 people gathered Friday night, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, and 29 people were arrested.

People demonstrated outside of hotels where ICE agents were believed to be staying. They chanted, played drums and banged pots. O'Hara said that a group of people split from the main protest and began damaging hotel windows. One police officer was injured from a chunk of ice that was hurled at officers, he added.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned acts of violence but praised what he said were the ""vast majority"" of protesters who remained peaceful, during a morning news conference.

""To anyone who causes property damage or puts others in danger: you will be arrested. We are standing up to Donald Trump's chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,"" Frey wrote on social media.

Commenting on the protests, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement, ""the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting, assault and destruction,"" adding, ""DHS is taking measures to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety and our officers.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the agency was sending ""hundreds more"" federal agents to Minneapolis Sunday and Monday to protect ICE agents.

""If they [protesters] conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,"" Noem told Fox News.

Good was killed the day after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota set to deploy 2,000 immigration officers to the state.

In Philadelphia, police estimated about 500 demonstrators ""were cooperative and peaceful"" at a march that began Saturday morning at City Hall, Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson Tanya Little told NPR in a statement. No arrests were made.

In Portland, Ore., demonstrators rallied and lined the streets outside of a hospital on Saturday afternoon, where immigration enforcement agents bring detainees who are injured during an arrest, reported Oregon Public Broadcasting.

A man and woman were shot and injured by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Thursday in the city. DHS said the shooting happened during a targeted vehicle stop and identified the driver as Luis David Nino-Moncada, and the passenger as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, both from Venezuela. As was the case in their assertion about Good's fatal shooting, Homeland Security officials claimed the federal agent acted in self-defense after Nino-Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras ""weaponized their vehicle.""

Protests also continued Sunday, including in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and New York City.

Crowds gathered across the metro Atlanta area, including on the 17th Street bridge, where demonstrators held signs that read ""Stop ICE Terror Now"" and ""ICE out 4 good,"" according to local media reports.

New cellphone video shows the deadly shooting from the ICE agent's, Jonathan Ross, perspective, but the reaction and interpretation of the many videos remains sharply divided.

The Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claim that Good weaponized her vehicle and argue that the federal officers' use of deadly force was justified.

Meanwhile, protestors and many Democrats argue the opposite.

""I'm horrified, and what this means is anyone is vulnerable,"" said Alice Rothchild.

Rothchild was one of several protestors who gathered in Columbia City on Saturday with signs and flags. The protest was peaceful with the running theme, ""ICE Out.""

While many Washington Democrats, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, have voiced similar sentiments to these protestors, the state's top Republicans are not aligned. Rep. Jim Walsh, chairman of the state's republican party, agrees with the Trump administration.

He told KOMO News the videos of the situation in Minneapolis clearly depict that the use of deadly force was appropriate.

""This woman [Good] attacked a law enforcement officer with her car, with her vehicle, and law enforcement officers are trained to protect themselves when being attacked,"" Walsh said.

The protestors seen on streetcorners along Rainier Ave. on Saturday sharply disagreed.

Genessa Krasnow, an organizer of the neighborhood demonstration, told KOMO News she saw Good simply trying to leave the scene in the videos.

Krasnow also rejects DHS's claims that Good accelerated her car towards the ICE agent.

""This was a woman who had everything to live for. She wasn't there to kill,"" Krasnow claimed. ""She was there to stop people being kidnapped on the streets.""

Pierce County Sheriff Keith Swank has joined the conversation online, as well.

He posted on X that people should not interfere with law enforcement regardless of their feelings toward President Donald Trump or ICE.

""Nothing good will come of it,"" Swank wrote on social media.

Swank has also criticized the Keep Washington Working Act, a state law that prohibits agencies, like the Pierce County Sheriff's Office, from assisting or cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

Walsh told KOMO News he similarly did not support the act, but he acknowledged it's state law and therefore must be followed.

The deadly shooting of Good raises additional questions about the training ICE agents must complete, and what protocol agents have to follow regarding the use of deadly force, local protestors said.

""Don't just abduct people from their homes,"" Krasnow continued, ""Don't senselessly kill.""

""I also think that if an agent feels threatened, shooting the person is not the first tactic you go for,"" Rothchild added further.

When asked about these concerns and questions, Walsh swiftly argued them to be baseless.

""The premise that somehow federal law enforcement agencies aren't professionals or aren't trained to a high level a professional standard, especially on matters like using deadly force, is false,"" he said.

Trump has said publicly that he may take action if Iranian leaders killed protesters challenging Iran’s theocracy, as demonstrations entered their second week despite an increasingly aggressive crackdown.

The president has been presented with preliminary plans, according to three U.S. officials, ranging from possible strikes to other options that would not entail military action. No final decision has been made, the officials said.

The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said Sunday that at least 538 people have been killed. The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights also cited unverified reports that several hundred people may have been killed.

Iran warned Trump that Israeli and U.S. military bases in the region could be considered “legitimate targets” if a strike goes ahead.

How ICE raids in Minnesota connect to a years-old fraud scandal

The Trump administration has surged immigration agents into Minnesota in what it has called the largest DHS operation ever. While the administration often frames its deportation operations as efforts to keep Americans safe, it has added another angle to its campaign in the North Star State: eradicating fraud.

Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors uncovered an enormous scheme to defraud a pandemic meals program in Minnesota’s Somali community, leading to multiple convictions.

In recent weeks, however, conservative commentators elevated the years-old scandal, suggesting that fraud was a reason to target immigrants in the Minneapolis area. As the story took hold, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted that agents were “on the ground” in response, with more than 2,000 agents and officers descending on the Twin Cities.

The ensuing tensions resulted in an ICE officer fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mom.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the federal government should allow state agencies to help investigate the shooting.

Frey told moderator Kristen Welker he didn’t have preconceived notions about what conclusion an investigation would reach, but said “there is deep mistrust” of federal agencies in Minnesota because “so many of the things that we are hearing are not true.”

One such narrative Frey is disputing was discussed by border czar Tom Homan earlier in the program.

When asked about Noem’s allegation that Good was engaged in “domestic terrorism,” Homan said “if you look up this definition of terrorism, it certainly could fall within that definition.”

Frey pointed to multiple publicly available videos of the shooting, including a cellphone video taken by the officer who shot Good.

“You don’t need to take my word for it. You don’t need to take their word for it. Watch the video,” Frey said.

Notable quote

There are parents that stand at four points around the schools with ICE whistles. I took my children to the pediatrician, and my pediatrician was handing out ICE whistles to families.

Ginya, 41, Minnesota resident who lives a few houses away from where Good was killed

Minneapolis residents say the killing of Renee Nicole Good sent shock waves through a city already shaped by repeated confrontations with police violence. For some, the fatal shooting reopened deep wounds from the police murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away in 2020. And in more recent months, residents said, heightened immigration enforcement has altered daily life in the city.

'Meet the Press'

Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that if the U.S. annexed Greenland, “it would be the end of NATO.”

The Connecticut Democrat’s comments came in response to a question about whether the move floated by the Trump administration would effectively end the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defensive alliance created in the years after World War II.

“NATO would have an obligation to defend Greenland, and so query whether we would be at war with Europe, with England, with France,” Murphy said.

Greenland is a territory of Denmark, a NATO member. Article 5 of the NATO Charter stipulates that an attack on one NATO member should be considered an attack on all NATO members. Article 5 has only been invoked once, in support of the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Politics in brief

Retaliatory strikes: The U.S. carried out what it called “large-scale strikes” against ISIS in Syria, the latest retaliatory attack after an ambush last month killed two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter.

Oil or democracy? Trump administration officials have competing priorities about what’s next for Venezuela, leaving its future unclear.

Bob Weir, Grateful Dead founding member, dies at 78

Bob Weir, a founding member of the Grateful Dead whose rhythm guitar work, songwriting and tireless touring helped push traditional American blues and folk music into the modern era, died, according to a statement posted Saturday to his official website. He was 78.

The statement said Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July, beat it, but “succumbed to underlying lung issues.”

Weir was one of music’s true road warriors, performing thousands of shows with almost a dozen bands. And though he often stood figuratively (and sometimes literally) in Jerry Garcia’s shadow, Weir eventually assumed the status of elder statesman of the “jam band” music genre that spun off from the Dead.

Steele, 67, was the first Black chair of the RNC and coined the phrase “Drill, baby, drill!” in a speech at the 2008 Republican national convention.
“The only thing that would be surprising is the speed with which institutions collapsed,” he said in a recent phone interview.
“I thought that there would be more resistance from lawyers and institutions of higher learning than we’ve seen.
He joined the Republican party in 1976 and became the first Black person elected to statewide office in Maryland, serving as lieutenant governor from 2003 to 2007.","The biggest surprise of Donald Trump’s first year back in office is how quickly America’s institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said Michael Steele, a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic.

But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy.

Steele, 67, was the first Black chair of the RNC and coined the phrase “Drill, baby, drill!” in a speech at the 2008 Republican national convention. He was implacably opposed to Trump’s takeover of the party and is now a co-host of The Weeknight on the liberal-leaning MS NOW network.

As the first anniversary of Trump’s second inauguration approaches, Steele said the president’s authoritarian assault on the constitution and rule of law was more expected than the way in which many law firms, universities and media companies caved.

“The only thing that would be surprising is the speed with which institutions collapsed,” he said in a recent phone interview. “I thought that there would be more resistance from lawyers and institutions of higher learning than we’ve seen.

“The administration came out of the gate with an everything-everywhere-all-at-once strategy that overwhelmed institutions and processes in a way that it was easier to collapse and give in than to stand and resist. The few institutions that did have proven that in the long run was probably the better strategy.”

Trump targeted law firms that opposed his policies or were involved in investigations related to the 2016 election. The threats included revoking security clearances, restricting access to federal buildings and terminating government contracts. Many firms negotiated settlements that involved providing pro bono legal services aligned with Trump’s priorities.

The White House also hit elite universities with funding freezes totalling more than $5bn in federal grants and contracts, often linked to investigations into alleged antisemitism; diversity, equity and inclusion practices; or perceived liberal biases. This led many to negotiate financial settlements, policy changes and oversight concessions to restore funding. Harvard was a notable holdout.

Steele commented: “Once you beholden yourself to a bully, you will always be bullied. It’s not a complicated narrative. In that regard, I’m not surprised by the ultimate outcome but I am surprised at the speed with which we’ve gotten there. Literally within six months of taking the oath of office, Donald Trump had pretty much slapped the crap out of everything and everyone he could and instead of fighting back they cowered in a corner.”

As Trump’s first year wore on, there were signs of dissenters finding their footing. Millions of people took to the streets in No Kings protests. Disney reinstated ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after its decision to suspend him over comments about Charlie Kirk was met with criticism from unions, free speech advocates and some Republicans, as well as millions of cancelled subscriptions.

But Steele cautioned that, even if 79-year-old Trump’s pace slows in his second year in office, his allies are eager to maintain the moment. “I guess at a certain point an old man will run out of steam, but he’s got enough other engines around him in [Steve] Bannon and [Stephen] Miller and [Kash] Patel and the like that they will keep things going.

“They know what he wants. They have bought into his diktats. They see themselves benefiting directly and indirectly from everything that is happening so they will continue to pursue those agendas.”

Steele grew up Washington DC, studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and spent three years as a seminarian in the Order of St Augustine in preparation for the priesthood. He joined the Republican party in 1976 and became the first Black person elected to statewide office in Maryland, serving as lieutenant governor from 2003 to 2007.

Steele was elected chair of the RNC 10 days after Barack Obama was sworn in as the US’s first Black president in 2009. He oversaw major gains for the party in Congress, governor’s mansions and state legislatures in the 2010 midterm elections but lost the chairmanship to Reince Priebus the following year.

Steele opposed Trump from the start and had a spell at the Lincoln Project, a group formed by anti-Trump Republicans, while also pursuing a media career. He became a pundit then a presenter on MSNBC, recently rebranded MS NOW, where since last May he has co-hosted The Weeknight with Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend.

He remains a pungent critic of the president. When, for example, the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington was rebranded the “Trump-Kennedy Center”, Steele posted on social media: “So pathetic. Such a lonely, desperate cry for acceptance. A craving not even his family can satisfy – he has to appropriate another family’s legacy.”

He voted for Democrats Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024 but has not quit his party, describing himself as a “Motel 6 Republican” who has to “leave the lights on” in the hope the party will find its way back to its principles. When that day comes, he hopes, the legions of Trump enablers who indulged his autocratic tendencies will face a reckoning.

Steele said: “For me the most important conversation Democrats and independents and like-minded Republicans like myself need to be having is: are we prepared to hold every last one of these folks accountable? You may be doing Donald Trump’s bidding but, at a certain point, Donald Trump will no longer be president and you will be exposed.”

He continued: “That, to me, is the next big piece in conversations going into the ’26 cycle: why the Democrats need to take the Congress, why the Democrats are in a position to make the Senate competitive. A lot more Americans are going to align themselves with demanding some level of accountability and wanting that process to unfold.

“It’s not impeachment of the president, because we’ve done that twice and failed. But individuals in their capacities as secretaries and administrators and directors and advisers can be held accountable and must be held accountable.”

With Trump sinking in the polls, Steele believes that Democrats should be looking to pick up a minimum of 30 to 35 seats in November’s midterm elections for the House of Representatives. “There are a lot of similar similarities to what I saw on the political landscape in 2010 that will be relevant some 16 years later in 2026 that can give you a very good indicator of how things could play out.”

The former Republican chair noted the Democrats’ run of successes in elections in 2025, including the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and Proposition 50 in California, which allows the use of new congressional districts drawn to benefit Democrats in an effort to counter redraws by Republicans in Texas and other states.

“All of these are very important indicators for Democrats that are signals from the American voter about how they’re looking at these things,” he said. “And how they are going to respond.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7bc97367a76a66e6f1de24990bb811ba9499e3/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce899d4e2a1fe6b36e1720786c16a595",N,,2026-01-11 20:56:35.663658

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Federal agents carrying out immigration arrests in Minnesota’s Twin Cities region already shaken by the fatal shooting of a woman rammed the door of one home Sunday and pushed their way inside, part of what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation ever.

In a dramatic scene similar to those playing out across Minneapolis, agents captured a man in the home just minutes after pepper spraying protesters outside who had confronted the heavily-armed federal agents. Along the residential street, protesters honked car horns, banged on drums and blew whistles in attempts to disrupt the operation.

Video of the clash showed some agents pushing back protesters while a distraught woman later emerged from the house with a document that federal agents presented to arrest the man. Signed by an immigration officer, the document — unlike a warrant signed by a judge — does not authorize forced entry into a private residence. A warrant signed by an immigration officer only authorizes arrest in a public area.

Immigrant advocacy groups have done extensive “know-your-rights” campaigns urging people not to open their doors unless agents have a court order signed by a judge.

But within minutes of ramming the door in a neighborhood filled with single-family homes, the handcuffed man was led away and soon gone.

More than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

Minneapolis still tense after Renee Good shooting

The Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — is bracing for what is next after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer Wednesday.

“We’re seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighborhoods,” said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city councilmember. “They’ve definitely been out here.”

Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents an area with a growing immigrant population, said he is closely monitoring information from chat groups about where residents are seeing agents operating.

People holding whistles positioned themselves in freezing temperatures on street corners Sunday in the neighborhood where Good was killed, watching for any signs of federal agents.

More than 20,000 people have taken part in a variety of trainings to become “observers” of enforcement activities in Minnesota since the 2024 election, said Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos MN, a local human rights organization .

“It’s a role that people choose to take on voluntarily, because they choose to look out for their neighbors,” Argueta said.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but residents remained anxious. On Monday, Minneapolis public schools will start offering remote learning for the next month in response to concerns that children might feel unsafe venturing out while tensions remain high.

Many schools closed last week after Good’s shooting and the upheaval that followed.

Questions about who should handle investigation

While the enforcement activity continues, two of the state’s leading Democrats said that the investigation into Good’s shooting death should not be overseen solely by the federal government.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in separate interviews Sunday that state authorities should be included in the investigation because the federal government has already made clear what it believes happened.

“How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation, without prejudice, when at the beginning of that investigation they have already announced exactly what they saw — what they think happened,” Smith said on ABC’s “This Week.”

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, defended the officer on Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

“That law enforcement officer had milliseconds, if not short time to make a decision to save his life and his other fellow agents,” he said.

Lyons also said the administration’s enforcement operations in Minnesota wouldn’t be needed “if local jurisdictions worked with us to turn over these criminally illegal aliens once they are already considered a public safety threat by the locals.”

The killing of Good by an ICE officer and the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, led to dozens of protests across the country over the weekend.

Thousands of people marched Saturday in Minneapolis, where Homeland Security called its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation.

UNHCR OBSERVATIONS ON RESTORING ORDER AND CONTROL: A STATEMENT ON THE UK GOVERNMENT'S ASYLUM AND RETURNS POLICY

31 December 2025

I. INTRODUCTION

1. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ('UNHCR') provides these comments in response to the United Kingdom (UK) Government's recently announced asylum reforms 'Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government's asylum and returns policy' ('the Asylum Statement'). Noting that there will be further details announced in relation to these reforms in the coming months, these comments consider the Government's proposals as set out in the Asylum Statement and offer initial observations to inform consideration and discussions around asylum reform in the UK. Given the wide-ranging nature of the proposals, these observations focus on the matters of greatest relevance to UNHCR's mandate, and do not seek to address every aspect of the Asylum Statement.

2. UNHCR offers these comments pursuant to its supervisory role for international refugee law, as the agency entrusted by the United Nations General Assembly with the responsibility for providing international protection to refugees and other persons within its mandate, and for assisting governments in seeking permanent solutions for refugees. [1]

3. The United Kingdom is a Contracting Party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (together, ""the Refugee Convention"") [2], as well as the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Statelessness Convention (together, ""the Statelessness Conventions"") [3]. Through accession to these instruments, the United Kingdom has assumed international legal obligations in relation to refugees, asylum-seekers, and stateless persons in accordance with their provisions.

II. OVERVIEW

4. UNHCR welcomes the Government's commitment to maintaining the UK's strong tradition of providing sanctuary and safety to people fleeing conflict and persecution, while ensuring well-managed borders - noting that these are compatible and mutually-reinforcing goals. In particular, we welcome the express commitment in the Asylum Statement to the principle of non-refoulement – a binding international norm reflected in the Refugee Convention, other international instruments and international customary law.

5. UNHCR also shares the Government's concern regarding the dangerous journeys undertaken by refugees and migrants, the abuses perpetrated by smugglers and gangs, and the challenges that these mixed movements present. We note that there is strong support among the UK public for receiving and hosting refugees but also that concerns persist regarding a perceived lack of control, particularly in view of the salience of irregular arrivals across the Channel and pressures on asylum accommodation and support. We also recognise the importance of sustaining public confidence as an essential underpinning of a successful asylum system; as well as the need to effectively return people not in need of international protection. In our Recommendations to the Government of the United Kingdom, issued in July 2024, we shared a number of proposed measures, noting in particular that fair, efficient asylum systems are essential to swiftly identify refugees and provide the protection they need. These should be coupled with well-managed migration pathways that alleviate pressure on asylum systems - often used by those seeking to move for economic reasons - with mechanisms that ensure the swift return of individuals who are found not to have valid claims. We note the progress made in this regard and will continue to support these efforts.

6. UNHCR notes that much of the Asylum Statement sets out high level policy goals, the substance of which will now need to be elaborated in detail – some through legislation and some through policy and operational guidance. We will engage closely as these are developed with the aim of ensuring that changes are elaborated and implemented in line with the Refugee Convention, also bringing to bear UNHCR's expertise in the drivers of refugee flows, potential solutions, and on additional policy options beyond those set out the statement.

7. The Statement consists of proposals to i) reduce arrivals; ii) increase removals; and iii) provide safe and legal routes. With respect to the first of these – reducing arrivals – we note with concern the emphasis on restricting the status and entitlements of those who have been determined to be refugees – especially (but not only) those on the 'core protection' offer. Refugees are not migrants. They are people fleeing conflict, instability and human rights abuses - circumstances no one would willingly choose. For those whose claims are assessed in the UK, and who are found to be refugees, UNHCR urges that they be given a stable status that allows them to rebuild their lives and reunite with their families, while a long-term, durable solution is sought. For some, this will be a return home when circumstances allow. But in view of the protracted nature of many of today's conflicts, and the persistence of repressive regimes, for many, it entails the hard reality of building a future elsewhere.

8. Early investment in refugee integration is in everyone's interest. UNHCR supports approaches that help refugees rebuild their lives in safety and contribute to their new communities. In contrast, short-term stay arrangements subject to regular review, prolonged pathways to settlement and naturalisation, and stringent limitations on refugee family reunion often create prolonged uncertainty and despair, undermining integration and social cohesion. Such arrangements can be complex and costly to administer and evidence of an impact on refugee decision-making as to where asylum is sought is weak at best.

9. With respect to increasing removals, UNHCR supports the prompt return of those found to have no international protection needs nor other legal basis to stay. We also encourage the UK to continue to work with European and other partners on cooperative arrangements to effectively manage irregular arrivals while sharing responsibility for refugees and upholding international protection. With the right safeguards in place, this may include lawful transfers of some asylum-seekers to other countries, including through mechanisms like the France-UK 'one-in, one-out' arrangement.

10. UNHCR welcomes the Government's commitment to safe, regular routes for refugees to be welcomed to the UK, drawing on the experience of the UK Resettlement Scheme and initiatives for Syrians, Ukrainians and Afghans. Such pathways provide a lifeline for refugees unable to live safely or realize their potential where they are and are a means of sharing responsibility with countries hosting most of the world's refugees. If accessible and realized at scale, they can provide managed alternatives to dangerous, irregular journeys. This work should be rooted in wider cooperation with European and other governments 'upstream' in large refugee-hosting and transit countries to help provide real alternatives to dangerous onward journeys and stabilize movements by strengthening rights, lawful stay and work opportunities.

11. In a time of unprecedented global displacement, empathy, efficiency, responsibility-sharing and international cooperation are essential to protect forcibly displaced people, with measures that work for both states and refugees. UNHCR stands ready to continue working closely with the UK Government to ensure a managed, shared approach to forced displacement that maintains access to asylum, upholds rights and promotes social cohesion.

III. COMMENT ON A NEW 'CORE PROTECTION' OFFER FOR REFUGEES: SHORTENED LEAVE, RESTRICTIONS ON FAMILY REUNION AND A LONGER PATH TO SETTLEMENT

12. The first section of the Asylum Statement sets out a wide-ranging set of changes to the type of protection the UK offers to refugees and other people in need of international protection – that is, people the UK has found to be at risk of serious harm if they were to return to their country of origin. The primary objective of these changes is deterrence, with the goal to reduce arrivals by making the UK a less desirable place to seek sanctuary. Changes include shortened leave to remain, a new 'work and study' visa, new requirements on family reunion and a longer path to settlement.

Shortened leave to remain

13. UNHCR notes with concern the Government's plans to reduce the duration of leave granted to individuals in need of international protection to 30 months. Such a change would place additional administrative and costly burdens on the asylum system, create greater uncertainty for refugees and negatively affect integration and social cohesion.

14. Currently refugees and others in need of international protection are granted five years leave and can then apply for indefinite leave (settlement) if they can show that they continue to need international protection. Under the proposed changes, the Government will instead introduce what it calls a 'core protection' offer whereby refugees will be given 30 months leave to remain in the UK that can be renewed where it is determined that they are still in need of international protection. On the 'core protection' offer, refugees will not have automatic rights to family reunion and will be required to wait 20 years before they can apply for settlement.

15. UNHCR has long advocated that refugees and others in need of international protection are provided with a secure and stable protection status that is not subject to constant review. [4] That is not to say however, that refugee protection, once accorded, can never come to an end. As set out in the Refugee Convention, refugee status is, by its nature, temporary, as it may be ceased in certain circumstances, including when the conditions that led to a person being recognised as a refugee no longer exist (see Articles 1C(5) and 1C(6) of the Refugee Convention). [5] However, while some refugees may be able to return to their country of origin in the future, and many strongly wish to do so, it was not intended that refugees would be subject to constant review of their status. Nor is there evidence that a frequent review of status accelerates returns. Based on UNHCR's observations of comparable protection-status review procedures in other States, international protection is in practice withdrawn from only a small number of individuals following a careful assessment of whether the grounds for protection continue to apply. [6] Regrettably, the protracted nature of displacement and conflict means that for many refugees, international protection needs persist as persecution and violence continue for years, and the prospect of returning to their country of origin is limited, particularly in the short term.

16. Providing refugees with only 30 months of leave at a time is likely to be detrimental to refugees' sense of security, belonging and stability, factors critical to positive engagement and participation in society. Status of such a temporary nature may impact on a person's ability to find housing, seek employment, learn English and develop skills, and risks undermining the Government's intention to enhance refugees' ability to contribute to their new communities.

17. Additionally, a temporary protection model that requires regular review of status is likely to impose overwhelming and unnecessary financial and administrative burden on the Home Office. A person who remains on the 'core protection' route will have had their refugee status reassessed eight times in 20 years before they can be eligible for settlement. Considering the recurrent challenge of backlogs and the significant resources the Government has invested to speed up the processing of claims, adding further labour-intensive assessments into the process risks undermining this progress. Home Office resources should be concentrated on assessing only cases where there are strong reasons to believe protection status may no longer be required.

18. While the Government has pointed to the Danish example to cite the benefits of temporary protection, it should also be noted that in 2023, the Australian Government abolished temporary protection visas for refugees after they concluded that it made ""no sense – economically or socially"" to keep people in limbo. [7] A report produced by the University of New South Wales highlights the financial and administrative costs of such a policy: ""The reassessment of protection claims imposes a significant financial and administrative burden on government, especially since the necessity for protection will remain in most cases. One study estimated the costs of reprocessing protection claims to be at least $300 million. A person whose visa is refused may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. Since many are self-represented on account of cuts to legal aid, and may have limited English, they consume a great deal of time of the court staff, government lawyers, and judges. [8]

19. Considering the negative impacts on refugees and the considerable resources involved in recurring reassessment, UNHCR advises that a review of status (cessation proceedings) should only be initiated where a high threshold of credible and detailed evidence is met that indicates a fundamental and durable change in the country of origin so as to conclude that the circumstances in connection with which the person has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist. UNHCR recalls that the test for whether refugee status should cease is not whether a person has a well-founded fear of persecution and does not involve an assessment of the claim de novo. Refugee status can only be ended where certain requirements are fulfilled, such as a fundamental and durable change in the conditions that led to the refugee's fear of persecution (the 'changed circumstances' as provided for by Articles 1C(5) and 1C(6) of the Refugee Convention). This distinct inquiry requires an assessment of the fundamental nature and durability of the change in circumstances in a person's country of origin, such that the circumstances which previously gave rise to a person's recognition as a refugee have ceased or no longer exist.

A longer route to Settlement

20. Refugees on the 'core protection' route will also be required to wait 20 years until they are eligible to apply for settlement, [9] with the requirement that they be found to be in continuing need of protection at 30-month intervals throughout this period.

21. The Government's proposal to extend the qualifying period for settlement to 20 years—double the time required for migrants—raises significant concerns, particularly when considered alongside changes made earlier this year to prevent refugees who have made a dangerous journey or arrived illegally in the UK from ever accessing citizenship. It is also important to consider in light of the Government position that ""refugees will never be in a better position than those coming to the UK on recognised migration routes (such as workers), who are subject to the usual standard settlement qualifying period of 10 years."" [10]

22. While the Refugee Convention does not specifically confer a right to permanent residence or citizenship, Article 34 calls on States as far as possible to facilitate the integration and naturalisation of refugees and ""in particular make every effort to expedite naturalisation proceedings"". In essence, Article 34, in addition to encouraging States to expedite naturalisation proceedings for refugees, asks that any bar to naturalisation has a good-faith justification. An excessively long period of residence before becoming eligible to settle and access naturalisation proceedings would be at variance with Article 34.

23. A more expeditious route to settlement for refugees than for migrants is objectively justified. Refugees, unlike migrants, lack the protection of their country of origin and citizenship rights. Recognising these unique challenges, the UNHCR Statute mandates cooperation with States to achieve such solutions, with local integration being one. UNHCR's Executive Committee, of which the UK is a member, has further urged States with developed asylum systems to support integration through the timely grant of secure legal status, residency rights, and, where possible, naturalisation. [11]

24. While there may be limited pathways for refugees on the 'work and study' route to settle sooner than those on the 'core protection' route (although this is still likely to be a minimum ten year wait, these are to be based on the concept of 'earned' settlement, whereby a person will be able to reduce the wait time for settlement where they can evidence financial independence, language ability or contributions to the UK. UNHCR calls on the Government to ensure that future settlement policies recognise the unique circumstances of refugees and promotes the full social inclusion of people who cannot, unlike others, return home.

Restrictions on Family Reunion

25. Family unity is a universally acknowledged principle and was expressly acknowledged by the Act of the United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries at which the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was adopted. [12] The right to family life is also reflected in other international and regional human rights instruments, including the European Convention on Human Rights. [13]

26. Ensuring family life and the principle of family unity may require a State to allow a family unit to be restored through family reunification. [14] UNHCR notes with concern that it is not clear that individuals on the 'core protection' offer will have access to family reunion at all. Furthermore, while the Government has indicated its intention to create a new 'work and study' visa to which refugees could apply, on which they would be granted family reunion rights, it appears that the Government is considering applying the same family reunion criteria imposed on migrants and UK citizens. Under the current Immigration Rules, these conditions include a minimum annual income requirement of £29,000, proof of suitable accommodation, and an elementary level of English for applicants, which are likely to present insurmountable barriers for many refugees, including those on a 'work and study' route. In fact, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has found a broad consensus at the international and European level on the need for refugees to benefit from a more favourable family reunification regime than other foreigners. [15]

27. The proposed changes to family reunion build on the May 2025 Immigration White Paper, in which the UK Government outlined proposals to restrict family migration, including refugee family reunion. Key measures under consideration included introducing an income or maintenance threshold and language requirements. In September 2025, the refugee family reunion route was suspended for new applications.

28. Family reunion was one of the few pathways that remained accessible to refugees and enabled people at risk to travel to the UK through a safe, regular route. It primarily benefitted women and children, was not nationality-specific and, unlike other pathways such as resettlement, was rights-based. Until it was paused, the route mostly benefitted applicants from countries experiencing instability, active conflict or where women and children are at particular risk, including Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea and Syria.

29. Further eligibility restrictions on the family reunion pathway would risk more people, particularly women and children, feeling compelled to embark on dangerous journeys, either at the same time as the men who might previously have sponsored them, or to join them afterwards. This risk has been recognised by the Council for Europe, [16] among others, and has been borne out in Australia, where the abolition of family reunion rights for holders of 'Temporary Protection Visas' was followed by a threefold increase in the percentage of refugees trying to reach Australia who were women and children. [17]

30. Family reunion is also key to ensuring that refugees can rebuild their lives and integrate in new communities, contributing to social cohesion. The absence of family members, and anxiety over their safety, has been shown to negatively impact a refugee's ability to form meaningful social connections in their country of asylum and engage in key activities such as language classes and vocational opportunities, [18] whereas reunification with family is key in promoting recovery from traumatic experiences and generally facilitating smoother, more rapid integration of refugees. [19] The presence of family also enables entry points for refugees to connect with the wider community through schools, workplaces, playgrounds and other institutions and community spaces.

31. Denying refugees on the 'core protection' route the possibility of family reunification would have profound and harmful effects and would fall short of the UK's obligation to take all reasonable steps to ensure refugees can realise their right to family life. For people unable to meet the as-yet-undefined requirements to move onto the 'work and study' route, they will only become eligible for family reunification once they apply for settlement after 20 years (although they would need to meet the same eligibility requirements for family reunion as settled migrants, which will be unachievable for some). Unlike migrants, refugees cannot return to their country of origin, and face very limited admission possibilities in most major refugee-hosting States, meaning that those who remain on the 'core protection' route are likely to be separated from their families for an extremely long period of time.

32. UNHCR also wishes to draw attention to the right to family life for children, as specifically protected under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. [20] UNHCR urges consideration of the situation and rights of children who remain behind in countries of origin or asylum and the heightened child protection risks that arise from prolonged family separation. [21] Children's psychological and physical wellbeing can be significantly impacted by the extended absence of one or both parents. Among the most at-risk are children who are unaccompanied or separated from other family members. Children are particularly vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and trafficking when they lack the support and protection of their family members. [22] They may also be more compelled to embark on a dangerous, irregular journey in the hope of reuniting with their family.

33. In the last year, over 11,600 children were granted family reunion to the UK, comprising 56% of all visa-holders on this route. The introduction of requirements such as financial thresholds or application fees may force families to make a selection among qualifying family members and could result in one or more children being left behind, ultimately prolonging the profoundly negative impact on children's wellbeing associated with split families. [23]

34. While UNHCR notes that people on the 'work and study' route may be able to sponsor family members, it is unlikely that all refugees will meet the requirements of this new visa, thus creating a risk of a two-tier system of refugee rights. There are likely to be factors beyond the control of the refugee that may inhibit their ability to transfer out of the 'core protection' route and to subsequently meet income or accommodation thresholds for family reunification. These include long-term illness or disability affecting work capacity, gender norms within families, care giving responsibilities, regional disparities in access to employment or education opportunities, such as admissions into college and English language courses and prolonged periods out of work during the asylum process.

35. The opportunity for refugees to be reunited with family should not be contingent on whether they are employed or studying, as refugees often have no other option to be reunited with their family members other than in the country of asylum. Further, the creation of two different classes of recognised refugees with varying access to family reunion has no basis in international human rights law. The European Court of Human Rights affirmed, in the context of differential family reunification entitlements across analogous forms of leave, that the protection conferred by the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is not limited to innate or inherent characteristics, but also extends to an individual's immigration status. Unless the Government can provide an ""objective and reasonable justification"" for treating refugees with 'core protection' differently from those who have transferred to a 'work and study' visa, such an approach may risk amounting to a breach of Article 14 ECHR read in conjunction with Article 8 ECHR. [24]

IV. INCREASING REMOVALS

36. The Government has outlined a range of measures aimed at increasing the removal of failed asylum-seekers and other migrants with no right to remain from the UK. UNHCR takes this opportunity to comment specifically on the plans to scale up removals of people whose claims have failed and the use of returns hubs.

37. The safe and dignified return of failed asylum-seekers is a cornerstone of a well-functioning asylum system. This is important to maintain public confidence in the integrity of asylum systems and to tackle irregular migration. Effective returns can support the functioning of asylum systems and contribute to addressing challenges posed by irregular migration, while upholding the principle of non-refoulement and other human rights.

38. UNHCR acknowledges the ongoing efforts of the Government to increase returns. However, key challenges remain, including delays in asylum decision making which can lead to long-term stay and disincentivise voluntary return, difficulty securing readmission agreements with countries of origin and lack of bilateral relations in some cases, as well as delays with documentation and other travel formalities. UNHCR recognises that a range of interventions are necessary to address the obstacles to effecting return and is ready to support these interventions on a good offices basis provided that its involvement is not inconsistent with its humanitarian mandate to provide international protection to refugees.

Returns Hubs

39. In light of the increasing attention in some regions to the concept of return hubs and the role that these may play in supporting returns of people not in need of international protection, UNHCR has issued detailed guidance on the potential of return hubs and key considerations for States. [25] While there is no commonly agreed upon definition of a return hub, it generally refers to an arrangement between two or more States whereby third country nationals who have been found to have no right to reside in a State and who cannot immediately be returned to their country of origin, are instead sent (voluntarily or involuntarily) to a third country. The third country hosting the return hub would need to grant temporary legal stay pending onward voluntary or involuntary return to the country of origin.

40. UNHCR considers that return hubs can be appropriate for people not in need of international protection, provided that they are designed within certain parameters and in line with human rights standards. At the same time, UNHCR underlines that return hubs should only be considered as an option when direct return to the country of origin is not feasible within a reasonable period of time. In addition, in UNHCR's view, the goal of return hubs should be to provide a location for temporary stays to facilitate staged returns to the country of origin.

41. UNHCR advises that agreements on return hubs with third countries may only be concluded where the third country respects international human rights standards as a precondition. Further, the agreement or arrangement must set out modalities for onward return to the country of origin, and the consequences where this is not possible.

42. UNHCR welcomes the Government's ongoing engagement on this issue and remains committed to working with States and other stakeholders on the potential use of return hubs as part of comprehensive responses to address mixed movements and ensure the integrity of asylum systems is upheld.

Resuming removals to certain countries

43. The Asylum Statement sets out the Government's plans to explore enforced returns to countries where they have not routinely carried out such removals in recent years, including to Syria. The Asylum Statement further indicates the Government's intention to cease refugee status and return people to their country or origin ""should the regime change in their home country"", noting that ""If someone has fled the rule of one regime, but that regime has since been replaced, it must be possible to return them to that country.""

44. A change of regime or a similar significant shift in circumstances within a refugee's country of origin can create a critical opportunity for advancing peace and for refugees to begin returning home. However, such a change, on its own, is unlikely to be sufficient to determine that a person can safely return home. In the case of regime change, the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation must be given sufficient time to take hold and agreements with opposing groups carefully monitored. Also, in addition to physical security and safety, consideration should be given to whether there is a functioning government able to provide basic administrative services and administer a system of law and justice. [26]

45. Cessation of refugee status as a result of changed circumstances in the county of origin under Article 1C(5) of the Refugee Convention is only permissible where the changes are fundamental and durable, and where effective protection is available in the country of origin. [27] For a change to be considered fundamental in nature it must allow a person to re-avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of origin. Where a particular cause or fear of persecution has been identified, consideration must be given to whether those specific circumstances have ceased. With regard to whether the change is durable, it will generally take some time before it can be determined whether the change can be regarded as non-temporary. UNHCR's Guidelines on Cessation provide that ""a situation which has changed but continues to show signs of volatility is not by definition stable, and cannot be described as durable."" [28] The appropriate period of time will vary depending on the nature of the change, but where the changes in a country occur in a context of violence, unreconciled warring groups, ineffective governance and the absence of human rights guarantees, a longer waiting period will be necessary to confirm the durability of the change.

46. UNHCR calls on the Government to ensure that the cessation of status is conducted in line with its obligations under international law, ensuring that the principle of non-refoulement is upheld.

47. With regard to Syrian refugees, UNHCR does not consider that the requirements for cessation of refugee status have been met. The changed circumstances in Syria, that being the fall of the Assad regime and the formation of a provisional government, cannot currently be considered so fundamental and durable in nature to warrant cessation of refugee status. Further, UNHCR continues to advise against forced returns to Syria. [29] UNHCR will continue to assess this position as the situation evolves in Syria and will provide updated guidance as required.

48. In relation to enforced return of persons not in need of international protection, UNHCR reiterates that voluntary returns are the most effective, dignified, and sustainable option for return and should remain the preferred approach. UNHCR welcomes ongoing efforts by the Home Office to increase voluntary returns.

France – UK Pilot

49. As part of measures to increase returns, the Government has also indicated an ongoing commitment to the France-UK pilot. While not relating to the return of failed asylum-seekers, this pilot involves the UK returning to France asylum-seekers who crossed the Channel, while bringing an equal number of people to the UK through a managed application process. UNHCR supports the pilot's intention to provide an alternative to dangerous crossings and disrupt smuggling networks.

50. UNHCR has consistently noted the importance of regional cooperation to effectively manage mixed flows of refugees and migrants and enable good border management while providing access to international protection. UNHCR considers that, if appropriately implemented, the France-UK arrangement could contribute to a more managed and cooperative approach to migration, offering alternatives to dangerous journeys while safeguarding access to asylum.

51. In line with its mandate, UNHCR can play an important role in supporting the development and implementation of international agreements concerning the transfer of refugees and asylum-seekers. As such, UNHCR is committed to ongoing engagement with the UK and France aimed at helping ensure that such arrangements uphold international protection standards and are implemented in a way that can be effective at scale and can contribute to improved refugee protection and the rights-based management of refugee movements. In the UK, this includes monitoring activities at the Manston facility and in Immigration Removal centres with a focus on screening procedures for individuals being considered for the France-UK pilot, the provision of information to individuals who have been selected for the pilot and access to legal representation for those detained for the purpose of the pilot.

V. LEGAL REFORM

52. In addition to the above measure to increase removals, the Government has also set out reforms to the law and legal processes that are considered to make it more difficult to remove people not in need of international protection, including reform of the appeals system and possible changes to the way the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is interpreted.

53. The Asylum Statement also outlines further changes in relation to the treatment of unfounded asylum claims and late claims. These changes must be considered in light of the need to provide due process to refugees and ensure key safeguards are in place to prevent refoulement. UNHCR will consider these changes in greater detail as further information becomes available.

Creation of a new appeals body

54. The Government has outlined plans to set up a new appeals body with increased capacity to deal with asylum appeals. The new body, independent of the Home Office, is intended to allow for greater ability to prioritise and accelerate certain profiles and caseloads and to add surge capacity as needed. The Asylum Statement also makes reference to a 'single appeal route' noting that if an appeal is unsuccessful the claimant will be required to leave the UK.

55. UNHCR recognises the undesirability of lengthy backlogs in the appeals system and supports initiatives to speed up the hearing of appeals. With an ever-growing backlog at the First Tier Tribunal, there is a clear need to ensure that asylum appeals are determined more quickly, moving those in need of international protection towards integration more swiftly and discouraging unmeritorious asylum claims through rapid but fair refusals.

56. Given that the Tribunal currently overturns almost half of all asylum decisions, the need to ensure that the new body continues to provide a full review of first instance asylum decisions is critical in ensuring that the principle of non-refoulement is upheld. Further details are required to understand whether claimants will be able to seek leave to appeal a decision made by the new appeals body on a point of law, for example to the Upper Tribunal as is currently the case. While UNHCR recognises the need to reduce the appeals backlog, it advises against measures that seek to achieve quicker decisions by reducing procedural safeguards.

57. As the Government further develops how the new body will work, UNHCR takes this opportunity to reiterate that it should be established in compliance with international standards and core due process. A detailed list of these criteria can be found in the UNHCR Handbook for Parliamentarians – A guide to international refugee protection and building state asylum systems, 2017. [30] In particular, the following standards are necessary: the opportunity to present a claim in person; the provision of accessible, reliable, and high-quality government funded legal aid; allowing for a full and ex nunc examination of both facts and points of law; adequate time for claimants to seek legal advice and file representations, and appropriately trained decision makers.

VI. RESETTLEMENT AND COMPLEMENTARY PATHWAYS

58. UNHCR welcomes the commitments made by the UK Government in relation to resettlement of refugees identified by UNHCR as well as the expansion of complementary pathways, including routes for refugees to access higher education and employment opportunities. UNHCR has enjoyed a long-standing collaboration with the UK on resettlement, with 30,000 of the most at-risk refugees from across the world having relocated to the UK in the last decade, able to rebuild their lives in dignity via this crucial safe pathway.

59. Complementary pathways, including labour, education and named sponsorship programmes, present important opportunities to increase refugees' access to third-country solutions by leveraging engagement among communities, institutions and the wider public. Complementary pathways should follow a number of key protection principles including, but not limited to the following: [31]

a. Additionality principle: Complementary pathways are not intended to replace a core resettlement quota and should remain additional to protection-driven resettlement.

b. Access to protection: Complementary pathways should ensure that refugees' international protection needs are safeguarded.

c. Ensuring family unity: Family unity should be maintained as a key human rights principle.

d. Equality of access/non-discrimination: Complementary pathways should aim to establish refugees' equal access to work and study relocation opportunities through their inclusion in existing migration frameworks.

60. UNHCR also wishes to highlight that, while resettlement and complementary pathways can provide an alternative to irregular journeys when operated at scale, there is no ""right way"" for an individual to gain access to territory to seek international protection. Access to territory and fair, efficient asylum procedures for people fleeing war and persecution is one of the essential rights laid down in the Refugee Convention.

The marchers began at Powderhorn Park and passed by the site where Good was killed. The protest was part of over a 1,000 planned demonstrations against ICE across the nation this weekend.

Among the demonstrators was a group of Roosevelt High School students. Hours after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Border Patrol agents arrived at the high school and deployed tear gas as students were being dismissed.

“I want to be able to go to work and school without worrying that we are going to be attacked,” said junior Maria DeLong, who said she burst into tears watching a video of her favorite teachers being tackled by federal agents.

Fahad Mo, 26, is a Somali-American who grew up in Cedar-Riverside, which has a large Somali community. He’s part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, a newly formed group working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood from immigration officers.

“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” Mo said at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”

The Minnesota Somali community has been the focus of a targeted deportation campaign by the Trump administration since late November, even though the vast majority are citizens or legal residents.

Protests at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which federal immigration agents use as a base, has been more confrontational. Federal agents fired pepper balls at a small group of protesters at the Whipple Building at the same time as the much larger Powderhorn protest, CNN reported.

On Friday night, police arrested 30 people, who have since been released, for blocking streets and damaging property at a protest outside hotels in downtown Minneapolis where ICE agents are thought to be staying, the Star Tribune reported.

Over 10,000 new ICE agents armed with personal data harvested by private contractors are expected to deploy across the country in the coming months.","Protests against President Donald Trump and his waves of immigration enforcement actions in cities across the United States unfolded Saturday after a woman was killed and two people were injured in separate shootings by immigration officers this week.

The shootings in Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon, have sparked fierce debates across the nation. White House officials defended the agents’ actions, saying officers used their firearms in self-defense; prominent Democratic leaders have blasted the administration for its militarized deployment of immigration authorities and said they will move to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the shooting of Renee Nicole Good.

Protests in the days since a federal immigration officer killed Good have remained largely peaceful, despite incidents of property damage that led to arrests Friday night, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. In Washington, D.C., on Saturday afternoon, protests gathered with chants of “ICE must go now, Trump must go now” outside the White House. Demonstrators in downtown Los Angeles shut down lanes of traffic.

Over 1,000 protests were planned for Saturday and Sunday in cities and towns across the country in response to Trump’s polarizing domestic agenda. Cities including Indianapolis; Des Moines, Iowa; Marion, Ohio; Coachella, California; and many others participated in protests and marches.

Good, a 37-year-old mother, was shot and killed on Wednesday by Jonathan Ross, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal officer based in Minnesota. The shooting happened amid an immigration enforcement action. Noem said Good ""weaponized"" her SUV to run over Ross in an act of ""domestic terrorism."" Good’s supporters have defended the woman, saying she was turning her car away from, not toward, Ross.

Venezuelan nationals Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras were shot in Oregon on Jan. 8. Homeland Security officials said the pair attempted to run over immigration officers with their car and say both are involved with gang Tren de Aragua. Following skepticism around Noem’s characterization of Good’s death, local officials have called for an investigation.

The shootings are just the latest involving federal agents under the Trump administration’s new, aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. The president ran on a promise to enforce mass deportations and has deployed heavily-armed federal agents to cities to carry out his plans.

Hundreds protest in Eugene, Oregon: 'I find it all repulsive'

At least 300 demonstrators gathered to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Trump administration at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and Pearl Street on Jan. 10 in Eugene, Oregon.

Eugene residents who attended were outraged by Renee Nicole Good's death and the response from the Trump administration.

Glenn Mittermann, a lawyer and former professor at UO, said Good's death was one more instance that demonstrated the Trump administration's disregard for legality.

""As a lawyer, I find it all repulsive,"" Mittermann said. ""That's not the way law enforcement should act. For the most part, the police in Eugene, we have really good police officers here. They understand that, they behave in a responsible way. We need them. But the way ICE is behaving, it's not at all in line with decent police practice.""

""ICE Out for Good"" in Eugene drew attendees from across Lane County and the state.

Sine Gaylord, who lives in Newport, Oregon, was in town visiting friends and decided to join Saturday's protest.

""Being silent is the greatest assistance we can give to the oppressors,"" Gaylord said. ""To me, speaking out and being there is important. It let's people who are driving by know that they're not alone.""

Naples residents protest killing of Minneapolis woman by 'brute force'

Hundreds gathered at the Collier County Courthouse near Southwest Florida's downtown Naples, Florida, Saturday night Jan. 10 for an ""ICE Out For Good"" vigil.

At the Naples event attended heavily by 60-plus-year-olds, participants said they gathered to honor and humanize the lives taken by ICE while demanding for accountability, transparency and immediate investigation into this week's ICE killing in Minnesota. They wanted to create a space for grief, solidarity and collection action while strengthening local connections.

""This killing is part of a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity and abuse carried out by federal immigration enforcement agencies against members of our communities,"" said Cynthia Odierna, an organizer of the Naples event.

After the one-hour vigil, the participants then went on a peaceful, solemn walk with lights around Davis Boulevard and Tamiami Trail, where car horns seemed to blare on endlessly.

""Renee Nicole Good died this week unnecessarily ― by brute force,"" said the Rev. Tony Fisher, a speaker and the minister of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Greater Naples. ""She was trying to protect her neighbors.""

Protesters at federal building tell ICE agents: 'Quit your job'

Roughly 10 people were protesting at 5 p.m. Saturday outside the Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling in Minneapolis, where immigration hearings are commonly held.Protesters shouted, “Quit your job,” at ICE agents.Derek Torstenson, of Richfield, Minnesota, was among those in attendance. He said he’s not surprised to hear members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, including U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, were denied access to the building.“We are not surprised by ICE and the Trump administration,” Torstenson said.Craig told MS Now that she was unable to tour the building because it wasn’t funded by the Federal Appropriations Act.“If Trump and ICE Barbie think they can keep me from doing MY JOB to conduct oversight at federal detention centers like the one I was denied full access to today — they couldn’t be more wrong,” Craig posted on X.

CNN reported that at this location at mid-afternoon, after protesters threw snow and ice at vehicles leaving the facility, police ""fired pepper balls at a crowd of protesters outside."" According to CNN, several cars also blocked vehicles leaving the building.

LA protests shut down traffic

Marchers in downtown Los Angeles shut down lanes of traffic Saturday afternoon as they demonstrated against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Los Angeles Police Department issued several alerts of street closures due to the march. Los Angeles Metro, the county transportation agency, announced it would temporarily reroute buses due to ongoing protests.

In June, Los Angeles became a national hub for demonstrations against the Trump administration following sweeping immigration raids in the nation's second largest city. Federal buildings became sites of protests, including those resulting in protesters clashing with law enforcement.

President Donald Trump had a militarized response, including deploying National Guard troops, attempting to quell protests. A federal court ruled the deployment was ""unlawful.""

Minneapolis protesters take to the streets

Many in the Minneapolis protest left Powderhorn Park at 1:30 p.m. Saturday, heading west on East Lake Street.

Those marching chanted “F--- ICE, ICE out.”

Organized by the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, the march followed roughly 30 minutes of speakers who offered a consistent message: They want President Donald Trump to know Minneapolis supports its immigrant communities.

“I refuse to believe the lies that they're spreading about us, and we refuse to concede to their intimidation tactics, and concede our people power,” organizer Deiu Do said.

Do referenced the recent surge of ICE agents deployed to Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 agents were deployed to the state beginning Jan. 4.

“You don't ask for backups when you’re winning the fight,” Do said. “They are losing this fight.”

Several people with megaphones spoke from the bed of a pickup truck as the group marched down East Lake Avenue.

'Surreal' moment for neighbors living on block where Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot

At around 3 p.m. Saturday, protesters marched past the 3300 block of Portland Avenue, where Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Some stopped at the site as others continued.

Protesters chanted, “No hate, no fear, Immigrants are welcome here,” near the site.

Nori Donais and Wren Clinefelter, who live on the block, took part in the protest.

“Even though we've been in the middle of it, its always important to go to organized events and show up,” Donais said.

Clinefelter said ICE’s presence is noticeable in Minneapolis, and to have the shooting happen in front of their house feels “surreal.”

“We’ve been very aware of everything happening in our city with ice, and their presence has definitely been a looming shadow, but to have that happen, right outside of your house is obviously very different,” Clinefelter said.

Protesters have gathered at the shooting site since Wednesday, Jan. 7. Donais said protesters have been respectful of neighbors.

“I really want to point out just the kindness of the protesters and all the people that showed up here,” Donais said. “We had our trash cans used for the barricade, but they were labeled and brought back with as soon as it came down.”

Rep. IIhan Omar to Minneapolis crowd: 'We are being terrorized by Trump'

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, spoke to those marching in Minneapolis from the back of a pickup truck.

She said lessons learned from the Jan. 7 shooting of Renee Nicole Good will help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

“We are going to use every single lesson we are learning today to make sure no community gets terrorized like we are being terrorized by Trump,” Omar said.

While Republicans have control of Congress and the presidency, Omar said, that won’t be the case forever.

""They might have the House majority, they might have the Senate majority, they might have the presidency today, but we live in a democracy,” Omar said. “We are going to show all of them the door out.”

'We've had enough,' say protesters at Coachella in California

A crowd of more than 150 gathered Saturday in the Riverside County city of Coachella to protest the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mom and poet Renee Nicole Good by an ICE enforcement officer in Minneapolis.

Demonstrators waved signs, chanted in English and Spanish and danced to music from portable speakers. The protest remained peaceful, with no visible police presence; passing drivers honked in support.

“We’ve had enough,” said Gabby Armenta of Comite Latino, the nonprofit that organized the event. “ICE is terrorizing our communities. People are afraid to leave their homes.”

ICE activity in the Coachella Valley has surged since mid-December, echoing enforcement campaigns last summer. Protesters cited fear and frustration: “I need to do something besides vote,” said Django Valledor of La Quinta, who sometimes monitors Home Depot lots to protect undocumented workers.

Participants traveled from across the valley, some from Palm Springs and Cathedral City. Yasmin Espinoza, whose grandmother was deported despite being born in Arizona, now carries her passport everywhere. “It’s horrifying that teenagers feel they have to protect their parents,” she said. “We’re living with a 1950s mindset in the 21st century.”

California's Coachella Valley includes cities such as Palm Springs, Indio, Palm Desert, and Coachella and is home to nearly 190,000 residents across 304 square miles. The valley has a predominantly Hispanic population. Seasonal tourism and agriculture shape its economy.

In snow, Iowa residents decry ICE, mourn killing

Snow drifted down on hundreds of residents in Des Moines, Iowa, gathered to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the killing of a Minnesota woman.

Despite the cold, over 200 people rallied Saturday at Evelyn K. Davis Park holding signs such as ""There's NO Iowa nice for ICE,"" ""No ICE!"" and ""It is best when ICE is crushed!""

The Rev. Luke Stringer, a pastor at Des Moines' Plymouth Church, led gatherers in prayer to remember Renee Nicole Good. ""We feel the ache of our sister's death,"" Stringer said to a silent crowd.

Hannah Davis, 34, of Winterset, said she traveled with Austin Hill, 33, to the Iowa capital because “there are so many (who) we’re worried about,” as state officials are welcoming ICE agents into the state. “I haven’t seen a lot of (ICE activity) in Des Moines, but I know it’s happening,” Davis said.

Hundreds attend rainy Ohio protest

Zack Dygart stood on the side of North High Street in Clintonville, Ohio, rain pelting him as he held a sign that said ""Abolish ICE.""

The 32-year-old Worthington resident and about 500 others stood outside on a rainy Saturday afternoon in the name of empathy.

""I want people to have more empathy. ... Our country is built on immigrants. It comes back to empathy and caring for our neighbors and making sure everyone has a good quality of life,"" Dygart said, while wearing a shirt reading ""Immigrants Make America Great."" ""They're people. Borders mean less to me than people.""

'You have to do something,' says 70-year-old Ohio protester

At a protest that drew dozens out in the rain in Marion, Ohio, Cindy Cooper, 70, said she's never been more fearful of a presidential administration. She participated in the Women's March in Washington, D.C., in 2017, but she said the political climate has only become ""uglier and more violent."" After watching video of Good being shot, she decided to join the protest.

“I would be ashamed not to be here,"" Cooper said. ""You can't watch what happened and sit in your nice, little warm house and say 'ain't that a shame.' You have to do something.""

Another protester, Terence Hero, was horrified by the videos of the shooting. Hero has protested since the Vietnam War and he said he's never seen the country more divided than it is today.

""It's always just been a matter of you can't just accept what authority says and just go with it and not question,"" Hero said. ""Our country was founded on people that questioned authority.""

How the protests were organized

Many of this weekend's protests were already in the works before well known organizing groups got involved Jan 8.

The infrastructure that national organizing groups have built over the last year made it possible to organize nationwide protests against ICE in a matter of days, said Sarah Parker, a 50501 National Partner and Executive Director of Voices of Florida Fund.

“I can't think of a time in the last year that we were able to respond as quickly, as big and as organized,” she told USA TODAY.

Throughout 2025, national organizing groups worked to build a network of hundreds of thousands of activists engaged in their communities and civic life.

That included training local activists to respond independently to moments that resonated in their community and hold protests without needing prompting from national groups.

Minnesota officials: ‘keep ICE away’ from schools, leave state immediately

Minnesota state senators on Saturday called on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stay away from schools and students, and to leave the state immediately.

Four Democratic-Farm-Labor Party lawmakers who chair state Senate education committees cited Minneapolis Public Schools canceling classes and extracurricular activities last week after federal agents reportedly clashed with students and staff during Roosevelt High School’s dismissal on Wednesday. Agents allegedly tear-gassed staff and students and handcuffed two staff members, Minnesota Public Radio reported.

“We demand that the Department of Homeland Security keep ICE away from Minnesota schools, and leave our state immediately,” state senators Mary Kunesh, Steve Cwodzinski, Heather Gustafson and Erin Maye Quade said in a joint statement. “The presence of masked federal agents is not making our state safer. Rather, they are heightening tensions and creating fear, panic, and anxiety among our residents. Our students need to be in safe learning spaces, not worrying about being pepper sprayed on their way home from school.”

On Thursday, Gov. Tim Walz said that there was an incident with ICE agents entering a school, ""causing disruptions.""

""I beg you, I implore you to tell them to stay out of our schools. This tragedy will be magnified 100-fold if this fight moves to the hallways of our public schools amongst our youth,"" Walz said in a message to elected representatives from both political parties.

‘It’s not normal.’ Brief protest against ICE in Indianapolis

Roughly 200 protesters lined up along an Indianapolis street on Saturday afternoon to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions.

In Indiana’s capital, demonstrators chanted, ""this is what democracy looks like,” hoisting signs as vehicles drove by on East 86th Street. Some drivers honked in support.

“Since President Trump took office for his second term, it’s not normal and we can’t be conditioned anymore,” Peter Moore, a 48-year-old Carmel, Indiana, resident, told IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network. “The more we protest, the more of an effect we’re going to gradually have.”

Face full extent of the law if you ‘lay a finger’ on feds, DHS warns

As protests are expected to ramp up Saturday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a stern warning.

“Reminder: if you lay a finger on a federal officer or agent, you will face the full extent of the law,” DHS said in an X post.

Federal officials have said agents, including those part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, are seeing increases in assaults and threats against them.

DHS has faced scrutiny for aggressive tactics in immigration enforcement and against protesters across several American cities.

On Saturday, DHS said Border Patrol agents arrested four people on suspicion of assaulting law enforcement on Wednesday in Minneapolis. ""Welcome to the Find Out stage,"" DHS said in an X post. The agency didn't list additional details of the people arrested.

Minneapolis mayor urges protesters to remain peaceful

The vast majority of demonstrations in Minneapolis have been peaceful so far, Mayor Jacob Frey said, urging protesters who plan to go out on Saturday not to “take the bait” and escalate conditions.

Frey said an incident Friday night that led to property damage at an area hotel and confrontation with police officers was an outlier to the largely peaceful events in recent days. He said some ""agitators"" have attempted to stir up the protests. There was about $6,000 in damage done to windows and from graffiti at the Depot Renaissance Hotel, the city of Minneapolis said in a news release.

“We are a safe city. We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos here,” Frey said. “And to the few that have caused damage to property and/or harm to others, we need to be very clear we’re not going to let that happen. If you cause damage to property or put others in danger, you’re going to be arrested.”

ICE detained a driver, left car rolling down road, mayor says

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said ICE actions in the city have turned “reckless,” giving an example of a what he described as a safety hazard in a city street.

Frey said ICE agents detained a driver and left their vehicle in the street without ensuring it was placed into park first, which he said “could have hit anybody.”

""You’ve got this vehicle that is just rolling down the street with nobody in it,” Frey said at a news conference Saturday. “This is not about safety. If this was about safety, you wouldn’t do stupid things like that.”

Police Chief Brian O'Hara said officers have had to respond to multiple arrests of drivers to tow the cars left in the road, including one case with a dog left alone in a car that required a response from animal control.

Americans increasingly disapprove of ICE actions, polling shows

Americans increasingly disapprove of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and back protests against the federal agency, recent polling shows.

A YouGov poll, conducted Jan. 7 of 2,686 American adults, showed most disapprove of how ICE is handling its job, including 40% with strong disapproval. Fifty-one percent of respondents said ICE’s tactics were too forceful, while 27% said tactics were “about right.”

Meanwhile, 44% approved of recent protests against ICE actions, compared to 42% who disapproved of protests.

The YouGov poll was taken the same day ICE agent Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, during an immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis. Protests have erupted in American cities since.

Last February, just after President Donald Trump took office on a promise to dramatically increase immigration enforcement, a YouGov poll showed ICE had a net favorability of 16 percentage points.

Fears among Phoenix’s Native population about ICE

With more ICE agents surging into Phoenix — and now empowered to racially profile under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling — urban Indigenous populations have growing fears about enforcement tactics.

Incidents have already shown federal agents apprehending Native Americans in a dragnet to apprehend suspected undocumented immigrants in President Donald Trump’s first year. Near Minneapolis, agents reportedly forcibly took a Native American man into custody on Jan. 8, even after video showed him complying and saying he was Indigenous and an American citizen. The same day, four homeless tribal men in Minneapolis were also detained, Frank Star Comes Out, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, said on social media.

Phoenix is the third-largest U.S. city for Native Americans, with about 65,000 Indigenous residents. Over 50,000 people are Navajo, according to a Navajo Epidemiology Center report. Last January, Navajo leaders advised citizens to carry their Certificate of Indian Blood or tribal identification card. However, Navajo officials have raised concerns that federal agents haven’t consistently recognized these documents as valid and could still detain tribal members.

“Indigenous people are the first people of this country,” Navajo Speaker Crystalyne Curley said. “Unfortunately, our communities have long endured the consequences of federal policies carried out without regard for our rights and livelihoods.”

At least 30 detained during protests in Minneapolis

As demonstrations in Minneapolis grew heated Friday night, at least 30 people were detained, cited and released after police gave orders to disperse at a hotel.

Hundreds gathered near the Canopy Hotel, a Hilton property, Friday evening, according to a statement from the Minneapolis Police Department. The group also moved nearby to the Renaissance Minneapolis Hotel, the Depot, where property damage was reported, police said.

At about 8:30, officers responded to a call and found a vehicle parked on a sidewalk. While they were investigating, protesters formed a crowd around them, according to police.

“Over the course of the night, individuals threw snow, ice, and rocks at officers, police vehicles, and other vehicles in the roadway,” the police department said, adding that one officer had a minor injury that didn't require medical attention.

At 9:45 p.m., some protesters entered “forced entry” into the Canopy, police said. At 10:15, police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and gave orders to disperse, which the main crowd began to do, police said. Arrests were made among a smaller group that remained near the Canopy, the statement said.

GoFund me for family of Renee Nicole Good raises $1.5 million

A GoFundMe campaign to support the family of Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman killed in a Jan. 7 shooting by an ICE agent, has closed after raising more than $1.5 million.

The campaign was started just hours after Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot while in her Honda Pilot SUV at an immigration enforcement operation on a residential street near her Minneapolis home.

After the campaign collected $1,503,533 from more than 38,500 donations, the organizers posted a note thanking contributors for their generosity. ""We’ve closed this GoFundMe and will place the funds in a trust for the family,"" the note said. ""If you’re looking to donate, we encourage you to support others in need. We’re truly grateful.""

The GoFundMe page has also been updated with a comment a statement Good's wife, Rebecca Good, had given to Minnesota Public Radio in which she said the two found themselves at the operation because they ""stopped to support our neighbors"" before Renee Good was fatally shot. ""We had whistles. They had guns,"" Rebecca Good said.

Protests against ICE planned this weekend

Among the places where people are expected to protest over the weekend are: Greenville, South Carolina; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boca Raton, Florida; Rochester, New York; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Lisa Gilbert, co-president of one of the organizing groups, Public Citizen, said she expects the events this weekend to be peaceful. Protests across the country during Trump's first year back in office were widespread and largely peaceful.

""The intent of these solidarity actions is to both honor and humanize the lives taken by ICE and to demand immediate accountability, transparency, and independent investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good, as well as expose the broader pattern of ICE violence,"" Gilbert said.

Tensions mount in Minneapolis

Hundreds of people took to the streets of Minneapolis to protest within hours of Good’s death and demonstrations have continued to swell in the ensuing days.

The site of her death and a federal building used by immigration agents, both south of the city’s downtown, have become focal points for protesters. Authorities installed concrete barriers outside the federal building following protests.

Many protesters have taken to carrying signs showing pictures of Good. The mother of three's wife, Rebecca Good, released a statement describing her partner as a dedicated Christian who had ""stopped to support our neighbors"" before she was fatally shot. ""We had whistles. They had guns,"" Rebecca Good said.

Local officials have called for immigration authorities to leave the city and for the officer behind the shooting to be arrested.

Minnesota prosecutors launched an online portal for residents to submit evidence related to the shooting in Minneapolis, vowing to probe the incident. State investigators said the FBI has moved to withhold evidence.

White House says ICE will go 'door to door'

Trump administration officials are promising to double down on their immigration enforcement strategy despite widespread protests.

Over 10,000 new ICE agents armed with personal data harvested by private contractors are expected to deploy across the country in the coming months.

Speaking on a FOX NEWS broadcast earlier this week, Vice President JD Vance said ICE would be going ""door to door"" in the coming months to carry out the White House’s plans for the largest mass deportation in history. Federal officials say they've now got about 22,000 agents and investigators, up from 10,000 a year ago.

Vance's comments were broadcast hours after the ICE agent shot and killed Good in Minneapolis. White House officials have accused Democrats of encouraging illegal immigration to reshape the country's voting patterns.

The vice president said the more aggressive enforcement that began in 2025 will ramp up in 2026.

The protest was held by the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA at the JFK Federal Building in Government Center to “mourn the lives lost to ICE and denounce ICE violence in our neighborhoods,” event organizers wrote in a flyer.

Organizers read aloud names of people they said had been killed by federal immigration authorities and called for an end to people in the community being detained and deported, The Boston Globe reported.

“Every day, more and more children are getting ripped out of the hands of their mothers, and grandparents are getting body slammed onto the pavement,” Hector Soares, a speaker at the protest, said to the crowd. “It is becoming increasingly obvious that we can’t sit and wait for this to resolve itself.”

The demonstrators at LUCE’s protest were joined by attendees from an earlier gathering hosted by Massachusetts Peace Action outside the State House, according to the Globe. Along with protesting the recent ICE-involved shootings in Minnesota and Portland, Ore., they denounced the Trump administration’s recent foreign intervention in Venezuela, which included seizing Nicolas Maduro, the country’s president.

Saturday’s protest follows a similar demonstration held Thursday by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, where nearly 1,000 people marched from Boston Common to City Hall Plaza in outrage at Good’s death. Kojo Achaempong, a speaker at that rally, compared the incident to the death of George Floyd, who was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, about a mile from where Good was shot.

“I remember six years ago when they killed George Floyd. They said he was a danger to the community,” Achaempong said. “Today, they try to claim that Renee Nicole Good was somehow a threat to those ICE officers.”

Since Good’s death, the Trump administration has characterized her as an agitator who committed an “act of domestic terrorism.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with other state officials, condemned that characterization, calling it “garbage.”

“They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” Frey said. “Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iceprotest-6963c84adedc8-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 17:57:22.898859

In trauma care, we are trained to act first because delay kills.
If we lose the commitment to treat the injured, regardless of who they are, we lose something essential.","I have spent my career as a trauma surgeon running toward gunshot wounds, not away from them.

I have also survived one myself.

Prevention is how we save the most lives, and it must always be our goal. But when prevention has failed, and a bullet has already torn through flesh, nothing matters more than immediate care. Seconds matter. Bleeding is relentless. Survival often hinges not on heroics, but on whether someone is allowed to do the most basic human act: Help.

That is why the recent shooting in Minneapolis is so deeply disturbing, not only because a woman was killed, but also because after she was shot, a physician on the scene was prevented by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from rendering aid.

As a trauma surgeon, I find that fact chilling.

What happened in Minneapolis should haunt us all

In medicine, we do not ask who someone is before we treat them. We do not ask where they are from, what they believe or whether they are ""deserving."" We treat them because they are injured. Full stop.

This principle is not sentimental idealism; it is the ethical foundation of emergency medicine, trauma care and humanitarian response across the world.

I have treated patients who have harmed others. I have cared for people in police custody, people accused of violent crimes, people whose actions I profoundly disagree with. None of that alters my obligation.

When someone is bleeding in front of you, your duty is to stop the bleeding.

This ethic does not end at our borders, nor does it bend to politics. Even in war – especially in war – there are rules that protect the wounded. Medics treat enemy combatants. Clinicians cross lines to render aid. These norms exist because once we decide that some injured people are unworthy of care, the concept of medicine itself begins to collapse.

Preventing a physician from treating a dying woman is not merely a procedural choice. It is a moral one. And it should alarm all of us.

As someone who has lain wounded, dependent on strangers to keep me alive, I know how thin the line is between life and death. I am alive today because people I did not know acted quickly, decisively and without hesitation. They did not ask whether I belonged. They did not wait for authorization. They simply did what was right.

What happened in Minneapolis represents a rupture of that shared ethic.

Who decides when survival becomes optional?

This is not an argument about immigration policy. Reasonable people can, and do, disagree about borders, enforcement and the rule of law. But none of those debates justify denying emergency medical care to a person who has been shot. When enforcement supersedes humanity, we are not enforcing laws ‒ we are abandoning values.

The danger of moments like this extends beyond the life that was lost, though that loss alone should haunt us. The deeper danger is the precedent set. If armed authority can block medical care today, under what circumstances will it be acceptable tomorrow? Who decides when compassion becomes optional?

In trauma care, we are trained to act first because delay kills. We do not debate while a patient is bleeding to death. We do not negotiate while oxygen levels fall. The failure to name moral breaches in society carries a similar cost, slower perhaps, but just as devastating.

I do not know if Renee Nicole Good could have been saved; no one can say with certainty. But she should have been given every possible chance. Allowing anyone to bleed while trained help stands ready violates something older and more sacred than any statute.

We must continue to fight for prevention – to reduce violence before it happens, to build systems that save lives upstream. But when violence has already occurred, the measure of a society is how it treats the wounded. Care is not a reward. It is a duty.

A society is judged not only by how it enforces its laws, but also by whether it upholds its most basic obligations in moments of crisis. If we lose the commitment to treat the injured, regardless of who they are, we lose something essential. And once lost, it will not be easy to reclaim.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88096657007-2254696062.jpg?crop=5562,3129,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-11 17:57:26.590294

Directive

In order to lessen the likelihood of deadly force situations and reduce the risk of injury or death to agents and others, I am implementing the following directive effective immediately, which clarifies existing guidelines contained in the CBP Use of Force Policy:

(1) In accordance with CBP’s current Use of Force policy, agents shall not discharge their firearms at a moving vehicle unless the agent has a reasonable belief, based on the totality of the circumstances that deadly force is being used against an agent or another person present; such deadly force may include a moving vehicle aimed at agents or others present, but would not include a moving vehicle merely fleeing from agents. Further, agents should not place themselves in the path of a moving vehicle or use their body to block a vehicle’s path.

The protest drew thousands into the streets, eventually turning chaotic as Los Angeles police officers in riot gear came face to face with demonstrators near the Federal Building. LAPD said one person was detained on suspicion of battery against a police officer.

Video from the scene shows an officer and a demonstrator being taken to the ground as a crowd rushed toward them.

Earlier in the day, the scale of the demonstration was visible from AIR7, with a large crowd streaming through downtown Los Angeles. Organizers estimated about 3,000 people attended.

""Thousands of people came together to really show people power, to basically say, 'Hands off Venezuela,' to say, 'We don't stand for a war for oil,' and that people need to come together to defend immigrant rights,"" said organizer Kameron Hurt.

The march began at Pershing Square, where protesters called for an end to immigration operations and condemned the Trump administration's military intervention in Venezuela.

""It's undeniable that the federal government and everybody in politics is enabling this attack, and people stay silent, and Trump thinks he can get away with more, so it's important that we come out to the streets to show that we aren't going to tolerate this,"" said protester Leonardo Vilchis-Zarate. ""This administration has to stop waging war abroad and waging war against its citizens.""

Organizers said anger over two recent deaths involving federal agents helped spark the rage. They cited the killing of Renee Good, a mother of three and U.S. citizen, in Minnesota, and the fatal shooting of Keith Porter Jr. by an off-duty ICE agent in Northridge on New Year's Eve.

""It's kind of scary to think that it could happen to any one of us, because the argument before was, 'They're not attacking U.S. citizens,' but that's kind of like, fallen short now,"" said protester Johnathan Rodriguez.

Protesters also pointed to the U.S. military seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which the White House says is part of a campaign against drug trafficking. Demonstrators described it as an ""illegal war.""

""People are angry, they are furious, and they don't want to let this go -- we can't let this go,"" said protester Aly Ceja.

After the march split up, a smaller group of demonstrators moved to the federal detention center, where police formed a line, and tensions began to rise. By nightfall, the situation escalated into a standoff between protesters and LAPD officers.

A dispersal order was issued for Alameda Street from Aliso Street to Temple Street, including Commercial Street, around 6:15 p.m. All demonstrators were being asked to leave the area.

Police said late Saturday that the protest was mostly dispersed as the night continued downtown. LAPD said no officers were seriously injured.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18384876_011026-kabc-dtla-ice-protest-split-tn-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-11 19:57:39.104315

Thousands of people joined another night of protests in Minneapolis on Saturday, following the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in the city.

Earlier, city officials said 30 people had been arrested during the weekend's protests, and one police officer had minor injuries after a ""chunk of ice was thrown at them"".

Protests against immigration enforcement have been held across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. More protests are expected in major US cities on Sunday.

The Trump administration said the agent who fired the shots acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.

People gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday despite bitterly cold weather, while anti-ICE protests also took place elsewhere in the US, including in Austin, Seattle, New York and Los Angeles.

Minneapolis police estimated ""tens of thousands of people"" attended the ""ICE out of Minnesota"" rally and march, which started in Powderhorn Park on Saturday.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the protest was ""peaceful"".

On Friday night, Minneapolis Police declared an unlawful assembly as protesters gathered outside the Canopy Hotel in the city, where some ICE agents were believed to be staying.

The Minneapolis police department said in a statement that ""several hundred people"" attended and ""some individuals forced entry into the hotel through an alley entrance"".

Videos posted online showed protesters flashing bright lights into the area, blowing whistles and banging on drums.

Police said some threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, police vehicles and other vehicles, but no serious injuries were reported.

One law enforcement officer suffered minor injuries but did not need any medical attention, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

Officials said another hotel in the city was also targeted and had window and graffiti damage.

At a news conference on Saturday morning, Mayor Frey applauded the majority of peaceful protesters, but noted that individuals who cause damage to property or put others in harm's way would be arrested.

Those arrested on Friday night were later released, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.

Many Minnesotans have been frustrated by the presence of ICE in the state and O'Hara said his department was getting dozens of phone calls every day about the federal agency's operations.

The shooting incident has exposed a stark political division, with both sides accusing the other of using inflammatory rhetoric.

On Sunday, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem doubled down on her assessment that Good was committing an act of ""domestic terrorism"", she told CNN that Good had ""weaponised"" her car"" to attack ICE agents in the city of Minneapolis.

Frey who spoke to CNN minutes later, and said ""anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist"" and characterised her actions as trying to do a three-point turn to escape the scene.

The Minneapolis mayor added that the city's local law enforcement were ""outnumbered by the number of ICE agents and beyond"".

On Saturday, three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour an ICE facility in Minneapolis. The women said they were initially allowed to enter, but were then told they had to leave.

Democratic Congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig said ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

""They do not care that they are violating federal law,"" Craig said.

""The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities,"" Omar posted on X on Saturday.

A DHS policy dated 8 January, the day after Good was shot, requires members of Congress to give seven days' notice for any visit to ICE facilities.

The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reports that the policy was submitted in a federal court on Saturday.

Good was shot and killed in her car on Wednesday.

Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.

As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.

The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street.

Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours.

The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car.

But Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Frey called that version of events a false narrative, saying it was clear to him she was trying to leave the scene, not attack an agent.

The FBI is investigating the incident.

On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation.

The announcement came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course. The US vice-president said the investigation was a federal issue.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/73cd/live/f2d4d200-eecf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:58:39.363422

“That’s fine dude, I’m not mad,” she said as the agent circled her car, which was blocking part of a road. He was using a cellphone to record Ms. Good and her wife, Becca, who prodded him: “You wanna come at us?”

Moments later, Ms. Good was dead, shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, Jonathan Ross, on Wednesday morning. The agent was near the front of her car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right on a snowy Minneapolis street.

Amid ongoing debate about whether the shooting was justified and the overall tactics employed by the deportation operations of the Trump administration, thousands in Minneapolis and across the country have been mourning Ms. Good, 37, who had only recently moved to Minneapolis with her wife and 6-year-old son. This weekend, protests against ICE took place in cities and towns across the country.

When she was killed, Ms. Good and her wife had been participating in a protest in response to ICE agents who had been spotted in the neighborhood, one of whom had gotten a vehicle stuck in the snow.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said that Ms. Good was one of several “agitators” who were trying to block the agents from leaving. In a chat called Central Rapid Response on Signal, the encrypted app, Ms. Good’s wife was described by another member as a “helper” in Wednesday’s action.

Becca Good, in a statement to Minnesota Public Radio, described her wife as a Christian woman who believed in loving others, as well as finding and nurturing kindness in people. She was “made of sunshine,” Becca Good said.

A Mother and Poet

Ms. Good, a poet and a mother of three, was born in Colorado Springs, Colo., and grew up in the state. Later in life, she moved to Virginia and Kansas City, Mo., before arriving in Minneapolis sometime last year.

A former classmate remembered her camaraderie when they were both pregnant during the same semester in 2019.

“We encountered each other at a time in my life when I was walking on new, wobbly legs in very uncharted territory,” said the classmate, Marie Branch. She said Ms. Good’s excitement for her new son “was palpable,” and that Ms. Good, who had already had two children, had helped guide her.

“She mentored me when she herself was in the throes of it — she was a nurturer to her core,” Ms. Branch said.

A Move to Kansas City

Ms. Good moved to Kansas City, Mo., sometime after college, and, in October 2023, successfully sought to change her name to Renee N. Macklin Good, writing in a court petition that she wanted “to share a name with my partner.” (She was born Renee Nicole Ganger.) In the court filing, she said that her two older children lived in Colorado at the time.

In Kansas City, neighbors recalled a happy family of three — the Goods and their exuberant son, now 6 years old — who lived in a small home with a gay pride flag in a quiet neighborhood on the south side of the city.

One neighbor, Zach Howdeshell, 34, said he did not think of Ms. Good as an activist. He lamented that her son — whose father died two years ago — was now without her as well.

“Her little boy was just so sweet,” he said. “And that’s one of the things that breaks my heart the most.”

Jennifer Ferguson, who lived across the street, said she and her husband would sit outside drinking coffee in the morning, waiting for their daughter’s bus, and that they would hear laughter flow out of the kitchen window of the Goods’ home.

Even though they were only neighbors for about six months in 2024, Ms. Ferguson recalled seeing “a lot of tender moments” between the couple. When they parted, they would often hug in the driveway or at their doorstep. And they frequently drove their son to school together.

Their son would play with the Fergusons’ daughter, and, when they spotted each other from across the street in the mornings, he would shout, “Have a good day!” If there was time, he would rush over and give her a hug.

Ms. Ferguson said she and her husband felt lucky to have had such friendly neighbors who were part of a loving family. Becca would sometimes talk handyman projects or tools with Ms. Ferguson’s husband, and the two families swapped Christmas cookies that year. Becca even once asked if they wanted some red wine that the couple had used to cook with, since she and her wife did not drink.

The two families did not talk about politics, Ms. Ferguson said, though it seemed clear that the Goods did not like the political direction of the country. They had talked about moving to Canada, she said, and seemed to grow more serious about the prospect after President Trump was elected.

A Fresh Start in Minneapolis

The Goods left Kansas City at the end of December 2024, dropping off two final gifts at their neighbors’ house: a lawn mower and a deep-freezer that they were not taking with them. Ms. Ferguson said she figured they were moving to Canada.

It is not clear exactly when they arrived in Minneapolis, but they had begun sending their son to school there.

“Like people have done across place and time, we moved to make a better life for ourselves,” Becca Good said in her statement. “We chose Minnesota to make our home. Our whole extended road trip here, we held hands in the car while our son drew all over the windows to pass the time and the miles.”

The family lived in a house in Powderhorn, a diverse neighborhood that has gentrified in recent years but that is still known for its activist community, particularly after a police officer killed George Floyd nearby in 2020.

Becca Good said in her statement that “there was a strong shared sense here in Minneapolis that we were looking out for each other.”

On the day her wife was killed, Becca Good said they had been trying to support their neighbors. “We had whistles,” she wrote. “They had guns.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10nat-renee-good-wwk-bhtf/10nat-renee-good-wwk-bhtf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 16:57:20.079559

The marchers began at Powderhorn Park and passed by the site where Good was killed. The protest was part of over a 1,000 planned demonstrations against ICE across the nation this weekend.

Among the demonstrators was a group of Roosevelt High School students. Hours after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Border Patrol agents arrived at the high school and deployed tear gas as students were being dismissed.

“I want to be able to go to work and school without worrying that we are going to be attacked,” said junior Maria DeLong, who said she burst into tears watching a video of her favorite teachers being tackled by federal agents.

Fahad Mo, 26, is a Somali-American who grew up in Cedar-Riverside, which has a large Somali community. He’s part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, a newly formed group working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood from immigration officers.

“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” Mo said at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”

The Minnesota Somali community has been the focus of a targeted deportation campaign by the Trump administration since late November, even though the vast majority are citizens or legal residents.

Protests at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which federal immigration agents use as a base, has been more confrontational. Federal agents fired pepper balls at a small group of protesters at the Whipple Building at the same time as the much larger Powderhorn protest, CNN reported.

On Friday night, police arrested 30 people, who have since been released, for blocking streets and damaging property at a protest outside hotels in downtown Minneapolis where ICE agents are thought to be staying, the Star Tribune reported.

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz said on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

“We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,” Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump’s administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he’s frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

”Democrats constantly rush to take the side of criminals over law enforcement officers.
Tina’s lies only serve to further inflame tensions and incite violence against law enforcement officers,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.","Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said on Sunday she thinks the Trump administration is trying to “cover up” the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer by pushing a narrative before investigators were able to gather information.

“I think what we are seeing here is the federal government, [Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, Donald Trump, attempt to cover up what happened here in the Twin Cities. And I don’t think that people here and around the country are believing it,” Smith said in an interview on ABC News’s “This Week.”

The Minnesota senator criticized Noem’s hasty characterization of the shooting of Renee Nicole Macklin Good, an American citizen, as an entirely justified use of force against a woman who “weaponized” her vehicle in an “act of domestic terrorism.” The swift assessment has even some Republicans on Capitol Hill raising questions.

“You can see everything that they are doing is trying to shape the narrative, to say what happened, without any investigation,” Smith said, when asked to elaborate on her claim of a “cover-up.”

“And, you know, hours after Renee Good was shot and killed by federal agents, Kristi Noem was already telling us exactly what had happened. They were calling her a domestic terrorist before they even knew what her name was,” she continued.

Smith said her concerns are amplified by federal officers not working with state law enforcement on the investigation.

“What I see — especially because they are blocking state investigators from participating in any way in this investigation — that they have a strategy of putting out what their version of events are. And that is very dangerous. And I don’t think people are going to buy it, particularly after you see these videos,” she said, referring to released footage of the shooting.

The White House sharply pushed back in a statement, accusing the senator of using rhetoric that contributes to an environment that makes violence against law enforcement officers more likely.

”Democrats constantly rush to take the side of criminals over law enforcement officers. Tina’s lies only serve to further inflame tensions and incite violence against law enforcement officers,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

The order says failing to safeguard the revenue, held in Foreign Government Deposit Funds, “will substantially interfere with our critical efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela.”

“The failure of these critical efforts would jeopardize major foreign policy objectives of the United States, including” curbing illegal immigration, fending off threats from Iran and Venezuela and “bringing peace, prosperity, and stability to the Venezuelan people and to the Western Hemisphere more generally,” the executive order reads.

Several companies have long-standing claims against Venezuela, Reuters reported, noting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips left Venezuela nearly two decades ago after their assets were nationalized and are both owed billions of dollars.

More agents headed to MN

What we know:

Speaking on FOX News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem said more officers will be on the ground in Minnesota on Sunday and Monday.

""We're sending more officers today and tomorrow,"" Noem told host Maria Bartiromo. ""They'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely. We're going to continue to, if they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences.""

The backstory:

Tensions have been high in the Twin Cities in recent days following the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of ICE officer Jonathan Ross. The shooting has sparked protests across the city including outside the regional ICE headquarters at the Whipple Building at Fort Snelling.

Federal head count

What we don't know:

It's not clear exactly how many officers will be coming to the Twin Cities and exactly where this will put the total head count for federal law enforcement in the metro. In December, the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge, bringing more than 100 federal agents into the Twin Cities.

In January, the Department of Homeland Security launched a new 30-day surge, this time bringing a reported force of 1,500 ICE officers and 600 Homeland Security investigators into the state with an aim at tackling fraud. Friday, FOX News reported that Border Patrol was set to add as many as 1,000 of its agents on the ground in Minneapolis as well. It's possible some or all of the hundreds that Noem referenced are the reported Border Patrol agents being deployed.

Federal immigration officials on Saturday used Ms. Noem’s guidance to deny Representatives Angie Craig, Ilhan Omar and Kelly Morrison, all Minnesota Democrats, from entering a detention facility in Minneapolis.
“This is a blatant disregard of the law,” Ms. Omar told reporters on Saturday.
In her memo filed last week, Ms. Noem characterized the visits as “circuslike publicity stunts” that pulled immigration officers away from more important duties.
Since 2020, the federal appropriations law that annually funds ICE prohibits it from using congressionally appropriated funds to deny lawmakers physical access to their facilities.","The day after an immigration officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, the Trump administration reinstated limits preventing lawmakers from making unannounced visits to immigration facilities, according to a court filing made public over the weekend.

In a memo dated Thursday, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said that she would once again require lawmakers to give seven days’ notice before conducting oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Ms. Noem’s new guidelines on lawmaker visits are virtually identical to a policy that a federal judge halted last month after ruling that it appeared to violate a provision of the appropriations law that funds ICE.

But Ms. Noem said that she would bypass that ruling by using another source: the injection of funds given to the agency through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, President Trump’s signature domestic policy law, which more than tripled ICE’s annual budget.

Ms. Noem’s memo, filed in court on Saturday, is all but certain to further stoke the conflict between Democrats and the Trump administration over its deportation push. As federal officials have increased immigration enforcement efforts, they have been met with increasingly hostile protests, including in Minneapolis, where an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, 37.

Ms. Good’s killing provoked a widespread outcry and protests across the United States, and intensified ongoing demonstrations in Minneapolis.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said that Ms. Noem issued the new limitations directly in response to that rising unrest, which she referred to as “escalating riots and political violence.”

Democrats, who had sued the department over the earlier guidance, vowed to challenge Ms. Noem’s new policy in court. Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a party to the lawsuit, called the memo “ a clear attempt to subvert the ruling” made last month.

Federal immigration officials on Saturday used Ms. Noem’s guidance to deny Representatives Angie Craig, Ilhan Omar and Kelly Morrison, all Minnesota Democrats, from entering a detention facility in Minneapolis.

The three lawmakers said that they were stopped after having initially been granted access to the building, with federal officials citing the new guidance.

“This is a blatant disregard of the law,” Ms. Omar told reporters on Saturday.

Ms. McLaughlin said that the lawmakers had led a group of protesters to the facility and that they were “out of compliance with existing court orders and policies.”

Democratic lawmakers across the country have been turned away from ICE facilities repeatedly over the past year as they have tried to conduct oversight visits.

“It is our job as members of Congress to make sure that those folks detained are treated with humanity,” Ms. Craig said.

In her memo filed last week, Ms. Noem characterized the visits as “circuslike publicity stunts” that pulled immigration officers away from more important duties.

Since 2020, the federal appropriations law that annually funds ICE prohibits it from using congressionally appropriated funds to deny lawmakers physical access to their facilities.

Congress has not yet passed a law to fund the Homeland Security Department this year, and it faces a Jan. 30 deadline for doing so to avoid a partial government shutdown.

Spending bills cannot be enacted by the Senate without the support of some Democrats. In the wake of the Minnesota shooting, some have suggested that their party refuse to back a budget for the department that does not put restrictions on immigration enforcement policies that they characterize as aggressive and abusive.

Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that he believed his party needed to press for changes to rein in “the most lawless Department of Homeland Security in the history of the country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/11/multimedia/11dc-immig-kqcl/11dc-immig-kqcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 13:57:07.283210

“I want them more than they want me and more than they want this country,” Trump said.
Still, when asked whether he disagrees on certain policies with Miller — whose views on immigration are on the far right — Trump said no.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened in an interview this past week to strip some naturalized immigrants of their citizenship, defended an immigration agent who killed a woman in Minneapolis and offered no regrets over officers’ aggressive tactics against immigrants, protesters and U.S. citizens.

But the president at times sought to soften his harsh, anti-immigrant image, as he has done at times. When asked if he would support a plan that includes a pathway to citizenship for immigrants lacking permanent legal status, Trump said “possibly, possibly.” He said “Dreamers,” who were brought to the United States illegally as children, should feel “safe” in the country and that he would “love to be able to do something for them.”

“I’d love to have a comprehensive immigration policy. Something that really worked. It’s about time for the country,” Trump said, a remarkable statement for a president whose administration has spent the past year demonizing, threatening and rounding up immigrants in raids across the country.

Asked for details of any plan he might have, Trump seemed to acknowledge the messy politics surrounding an issue that has motivated a large number of his staunchest supporters: “I don’t want to go into that because it’s a very ticklish subject.”

Many of Trump’s assertions in the interview Wednesday evening contradict the actions he’s taken since he returned to office nearly one year ago.

Immigration agents, operating at his direction, have already targeted some immigrants brought to the country as children. Neither Trump nor Republicans in Congress have made any effort to create new protections for immigrants like the Dreamers. And the president has effectively shut down asylum at the border, gutted the refugee program and made it harder for many foreigners looking to work in the United States.

Nevertheless, many of his comments to The New York Times were striking because of how deeply they clashed with the views of Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration policy, and significant portions of his MAGA base.

“I just want people that love our country. It’s very simple,” Trump said when asked if his immigration policies — which in some cases favor white people — were aimed at changing the racial makeup of the United States.

Trump also said he would provide an update on his plans for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in about a year.

“They should feel safe,” said Trump, who during his first term tried to wipe out the program.

He also acknowledged that he had given the directive for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to scale back raids on the agriculture, service and hospitality industries, which rely on immigrant labor.

“They have great people working for them who have been working for them for 25 years,” Trump said, referring to farmers who hire immigrant workers. “They’re almost like a member of the family.”

He also said he was frustrated by an immigration raid of a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia that outraged officials in South Korea.

“I was very angry about it,” Trump said. “You know why? Because they have to open a factory and you can’t take a person off the street who’s never seen a battery before and think that they’re going to make highly complex batteries.”

Trump said the United States needed skilled foreign workers at those factories to train Americans on to how manufacture complex batteries.

“I want them more than they want me and more than they want this country,” Trump said. “We need people. We’re building factories all over the country.”

And yet, in the same interview, he said his administration was examining criteria for stripping some naturalized U.S. citizens of their citizenship, with a particular focus on the Somali community that he has frequently insulted.

“You see conflicting messages sometimes from the same mouth and sometimes from two different mouths in the same agency,” said Muzaffar Chishti, a Migration Policy Institute senior fellow. “His connections to the corporate world are deep and long-lasting. He is keen on having the corporate end of his base on his side. And immigration is key on having support on that side.”

Trump’s dueling messages could in part be rooted in his awareness that many of his supporters were infuriated by his comments last year embracing foreign students and labor.

When the administration issued guidance to largely pause raids at agriculture sites, meatpacking plants, restaurants and hotels — absent other criminality like human trafficking or drug smuggling — some White House officials who wanted Trump to maintain his pledge for mass deportations were taken by surprise.

Still, when asked whether he disagrees on certain policies with Miller — whose views on immigration are on the far right — Trump said no.

“Stephen’s a very strong voice,” Trump said. “I don’t think I disagree with him, no.”

And when it came to the shooting death of a 37-year-old Minnesota woman by an ICE officer, which has prompted furious demonstrations, Trump was back to his hard-line rhetoric. He blamed the woman and stopped short of saying the agent had gone too far.

Trump said he did not believe ICE’s authority was limitless.

He said agents should not pursue immigrants based on race or ethnicity alone, a comment that could be significant for future court proceedings examining his immigration crackdown.

The Supreme Court has long held that “the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race.”

But in at least four major cases, lawyers are arguing that officers have been rounding up people, mainly Latino residents, based on mass racial profiling and using tactics that violate prior case law and the Fourth Amendment, which protects against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01102026_trump_tzr_165531.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-11 13:57:10.751055

A coalition of nonprofits including the American Civil Liberties Union is promoting the events as an “ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action,” aimed at demanding accountability and changes to federal immigration policy, according to a press release. The protests will take place in major cities nationwide including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago, as well as smaller towns like Martinsburg, West Virginia.

“The Trump administration and its federal agents are out of control, endangering our neighborhoods, and trampling on our rights and freedom,” the ACLU said in the press release. “This weekend Americans all across the country are demanding that they stop.”

On Wednesday, ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and a U.S. citizen, during a federal immigration operation. Government officials have characterized the use-of-force as self-defense while local officials and eye witnesses have disputed that account as the case remains under investigation.

And on Friday, two people described by the Department of Homeland Security as “suspected Tren de Aragua gang associates” were shot by a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon. Both survived their wounds.

With that backdrop, protestors in Minneapolis and Portland have taken to the streets this week to demand accountability and to end ICE and Border Patrol operations in their cities. The protests have since spread to other cities.

Thousands of peaceful protesters filled Minneapolis' Powderhorn Park and the surrounding streets on Saturday.

“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE!” The crowd chanted.

Lindagail Roy, 73, was among those braving the cold weather to protest in Minneapolis on Saturday. She was marching with a sign that read: ""No amount of soap will wash the slime of ICE from your soul.""

""I don’t really think the ICE agents realize what they’re standing for. They’re going to have to live with themselves, with what has happened and what is happening in our country,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion.“This is murder. We cannot stand for it. If we don’t show up now it’s going to continue and when is it going to stop?""

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Saturday that “ICE officers are facing a nearly 1300% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members.”

“The First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting, assault and destruction,” she said. “DHS is taking measures to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety and our officers.”

No one has been arrested or charged in connection Good's killing and Minneapolis officials have repeatedly said federal authorities have restricted local access to key evidence as the FBI leads the investigation. Trump administration officials have come out in defense of Ross, with Vice President JD Vance saying he had “absolute immunity” in the shooting. Local officials have rejected this characterization.

Ross has not replied to multiple requests for comment by NBC News.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference on Saturday that 29 protesters were arrested Friday night at a protest with more than 1,000 demonstrators. The city’s police chief, Brian O’Hara, added that some individuals caused damage to windows and sprayed graffiti at a hotel in downtown Minneapolis, leading to arrests.

Frey said the “vast majority of people have protested peacefully” and urged Minneapolis residents to continue doing so.

“We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos,” Frey said. “Here, we in Minneapolis, are going to do this right.”

The killing of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer is reverberating across Capitol Hill where Democrats, and certain Republicans, are vowing an assertive response as President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation operations spark protests nationwide.

Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into Renee Good's shooting death and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.

""The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,"" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. ""And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.""

Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Trump and Noem said the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.

Vice President JD Vance blamed Good, calling it ""a tragedy of her own making,"" and said the ICE officer may have been ""sensitive"" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.

But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.

""The videos I've seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement.

""As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,"" she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation ""was devastating, and cannot happen again.""

Homeland Security funding is up for debate

The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another federal government shutdown when money expires at the end of January.

As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.

""We've been warning about this for an entire year,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.

The ICE officer ""needs to be held accountable,"" Frost said, ""but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.""

Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.

Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.

Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.

""More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,"" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.

Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats are splintering between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.

The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest Covid-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.

Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.

""I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,"" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border

""Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,"" he said.

Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers

In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.

In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent also in Chicago shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., Good's death ""brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.""

""It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what's going on is out of control,"" he said, ""that this isn't about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.""

Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration's policy, defended the officer's actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.

""Nobody wants to see people get shot,"" said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.

""Let's do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they're standing in front of your car,"" he said. ""She made a mistake. I'm sure she didn't mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108250076-1767894426190-gettyimages-2255265591-l1042012_copy_vbzl1bey.jpeg?v=1767894462&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-11 14:56:45.879053

President Donald Trump's administration imposed a new rule on Saturday requiring lawmakers to give at least one week's notice before entering an ICE facility.

The move is the administration's second attempt at such an order. A federal judge previously struck down a similar requirement from Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem, finding that federal spending laws require that members of Congress receive unrestricted access to recipient facilities.

Omar said her group was able to briefly question officials inside the facility regarding hygiene for detainees and other topics. She described the answers she received as ""insane,"" and argued officials were downplaying how long detainees remain at the facility.

Federal officials say the new order complies with federal law because the funding for the facility is sourced from the Big Beautiful Bill rather than congressional appropriations.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin elaborated on Omar's removal in a statement to reporters, arguing that the lawmakers entered the facility ""with the explicit goal of ‘hunting down’ ICE officers who they believed may have been staying there.""

“You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action.","LINCOLN, Neb. (KLKN) — Dozens of people lined the sidewalk in downtown Lincoln to protest the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers.

The “ICE Out For Good” campaign spread across the country on Saturday, with thousands gathering in major cities.

“I’m very concerned for our country,” said protester Janet Morris.

The protest comes after the deadly shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump’s administration said the officer acted in self defense after the woman tried to run him over.

“The precedent here is very simple,” Vice President JD Vance said. “You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action. That’s a federal issue. That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.”

The group stood outside the Nebraska federal building as they made signs, waved flags and chanted for an end to ICE.

One of their main goals was to shine a light on the violence and call for others to join their mission.

“I want Americans to wake up,” Morris said. “What I see too much of, ‘oh I’m overwhelmed, I don’t want to be involved, oh I just want to live my life.’ They don’t realize that what’s happening at a national level will affect them. It’s already affecting them. You can’t bury your head in the sand.”

After protesting, the group held a vigil to remember the lives lost at the hands of ICE agents.

For many of those who showed up, they say standing up for human rights was an easy decision.

“We’re talking about people being disappeared in our own country,” Joseth Moore said. “And what I mean by disappeared, as in killed or picked up by ICE. I don’t have any hope for this country to be honest with you. But I have to fight. I have to fight for myself, for my family.”",https://www.klkntv.com/content/uploads/2026/01/i/z/ice-protest-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 12:56:56.314768

Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle.
The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.
""They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,"" Frey said.
Frey called for ICE to ""Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday.

""We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,"" Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot.

""If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,"" Noem claimed in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""This officer was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.""

Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.

Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda.

The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud.

Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, ""Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth.""

Democrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" demanded an impartial investigation of the incident.

""Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased,"" he said. ""Let's not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice.""

""When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,"" Frey added.

Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions.

""They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,"" Frey said.

Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. Frey called for ICE to ""Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,"" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

""They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public,"" Noem said on CNN Sunday. ""They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days.""

Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, ""I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears.""

""I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. I think the 'killing somebody' is the inflammatory element here, not the F-bomb,"" Frey said.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should ""let the investigation play out.""

""I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't,"" Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this.
As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere?
It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this.
It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing.","Sandweg, who led the nation’s top immigration enforcement agency from 2013 to 2014, said ICE serves the entire public — and its politicization is doing it no good. He’s also critical of the administration’s hasty response to Good’s killing, which he argues only further undermined public trust in ICE activity.

As Sandweg sees it, ICE needs to pare back its visibility: stop taking partisan sides, mend relationships with local partners and cease publicly announcing their operations. He stresses the need to de-escalate — but worries it isn’t coming anytime soon.

“It’s going to be a long time,” Sandweg says, “before the agency recovers.”

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Videos of the Minneapolis shooting are circulating online, and there have been lots of different reactions. The Trump administration is claiming that ICE agents were operating in self-defense. State and local officials have swiftly denounced that conclusion. Did you watch the videos, and what was your reaction?

I’ve seen a couple of the videos. To me, it highlighted why it’s so important that you withhold judgment until there is a thorough investigation, and why that’s the standard practice any time there’s an officer shooting.

I feel like each video provided a different perspective that could lend itself to a different conclusion. Of course, I think the entire thing is tragic. And if I were at ICE, what I would hope is that the investigation is not only a tool to determine, if in that moment the officer’s decision was reasonable, but also to look at this holistically. To try to inform us, how can we make sure something like this doesn’t happen again?

Anytime anyone is killed, it’s a horrific tragedy, and I think we need to do everything we can to learn from it. And I do worry that with the quick rushes to judgment and, in many ways, the politicization of this issue, it makes it harder for us to try to at least draw some good from this — which would be trying to reduce the chances of this reoccurring.

Pretty quickly after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem framed it as an act of self-defense, insisting that the agent was responding to an act of “domestic terrorism.” Other members of the Trump administration seemed to agree. But what information might the DHS actually have had, in the aftermath of the shooting?

I just can’t imagine any secretary, or the department itself, ever saying anything at that moment other than, “We’re committed to having an investigation here.” Whether that was a Republican administration or a Democratic administration.

I’ve been through five years at DHS, which included a significant portion of time as a senior advisor to a secretary. Whenever something major happens, the initial information we received almost always had severe inaccuracies. You learn very quickly in that job not to trust the initial information. Anytime there’s a major event, information is flowing and fast.

You cannot rush out and make pronouncements about what’s going on until the dust settles a bit and you have a more accurate picture of what happened. There have been a couple of incidents with [FBI Director] Kash Patel, who’s rushed out to get facts out to the public, and then later those facts proved, pretty quickly, to be wrong.

With a shooting like this, you need to look at the totality of the circumstances. Not only does each video give you a different angle and a different perspective, but there’s so much information the videos don’t capture … You have to wait for all the facts to come in.

But the other reason why that’s significant, though, is because there is going to be an investigation. The public expects an investigation. The risk you run, especially in this environment we’re in now, is that people don’t believe in the government. They’re losing faith in ICE as an institution.

What’s the point of the investigation? We’ve already announced this was a justified shooting, right? “No mistakes were made. We followed our training perfectly.” “She was a domestic terrorist trying to kill people” — I don’t know how you could possibly draw that conclusion at that stage. What was she doing that day? What were her intentions? Are there signs that she was actually trying to kill an officer, that she was in that state of mind that day? 37-year-old mothers don’t typically try to kill federal officers.

But you can’t get [evidence] unless you’re executing search warrants on her phone, getting into her email communications, interviewing people who knew her. In any event, the irresponsibility is not only rushing up to the public and giving them information that isn’t vetted, but it also undermines the investigation … I just can’t imagine anyone’s going to have confidence in that investigation anymore.

And how exactly do you investigate an incident like this?

Every case is different. Some of the protocols require, of course, getting the officer off the scene, interviewing the officer as quickly as possible about their perspective. All of this gets really complicated. The FBI has taken charge of this investigation, typically you would have some DHS entity involved in that investigation

They interview witnesses and look at all the available evidence; they get all of the available surveillance cameras, interview all the officers at the scene, try to build back what was going on that day.

The investigation itself would determine whether, under the use of force rules, the officer had a reasonable belief that he was facing imminent danger. But it would also look at everything else that happened and if mistakes were made that require administrative action.

One thing we learned recently about the officer involved in the Minneapolis shooting is that he had recently been the victim of a dragging incident with a car. What psychological supports are available for officers after an attack?

There’s certainly tools available. You don’t return to duty until you’re fit for duty. I know there’s an evaluation there. Obviously, everybody’s going to bring their own personal experiences to the job. That’s just the reality of the situation. And, by the way, the investigation will look into that, if there were fitness reports or other things.

But I certainly don’t believe just because somebody was the victim of an assault, that they can’t do their job. We probably wouldn’t have very many officers if that were the standard.

The Trump administration has floated the idea of immunity for the agent. Obviously depending on the outcome of the investigation, what could that look like? Could the officer be prosecuted?

This raises a lot of complicated issues. The state of Minnesota might make their own decision about what happened and whether any state crimes occurred. The state of Minnesota could independently charge the officer. The federal government could obviously charge the officer as well. If the state charges the officer, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity. Vice President JD Vance misspoke at the press conference when he said, “absolute immunity.” There is no absolute immunity. There’s qualified immunity.

Certainly, the state could charge the officer with murder. The officer could have to make a court appearance or two, but there is a process in place, when it is a federal official exercising their official duties, where they can seek removal of the case to federal court. If it’s deemed that they were acting in their official capacity, they were doing their federal job, then the federal court can assert jurisdiction in order to make a determination as to whether they’re entitled to qualified immunity.

As we talked about in our previous interview, it’s difficult to question use of force because we don’t know what the agents knew, what they were thinking at the moment, or what sort of threat they perceived. But with escalating violence across the country, does it seem like the DHS needs to revisit that “objectively reasonable” policy?

I don’t think the policy or the standard needs to be changed. I mean, this is a uniform use of force standard that all law enforcement agencies basically employ.

What I do think we need to do, though, is look at this holistically… Are we doing things that have made our agents more vulnerable, and are we doing things that have made the public more vulnerable? The administration should be thinking, “OK, what have we done?”

From my perspective, a couple of things have been done. We’ve shifted tactics. We have officers engaged in a lot more traffic stops now than we previously did. We have officers now confronting these protesters, something that ICE very, very rarely did before. We pulled Border Patrol agents up off the border, where they operated in a completely different environment, and put them in an urban environment … We’ve put our officers in a very difficult position.

On Thursday, Border Patrol agents shot two people in Portland. We know less about the Portland shooting than we do about Minneapolis right now. But these two incidents were nearly back-to-back. Are you concerned that these violent incidents are starting to form a pattern?

The statistics suggest that these shootings are up significantly. But I want to be really clear. Nobody at Border Patrol, nobody at ICE, wakes up and says, “I want to shoot someone today.” It’s the last thing they want to do.

But so, we have to ask ourselves, “Why is this happening?” It goes back to exactly what I said.

The administration has said, in order to make mass arrests, we’re going to pull agents out of what they’re trained to do, and out of their normal operating environment, and we’re going to put them in an urban area with a completely different type of policing. That is where I think the frustration should be.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this. They say this is what you have to expect when you pull these agents out of their normal environments, having them do things that they’re not trained to do.

As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere? And will it be harder for protesters to exercise their rights?

Immigration enforcement has always been politically charged, but now it’s even more charged. And we’re turning it into a both-sides-ism. There is a middle ground here. This is what’s frustrating to me and to other people who worked at ICE. You can be pro-immigration enforcement. You can have, like during the Obama administration, extensive immigration enforcement focused on the right people, done without being so politicized.

But in any event, will it be harder? Of course, yes. It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this. By becoming so political, just at a bare minimum, what it does is it makes it incredibly hard for ICE to [maintain] these relationships with state and local partners, which are so critical to a law enforcement agency like ICE. Those are incredibly damaged right now. Our relationships with these large cities are damaged.

It’s going to be a long time before the agency recovers.

I asked you this question three months ago. Maybe your answer is the same, maybe it’s changed. Where do we go from here?

I’d like to see us deescalate things. ICE serves the entire public. It doesn’t serve a political party. It doesn’t serve just red America, and it’s not the enemy of blue America.

It doesn’t mean you have to back off immigration enforcement … But try to do things in a less overt manner. Don’t try to antagonize. Don’t take sides. Lower the visibility of ICE. You can keep doing these operations but go back to some of the tactics we’ve seen before where that are lower profile, less visible. Do your job. Do your job quietly.

Stop announcing these operations. This is so bizarre to me. How high-profile [it is], we announce weeks in advance that ICE is coming to town. Candidly, that just puts the officers in greater jeopardy. You’re telling all the potential targets, “We’re coming to get you next week.” I mean, what?

I think we need to de-escalate. But unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’re doing that.

ICE operations in Minnesota are especially large. When we last spoke, one of your biggest concerns was whether ICE could ratchet up its activity without cutting corners on training and recruitment. That doesn’t seem to be the case here; the officer who fired shots in Minnesota had experience with the agency. But just broadly speaking, could inexperience, these concerns about declining training standards, lead to more incidents like these?

Absolutely. I mean, you have a supercharged environment where things are incredibly tense. The officers are operating in a reality where the assaults on them are up. We’re having them do things that seasoned officers have been trained to do. It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing. And now you’re sort of flooding the agency with these new hires.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-11 14:56:49.368186

""You need to speak up and be active. So I do it in the classroom, and I do it on the streets here in Portland,"" said Ben Feeney, a public school teacher from Massachusetts.

The group Indivisible, and its local chapters, were behind many of the protests. Indivisible is a group that was formed after Donald Trump's 2016 election victory and aims to promote progressive policies and candidates. Saturday's theme was ""ICE Out For Good.""

One protester in Portland said she wanted to abolish ICE. When asked what should replace the agency, she said ""the government should handle it,"" and eventually let local police, and maybe the National Guard, take control.

Other protesters said the Trump administration is breaking tradition and norms with its handling of immigration, strikes against Venezuela, and the president's desire to acquire Greenland.

""A lot of the actions right now, especially in Congress, they are not making any movement to right some of these wrongs,"" said Warren Michaelson of Yarmouth.

Protesters also said they were worried about federal enforcement on the ground in Minnesota potentially making its way to Maine.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/dc863751-e046-4132-87b6-22ae28b461ee/64f842b7-203a-4911-a311-24c53b884ab3.jpg?crop=0.786xw:0.784xh;0.0714xw,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-11 14:12:37.126408

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz said on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

“We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,” Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump’s administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he’s frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

In a statement, the coalition—made up of immigrant rights groups, labor unions, and other community organizations—said the airline’s decision followed months of protests, boycott efforts, and legislative activity aimed at pressuring Avelo to end its involvement in federal immigration enforcement flights.

Avelo’s Announcement and Local Response

The coalition said Avelo, which it described as having previously defended the work, announced on Tuesday that it would stop conducting deportation flights. The groups framed the move as a major shift and said they hope it sets a precedent for other private airlines considering similar work.

The coalition also renewed criticism of the company’s presence at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, where Avelo operates commercial passenger service. Organizers said they had urged Governor Wes Moore to take steps to remove the airline from BWI. They pointed to a petition they said collected more than 15,000 signatures, including support from state and local elected officials.

Claims About Deportation Activity

In their statement, organizers said deportations in Maryland have increased sharply since the beginning of the year and argued that deportation flights have also climbed nationally. The coalition also claimed that, prior to the announcement, Avelo was responsible for a significant share of ICE Air flights.

Avelo’s announcement was met with celebratory statements from several organizers involved in the campaign.

“This is the result of tens of thousands of people organizing here and nationwide to put pressure on Avelo, airports where they operate, and local governments that host their operations. It should be a message to other private airlines that cooperation with ICE will be met with mass boycotts and protests, and it will hurt your business. There is no excuse for human rights violations.“ – Ryan Harvey, Baltimore Rapid Response Network

“Deportation is a public health crisis and a human rights violation. As physicians and other providers who treat immigrants and refugees, we are pleased that thousands of protesters, including our colleagues, have forced Avelo to say they will stop assisting ICE in their destruction and violence.

After briefly entering the monitoring center, Craig said, “there was an abrupt decision that we should return to a waiting area and await leadership to come and tell us what was going on.
“What happened today is a blatant attempt to obstruct members of Congress from doing their oversight duties,” Omar said.
It’s been beautiful to see, and that kind of resistance is why ICE agents seem so angry and agitated,” Omar said.","A surprise visit by three congressional members to the immigration detention center at Fort Snelling ended abruptly on Saturday morning, when Department of Homeland Security employees told them to leave.

In the short time they were inside the center, U.S. Reps. Kelly Morrison and Ilhan Omar said they saw 20 people in a facility that has no beds.

The visit comes amid a surge of ICE and Border Patrol agents that has led to ramped up enforcement actions across the Twin Cities and less than a week after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in south Minneapolis.

Minnesota Democrats Morrison, Omar and U.S. Rep. Angie Craig said they had prior authorization from a senior official at the local field office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to carry out congressional oversight at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building and examine the conditions under which detainees are held.

After briefly entering the monitoring center, Craig said, “there was an abrupt decision that we should return to a waiting area and await leadership to come and tell us what was going on. “The response was that, because the funding for this center came from the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill,’ not a congressional appropriations bill, that they were denying our access.”

Craig said she brought court precedent with her to the site, calling the justification for denying entry “nonsense.”

In December 2025 a U.S. District Court judge temporarily blocked Trump administration policies requiring lawmakers to provide seven days’ notice before visiting ICE facilities, saying the requirement likely exceeded DHS’ statutory authority and undermined Congress’ oversight responsibilities.

Omar said DHS staffers went even further, telling the congresswomen: ‘Yes, the law is on your side, but we don’t care, and we are not going to allow you to fulfill your oversight duties.’”

Her office told Sahan Journal that as congressional members, they have automatic access to federal facilities and the authorization was a courtesy heads-up.

“What happened today is a blatant attempt to obstruct members of Congress from doing their oversight duties,” Omar said. “When we appropriate funds as members of Congress, we are expected by the public to do oversight, because the public requires their money be used with transparency and accountability, and what happened today is ICE agents deciding that we were no longer allowed to fulfill our constitutional duties.”

Sahan Journal reached out to DHS and ICE for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Morrison, a doctor, and Omar said they were able to see 20 people held in the monitoring center during their brief period of access.

Omar said that she inquired about hygiene conditions and was told that they have showers but no hygiene products since they aren’t held there for long, “which is insane, because we’ve heard from people who have been detained here before,” she said.

“We are going to continue to show up. We’re going to continue to do our job,” Craig said. “We let ICE know, Department of Homeland Security know that they were violating federal law. They do not care that they are violating federal law.”

Before and after the oversight visit, vehicles carrying immigration agents entered and exited the Whipple Building as a small group of protesters gathered outside, shouting at the cars as they passed. Officers were seen photographing demonstrators from inside their vehicles, and in at least one instance, an officer deployed pepper spray directly into a protester’s eyes as the car pulled away.

“I have been incredibly, incredibly proud the way our neighbors have shown up for one another.

Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states.

The challenges align with parts of Trump's agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants' privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit's intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

“This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,"" Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees’ association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of “a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process” if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump's agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump's agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president's social media post.

Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to exclude noncitizens from the apportionment process. That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution's 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau's defense in both cases, despite the intervenors' concerns.

In the Louisiana case, Justice Department lawyers argued against lifting the hold, saying the Census Bureau was in the middle of planning for the 2030 census: ""At this stage of such preparations, lifting the stay is not appropriate.""

The new policy, dated Jan. 8 and submitted Saturday in federal court, says members of Congress need to schedule any visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities 7 days in advance. Any exemptions to the rule have to be approved by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed the new memo.

Over the weekend, Democratic Minnesota Representatives Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry into an ICE facility in Minneapolis. Tensions there have escalated after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday. Trump administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense, a claim rejected by local leaders.

In December, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. blocked an identical DHS policy that required members of Congress to submit requests at least 7 days in advance of visiting facilities holding those facing deportation in ICE custody. Before that policy, issued in June, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit its detention facilities, without prior notice.

The December court ruling cited language in appropriations law that prohibits DHS from using funds to prevent members of Congress from conducting oversight visits to ICE detention centers, or from requiring those lawmakers to ""provide prior notice of the intent to enter"" such facilities.

But in her new memo, Noem ordered DHS to again implement the 7-day notice requirement ""exclusively with money appropriated by the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act),"" not regular appropriations.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law over the summer, provided an unprecedented infusion of funding for immigration enforcement, including $75 billion to ICE alone to bolster deportation efforts and expand detention capacity.

Noem said the policy is needed to protect lawmakers, their staff, ICE detainees and employees.

In Portland, Ore., demonstrators rallied and lined the streets outside of a hospital on Saturday afternoon, where immigration enforcement agents bring detainees who are injured during an arrest, reported Oregon Public Broadcasting.","People have been taking to the streets nationwide this weekend to protest the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics following the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, a 37-year-old woman who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer this week.

At least 1,000 events across the U.S. were planned for Saturday and Sunday, according to Indivisible, a progressive grassroots coalition of activists helping coordinate the movement it calls ""ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action.""

Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible, said people are coming together to ""grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long.""

""Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,"" Greenberg said in a statement on Friday. ""ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent.""

Large crowds of demonstrators carried signs and shouted ""ICE out now!"" as protests continued across Minneapolis on Saturday. One of those protestors, Cameron Kritikos, told NPR that he is worried that the presence of more ICE agents in the city could lead to more violence or another death.

""If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there's very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I'm nervous that there's going to be more violence,"" the 31-year grocery store worker said. ""I'm nervous that there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day I think that's not what anyone wants.""

The night before, hundreds of city and state police officers responded to a ""noise protest"" in downtown Minneapolis. An estimated 1,000 people gathered Friday night, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, and 29 people were arrested.

People demonstrated outside of hotels where ICE agents were believed to be staying. They chanted, played drums and banged pots. O'Hara said that a group of people split from the main protest and began damaging hotel windows. One police officer was injured from a chunk of ice that was hurled at officers, he added.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the acts of violence but praised what he said was the ""vast majority"" of protesters who remained peaceful, during a morning news conference.

""To anyone who causes property damage or puts others in danger: you will be arrested. We are standing up to Donald Trump's chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,"" Frey wrote on social media.

Commenting on the protests, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement, ""the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting, assault and destruction,"" adding, ""DHS is taking measures to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety and our officers.""

Good was fatally shot the day after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota set to deploy 2,000 immigration officers to the state.

In Philadelphia, police estimated about 500 demonstrators ""were cooperative and peaceful"" at a march that began Saturday morning at City Hall, Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson Tanya Little told NPR in a statement. And no arrests were made.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., Good's death ""brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.""","WASHINGTON -- The killing of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer is reverberating across Capitol Hill where Democrats, and certain Republicans, are vowing an assertive response as President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation operations spark protests nationwide.

Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into Renee Good's shooting death and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.

""The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,"" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. ""And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.""

Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Trump and Noem said the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.

Vice President JD Vance blamed Good, calling it ""a tragedy of her own making,"" and said the ICE officer may have been ""sensitive"" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.

But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.

""The videos I've seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement.

""As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,"" she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation ""was devastating, and cannot happen again.""

The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another federal government shutdown when money expires at the end of January.

As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.

""We've been warning about this for an entire year,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.

The ICE officer ""needs to be held accountable,"" Frost said, ""but not just them -- ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.""

Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.

Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.

Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.

""More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,"" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.

Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats splinter between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.

The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest covid-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.

Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.

""I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,"" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border

""Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,"" he said.

In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.

In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent also in Chicago shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., Good's death ""brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.""

""It looks like the fact that a U.S. citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what's going on is out of control,"" he said, ""that this isn't about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.""

Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration's policy, defended the officer's actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.

""Nobody wants to see people get shot,"" said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.

""Let's do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they're standing in front of your car,"" he said. ""She made a mistake. I'm sure she didn't mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211961625_211961041-49107d635f2b4597826ef17f27804316_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:33.138254

What You Need To Know

Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously

One of the lawsuits, which was filed in Florida, contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants' privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana and seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts

Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states.

The challenges align with parts of Trump's agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants' privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit's intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

“This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,"" Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees’ association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of “a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process” if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump's agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump's agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president's social media post.

Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to exclude noncitizens from the apportionment process. That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution's 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau's defense in both cases, despite the intervenors' concerns.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/us_census_bureau_ap,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:36.939463

Here is what she said about the facility: El Paso Times: You made your very first unannounced visit on Dec. 19.
Rep. Escobar: There were a couple of issues that were very alarming to me.
Rep. Escobar: I've had this very conversation with the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee (Mark Amodei, R-Nevada).
El Paso Times: In your opinion, is Camp East Montana a safe and healthy place to detain immigrants as they await deportation?","The largest immigration detention center in the United States continues to grow and concerns over conditions in the facility continue to be raised.

The Camp East Montana facility in El Paso is projected to hold 5,000 detainees for deportation. The facility has grown to a capacity of 3,250 people as of Dec. 19, but held 3,080 people, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said.

U.S. taxpayers are paying $1.26 billion to the Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC to construct and operate the detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The site continues to generate reports of inhumane conditions and human rights violations since it opened in August.

The El Paso Times reported nearly 90 emergency 911 health calls coming from the facility in the first 15 weeks of operation, the Washington Post reported multiple violations during construction and the ACLU reported acts of physical violence against detainees and attempts to force detainees to self-deport.

The facility reported its first death in December 2025. Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés died after being detained there for nearly three months.

While acknowledging some improvement, Escobar concluded that the facility had opened prematurely and was not meeting the minimum federal standards for the care of human beings in its custody.

The facility should have been completed before anyone was detained here and it is clear that they are not meeting federal standards,"" Escobar said. ""Camp East Montana shouldn't be operational.""

The El Paso Times spoke with Escobar after her fourth oversight visit on Dec. 19. Her visit followed a court order that reversed a DHS policy that blocked congressional representatives from making unannounced oversight visits.

Here is what she said about the facility:

El Paso Times: You made your very first unannounced visit on Dec. 19. What did you see, and how was that visit different than your previous three other visits?

Rep. Escobar: I was pleasantly surprised about a couple of things. First and foremost, the ICE agents and staff on site knew about the court ruling because there was no problem getting in. This was an unannounced visit, which by law we've always had the authority to conduct, but it was, you know, these unannounced visits were denied by Secretary (Kristi) Noem and the Trump administration unlawfully. So I was very pleasantly surprised that there was no issue getting in and I was grateful to the ICE agents on staff on site for their professionalism.

The other thing that I was very pleasantly surprised by was that the facility, in general, was clean. It had been clean during my scheduled visits, but what I heard from a number of detainees was that it was dirty and not clean most of the time. And so I was relieved to see that there was significant cleanliness, that was obviously a relief.

El Paso Times: What stands out from your visit on Dec. 19?

Rep. Escobar: There were a couple of issues that were very alarming to me. What is consistent in all of my visits is that there is always something that's alarming. That leads me to the conclusion that the facility is not functioning properly and should not be open until it is functioning properly.

There are two things that were very alarming.

The first was the food, again. As part of my unannounced visit, I told the staff that I wanted to go into one of the pods. The pods are these large rooms where detainees are held, where they basically live, they eat there, and they shower there; their entire existence pretty much is in that one shared room.

I went into one of the women's pods and sat down with a group of women and began visiting with them about the conditions within the facility. And one of my first questions was about the food, because I consistently hear from male detainees and female detainees that the food is inedible. And so one of the female detainees — I think we were there I think by about 9:00 a.m. and I think they received breakfast at around 7:30, if I'm not mistaken — when I asked about the food, she said, ""Let me show you. I actually still have my breakfast, and it's not edible.""

And she brought it to me —they are very small, almost like frozen meal trays — she showed it to me and I held it in my hands, and it was a partially frozen breakfast. It had not been warmed to the point that it was edible. So, I finally got to see evidence of what the detainees were talking about. When I've gone in the past and have been shown the kitchen and the operations of the kitchen — it's not a full kitchen, it's just a place where the food warming happens — everything has looked acceptable and good. But it was the unannounced visit and the fact that a detainee kept her breakfast, happened to keep her breakfast, that allowed me to see that their complaints are absolutely legitimate.

El Paso Times: When we spoke with Lucía Pedro Juan, the Guatemalan woman whose husband died on Dec. 3 and who was deported on Nov. 28, she mentioned that people in her pod were guarding food because they weren't receiving proper food portions. Did you hear anything about hoarding food?

Rep. Escobar: I will tell you the portions were tiny. So, I can understand why they would hoard food. They were very small portions. And of those portions, again, it was half frozen. That breakfast was half frozen.

El Paso Times: What was the second thing that was alarming?

Rep. Escobar: The second thing that was really alarming is nearly every person that I spoke to inside that pod, these were women who were begging to be deported.

One woman broke down in tears and told me she had been shuffled from one detention facility to another over the course of the last few months inside the U.S., and she had asked to self-deport. She was eager to get out of America and get out of the hands of the Department of Homeland Security and return home, but she was given no information about her case or about her deportation. She was given no timeline. She said she consistently asks questions about when she will finally be allowed to leave and be sent home and gets no answers. And as she was telling me her story, a number of other women were nodding and telling me that they were experiencing the same issue.

And so, you know, these are people who are ready to go to their home country, but are being detained in this private facility that's charging the American taxpayer by the day, by the person, for detention. A couple of the women there that I spoke to, actually more than a couple, had been waiting for over two months in this facility.

I flagged that for ICE, and to their credit, the agent that I flagged it to immediately called for other ICE agents to come into the pod with their laptops so that they could try to begin processing some of these women out. Why that hadn't happened before, I do not know. Why this private corporation is holding people who are literally begging to be deported for not just days or weeks, but in some cases months, it leads me to believe that this is a profit-making exercise for this private corporation. And while the American public is being told there's no money for health care, there's no money for nutrition programs for you, American citizens, there seems to be plenty of money for a private corporation detaining people begging to be deported.

El Paso Times: I'm sure you saw we published our story about the 911 calls. Were you able to learn anything more about those attempted suicides or the other emergencies that were being reported? What steps is the facility taking for any mental health crisis?

Rep. Escobar: This was before your story was published. I explicitly asked about the 911 calls and asked to speak to the behavioral health professional on site, and I was a little taken aback initially by personnel’s response, which was fairly dismissive. In fact, one of the comments was ""they sometimes do that to get attention.""

And I spoke to the behavioral health professional and asked what the steps were when someone either expresses suicidal ideation or actually seeks to actively take their own life. And they detailed a process. I did not get specific information on the number of people who that's happened to. I've gotten none of the information I've asked for. Nothing. I've been asking for months now for detailed statistics from ICE and other pieces of information, but this is the least transparent agency that we've had to deal with during the Trump administration. I will say that the Department of Homeland Security in Washington, D.C., is doing everything possible to keep members of Congress in the dark. And it's not just DHS, I mean, all the agencies, but DHS has been the worst.

El Paso Times: How confident are you that detainees are receiving timely attention for medical issues or mental health crises after your visit?

Rep. Escobar: No, I'm not confident.

El Paso Times: In the case of Pedro Juan, she said that she'd been begging her agents and guards to permit her to see her husband. Is there any policy in place that keeps them or why is it that ICE and DHS keep family members apart in these facilities like this, even when they're in the same facility?

Rep. Escobar: There are very strict protocols — this predates Donald Trump — but the idea is that the populations should be kept separately, so the female population and the male population, for the safety of the detainees.

During the first Trump administration, I discovered that even siblings were being separated and kept apart, which was inexplicable for very young children who are being kept apart, children who are traumatized by their detention. I think when we're talking about very young kids, it's one issue, but I totally understand the separate issue of adults.

That doesn't mean, though, that they shouldn't be allowed to see each other and speak to one another. I mean, I would think that the personnel on site have the discretion to be able to allow spouses to speak to each other and check in on one another.

El Paso Times: Especially at a time of a health emergency.

Rep. Escobar: Oh, absolutely, without a doubt. That is some pretty fundamental compassion that should be exhibited within the staff's discretion.

El Paso Times: What steps are there to hold the company running the site accountable?

Rep. Escobar: I've had this very conversation with the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee (Mark Amodei, R-Nevada). He and I have had a number of conversations about accountability. We were promised by ICE director (Todd) Lyons that we would get a copy of the contract for this facility, as well as a list of the vendors that the contractor has subcontracted with. That was the week before the Christmas holiday, that should have been delivered by the end of that week and it was not.

I need help from my Republican colleagues, who are in the majority, to get the administration to give us the information that they have promised us. And to be perfectly candid, I think Republicans have been far too comfortable with giving the administration absolute free rein to do anything that it wants.

El Paso Times: In your opinion, is Camp East Montana a safe and healthy place to detain immigrants as they await deportation?

Rep. Escobar: From the beginning, a facility like this should not be receiving any federal funding if they are not being held to federal standards. The facility should have been completed before anyone was detained here and it is clear that they are not meeting federal standards. Camp East Montana shouldn't be operational.

El Paso Times: Is there anything else you want to comment on about your Dec. 19 visit or anything related to the site that I haven't asked?

Rep. Escobar: I think it's so important. There are, unfortunately, far too many Americans who feel no compassion for fellow human beings who are in custody. So, for those folks who are perfectly comfortable with people who are being detained by the American government, being fed frozen food and living in conditions that are far below federal standards. Even if they don't care about fellow human beings, I hope they care about the fact that their tax dollars are being turned over to a private corporation that is unaccountable to the American public and seems to operate with impunity.","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/08/PTX1/88081335007-070120266-d-8-a-8026.jpg?crop=4952,2787,x0,y257&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-11 09:56:23.705506

Nearly 10 months later, in September 2025, the Trump administration flew the 52-year-old to the Costa Rican capital of San José on an air ambulance.

Randall Gamboa Esquivel had left Costa Rica in good health and crossed the United States-Mexico border in December 2024, according to his family. However, Gamboa was detained by the US authorities for re-entering American soil unlawfully, as he had previously lived there undocumented between 2002 and 2013.

Gamboa was initially held at the Webb county detention center in Laredo and then transferred to the Port Isabel detention center in Los Fresnos, both in south Texas. Nearly 10 months later, in September 2025, the Trump administration flew the 52-year-old to the Costa Rican capital of San José on an air ambulance.

He never came round and five weeks later Gamboa was pronounced dead at a hospital in Pérez Zeledón, his home town, around three hours south of the capital.

The Guardian spoke with relatives, neighbors and old friends in Costa Rica who remain shocked and outraged about what happened. His younger sister, Greidy Mata, said she is still trying to make sense of how his health deteriorated so badly while in the custody of US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE).

In an exclusive interview in Pérez Zeledón, Mata recounted that Gamboa had sounded and looked healthy when they talked via video calls while he was in detention, until 12 June, which marked their last conversation, after which he seemed to vanish. Mata waited for weeks to hear from him, but in fact Gamboa had fallen into a health crisis.

“My brother disappeared and we had to reach out to agencies, lawyers, consulates, anyone willing to help,” Mata said in Spanish, standing across the street from the hospital where Gamboa died on 26 October.

“How is it possible that a man that left healthy, tall, chubby, robust, came back dirty, looked abandoned, with ulcers on his entire body, in a vegetative state?” she said.

Medical records related to Gamboa’s time in US custody and shared with the Guardian show that there was a transfer request for him from the Port Isabel detention facility to Valley Baptist medical center in Harlingen, 28 miles (45km) east, on 23 June.

According to a document included in the medical records and issued by Ice Health Service Corps (IHSC), a service within ICE that provides healthcare in immigration custody and assesses people slated for deportation, Gamboa was hospitalized with an “altered mental status”. The document also indicates he had been taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.

Relatives and friends denied Gamboa had a history of mental illness before he migrated to the US.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent company of ICE, said in an email response when asked about Gamboa’s detention and health that: “While in custody, medical professionals diagnosed him with unspecified psychosis and hospitalized him at Valley Baptist Hospital so he could get proper mental health and medical care.”

McLaughlin added that medical care for those in the custody of ICE includes “dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care”. She added: “This is the best health care that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

By 7 July, Gamboa had been diagnosed with at least 10 conditions, medical documents from the hospital show. Sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to an infection, is listed as his primary diagnosis, followed by rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which damaged muscle tissue breaks down rapidly.

Other conditions outlined in the records included protein malnutrition and toxic encephalopathy, caused by an infection or prolonged exposure to drugs, radiation or metals that ultimately alters brain function.

“I can’t sleep thinking what would’ve happened if we knew he was sick? Why did they keep this information from us? We found out where he was in August,” said Mata, making an effort to keep a calm composure despite crying on the recent December afternoon in Pérez Zeledón when she gave an interview.

“The information didn’t come from the Costa Rican consulate, nor ICE, it came from a lawyer whom we asked for help and who called us saying: ‘I found him in a bed, he follows you with his eyes, but can’t talk, he is in a vegetative state’,” she said.

Costa Rica’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined an interview with the Guardian to discuss Gamboa’s case. It also didn’t answer a series of questions including whether any of their consular officers visited Gamboa during his hospitalization in Texas.

The director of Costa Rica’s migration agency, Omer Badilla, said his office was notified that Gamboa was being deported back to San José, but didn’t receive any details regarding his health.

According to a further document in Gamboa’s medical reports from the hospital, a doctor who visited Gamboa on August 2 wrote: “He doesn’t move or respond. He does blink at times … there is immobility and mutism present. The patient appears exhibiting the decerebrate posturing.”

“Decerebrate posturing” typically refers to a patient’s arms and legs being held stiffly straight, with head arched back and toes pointed down. The doctor also noted that Gamboa was “undergoing tube placement”.

The medication list included in the medical records showed that by 7 August, nearly a month before his deportation to Costa Rica, Gamboa had received IV injections and more than a dozen medications. He was assessed as catatonic.

“At times this all seems like a horror story or a lie,” said Mata, as she prepared to mark Christmas while in mourning for her brother.

She said that when Gamboa came home, there was at first a flicker of optimism. “It was nice seeing and touching him again because it gave us hope that he could recover,” she said, adding: “But the doctors never said that ... and we realized then that the condition in which he arrived was irreversible.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/974cd9b47157276ef9f3311ec9d732bd5bf84bf7/0_116_1440_1151/master/1440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30a0b55e64aa7cb2ae046324b073bc64",N,,2026-01-11 12:57:14.344943

In Illinois, a Democratic state senator has filed legislation that would bar anyone hired by ICE under Trump from obtaining employment in state or local law enforcement.
In conservative Tennessee, a lawmaker has filed legislation that would prohibit federal immigration enforcement actions on school property.
Kathy Hochul signaled she’ll support legislation that would allow residents to bring civil lawsuits against federal immigration officials for constitutional violations.
Fine said the measure is intended to hold federal immigration officials accountable and prevent what she characterizes as escalating violence tied to immigration enforcement.","Some policies were moving before an ICE agent fatally shot Renée Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis mother last week. But her death has been cited by lawmakers as reason to squeeze ICE out of their states.

New York state Sen. Pat Fahy, who sponsored a bill that would prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks and one that would create a state dashboard tracking immigration officials’ activity, said “momentum is on our side.”

“To me, this goes beyond immigration,” she said. “People understand now that masked, armed men in our city and suburban streets [are] seriously eroding any form of public trust in law enforcement. Some of these issues are having more universal appeal.”

Trump administration officials have long opposed local Democratic leaders restricting cooperation with ICE. They have sued local governments over “sanctuary” policies — when local police limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities — and tried to link those policies to federal funding.

President Donald Trump and other administration officials have also said the agent who shot Good acted in self defense — an account that has been contested by local Minneapolis officials. In a statement to POLITICO, White House Spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended ICE activity and pushed back against state Democratic lawmakers.

“ICE officers are facing a massive increase in assaults against them because of dangerous, untrue smears from elected Democrats,” Jackson said. “ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism. Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens.”

State leaders are pursuing different policy responses – but the throughline is that federal immigration authorities may find themselves with headaches in some blue states if the proposals become law.

In Illinois, a Democratic state senator has filed legislation that would bar anyone hired by ICE under Trump from obtaining employment in state or local law enforcement.

In conservative Tennessee, a lawmaker has filed legislation that would prohibit federal immigration enforcement actions on school property. And in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul signaled she’ll support legislation that would allow residents to bring civil lawsuits against federal immigration officials for constitutional violations.

Across the Hudson River, New Jersey lawmakers are pushing to codify the state’s practice that limits state and local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities; bar the government and hospitals from collecting immigration information; and set up guidelines on how health care facilities, schools and other institutions should respond to federal immigration authorities. The suite of bills — which started advancing before the Minnesota shooting — could be on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk this upcoming week.

New Jersey state Sen. Britnee Timberlake, who is sponsoring the bill to write into state law restrictions between local police and federal immigration authorities, during a Thursday committee hearing likened what happened in Minnesota to Nazi Germany.

“Anyone who is an ancestor of a Holocaust survivor will tell you, this is how it starts,” Timberlake said. “If you don’t believe me, just ask the children of the 37-year-old woman from Minnesota, a white American citizen, who was just shot and killed by ICE.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called such language “gross” in a statement to POLITICO.

“From comparisons to the modern-day Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the vilification of ICE must stop,” she said.

Timberlake, in response, told POLITICO “if they want to stop parallels to the Gestapo and Nazi Germany, then they should stop behaving that way.”

In Illinois, Democratic state Sen. Laura Fine introduced a bill that would make anyone hired by ICE during Trump’s second term ineligible for state or local law enforcement positions in Illinois. Fine said the measure is intended to hold federal immigration officials accountable and prevent what she characterizes as escalating violence tied to immigration enforcement. She said it was prompted by what she described as a “deeply disturbing” incident in Minneapolis.

“As a mom, I can’t even fathom it. These children are now going to grow up without their mom,” said Fine, who’s also a U.S. Senate candidate and whose state legislation will be considered when the Illinois General Assembly returns to work this week.

She pointed to the Department of Homeland Security hiring more than 12,000 sworn ICE agents during Trump’s first presidency, more than doubling the agency’s ranks. Fine argues that those hires reflect a shift in the agency’s culture.

“These officers seem to be complicit in the president’s authoritarian campaign,” Fine said. “We have to do everything in our power to stop it and prevent further violence and loss of life.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, struck a similar tone in his State of the State address this week, warning that the Trump administration was “using American cities as training grounds for the U.S. military.”

He and California lawmakers reacted to ICE raids, which began in Los Angeles last year, by passing multiple bills meant to prevent officers from wearing masks and to keep them out of hospitals and schools.

This year, one lawmaker is leading an effort to ban businesses from selling personal data to third parties, specifically citing a fear that information sold could help ICE arrest undocumented immigrants. Another wants to prevent the state’s police officers from working with or volunteering for ICE.

Across the country in New York, there were already signs that Democrats might be more open to addressing immigration issues in this year’s legislative session. Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins announced on Wednesday that she supports the “goals” of a bill that would make it much more difficult for law enforcement to cooperate with ICE. New York state lawmakers are also weighing a measure meant to guarantee undocumented immigrants legal representation when they are facing deportation proceedings, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations and granted anonymity to discuss the private talks.

Fahy, the New York state senator, said she’s spent much of the week coordinating with legislators and activists on the proposals she backs, and has been lobbying Hochul’s office to place immigration at the center of her State of the State address next week.

“Just on what we’ve seen in the last 48 hours, I can’t help but think that we’re going to hear a lot more than what was in the original State of the State script,” Fahy said.

It’s not just blue state lawmakers jumping on proposals. Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Gabby Salinas has introduced a bill in the state Legislature that would prevent immigration agents from entering schools and churches.

Salinas, who immigrated to Memphis as a child from Bolivia, said she initiated the bill a few weeks ago as ICE agents ramped up enforcement in the city.

“What’s happening in other cities potentially can happen here in Memphis and I don’t want us to lose a life or have these adverse events in schools where kids are supposed to be learning,” said Salinas, acknowledging the challenge of getting a bill passed in a legislature that has a Republican supermajority.

But, she said, “The Republican electorate has been very receptive” to the measure, adding, “there’s a difference between elected Republicans and the electorate.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F60%2Fcc%2Fe33b0aac441786895be7e4c39d45%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-56052.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 09:56:29.751527

And – this is why it’s important to include the point about Noem’s apparent corruption – the lawlessness also removes restraints on self-enrichment.
A good opposition party makes their adversaries go on the record as to whether they support killings with impunity.","In the wake of the killing of Renee Nicole Good, Congresswoman Robin Kelly has announced the filing of three articles of impeachment against Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. Predictably, reactions have been muted at best: with the GOP holding both the Senate and the House, impeachment can be dismissed as purely performative, a helpless response to an in and of itself understandable moral imperative of “just do something!”

But such dismissals are too quick: this administration has been running on a promise of impunity at all levels, and Democrats have to start signaling that actions have consequences. They also need to break out of a fateful dynamic: during Trump 2.0, misdeeds and scandals are following each other in such rapid succession that neither the press nor the public ever seem to get to focus on one. Impeachment can concentrate minds and slow down political time.

Of course, on one level it is obscene to make a senseless killing immediately subject to political calculations – what happened in Minneapolis is not a test of Machiavellian savviness, but of one’s capacity for compassion and decency. Trump’s sycophants have been failing it; they rushed into TV studios, spreading lies about Good’s conduct as well as her character, outdoing each other in blaming and smearing the victim. They have also effectively communicated that anyone deemed somehow to stand in the way of Stephen Miller’s will triumphing can be declared a “domestic terrorist” – and treated like the law no longer protected them at all.

As so often, JD Vance turned out to be particularly vile; he also falsely asserted that ICE officers have “absolute immunity,” reinforcing the message to American citizens that there is simply nothing they can do if one misbehaves.

Lies that go unopposed tend to stick, and the rewriting of the history of January 6 demonstrates that Trumpists will be relentless in making everyone repeat them, as they become part of a political loyalty test. Impeachment is one way of creating a truthful record. Impeachment cannot simply be stopped by the House speaker. Kelly has announced that she wants to charge Noem with willfully obstructing congressional oversight, with directing unconstitutional actions, and with abusing her office for personal benefit.

That combination makes sense, because it highlights the particular political dynamic of this administration: from the pardoning of violent insurrectionists on day one, it has signaled that those obeying Trump and working for his benefit – whether political or financial – could count on impunity. And while not every ICE agent is a monster, the number of monstrous acts have been so large that there can be little doubt that the violence and cruelty are systemic and in a sense encouraged from the top. The obscene ads for the DHS – including not just the dehumanizing dramaturgy of cop shows, but outright Nazi iconography – are not somehow irrelevant aesthetics; whoever studies them cannot be surprised if state agents start to act more like death squads.

The imperative of staging spectacular violence – and then lying about the circumstances, laughing about victims, and refusing to be held accountable – is likely to get stronger the weaker Trump becomes politically; after all, there will be more of a need for intimidation. From blowing up fishermen in the Caribbean to having masked men parade around school grounds as if it were Fallujah – the message is that anyone can become subject to arbitrary and unaccountable power. And – this is why it’s important to include the point about Noem’s apparent corruption – the lawlessness also removes restraints on self-enrichment.

Smart aspiring autocrats actually realize that they should at least occasionally do something to convince citizens that legality still exists and that bad actors face consequences. Consolidation of power matters more to them than the kind of unconditional celebration of cruelty that appears popular only with Vance’s very online crowd.

Some might worry that signaling punishment for Trumpists down the line will only increase the lawlessness (and any willingness to prevent the midterm elections from being free and fair). That is not a crazy concern. But, of course, by that logic, one might as well give up on accountability altogether and concede that the initiative – and, ultimately, power – now rest permanently with one’s political adversaries. More important, it seems clear, given the will to lie no matter what, members of this administration do not need excuses grounded in facts in order to escalate – they do it anyway.

A good opposition party takes the lead in framing issues – the same way the GOP did with its impeachment of Biden’s homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas (an effort that failed to remove the man, but reinforced the mindset that the situation at the border was out of control). A good opposition party makes their adversaries go on the record as to whether they support killings with impunity. And a good opposition makes the public focus on symbolic, revealing moments everyone can see: the killing of a mother of three, with the officer then calmly walking away from the carnage he caused; the refusal by ICE agents to let a doctor get close to the victim; and a DHS agent kicking over candles lit in memory of Good, saying: “I don’t give a fuck.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5014d9fdfb327117dc423f6a176c47edb88f932d/281_0_2805_2244/master/2805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d13fbda26a9f683ff1961300f6b55167",N,,2026-01-11 10:58:44.101439

Kremenitzer said ICE has been ""coming into our communities and tearing families apart.""

The protest comes amid rising tensions following recent incidents involving ICE agents. On Wednesday, Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after she refused commands. Federal officials say the agent was acting in self-defense.

Court records show the same agent was involved in another incident over the summer, where he was dragged by a car after trying to arrest someone who was refusing agents' commands to exit the vehicle. The agent has been with ICE for a decade.

""A US citizen was killed the other day Rene Good. We are here with anger in our hearts with what is happening in our country,"" Kremenitzer said.

On Thursday, immigration agents shot and injured two people during a traffic stop in Portland, Oregon. The Department of Homeland Security says the two were Venezuelan gang associates.

But for ICE and border agents—whose livelihoods literally depend on the level of immigration enforcement—it could not be clearer.","On September 30, hundreds of federal law enforcement officers raided a 130-unit apartment complex in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. After rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter, rifle-wielding agents hurled stun grenades, kicked down doors and dragged residents out of their apartments, zip-tying and detaining some of them for hours. The operation, ostensibly targeting an alleged stronghold of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang, resulted in thirty-seven arrests of mostly Venezuelan immigrants. Dramatic footage was posted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on social media alongside the ominous caption: “To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your alley. We will find you.” DHS later conceded that only two of those arrested actually belonged to any gang.

The South Shore raid is a microcosm of the new regime imposed by immigration hardliners at the DHS, the Justice Department, and the White House. Communities targeted by this enforcement blitz are familiar with its hallmarks, from indiscriminate force to the abandonment of due process, vacuous claims of criminality to theatrical violence. The fallout of such tactics is well-documented: a veteran attacked and dragged into a Portland ICE field office; Congressional Candidate Kat Abughazaleh thrown to the ground outside an immigration processing facility in Chicago; a Mexican national fatally shot while driving away from ICE agents; a 79-year-old man body-slammed by Border Patrol agents; NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested by ICE agents under false pretenses. And now, the brutal killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, followed by the Trump administration’s attempts to smear her as a “domestic terrorist.”

ICE’s crackdowns and shock-and-awe operations are being carried out alongside more routine sweeps, in which facial recognition algorithms and the whims of street-level agents—rather than legal status, identification documents, or judicial process—increasingly decide who is detained and deported. With public opposition to the agency reaching fever pitch in many cities, it is worth pausing to ask whether this terrifying spectacle represents something genuinely new. From one perspective, the current enforcement regime reflects longstanding methods of US statecraft, accentuated by the Global War on Terror, including the interiorization of the border into the US mainland, racialized policing, the use of deportation against ideological enemies, and the frequent invocations of ill-defined emergencies or states of exception.

Yet these same methods have been transformed in recent decades by far-right organizational cultures operating within the state. The second Trump administration has harnessed them to build a domestic policing omniforce, based within DHS and given enormous resources by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. By reconfiguring lines of authority and warping agency functions, it is mounting an existential challenge to the existing terms of order that govern the rights of noncitizens, while turning citizenship itself into a more flexible category. How should we understand this latest mutation in the domestic security apparatus created by the Bush administration, augmented by Obama, and left in place by Biden? What institutional dynamics are driving the escalating war on migrants?

To answer, we must first examine Trump’s immigration program to date: the extent to which the existing framework has been remade by this recent surge in detentions and deportations. We can then look at how the agencies themselves laid the groundwork for this project over the previous decades, as they morphed into rogue actors with increasingly radicalized unions—aiding the advance of the far right at the national level.

Interior offensive

The administration’s opening salvo in the transformation of federal policing involved systematically removing legal and institutional barriers to immigration enforcement. Executive actions dismantled watchdog agencies, exposed sensitive data and spaces to immigration authorities, expanded “expedited” removal, and disregarded due process for legal residents and citizens. Millions have been made ineligible for bond and asylum hearings, while temporary protected status (TPS) has been revoked for one group after another. These moves came alongside a break with the fifteen-year-long trend away from interior enforcement. ICE has now shifted its attention away from the US-Mexico border and onto major cities, increasing the rate of interior arrests at an alarming clip, with government data showing ICE on track to deport upwards of 300,000 noncitizens this year.

These institutional attacks were complemented by massive new investments in the domestic enforcement apparatus. Last summer, Trump’s signature domestic bill poured a staggering $171 billion into immigration enforcement through 2029. A glimpse of the line items reveals the sheer scale of the investment: $46.6 billion to complete the border wall; $45 billion to expand immigration detention centers; $18.2 billion for border facilities and initiatives; and $30 billion on top of ICE’s $9.6 billion base budget to bolster deportation and removal operations. ICE’s annual budget increased threefold to around $28 billion through 2029, making it the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country.

The legislation solved ICE’s looming “cash crisis” while increasing its army of lawyers, deportation officers and other support personnel. It strengthened the material links connecting US immigration enforcement agencies as a constituency to the defense, technology, and private prison industries, and now promises to bring state and local police in cooperative districts deeper into the business of policing immigration.

DHS wasted no time making use of the new funds. A slew of generous hiring incentives, including student loan forgiveness and a $50,000 signing bonus, were announced to facilitate the recruitment of 10,000 new ICE agents. By October ICE was struggling to vet more than 150,000 applicants in their hiring pipeline. Assuming federal hiring targets are met, the total number of ICE Deportation Officers will increase from 6,000 to 16,000, while Border Patrol Agents rise from roughly 20,000 to 23,000. These increases are largely in keeping with the agencies’ history of periodic funding spurts at times when border politics moves up the headlines; yet they mark a new era for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal (ERO) team, whose staffing levels had plateaued since the previous interior enforcement surge under Bush and Obama.

Federal spending records show that, as of October, ICE had also increased weapons spending by 600 percent compared to 2024, mostly on small weapons and armor. Another $25 million in contracts has gone to facial-recognition and monitoring software to find and detain the agency’s growing list of targets. These investments reflect not just an expanding force but also an increasingly militarized and technologized one, planning for sustained operations in US cities. It has become routine for immigration agents and allied federal law enforcement officers to use crowd-control tactics like tear gas, flash bang grenades, and rubber bullets alongside excessive physical force to “manage” protesters and apprehend noncitizen targets.

Quantity to quality

While the above figures are impressive by any standard, the shift here is not merely quantitative. The emerging enforcement regime melds federal law enforcement and other personnel into an interoperational whole, focused on mass deportations and ideological policing. The White House has detailed at least 33,000 additional federal employees for ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) duties, taking them from the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, US Marshal Service, and Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. FEMA employees are now tasked with sorting through thousands of ICE job applications, while the agency’s emergency funds have been siphoned to fund detention camps. A December report released by Senate Democrats shows that $2 billion in Pentagon funds have been diverted for immigration enforcement. The number of deputized immigration agents is even higher when counting National Guard troops occupying US cities or local police who have been pulled into immigration task forces.

These moves have already compromised DHS’s other competing obligations, including those most closely aligned with the administration’s own moral justifications for mass deportations, like combatting drug or sex trafficking rings. Even US Citizenship and Immigration Services—the agency tasked with processing citizenship, asylum, and work authorization claims—has been transformed into an enforcement wing, with no compunction in detaining even immigrants when they arrive for naturalization ceremonies.

The crackdown also benefits from the longstanding flexibility in the remits of ICE and Border Patrol itself. In theory, ICE’s jurisdiction is the “interior”—jails, workplaces, and communities—while CBP’s is the “border.” In practice, though, their activities often overlap. Whereas Biden rushed interior resources to the border, Trump has diverted resources from there to boost interior removals. This not only allows for additional manpower; Border Patrol agents can also operate with little transparency or oversight, enjoying special authority to interrogate and detain individuals within an expansive 100-mile “border zone” occupied by over 200 million people. In other words, as long as things remain quiet at the border, this fluid interoperability allows both agencies to focus their efforts on the interior.

Detention data indicates the full extent of this interior surge. When the detainee numbers are broken down by the arresting agency, we see that the proportion of ICE arrests increased from 28 percent of total detained in January to 82 percent as of December 13. The same data shows that the total number of average detainees reached 50,000 in June, a figure not seen since 2019, and exceeded 65,000 by the end of last year—the highest in recorded history.

The new detainees have so far been crammed into what was already a sprawling system of poorly maintained and jerryrigged detention centers, far exceeding the maximum population capacity of 41,500 justified by ICE’s previous budget. While it is estimated that $45 billion in additional funding will expand detention capacity by “at least 116,000 beds,” these resources are unlikely to improve conditions for inmates. Egregious treatment is baked into the institutional design of the detention system. Because immigration proceedings can take months or even years, suspended bond hearings are now funneling more detainees into already overcrowded detention centers. This in turn puts more stress on ICE’s Custody Management and Health Services teams. Supposedly responsible for maintaining detention standards and administering medical aid, they have a long track record of neglect and abuse—which will surely be exacerbated as ICE’s for-profit partners scramble to staff up rapidly expanding private prisons.

New funding lines have also ushered in an era of immigration federalism. ICE heavily relies on cooperation from state, local, and local law enforcement offices to do its work (hence “Border Czar” Tom Homan’s vocal frustration with sanctuary city measures). Programs like 287(g) agreements create such federal-to-local links by subsidizing detention costs and empowering local authorities to make immigration arrests. In practical terms, these efforts multiply the possible locations—such as traffic stops, public spaces, and jails—in which an individual might encounter an immigration authority. Alongside $10 billion in reimbursements for “border states,” an additional $3.5 billion in state and local reimbursements through 2029 are empowering cooperative states to invest in immigration enforcement. The flood of resources could fund thousands of enforcement initiatives in cash-strapped red counties, with at least 730 new agreements inked since January 2025.

Redefining criminality

In April, Homan attempted to blackmail cities by promising more collateral arrests if local authorities did not cooperate with ICE: “sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want—more agents in your community because . . . now we have to send a whole team to look for the bad guy.” This offer was clearly disingenuous. The notion that sanctuary cities could escape ICE by sacrificing “criminal” immigrants was contradicted both by the Trump administration’s staggering deportation quotas—statistically impossible without noncriminal arrests—and the high percentage of detainees without criminal records. Of those arrested and detained by ICE since the beginning of October, 72 percent have committed no criminal offences. Many more detainees have been caught in the crosshairs for minor infractions like parking tickets or nonviolent drug charges. The administration’s recent threats to “denaturalize” foreign-born citizens on ideological grounds suggest that acts of protest or civil disobedience could soon spell deportation for tens of millions of Americans.

This is part of a wider systematic attempt to redefine criminality so as to implicate larger numbers of immigrants and activists—for instance, by expanding the legal definition of “terrorism” to include various forms of political dissent, or by designating fentanyl a “weapon of mass destruction.” Along with these language games, the new enforcement regime has adopted a more expansive view of immigration police work. As an ICE Field Director boasted at a hiring event in Arlington last year, what makes the agency different from other law enforcement is that “[ICE] is an expert in stopping the creation of victims . . . we stop things . . . before they happen.”

“Criminality” has long been the conceptual hinge for the contradictions of the immigration system. For decades, pro-immigration legislators won partial reforms by separating “bad” immigrants from “good” ones, targeting the former for harsh criminal penalties or deportation, while increasing inflows of the latter. There were two benefits to this approach: first, legislative crackdowns on “criminal” immigrants allowed policymakers to pursue expansionary immigration policies by bargaining away the rights of non-citizens; second, it afforded executives greater administrative discretion to use deportations as a form of political currency: increasing or decreasing the rate depending on what happened to be expedient at a given moment. This arrangement suited migrant-dependent business owners, who retained access to a large reserve of non-citizen workers. Without recourse to law, the over nine million undocumented workers in the US are largely under the power of employers.

These dynamics deepened the legal division between citizens and noncitizens in the decades leading up to the War on Terror. Thereafter, new investments in border security allowed immigration agencies to flourish as unaccountable incubators of a hard-right agenda within DHS. This is the foundation on which the Trump administration has built. With organized capital no longer exerting a moderating influence on immigration policy—instead favoring tax cuts, deregulation, and backroom deals on immigration enforcement—the forces now operating the machinery of the state have abandoned the status quo of selective enforcement and pivoted to a scorched-earth strategy of mass deportations. To fully understand this transition, we must look more closely at the institutional politics of ICE and Border Patrol, as it developed from the Bush era onward.

Rogue agencies

Lax oversight and weak internal controls have plagued DHS since its foundation. Beyond carrying out publicly controversial policies such as family separation, Border Patrol agents have been implicated in numerous scandals, including abductions and sexual violence, unreasonable use of force, minor abuse, posting racist messages on private social media pages, and widespread corruption.

The crisis of discipline is an outgrowth of a domestic security state that was revamped to meet the demands of the War on Terror. As investigative journalist Garrett Graff has documented, the rapid expansion of ICE from 9,000 agents before 9/11 to 21,000 during Obama’s presidency led to a dramatic reduction in hiring standards, while the CBP lacked a coherent internal affairs process until 2014. A ProPublica report notes that misconduct investigations became contests between “local CBP supervisors; CBP’s nationwide internal affairs unit; the Homeland Security Department’s inspector general; the civil rights office at Homeland Security; and, in certain cases, the FBI and US Department of Justice.” CBP’s own understaffed internal affairs department was ill-equipped to handle the agency’s growing volume of disciplinary investigations.

The absence of accountability tallied with a crisis of authority in DHS. While both ICE and CBP have benefitted from DHS’s remaking of the security state, it would be wrong to view these agencies as passive beneficiaries of the reforms set in motion by the War on Terror. If anything, the relationship has often been the other way around: militant actors within ICE and Border Patrol have exploited the political contention over immigration to increase their resources, autonomy, and power within DHS—actively shaping the Department in their own image. This political mobilization took place primarily through their respective labor unions, the National ICE Council (NIC) and National Border Patrol Council (NBPC). As organizations mandated to advance the material interests of rank-and-file agents, both became incubators for far-right projects. Both also found an obvious ally in Trump, who in turn saw the unions as a potential power base in DHS.

Insurrectionary energies within NIC and NBPC became especially pronounced during Obama’s first term, as the precarious balance between protecting and punishing immigrants began to falter. Even as Obama ordered record interior removals in a futile attempt to build a coalition around comprehensive immigration reform, key figures within ICE and Border Patrol raged against what they saw as overly accommodationist “open border” policies. This rift set the stage for a protracted power struggle within immigration agencies between more pragmatic factions and radical ones who no longer saw a place for amnesty in the larger calculus of the US immigration system.

In 2010 ICE’s union chief, Chris Crane, filed a “no confidence” vote against then-ICE Director John Morton, citing his support for amnesty reforms as well as inadequate staffing. Crane would later go on to sue the Obama administration over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) executive order, and had to be forcibly escorted out of a 2013 Senate news conference where immigration compromise legislation was being announced. Border Patrol meanwhile came to feel increasingly hamstrung by institutional constraints as it was plagued by repeated corruption and abuse scandals, prompting it to escalate tensions with the Obama White House.

A turning point came in 2016, amid the growing politicization of rank-and-file agents, when the NIC and NBPC decided to cast their lot with Trump: their first ever political endorsements. “[A]ll the people responsible for the problems plaguing America today are opposing Mr. Trump,” claimed the NBPC, warning that “if we do not secure our borders, American communities will continue to suffer at the hands of gangs, cartels and violent criminals preying on the innocent.” The NIC likewise denounced Hillary Clinton as an “open-border radical” whose policies would force officers to “violate their oaths to uphold the law.”

The gambit paid off when Trump won the election and rewarded the agencies with greater enforcement powers, resources, and prestige. But although it saw the new administration as an ally, NIC did not shy away from criticizing Trump when he allegedly conceded to pro-immigration forces. Union representatives claimed the Trump administration had ​“betrayed” its promises by leaving Obama’s ICE team in place (this included Homan, then ICE’s Acting Director, who was accused of waste and mismanagement). Crane published an open letter claiming that Trump was continuing Obama-era policies of understaffing, political correctness, and deals with sanctuary cities. “I don’t believe you will find a group of law enforcement officers,” he wrote, “more hated by their own leadership and managers than the officers of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.”

In 2017, NBPC wielded its now considerable influence to oust Mark Morgan, a reform-minded director and the agency’s first outsider, after only seven months, resenting his alleged support for Comprehensive Immigration Reform’s pathway to citizenship provisions. At the time, the union’s president Brandon Judd remarked in an interview with Fox News that immigrants are “worse than animals, in my opinion . . . Animals do not treat other animals the way MS-13 treats other human beings.” Such dogged commitment to anti-migrant politics on the part of these powerful organizations arguably helped to push the first Trump administration further to the right.

Indeed, the crisis of authority at DHS had by this time begun to worry even the most zealous practitioners of the War on Terror. At the peak of the Black Lives Matter protests of June and July 2020, the Bush-era DHS chief, Michael Chertoff, warned of growing politicization within his former agency, cautioning that DHS personnel had begun “operating in camouflage uniforms with no clear identifying insignia.” Chertoff also claimed that immigration officials had been willfully overlooking DACA applications, in open defiance of a Supreme Court ruling.

This view was quietly endorsed by a bipartisan group of several former and acting Homeland Security secretaries who served as advisors on a 2020 Atlantic Council study on the “Future of DHS.” The report detailed a crisis of morale stemming from criticism of family separation, internal dissatisfaction with so-called catch-and-release policies, and ICE and CBP deployment at Black Lives Matter protests. It also considered whether “a change in Border Patrol culture would be beneficial,” citing Graff’s 2019 exposé on dissent among CBP’s rank and file:

Most Border Patrol agents serving today signed up for a tough job in a quasi-military agency protecting the country against terrorists and drug dealers. They’ve found themselves instead serving as a more mundane humanitarian agency—the nation’s front-line greeter for families of migrants all too happy to surrender themselves after crossing the border. CBP doesn’t have the culture to meet this challenge, nor does it have the manpower or support from the rest of government.

After the 2020 election, the Trump administration tried to use ICE and CBP unions as a lever to undermine the incoming Biden administration. Acting Deputy of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, a future architect of Project 2025, unilaterally declared that all DHS policy changes affecting agents would have to be approved by ICE’s union. When that gambit failed, ICE agents nonetheless continued to defy the new administration’s federal enforcement guidance. In 2022, NIC filed a Labor Department complaint seeking “autonomy” from the American Federation of Government Employees and requesting an audit of its parent organization, the AFL-CIO, which Crane argued were “far-left organizations” with “anti-law enforcement” biases.

Hypertrophy

How should we understand the endgame of the ICE and Border Patrol unions? What is striking about these organizations is the extent to which their material and ideological investments in immigration policing tend to reinforce one another. Opponents of immigration have long argued that restricting numbers will help protect the labor interests of native citizens. Often the connection between the two is highly uncertain. But for ICE and border agents—whose livelihoods literally depend on the level of immigration enforcement—it could not be clearer. For those on the frontlines of the war on immigrants, nativist politics combines with direct material incentives to support zero-tolerance policies which seek to eliminate all forms of amnesty. This is precisely the institutional culture that the Trump administration has sought to tap into by shutting down DHS’s civil rights division and the detention ombudsman’s office.

In late October 2025, a major purge of ICE leadership across the US—said to have been orchestrated by informal Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski—handed greater control of deportation operations to Border Patrol personnel. As a result, the man now leading the charge is Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol veteran who exemplifies the agency’s cowboy culture and whose no-holds-barred immigration raids in rural California had impressed the administration. With the Supreme Court’s blessing, Bovino has brought his trademark style of indiscriminate arrests and aggressive racial profiling to “enemy” sanctuary cities.

The change came amid removal numbers that fell short of the administration’s stated goal. It suggests that even as ICE racks up formal arrest numbers in the US interior, it is Border Patrol that is set to become the dominant force within the expanded enforcement regime. ICE’s numerical expansion will serve as the vehicle for extending CBP’s paramilitary mentality across the interior. As a DHS spokesperson remarked to NBC News: “the administration thinks ICE isn’t getting the job done,” whereas CBP “does what they’re told.”

The close relationship between ICE/CBP and Trump has now, paradoxically, begun to limit Trump’s own room for maneuver. His instinct to insulate farmers and hotel operators from excessive enforcement was scuttled by Stephen Miller, who quickly retracted an order to “hold off on work site enforcement.” Shortly after, the White House made an about-face and emphasized the need to “massively expand” such worksite enforcement absent a congressional “deal.” The episode suggested that the lines of authority connecting Trump to immigration enforcement have undermined the president’s own directives. Now, as Bovino takes the reins, this dynamic is surely set to deepen.

While the reality of the immigration system has long been hidden from swaths of the US population, shifts in public opinion suggest that many are now seeing how radical the existing framework really is. Recent events in Minneapolis and elsewhere reflect its wild extrajudicial excesses, with tactics that exceed the demands of the mission and punishments meted out for their own sake. Trump’s immigration agenda—lawlessness achieved through the hypertrophy of law enforcement—has been laid bare. As ICE and CBP continue to grow in strength and autonomy, various groups (legal residents, federal workers, activists) have come to resemble the traditional targets of immigration clampdowns, unable to rely on rules that might constrain the hard power of the state.

The longstanding practices of these agencies are well-suited to our present moment of flexible citizenship and vanishing due process. Their dramatic expansion marks an unprecedented enhancement of the domestic security apparatus. But while this development is deeply troubling, it is not sudden or inexplicable, nor is it merely a top-down project of the Trump administration. The unconditional flow of money, equipment, and resources to DHS and its immigration sub-agencies—overseen by multiple previous administrations—had already allowed them to operate with minimal accountability for decades. This, in turn, nourished an increasingly assertive anti-migrant politics among the agency’s rank-and-file, whose militant unions fought to override resistance from employers and policymakers alike. Both Democrats and Republicans, following this bipartisan logic, spent years lurching rightward on immigration. Unconstrained resources have thus enabled the growth of the far-right enforcement regime; reckoning with its budgetary and institutional foundations will be necessary to stop it.",https://www.phenomenalworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/enforcement-regime-ice-cbp-michael-macher-phenomenal-world-immigration-fascism-trump.png,N,,2026-01-11 08:56:22.000995

(KLFY) — Demonstrators gathered outside the Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office to protest the agency’s new partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raising concerns about immigration enforcement, civil rights and community trust.

Protesters pointed specifically to the sheriff’s office entering into a 287(g) agreement, a federal program that allows local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE on immigration-related enforcement.

Richard Wheat, one of the protesters, said demonstrators believe the agreement fundamentally changes the role of local law enforcement.

“That 287(g) agreement means that they are not only going to be cooperating with ICE, they are going to be actively enforcing ICE policies,” Wheat said.

Wheat argued that such authority undermines community policing efforts in Acadiana.

“A community policing organization, an organization that is supposed to be here to support Acadiana and the Lafayette community and be a source of trust, is now going to be a more or less secret police,” he said.

Others at the protest said the issue hits close to home for families living in the region.

“A lot of people are affected; innocent people, good people, especially here in Lafayette,” said Nathan Del Rosario. “The people that are here, we need them.”

Del Rosario said younger generations feel a responsibility to speak out about the long-term impact they believe the agreement could have on the community.

“I want this to be a good place for my kids to raise,” he said. “I don’t want to tell them to go out in the street and be careful because something might happen.”

Several protesters also pointed to recent national incidents involving ICE, including the death of Renee Good, which they say has intensified concerns about immigration enforcement across the country.

“She’s a mother,” said protester Amanda Pereira. “It is a shame that a mother of children had to go through that, and that families have to go through that for people to actually stand up.”

Protesters said their goal is for parish leaders and the sheriff’s office to reconsider the agreement and listen to community concerns.

“We are the people. We are the voice,” Pereira said. “At the end of the day, we don’t want ICE.”

Demonstrators said the gathering outside the sheriff’s office is only the beginning, with additional protests planned in the coming months.

Trump signed an executive order a few days before designating antifa, a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists, as a “domestic terrorist” organisation.
Experts raise questions about Noem’s ‘domestic terrorism’ label Information is still surfacing about what transpired before Good was fatally shot.
“Essentially within hours of the incident occurring, labelling this activity as domestic terrorism, what that does is effectively strip domestic terrorism of its significance,” he said, calling it a “blatantly partisan effort to label it as domestic terrorism”.
“So a government official calling her a domestic terrorist isn’t supported in the law and is entirely pejorative and prejudicial.”","United States Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has described the actions of Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis woman killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer on Wednesday, as “domestic terrorism”.

Noem said Good refused to obey orders to get out of her car, “weaponise[d] her vehicle” and “attempted to run” over an officer. Minnesota officials disputed Noem’s account, citing videos showing Good trying to drive away.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said on Thursday on the CNN news channel that Noem’s statement is “an abuse of the term” “domestic terrorism”.

President Donald Trump’s administration has turned to the phrase in recent months, including in an October immigration enforcement-related shooting.

In September, the administration issued a memo calling on law enforcement to prioritise threats including “violent efforts to shut down immigration enforcement”, saying “domestic terrorists” were using violence to advance “extreme views in favour of mass migration and open borders”. Experts said it violates free speech laws.

Good, a mother of three and a poet, lived in the Minneapolis neighbourhood where she was fatally shot. She was a US citizen and had no criminal background, The Associated Press news agency reported. Good’s ex-husband told AP that she wasn’t an activist and he hadn’t known her to participate in protests. Good had dropped off her 6-year-old son at school and was driving home when she encountered ICE.

The Trump administration has ramped up Minneapolis immigration enforcement in recent weeks after news reports about allegations of daycare funding fraud involving the local Somali community.

What is ‘domestic terrorism’?

Federal agencies have their own definitions of “domestic terrorism”.

According to a 2020 memo, the FBI, citing a specific section of the US Code, defines “domestic terrorism” as acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state criminal laws and appear intended to intimidate or coerce civilians; influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses a similar definition, citing a different statute that defines “domestic terrorism” as dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources.

The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023: “Unlike foreign terrorism, the federal government does not have a mechanism to formally charge an individual with domestic terrorism which sometimes makes it difficult (and occasionally controversial) to formally characterise someone as a domestic terrorist.”

In 2022, former FBI agent Michael German, then a fellow with New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, told PolitiFact that 51 federal statutes apply to “domestic terrorism”.

“I think there is and always has been confusion between rhetoric and the law in regard to terrorism,” German told PolitiFact after the Minneapolis shooting. “There is no law that authorises the US government to designate any group or individual in the US as a ‘domestic terrorist’.”

The federal government periodically revises how it describes threats. For example, in 2025, federal officials sometimes used the term “nihilistic violent extremists” to describe perpetrators who don’t subscribe to one ideology but appear to be motivated by a desire to, as one expert put it, “gamify” real-life violence. Experts told PolitiFact that the term is valid but cautioned against its overuse or citing it to obscure other ideological motivations, such as white supremacy.

The Trump administration has broadened the ‘domestic terrorism’ label

The DHS rhetoric around Good’s fatal shooting is similar to another immigration enforcement-related shooting in October. During DHS’s months-long immigration crackdown in Chicago called “Operation Midway Blitz”, a Border Patrol agent shot US citizen Marimar Martinez five times.

A DHS news release described Martinez as a “domestic terrorist” and accused her of ramming her vehicle into the Border Patrol agent’s car, carrying a semiautomatic weapon and having a “history of doxxing federal agents”.

A federal judge granted a motion from prosecutors to dismiss federal charges against Martinez in November.

“Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers’ narratives,” legal analyst Joey Jackson told CNN.

The government’s use of the term goes beyond immigration and the DHS.

After conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s murder, Trump issued a September 25 memo ordering the attorney general to expand “domestic terrorism” priorities to include “politically motivated terrorist acts such as organised doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder”.

Trump signed an executive order a few days before designating antifa, a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists, as a “domestic terrorist” organisation.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi told federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to compile a list of groups “engaged in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism”.

Legal experts have raised alarms about the memo’s potential infringements on the First Amendment.

“Both the order and the memo are ungrounded in fact and law,” Faiza Patel, the director of liberty and national security at the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote. “Acting on them would violate free speech rights, potentially threatening any person or group holding any one of a broad array of disfavored views with investigation and prosecution.”

Experts have also pointed to the memo’s focus on left-wing violence. It does not mention the politically motivated assassination of Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, months before.

“When a policy directive targets one ideological family and leaves others to the footnotes, it sheds any pretense of neutrality,” Thomas E Brzozowski, former Department of Justice counsel for domestic terrorism, wrote on December 12.

Experts raise questions about Noem’s ‘domestic terrorism’ label

Information is still surfacing about what transpired before Good was fatally shot. However, frame-by-frame analyses of video footage by The New York Times and The Washington Post found Good’s vehicle moved towards an ICE agent, but the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of the three shots from his gun from the side of the car as Good veered away.

Brzozowski told PolitiFact that because Good was trying to drive away, to “characterise that as domestic terrorism, I think, is a stretch.”

However, he said the larger concern is that Noem is using the “domestic terrorism” term absent any actual findings before an investigation.

“Essentially within hours of the incident occurring, labelling this activity as domestic terrorism, what that does is effectively strip domestic terrorism of its significance,” he said, calling it a “blatantly partisan effort to label it as domestic terrorism”.

“Now what is domestic terrorism? Whatever the DHS secretary says it is? She can characterise anything she wants as domestic terrorism. She is doing so without any facts to go on.”

Shirin Sinnar, a Stanford University Law School professor, told PolitiFact: “While intentionally ramming a vehicle for a political purpose could amount to terrorism in a different context, the videos of the Minneapolis incident appear to show a woman attempting to drive away from ICE officers, not hit them. Here, the administration’s calling her a domestic terrorist is simply an attempt to malign a protester and justify her killing by an ICE officer.”

German told PolitiFact there isn’t any public evidence to suggest that Good was “engaging in conduct that could have been prosecuted under the terrorism chapter of the US Code”.

“So a government official calling her a domestic terrorist isn’t supported in the law and is entirely pejorative and prejudicial.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-09T055818Z_28740142_RC2GXIAQT78I_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-PROTESTS-1768101856.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-11 10:59:26.767443

Renee Nicole Good's final moments were spent in her maroon Honda Pilot, her son's stuffed animals peeking out from the glove compartment.

She had stopped in the middle of a tree-lined south Minneapolis street and motioned for unmarked government vehicles to drive past.

Whistle blasts pierced the early January chill in a now-familiar community response employed by activists in US cities to alert neighbours to the presence of immigration officers. For several minutes, Good partially blocked traffic on the street.

Some unmarked government vehicles idled, others drove around.

""Go home,"" a bystander yelled.

On a snowy residential street Wednesday morning, Good crossed paths with a 10-year Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer and Iraq War veteran named Jonathan Ross, who was dragged about 100 yards six months before by a driver during an immigration operation in a Minneapolis suburb.

""I was fearing for my life,"" Ross testified during the December trial of an undocumented immigrant who was behind the wheel.

Good and Ross - whose brief confrontation Wednesday ended with him firing his weapon at least three times as she attempted to drive away - are now at the centre of furious debate over the Trump administration's building immigration crackdown, each side angrily assigning blame to the other. Videos of the incident are still emerging, and there's more to be learned.

Good, 37, had dropped off her 6-year-old son at school before she was mortally wounded, according to witnesses and city officials. A US citizen, Good was described as a poet and loving mom.

Ross joined ICE in 2015. He works in fugitive operations in the Minneapolis area and as part of a special response team. Before joining ICE, he served in Iraq with the Indiana National Guard, then became a US Border Patrol agent in 2007.

Now, their fleeting yet violent encounter has made them unwitting symbols of a dark and uncertain time in the nation's history.

More than five years after George Floyd's killing

""Get the f**k out of my neighbourhood,"" a bystander shouted at an armed federal officer in a mask and body armour as he walked behind Good's SUV holding up his cellphone.

The agent, later identified as Ross, pointed his camera at an onlooker later identified as Good's wife, Becca Good, who pointed her cellphone back at him.

In a deeply divided country, that moment on Portland Avenue became a stark example of the unending political finger pointing over President Donald Trump's militarized immigration crackdown in some US cities - and would foreshadow the heightened tensions in the days to come.

Federal officials, including Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly accused Good of trying to use her vehicle to kill or harm ICE agents. She called it an ""act of domestic terrorism.""

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state officials pushed back, blasting the actions of the officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting ""totally predictable"" and ""totally avoidable.""

""This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,"" Frey said. He demanded ICE ""get the fuck out of Minneapolis.""

The shooting occurred more than five years after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police not far from where Good died - which sparked riots and a movement for racial justice in a city still struggling to heal.

Car crashes - many captured on dramatic video - have been a hallmark of the Trump administration's crackdown, including collisions between federal officers and suspects trying to get away and alleged ""ramming"" assaults involving pro-immigration activists. Some crashes have led to shootings, injuries and death.

The incident in which Ross was dragged by an undocumented immigrant on June 17, 2025, occurred when the suspect fled during a traffic stop, pulling the officer along by his right arm. The suspect was convicted in December of assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon and resulting in bodily injury.

The ICE veteran, who repeatedly fired his Taser at the driver in the June assault, sustained a cut to his right arm that required 20 stitches, according to court records. A cut to his left hand took 13 stitches.

Whistles and then gunfire

""On Wednesday … we stopped to support our neighbours,"" Good's wife said in a statement to Minnesota Public Radio.

""We had whistles. They had guns.""

Aidan Perzana, the father of a month-old baby, woke up to the sound of whistles and honking vehicles. He looked out his window and saw ICE officers approaching the maroon SUV outside his home.

Lynette Reini-Grandell, an English professor and poet, was walking along Portland Avenue at the time, like others, recording video of the situation playing out in broad daylight.

""The tension had been building for so long … but it wasn't real until I heard the gunfire,"" she told CNN Thursday.

Reini-Grandell had been outside a nearby elementary school earlier Wednesday following reports of ICE officers in the area.

""The staff and administration were asking people in the community to come and essentially watch while the kids were getting off the school buses … because ICE vehicles had been circling the school all morning,"" she said. ""They were afraid that parents were going to be yanked and there was going to be horrible disruptions to the kids.""

In US cities targeted by ICE, parents, teachers, clergy and community organizers have started informal networks to intervene as immigration raids unfold, including blowing whistles and honking car horns to warn others. Activists say they're creating accountability for the actions of agents; critics call it obstruction.

CNN has been unable to determine whether Good was involved in such a network. What little is known about her comes largely from her wife's statement - and what was captured within the frames of several cameras during her final moments.

When Reini-Grandell returned to Portland Avenue from checking on reports of ICE agents outside a school, the confrontation that ended with Good's death was escalating.

'I'm not mad at you'

The cellphone video captured by Ross offered the closest glimpse into the pivotal moments before he fatally shot Good. A DHS official confirmed the video, obtained by CNN, was recorded by the agent. The footage was originally obtained by conservative Minnesota media outlet Alpha News.

It opens with Ross walking in front of the maroon SUV driven by Good, who had stopped the vehicle perpendicular to the street, obstructing traffic. He doesn't say anything as he walks across the front of the Honda toward the driver's side.

As he rounds the vehicle, Good is seen with her window down. She looks directly at the officer.

""That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you,"" Good can be heard saying in the video. The victim's wife, standing outside the SUV, says to Ross: ""show your face.""

He does not respond. His reflection can be seen in the car window. He holds his phone and keeps moving.

The ICE officer walks around to the back of the SUV, according to the video. Becca Good, who was a passenger in the vehicle and stepped outside before the shooting, tells the officer, ""We don't change our plates every morning, just so you know. This will be the same plate when you come talk to us later,"" in a possible reference to reports immigration officers have swapped license plates during enforcement actions.

She holds the cellphone up to Ross's face.

""You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,"" Becca Good tells Ross.

'Drive, baby. Drive!'

A pair of ICE officers are seen in a separate video approaching Good's SUV. One officer attempts to open the driver's side door, pulling on the handle. ""Get out of the car,"" the officers say repeatedly.

""Get out of the f**king car.""

Becca Good tries to get back in the SUV, but the door is locked.

She is then heard telling Renee Good, ""Drive, baby. Drive!""

Renee Good backs up her SUV slightly, according to the videos. She then starts to pull away. In Ross' video, she turns the steering sharply toward the right, away from the officers.

""She backed up and turned her wheels away from them to drive down the road,"" Perzana recalled.

The car moves forward, and Ross, in his recording, cries out, ""Whoa!"" The video does not show if the SUV made contact with Ross. The camera angle jerks up to the sky.

Good accelerates and appears to clip the officer with her vehicle before he opens fire, according to one video. A separate video with a different angle doesn't capture that possible contact. Instead, the officer is seen moving away from the front of the vehicle and toward the driver's side.

Three gunshots explode in rapid succession, according to multiple videos reviewed by CNN. In Ross' video, the shooting is not visible, but the shots are heard as the phone camera in his hand jostles further and then faces the house behind Ross. Bystanders can be seen outside the house.

The officer first shoots into her windshield and then at close range through the open driver's side window, other videos show.

Ross' camera captures the SUV as it barrels forward. Someone can be heard saying, ""fucking bitch."" The impact of the SUV crashing into a parked car and wooden pole can be heard as the camera pans down to the street.

Becca Good can be seen running down the street to the driver's side of the crashed SUV, staggering back after a while, covered in her wife's blood.

'You guys just killed my wife'

Tyrice Jones, 35, was in his apartment when he heard gunshots and a crash. He went outside and saw the SUV driven by Good had struck the light pole in front of his building.

Jones saw a woman who identified herself as Good's wife. She sat in the snowy front yard of his building, crying alongside her black Labrador, he said.

""You guys just killed my wife!"" she shouted.

A man is heard in one bystander video asking ICE officers if he can check the victim's pulse.

""No! Back up. Now!"" one officer shouts.

""I'm a physician,"" the man says.

""I don't care,"" the officer responds.

""We have medics on scene,"" another officer says.

""Where are they?"" a woman is heard shouting. ""You killed my f**king neighbour.""

Jones captured video of ICE agents at the driver's seat of Good's SUV as bystanders berate the officers. Within minutes, officers lift Good from the driver's seat and place her on the ground. Jones' video later shows several people carrying her by arms and legs to the end of the block.

Emily Heller, 39, who said she had been home making breakfast at the time of the shooting, told CNN it took at least 15 minutes before an ambulance responded. The street was clogged with ICE vehicles, forcing emergency personnel to approach the victim on foot, without a stretcher, according to Heller.

""They were with her for a few minutes and then they carried her limp body away - by her limbs,"" she told CNN.

""My life is forever changed from having witnessed this,"" Heller added.

Becca Good, in her statement to Minnesota Public Radio, wrote: ""Renee leaves behind three extraordinary children; the youngest is just six years old and already lost his father.""

""I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him.""",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--0zBBqNK8--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1767895452/4JV34H2_AFP__20260108__922H2WA__v2__HighRes__UsImmigrationOfficerKillsWomanInMinneapolis_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2026-01-11 10:59:31.001699

The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.","A federal judge said Friday that she expects to temporarily block efforts by the Trump administration to end a program that offered temporary legal protections for more than 10,000 family members of citizens and green card holders.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said at a hearing that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order but did not say when it would be issued. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to end temporary legal protection for numerous groups and comes just over a week since another judge ruled that hundreds of people from South Sudan may live and work in the United States legally.

“The government, having invited people to apply, is now laying traps between those people and getting the green card,” said Justin Cox, an attorney who works with Justice Action Center and argued the case for the plaintiffs. “That is incredibly inequitable.”

This case involved a program called Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, and affects people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. Most of them are set to lose their legal protections, which were put in place during the Biden administration, by Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security terminated protections late last year.

The case involves five plaintiffs, but lawyers are seeking to have any ruling cover everyone who is part of the program.

“Although in a temporary status, these parolees did not come temporarily; they came to get a jump-start on their new lives in the United States, typically bringing immediate family members with them,” plaintiffs wrote in their motion. “Since they arrived, FRP parolees have gotten employment authorization documents, jobs, and enrolled their kids in school.”

The government, in its brief and in court, argued that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to terminate any parole program and gave adequate notice by publishing the termination in the federal registry. It also argued that the program’s termination was necessary on national security grounds because the people had not been property vetted. It also said resources to maintain this program would be better used in other immigration programs.

“Parole can be terminated at any time,” Katie Rose Talley, a lawyer for the government told the court. “That is what is being done. There is nothing unlawful about that.”

Talwani conceded that the government can end the program but she took issue with the way it was done.

The government argued that just announcing in the federal registry it was ending the program was sufficient. But Talwani demanded the government show how it has alerted people through a written notice — a letter or email — that the program was ending.

“I understand why plaintiffs feel like they came here and made all these plans and were going to be here for a very long time,” Talwani said. “I have a group of people who are trying to follow the law. I am saying to you that, we as Americans, the United States, needs to.”

Lower courts have largely supported keeping temporary protections for many groups. But in May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants for now, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million.

The justices lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.

The court did not explain its reasoning in the brief order, as is typical on its emergency docket. Two justices publicly dissented.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa4b369/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3827x2009+0+275/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F38%2F2a6f5d197b7113d85db0ff29b0e4%2Ff3b75c5b57614fddbbdcd86731976c9d,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:46.454336

Speakers talked about US actions on the ground and in the waters around Venezuela and also about the recent death of Renee Good.

Karishma Manzur, a Democratic candidate in New Hampshire for U.S. Senate, spoke about the monetary cost, and loss of lives when the United States engages in war.

Manzur has been a staunch defender of Palestinian human rights and opponent of Israel’s actions in the war in Gaza. Her campaign launch video focused on the struggles of low-income Americans and her own childhood growing up as an immigrant in a working-class family.

On Thursday evening hundreds gathered at the Merrimack Town Hall to protest a possible ICE facility there to hold immigrants before deporting them.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is reportedly considering the Town of Merrimack for a potential facility to detain and deport individuals from the United States.

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

""We're all living in fear right now,"" said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. ""ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that's unacceptable.""

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis police Chief Brian O'Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O'Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted ""agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.""

""This is what Donald Trump wants,"" Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. ""He wants us to take the bait.""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

""Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,"" Walz posted on social media. ""Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don't give him what he wants.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump's administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who ""weaponized"" their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he's frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

""Almost daily I see them harassing people,"" he said. ""It's just sickening that it's happening in our community around us.""

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying, ""De-ICE Minnesota!"" and ""ICE melts in Minnesota.""

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, N.C., because of the ""horrifying"" killing in Minneapolis.

""We can't allow it,"" Eubanks said. ""We have to stand up.""

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers -- at least one in Border Patrol uniform -- approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his ""first and final warning.""

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O'Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening ""all over the city"" and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to accusations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C., to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

The Utah march, called ""ICE Out For Good,"" referring to the death of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, was organized by Salt Lake Indivisible.

""We can see with our own eyes what happened and we can't tolerate being lied to,"" said protester Cassie Hoag.

Hoag said she believes it's important to make her voice and the voices of others heard.

""It helps. It helps me stay resolute in my commitment to our democracy,"" she said.

Demonstrators at the Salt Lake City-County Building chanted, ""No peace, no justice"" and ""ICE out Utah,"" among others. The protesters marched with a variety of signs, including ""Compassion for immigrants,"" ""Make America rational again,"" ""CTR Choose the right, choose love,"" ""Fight ignorance, not immigrants,"" and ""Crush ICE.""

Other signs at the Salt Lake protest said, ""Justice for Good,"" ""Stop abducting our neighbors, no ICE concentration camps"" and ""ICE murderer: Blood on your hands,"" among many others.

Thousands marched in Minneapolis Saturday in a city on edge since the killing of Good on Wednesday.

""We're all living in fear right now,"" said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. ""ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that's unacceptable.""

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O'Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted ""agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.""

""This is what Donald Trump wants,"" Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. ""He wants us to take the bait.""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

""Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,"" Walz said on social media. ""Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don't give him what he wants.""

""We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,"" Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump's administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who ""weaponized"" their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he's frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

""Almost daily I see them harassing people,"" he said. ""It's just sickening that it's happening in our community around us.""

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, ""De-ICE Minnesota!"" and ""ICE melts in Minnesota.""

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the ""horrifying"" killing in Minneapolis.

""We can't allow it,"" Eubanks said. ""We have to stand up.""

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his ""first and final warning.""

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O'Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening ""all over the city"" and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A police helicopter’s search light beamed down on the protesters on Alameda Street, who are outfitted with upside-down American flags and handmade anti-ICE posters.

The street was also the site of clashes between protesters and police in June last year, when crowds gathered to rally against immigration raids and President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard.

Police have blocked off the nearby intersection with squad cars and officers and much of the crowd has dispersed, video reviewed by CNN shows. But a small group of demonstrators appeared unyielding as police tried to usher them away from the buildings.

The Los Angeles Police Department issued a dispersal order along the stretch of Alameda Street where protesters gathered. The department wrote on X on Saturday night, telling demonstrators, “You must leave the area.”

The dispersal order was “in response to protesters engaging in acts of vandalism,” said the LAPD. Approximately 150 protesters had gathered just after 6 p.m. PST, it told CNN.

One person was detained for battery on a police officer after initially fleeing the scene and later returning to the area, the LAPD said on social media.

CNN has reached out to the LAPD for details.

CNN’s Hanna Park contributed to this report.

This post has been updated with additional details.

A group of anti-ICE protesters were seen marching and chanting in downtown Austin, Texas, outside a federal building on Saturday. Several armed law enforcement officials wore helmets and masks and stood outside while holding batons, according to CNN affiliate KEYE.

Demonstrators — some of whom were banging drums — held up a large sign that read: “It’s right to reel against ICE terror.” Other signs said, “Abolish ICE” and “End ICE terrorism.” Some protesters were confronting the officers standing outside the building.

“I’m glad we’re taking to the streets,” one protester, David Whitfield, told KEYE. “I think this is the type of action that we need. We really need people out here right now. I think the turnout could be bigger.”

The Department of Homeland Security posted a new video on X that shows the three minutes and 30 seconds before the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Wednesday.

The video is shot from a height above street level, and far enough away from Good’s vehicle that any words exchanged by or near Good are inaudible.

In the Saturday post with the three-and-a-half-minute video, DHS claimed without providing evidence that Good was “stalking and impeding a law enforcement operation over the course of the morning.”

The new video shows Good’s vehicle partially blocking the street. Several vehicles stopped on the street behind her appear to belong to federal agents, based on activity observed in other videos.

About 10 seconds in, a small group of people in uniform appear to be gathered a short distance away from her on the street.

Several vehicles are able to pass Good’s car during the video.

About 40 seconds into the video, the camera focuses on Good moving in her vehicle as the sound of honking can be heard, but it’s unclear where the honking is coming from.

About three minutes in, law enforcement sirens start to go off and there are more audible car horns. At 3:11, two vehicles pass Good’s car.

From there, a truck that appears to belong to a federal agent pulls up perpendicular to Good and agents get out of the vehicle. Good appears to be motioning to them with her hands.

The agents then exit the vehicle and the video cuts off right before the deadly shooting.

The sun has set and snow flurries have started to fall on protesters in Minneapolis still rallying against immigration operations in their city, days after an ICE agent fatally shot a Minnesota woman.

Saturday’s protest has taken many shapes throughout the day, starting at Powderhorn Park, a historic spot for demonstrations, known as the prime gathering place for the 2020 George Floyd protests. After marching through a Minneapolis neighborhood, the large crowd is now gathered on the street where Renee Good was fatally shot Wednesday.

As thousands of demonstrators were seen protesting across the city throughout the day, Minneapolis police said there have been no arrests.

Now, at the site that has become the center of furious debate over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Minnesotans share warm drinks and blankets as they chant for justice in their state.

A large crowd of protesters is marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles today, holding up signs reading, “ICE out for good” while chanting in unison, “Trump must go now!”

The demonstration is one of more than 1,000 planned across the country today in the wake of the fatal ICE shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, mobilized by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.

Protesters in Los Angeles were heard voicing their outrage against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, flashing other signs that said, “Injustice demands resistance” and “Justice for Renee.”

Several other demonstrations have been underway in cities nationwide as large crowds were seen marching in major cities such as Philadelphia, New York and Washington, DC.

Smaller demonstrations were taking place in other locations such as Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Durham, North Carolina; and Tempe, Arizona, where protesters lined a bridge overlooking a highway.

As more snow covers the ground, hundreds of people are marching on the icy pavement in Minneapolis to protest the fatal ICE shooting of Renee Good.

Repeated chants of Good’s name echoed through Powderhorn Park this afternoon, along with community members’ demands for ICE to leave the city.

Attendees held signs reading, “ICE will melt,” and, “It’s not very pro-life to kill our neighbors,” as they gathered for a rally on the recreational ground, before pouring out into the street and marching through a Minneapolis neighborhood. The crowd stretched for a full block at the height of the march.

This kind of activity isn’t new for Powderhorn Park. The area has a history of being a central hub for demonstrations, notably serving as the prime gathering place for the 2020 George Floyd protests.

Law enforcement is expecting demonstrations to continue here throughout the weekend.

Agents fire pepper balls outside federal building

Loud bangs rang out and agents fired pepper balls at a crowd of protesters outside a Minneapolis-area federal building a short time ago.

A small group of protesters has been pelting cars with snowballs as they leave the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, where demonstrators have been confronting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during daily protests.

According to CNN’s Omar Jimenez, who is on the scene, the law enforcement presence outside the facility increased significantly after several instances of cars being hit with snow and ice, or protesters trying to block vehicles from leaving the facility.

Jimenez reports that rallies at the Whipple building have been more confrontational than other demonstrations around the city, as the location puts protesters directly across from the federal agents they’re protesting against.

A much larger crowd has gathered for a march and a rally this afternoon at Powderhorn Park, elsewhere in Minneapolis.

Protesters gathered in Washington, DC, to condemn the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this week by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

With signs including, “The Trump Fascist Regime MUST GO NOW!!” And “WAKE UP AMERICA,” protesters marched in front of the White House as it rained steadily.

“I’m deeply concerned about the 10th Amendment being downtroddened by this administration and about the lives of common American citizens being endangered by a government that, in my opinion, has gone beyond its law enforcement responsibilities,” said Jack McCarty, a protester who said he is originally from Minnesota.

The 10th Amendment of the Constitution protects states’ rights, and McCarty is calling for state oversight of ICE activity.

When asked by CNN what he believes need to happen to ensure a death like Good’s never happens again, McCarty said, “I think independent accountability and oversight over ICE activities at the state level, in addition to empowering state lawmakers and investigators to be able to hold ICE agents accountable for actions within their state is a step forward to ensuring this tragedy never happens again.”

Another protester, Claudia Schur, joined the march to share her grievances against several Trump administration actions.

“It’s a combination of everything that’s been happening since Trump took office but particularly the invasion of Venezuela and then the murder by an ICE agent in Minneapolis is just, it’s too much,” Schur told CNN.

“There’s no rules anymore, no shame, no integrity,” Schur added while holding a sign that said, “ICE Out.” “It’s just a country I can’t even, I can’t, I don’t recognize.”

Meanwhile, Julia Doherty — who marched alongside Schur — shared concerns about the polarization of the country.

“There’s no sense of community. We’re just so polarized, it’s horrifying,” Doherty said. “And we need to stand up and do whatever we can to, to effect change. Trump is out of control.”

Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison were initially invited into the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building near Minneapolis to exercise their congressional oversight duties, according to Omar.

Shortly after being let in, two officials approached the congresswomen and said they had received a message the lawmakers were no longer allowed to be there, Omar said.

The explanation they were given is because the building’s funding, in part, comes from President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” Craig said.

Upon entering the facility, Omar said they were able to observe “about 20 people that were being detained there.”

They were told showers were available for detainees, although the congresswomen said they did not see them. Those inside the facility also told the lawmakers detainees are not held there long enough to need hygiene products, “which is insane,” Omar added.

Morrison said the lawmakers were not allowed to speak to the detainees and said she saw no beds for them.

The three representatives have let Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security know they “were violating federal law,” Craig said.

“This administration continues to use Minnesota as a political stunt. Earlier this week, it got a woman killed,” she added. “It is our job as members of Congress to make sure that those folks detained are treated with humanity because we are the damn United States of America, and we don’t treat people the way that this administration is treating people in our country.”

Twenty-nine people were detained, cited and released after an overnight anti-ICE protest in downtown Minneapolis, according to police.

The demonstration started peacefully around 7 p.m. local time — “mainly a noise protest,” according to Police Chief Brian O’Hara — outside the Canopy by Hilton Minneapolis Mill District hotel. There were over 1,000 participants, O’Hara said today at a news conference.

The protesters marched on Washington Avenue before some individuals “broke off” from the group and began spraying graffiti and causing damage to the windows of the Depot Renaissance Hotel, O’Hara said.

Demonstrators have been protesting outside hotels where they believe federal agents are staying in the Twin Cities.

Over 200 police officers and state troopers responded to the incident, according to the police chief.

By 1 a.m. the crowd dispersed. One officer suffered minor injuries and 29 people were detained and later released, according to a Minneapolis police spokesperson.

CNN reached out to the Canopy and Depot Renaissance hotels for comment.

This post has been updated to reflect the latest total provided by authorities for the number of people detained.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey blasted Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s “reckless” actions at a news conference this morning.

Frey described an incident where ICE detained an individual from a car “in the middle of a pretty significant street,” then left the car there without putting it in park.

“This was a car that was rolling down the street that could have hit anybody, including my own family members that live not too far from here,” Frey said. “So, this is not about safety, clearly. If this was about safety, you wouldn’t do stupid things like that. Somebody’s going to get hurt. Somebody has gotten killed.”

Local authorities are getting “dozens and dozens” of 911 calls specifically about immigration enforcement “every single day,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara added.

The “vast majority” of protesters in Minneapolis are demonstrating peacefully, according to Mayor Jacob Frey.

The mayor said there are “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds” and claimed that is what President Donald Trump wants.

“We cannot take the bait,” Frey said at a news conference this morning.

To people who have damaged property or caused harm to others during protests, Frey said “we’re not going to let that happen,” adding they would be arrested.

He thanked community members who are trying to calm things down and keep the peace at demonstrations.

The mayor said he saw a video of what he claimed was an “agitator, clearly from the far-right” who was “coming in and trying to rile up the crowd” at a recent demonstration.

“He was trying to make the crowd take the bait so that they would give the authorization — or at least an excuse — to the Trump administration to come in even more,” Frey said.

He said it was “so awesome” to see the crowd ignore the man.

“They were basically blowing him off,” Frey told reporters.

Germany's border with Poland is more than 400km (249 miles) long, surrounded by huge stretches of isolated farmland, dense forest and small villages.
""Is it possible for you to stop all illegal migrants?""","In Germany's fight against people smugglers, Chief Inspector Igor Weber's Pasewalk force is on the frontline.

Their patch includes part of the border area with Poland, a popular spot for people trying to cross illegally into Germany.

At the police headquarters, the chief inspector shows us a line of smugglers' vehicles, which were seized while trafficking illegal migrants.

One of them is a refrigerated van which has been stripped back to carry human cargo.

Inside, sodden sleeping bags and a few abandoned clothes are the only traces of the migrants who were moved like cattle for hundreds of miles.

Chief Inspector Weber says there were 18 people inside when they found the van.

There are no seats or seatbelts, just the hard, cold floor to sit on during the long journey.

A hole in the roof left them exposed to the elements, so the rain could pour in, making conditions even more grim.

This isn't a one-off.

Officers show us pictures of other illegal migrants they have stopped.

One shows nine East Africans found crammed in a car, again without seats or seatbelts.

In another, 16 exhausted Somalis rest on the grass.

Many of the migrants have been travelling for months.

Route to Germany

After leaving Africa, the Middle East or Asia, Chief Inspector Weber says lots of people now come via Russia, travelling through Belarus, into Latvia, Lithuania and on to Poland.

They keep driving until they cross into northeastern Germany and straight into the patch patrolled by the Pasewalk force.

As a result, the fight against illegal migration has become a daily game of cat and mouse.

Germany's border with Poland is more than 400km (249 miles) long, surrounded by huge stretches of isolated farmland, dense forest and small villages. The perfect place to hide.

Throughout the day, the chief inspector takes us to different areas which have become crossing hotspots.

We drive to a quiet checkpoint surrounded by fields, which we are told is one of the places people traffickers try their luck.

It's manned by two Polish guards when we arrive.

The chief inspector explains the smugglers send a spotter car out to the top of a small hill above the checkpoint.

From there, the countryside opens up, allowing them to see if there are any controls in place. If there aren't, the smugglers then drive in with the illegal migrants.

The smugglers take a photo of them in front of a sign proving they have brought them to Germany and then leave the migrants to walk the rest of their journey alone.

It's a complex and well-funded criminal racket.

'Insidious' smuggling business

But the German government has had enough. Border checks have been tightened up and asylum rules made stricter.

We watch as police search the cross-border train, looking for anyone trying to sneak in that way.

But as we drive around rural routes filled with hiding places, the challenge facing authorities is clear.

""Is it possible for you to stop all illegal migrants?"" I ask the chief inspector.

""No,"" he replies. ""No border is 100% closed - that doesn't exist. In my professional experience, people always manage to overcome even the biggest walls or fences, but you can make that more difficult.""

It seems Germany has done just that: in 2025, illegal entries were down 25% compared with the year before, according to figures from the interior ministry.

""Who do you think's winning? The police and border control, or the smugglers?"" I ask.

""There are no winners in this business. The biggest losers are the migrants. That's just the way it is. Smuggling is a very insidious business - it's all about money,"" Chief Inspector Weber replies.

Hardening views

Germany's attitude to asylum seekers has radically changed.

In 2015, people cheered as refugees arrived at German train stations under Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy.

The move saw more than a million, mainly Afghan and Syrian asylum seekers, enter in a year.

In the past decade, views have hardened.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has soared in the polls, fuelled by its anti-immigration policy.

In response, the ruling coalition has also got tough; by November 2025, deportations were already up 15% on 2024.

But some recent deportation flights have been controversial.

In the summer, a plane carried 81 criminals back to Afghanistan, while in December, Germany deported a convicted criminal to Syria for the first time since the start of a 14-year-long civil war.

Now the government is hoping to strike a deal to deport more Afghans as well as return Syrians.

Despite criticism from human rights groups, it is standing by its policy.

""It is necessary we show the people that we are able to control who is coming to Germany and who [is] not,"" Germany's foreign minister Johann Wadephul told me at a recent news conference.

""So that is the deeper reason why we are controlling the borders now, and we are doing this in accordance with international law.""

Traditionally the EU country which took the most asylum seekers, Germany has slashed first-time applications by more than half so far this year.

The government says it's proof its stricter policies are working.

But as Germany toughens up its asylum system, nearly a million people are living with rejections, and the largest number are from Afghanistan.

They say they're living in limbo.

'I'm not a criminal'

At a church in Berlin, I meet Sayed who has just found out his application has been rejected.

He says returning to Afghanistan is a death sentence.

Terrified, he asks us not to show his face as he tells me his story.

""They [the German authorities] rejected me and said it's safe to go back to Afghanistan,"" he explains.

""Everyone knows the consequences if a believer goes to Afghanistan. They won't survive there.""

I ask him if there's any reason he can think of for the rejection?

""I have never done anything wrong in my whole life and I'm not a criminal,"" he replies.

For his pastor, Dr Gottfried Martens, it's a sadly familiar story.

His congregation includes 1,400 asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Iran.

He believes asylum applications have fallen not because of the government crackdown, but because of changes inside countries like Syria, where many refugees come from.

He says the tough new rules mean some of his congregation have already fled rather than risk being deported to Afghanistan.

""There has been a framing in the speeches of German politicians and for them, all Afghans are criminals,"" he says.

It's a claim ministers would refute.

Germany's problem may soon become UK's

I ask what those who have had their applications rejected will do now?

""Our people see no other way than to look for a country outside of the European Union, which is in fact the UK, because they know when they stay here then they will be dead pretty soon,"" he replies.

If the pastor is right, Germany's problem may soon become Britain's.

Those fleeing know since Brexit it's much harder for the UK to return people to Germany.

Whether Sayed joins a small boat crossing is undecided.

I ask if he understands the view of many Germans that they've taken some of the highest levels of asylum seekers in the world and enough is enough?

""Enough is enough? They are talking about human rights,"" he says. ""As a human, it's my right to be free to live.""

Looking at the statistics available for 2025, on paper Germany's crackdown seems to be working.

Initial figures show illegal migration is down, deportations are up and asylum applications have more than halved.

A new government in Syria and EU deals with other countries to curb the flow of migrants have undoubtedly also played a role.

But the question is, has Germany solved its migration problem or simply moved it on? Are those fleeing war and persecution now just paying smugglers to take them to other countries they hope are safe havens?",https://e3.365dm.com/26/01/1600x900/skynews-migrants-europe_7131100.jpg?20260109150238,N,,2026-01-11 01:58:51.455055

His family is scattered across the globe, some in the United States, others in Europe and four siblings still in Venezuela.","LIMA, Peru -- Almost immediately after U.S. forces deposed Venezuela’s president, officials from Washington to Lima, Peru, began encouraging some of the 8 million Venezuelans who have scattered themselves across the Americas over more than a decade to go home. But that idea had not even crossed the mind of Yanelis Torres.

The 22-year-old graphic designer was too busy printing T-shirts with images of captured former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro overlaid with phrases like “Game Over.” Her clients in Lima’s largest textile market were snatching them up within hours of the news of Maduro’s downfall.

Settled or undocumented, many of the millions of Venezuelans spread across Latin America received news of Maduro’s capture with joy but also caution, especially after hearing U.S. President Donald Trump say that he would work with Maduro’s vice president, now interim President Delcy Rodríguez, rather than the opposition.

Despite leaders in Peru and Chile echoing U.S. suggestions to return to Venezuela, the diaspora does not appear ready to do so. Venezuela’s economy remains a shambles and with the exception of Maduro and his wife, the government remains in place.

“I have a lot of things here,” Torres said from her shop in a bustling Lima neighborhood, adding it would take time for things to change in Venezuela. “You’ve got to keep an eye on it, know what’s going on, but not lose hope.”

There are nearly 7 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees in Latin America. Colombia tops the list with 2.8 million, followed by Peru with 1.5 million. A further estimated 1 million are in the United States, according to the most recent data from R4V, a network tracking the diaspora and coordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration.

They were driven out by compounding political and economic crises. An estimated 8 in 10 people in Venezuela live in poverty in a country that was once one of Latin America’s wealthiest, with the world’s largest proven oil reserves.

Some have found work or started small businesses, while others tried to the reach the U.S. or bounced from country to country. Over the past year, thousands have been deported to Venezuela or third countries and many more could be near the end of their protected status in the U.S.

Eduardo Constante, 36, left Venezuela in 2017 in the middle of a “hunger crisis.”

Speaking from a migrant shelter in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, he recalled his journey. He had spent three months in Colombia, a country overwhelmed by the numbers of arriving Venezuelans; three years in Peru, which he left during the pandemic because they wouldn’t give him the vaccine; and then three more years in Chile, where he was unable to legalize his status.

Finally he made the long trek through South America, the Darien jungle and up to the U.S. border just in time for Trump to close it to asylum seekers.

“I had plans in Europe, but if things settle down in Venezuela, I’m going to Venezuela,” he said. His joy at Maduro’s ouster was moderated by the worries of the family he still has there over food scarcity and security forces that search people’s cellphones for signs of opposition, he said.

Maureen Meyer, vice president for programs at WOLA, a Washington-based human rights organization focused on Latin America, said “we’re nowhere near where we’re going to have a country where people that fled … feel that they could be comfortable returning.”

And if Venezuelans are forced to leave the countries where they are now, either under pressure or via deportation, they will be even more vulnerable to organized crime groups in the region seeking to exploit them now that the business of smuggling them north has dropped off.

Yohanisleska de Nazareth Márquez, a 22-year-old Venezuelan, heard of Maduro's capture while riding across Mexico on a bus with her 3-year-old.

They had left Venezuela in February 2024 and turned themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol that June. She was picked up by U.S. immigration agents in Pennsylvania last year and deported to Mexico with her son on Jan. 1.

They were headed with other deportees to the southern state of Tabasco when she heard about Maduro. “We all shouted with joy ... it was what we all wanted,” she said.

Still getting her bearings, Márquez planned to apply for asylum in Mexico and try to find work but she is worried. She doesn't know how long they will be allowed to stay in the shelter and she heard about kidnappings in the area.

“I’m afraid of being out on the street with my son alone. It's a bit dangerous here,"" she said.

Meyer said forces were building to create a “perfect storm” for Venezuelans like Marquéz who found themselves outside their country and without legal status.

Their prospects are not looking good.

In Chile, ultra-conservative President-elect José Antonio Kast, who will take office in March, made deporting hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants central to his campaign. This week, Kast said “they have 63 days left to leave our country and to have the possibility of returning with all of their papers in order.”

Peru and Colombia are also scheduled to elect new presidents this year, and immigration will be a focus.

This week, Kast met with Peru’s interim President José Jerí, and among the ideas that both men have mentioned is creating some sort of humanitarian corridor passing through Chile, Peru and Ecuador to make it easier for Venezuelans to return home.

“Some of these big host countries, how they decide to respond to the population that are already in their countries and those that may come will be key,” Meyer said.

In Santiago, in the eight-block “little Caracas,” initial celebrations with car horns, shouts and reggaeton music, had calmed.

Alexander Leal, 66, who arrived with his wife in 2018, expressed hope as he sold homemade ice cream in the southern hemisphere summer. His family is scattered across the globe, some in the United States, others in Europe and four siblings still in Venezuela. He dreams of returning one day.

“It won’t be this year, but maybe it will be next year,” he said. “That is everyone’s aspiration, that the country is fixed.” He said Trump’s help would be necessary.

Yessica Mendoza, a 27-year-old Uber driver and mother, knows that she is one of the thousands of undocumented immigrants in Kast's sights, but she plans stick it out. “Returning is not an option.”

Venezuela’s neighbor, Colombia, has received more Venezuelans than any other country and has largely been applauded for its efforts to help them settle, like an offer of 10-year residency permits.

A close security ally of the United States, Colombia is navigating a tense moment in its relationship with the U.S. under President Gustavo Petro, who has sparred with Trump and at times been the target of his ire.

Ángel Bruges, a 54-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in Bogota for six years with his wife and daughter and runs an empanada business there, expressed gratitude for Colombia’s hospitality. He said he did not celebrate Maduro’s capture and is well aware of the fear his relatives still in Venezuela live with. “Returning would be crazy,” he said.

Back in Peru, Torres, the graphic designer, was measuring her expectations.

It has been four years since she left Venezuela. She hoped for the possibility of returning for long visits with her family there some day. But for now, she talks of how “marvelous” Peru is as she fields orders for more T-shirts featuring her country’s deposed president, telling people that if she does not have what they want, she will make it.

In a five-page order, Judge Indira Talwani of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts granted a 14-day stay of the Trump administration’s decision last month to cancel the immigration program, known as the Family Reunification Parole Program, while legal challenges continue.

The order is the latest rebuke in a protracted battle between the Trump administration and the courts over a series of Biden-era immigration policies that Mr. Trump has attempted to cancel.

In a statement on Dec. 12, the Department of Homeland Security said it would end family reunification parole programs for migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras. The agency said the programs had “security gaps caused by insufficient vetting that malicious and fraudulent actors could exploit to enter the United States.”

It added that migrants currently enrolled in an F.R.P. program who did not have a pending permanent residence application would lose their legal status on Jan. 14.

On Dec. 29, a group of migrants challenged the Department of Homeland Security over the programs’ termination. They argued that D.H.S. “fell well short of satisfying their most basic obligations” of due process when it canceled the programs.

In the challenge, lawyers representing the migrants estimated that more than 10,000 migrants, more than a quarter of whom are children, would lose their legal status in the U.S. as a result of the administration’s decision.

In Judge Talwani’s order, she said that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the programs, failed to provide adequate written notice to the affected migrants after the administration tried to cancel them.

The department had claimed in a Dec. 15 Federal Register notice, which explained how the programs’ termination would be administered, that the notice itself “satisfies the requirement that DHS provide written notice upon the termination of parole.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10DC-REUNIFICATION-mkwb/10DC-REUNIFICATION-mkwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 01:58:21.228358

We extend our solidarity to the victims, their families, and all community members impacted by the violence of President Donald Trump's mass deportation machine.

As the federal government spreads lies and attempts to sow division around these events, it is important for those of us fighting for justice and democracy to be clear in this moment. What happened in Portland is not an isolated incident. What we are seeing on our streets today is a coordinated campaign of state terror.

ICE is not a legitimate law enforcement agency–it is an armed gang tasked with terrorizing and ethnically cleansing our communities. Since its creation in 2003, it has been defined by human rights abuses, family separation, and a complete lack of public accountability. Its very existence is a clear and present threat to public safety.

As councilors, our lived experiences and histories ground our resolve. We are immigrants, children of immigrants, and descendants of those rounded up by their own government. We carry the trauma of knowing that injustice begins with dehumanization and bureaucratic cruelty. We remember that when our families were targeted, too few spoke up and too many looked away.

While the two Oregonians shot by agents have fortunately both survived, this tragic incident serves as a grave warning to our community and our leaders that now is the time to speak up. Justice does not look like people being extrajudicially killed or injured. Due process is a requirement of democracy guaranteed to citizens and non-citizens alike. Now is the time to take urgent and decisive action to hinder the ability of these reckless forces to operate in our city.

Here at home Portlanders are demanding that we unmask all law enforcement and do more to verify agents' identities and investigate any unlawful activities. Related legislative efforts, spearheaded by Councilor Sameer Kanal, have so far been met with considerable resistance from police and some City leaders. We need our police force to stand with Portlanders facing ICE, not with ICE facing Portlanders.

At the state, regional, and federal level this looks like supporting community-led efforts to track and document ICE raids, providing legal and financial support to victims and their families, and demanding that our congressional delegation immediately pursue articles of impeachment of the President, and passing legislation to defund and dismantle ICE.

Several groups quickly organized Saturday’s events after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed an unarmed woman in her vehicle in Minneapolis, federal Customs and Border Protection agents shot and wounded two Venezuelan immigrants in Portland and recent U.S. military attacks in Venezuela that led to the arrest of president Nicolás Maduro. Many joined chants and held signs calling for both the abolishment of ICE and for the U.S. to leave Venezuela.

Local nonprofit immigrant advocacy groups and doctors’ advocacy groups, the national progressive grassroots organization Indivisible and the Portland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America organized the demonstrations.

Salem

Roughly 800 people gathered on the north end of Salem’s Capitol park, waving signs and chanting while a steady stream of drivers on Center Street honked their horns in support.

Thom Gapen, who handles communications for Salem Region Indivisible, said organizers knew they had to do something as soon as they heard news on Wednesday that a Minneapolis woman, Renee Nicole Good, had been shot and killed by an ICE agent in her car.

Organizers put together several large protests last year, including getting 10,000 people on the streets of Salem for the nationwide No Kings Day protest in mid-October. They were exhausted and needed a break, Gapen said, and they didn’t expect to have to organize a demonstration so quickly in 2026.

“We knew after the holidays that we were going to jump back in and get busy, but we did not think this would happen, and we did not think that this would be the reason,” Gapen said. “I mean, we’re not even one week into the year, and people are getting killed by rogue agents.”

State Sen. Deb Patterson, D-Salem, walked around the crowd talking with Salem residents. Patterson said she’s working with other legislators, including some Republicans, on bills for the upcoming short session that begins in February to respond to the Trump administration’s crackdown on Oregon and other Democratic states.

“We’re a blue state. The federal government’s already targeting blue states, whether we’re on the street or not,” Patterson said.

Lawmakers haven’t released bill language yet, but they’ve discussed ideas to bar federal agents from wearing masks and support lawsuits against federal officers who enter people’s homes without permission. They’re expected to share more details during pre-session meetings next week.

Portland

More than 200 people, including Portland City Councilor Angelita Morrillo, Oregon leaders of the American Civil Liberties Union and the anti-war veterans’ group About Face, gathered along the Willamette River waterfront.

For Portlander Glenn Hoerner, defunding and eliminating ICE is a priority, and he said he was compelled to join the protest out of “pretty simple outrage.”

“It’s pretty simple for me. I’m a Brown man in a situation where Brown people are getting rounded up. American citizens. Seeing people who look like me just being taken just pisses me off,” he said. “We can’t fix anything until we have basically secret police off the streets.”

By mid afternoon on the other side of the Willamette River, nearly 200 people were protesting outside the Legacy Emmanuel Medical Center in northeast Portland at an event organized by a local immigrant rights group PDXCD Portland Contra las Deportaciones. The group is protesting what organizers characterized as Legacy making itself the “go-to hospital” for ICE agents to bring people injured during arrests.

Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, one of two Venezuelan immigrants shot by a U.S. Border Patrol officer on Thursday, is recovering at the hospital.

Jennifer Black, a retired doctor and member of the local advocacy group Doctors for Democracy, said she was protesting because she is concerned with ICE’s impact on patients getting needed health care, and accounts from group members who work for Legacy that federal officers are being allowed unlawful access to patients and patients’ medical information.

“People are now afraid to come in for care. They can now be, I guess, kidnapped from our offices, from our hospitals, and we’re here today because there are a lot of rumors that Legacy is not respecting HIPAA, which is the privacy rules that govern our work with our patients,” she said.

The Oregon Nurses Association, a union representing more than 24,000 nurses in the state, has called on Legacy’s President Bahaa Wanly to sign a legally binding memorandum of understanding that ensures a number of patient rights are upheld when the target of an ICE arrest is brought to the hospital.

They include restricting law enforcement access to patients in the hospital without a warrant or the proper legal authority and affirming that under federal law, law enforcement officers are not authorized to make medical decisions for patients or interrupt or terminate care.

At least one more protest was scheduled to take place in downtown Portland from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. A protest organized by the groups UpRisePDX and Operation Inflation and Portland Frog Brigade outside of the ICE processing facility south of downtown Portland is scheduled for 7 p.m.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the actions of Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis woman fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, as ""domestic terrorism.""

Noem said Good refused to obey orders to get out of her car and ""weaponize(d) her vehicle"" and ""attempted to run"" over an officer. Minnesota officials dispute Noem's account, citing videos showing Good attempting to drive away.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a member of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, said Jan. 8 on CNN that Noem's statement is ""an abuse of the term"" domestic terrorism.

The Trump administration has turned to the phrase in recent months, including in an October immigration enforcement-related shooting.

In September, the administration issued a memo calling on law enforcement to prioritize threats including ""violent efforts to shut down immigration enforcement,"" saying domestic terrorists were using violence to advance ""extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders."" Experts said it violates free speech laws.

Good, a mother of three and a poet, lived in the Minneapolis neighborhood where she was fatally shot. She was a United States citizen and had no criminal background, The Associated Press reported. Good's ex-husband told the AP that she wasn't an activist and he hadn't known her to participate in protests. Good had dropped off her 6-year-old son at school and was driving home when she encountered ICE.

The Trump administration has ramped up Minneapolis immigration enforcement in recent weeks, following news reports about fraud in the Somali community.

What is domestic terrorism?

Federal agencies have their own definitions of domestic terrorism.

The FBI, citing a specific section of the U.S. code, defines domestic terrorism as acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state criminal laws and appear intended to intimidate or coerce civilians; influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping, according to a 2020 memo.

Homeland Security uses a similar definition, citing a different statute that defines domestic terrorism as dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources.

The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in 2023, ""Unlike foreign terrorism, the federal government does not have a mechanism to formally charge an individual with domestic terrorism which sometimes makes it difficult (and occasionally controversial) to formally characterize someone as a domestic terrorist.""

In 2022, former FBI agent Michael German, then a fellow with New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice, told PolitiFact that 51 federal statutes apply to domestic terrorism.

""I think there is (and always has been) confusion between rhetoric and the law in regard to terrorism,"" German told PolitiFact after the Minneapolis shooting. ""There is no law that authorizes the U.S. government to designate any group or individual in the US as a 'domestic terrorist.'""

The federal government periodically revises how it describes threats. For example, in 2025, federal officials sometimes used the term ""nihilistic violent extremists"" to describe perpetrators who don't subscribe to one ideology but appear to be motivated by a desire to, as one expert put it, ""gamify"" real life violence. Experts told PolitiFact that the term is valid, but cautioned against overuse or citing it to obscure other ideological motivations such as white supremacy.

The Trump administration has broadened the domestic terrorism label

The DHS rhetoric is similar to another immigration enforcement-related shooting in October. During DHS's months-long Chicago immigration crackdown dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" a Border Patrol agent shot U.S. citizen Marimar Martinez five times.

A DHS press release described Martinez as a ""domestic terrorist"" and accused her of ramming her vehicle into the Border Patrol agent's car, carrying a semiautomatic weapon and having a ""history of doxxing federal agents.""

A federal judge granted prosecutors' motion to dismiss federal charges against Martinez in November.

""Ultimately, there was a determination when everything was evaluated that there were serious questions about the officers' narratives,"" legal analyst Joey Jackson told CNN.

The government's use of the term goes beyond immigration and DHS.

After conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder, Trump issued a Sept. 25 memo ordering the attorney general to expand domestic terrorism priorities to include ""politically motivated terrorist acts such as organized doxing campaigns, swatting, rioting, looting, trespass, assault, destruction of property, threats of violence, and civil disorder.""

Trump signed an executive order a few days before designating antifa, a broad, loosely affiliated coalition of left-wing activists, as a domestic terrorist organization.

WATCH: What is antifa and why Trump wants to label it a terrorist organization

Attorney General Pam Bondi told federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to compile a list of groups ""engaged in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism.""

Legal experts have raised alarms about the memo's potential infringements on the First Amendment.

""Both the order and the memo are ungrounded in fact and law,"" Faiza Patel, Brennan Center for Justice director of liberty and national security, wrote. ""Acting on them would violate free speech rights, potentially threatening any person or group holding any one of a broad array of disfavored views with investigation and prosecution.""

Experts have also pointed to the memo's focus on left-wing violence; it does not mention the politically motivated assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a member of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor party, months before.

""When a policy directive targets one ideological family and leaves others to the footnotes, it sheds any pretense of neutrality,"" Thomas E. Brzozowski, former Justice Department Counsel for Domestic Terrorism, wrote Dec. 12.

Experts raise questions about Noem's 'domestic terrorism' label

Information is still surfacing about what transpired before Good was fatally shot. However, frame-by-frame analyses of video footage by The New York Times and The Washington Post found Good's vehicle moved toward an ICE agent, but the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of the three shots from his gun from the side of the car as Good veered away.

Brzozowski told PolitiFact that since Good was trying to drive away to ""characterize that as domestic terrorism I think is a stretch.""

However, he said the larger concern is that Noem is using the domestic terrorism term absent any actual findings before an investigation.

""Essentially within hours of the incident occurring labeling this activity as domestic terrorism, what that does is effectively strip domestic terrorism of its significance,"" he said, calling it a ""blatantly partisan effort to label it as domestic terrorism.""

""Now what is domestic terrorism? Whatever the DHS secretary says it is? She can characterize anything she wants as domestic terrorism. She is doing so without any facts to go on.""

Shirin Sinnar, Stanford Law School professor, told PolitiFact, ""While intentionally ramming a vehicle for a political purpose could amount to terrorism in a different context, the videos of the Minneapolis incident appear to show a woman attempting to drive away from ICE officers, not hit them. Here, the administration's calling her a domestic terrorist is simply an attempt to malign a protester and justify her killing by an ICE officer.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-09T214408Z_659725779_RC2VXIAI859C_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 01:58:24.316200

ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday as she drove away after a confrontation with officers. The Trump administration has said Good presented a threat to agents, but protesters across the country have rallied to dispute that narrative.

On Saturday, roughly 400 demonstrators filled Austin City Hall's front plaza, chanting ""No peace! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!"" alongside a roaring brass band.

Teacher Joanna Ford said she's been struggling to have conversations with her eighth-graders about the events in recent weeks, specifically Good's death and the U.S. deposition of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Her students, two of whom recently fled Venezuela, are looking to her for answers that, she said, she doesn't necessarily have.

""What are we doing, you know? It's just really disheartening,"" she said. ""I feel like Ms. Good['s] death is now going to be a catalyst, and if nothing changes after this, then I'm sorry. I feel like we're doomed to become a fascist state.""

Elizabeth Gray, a longtime city employee who's now retired, said the killing of Good was ""entirely avoidable."" She said ICE's unwanted presence in cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., represents a breakdown in how local and federal government should function.

""I think it symbolized a complete separation of government, what government is supposed to do and what government is doing,"" she said. ""And I think that this murder symbolized the complete failure of our government to do — to be of, by and for the people.""

Austin-area Congressman Greg Casar joined the City Hall rally Saturday, urging Austinites to keep protesting as he read a note from Good's wife that emphasized ""there is good in this world"" and that people should choose ""courage and kindness.""

""There has to be a world where things get better,"" Casar said to close out the rally.

Outside the Capitol the night before, Renee Fuentes and her friend Monica Castillo waved Mexican flags along 11th Street as drivers whizzing by blared their horns in support.

Fuentes said what happened to Good is scary. She said when she was growing during the Reagan administration immigrants were welcomed by the federal government. To Fuentes, Good's shooting hows that federal immigration authorities are targeting citizens and noncitizens alike.

""That could have been me, it could have been her, it could have been any of us that are here right now,"" she said. ""You can't even be American with ICE anymore. Everybody should be afraid of ICE right now, not just immigrants, but us, as well.""

Fuentes was one of dozens of demonstrators who gathered Friday outside the Capitol gates. The peaceful demonstration lasted roughly an hour, with a handful of Department of Public Safety troopers watching from the Capitol lawn.

The “Ice Out for Good” campaign held demonstrations in small towns and major cities, including some that have been central targets of President Trump’s immigration crackdown. The protests came three days after an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen at the wheel of a car, during an encounter in South Minneapolis.

Almost immediately, conflicting interpretations of the killing — which was captured in video from several angles — divided the country along ideological lines. State leaders in Minnesota described the ICE agent’s action as an unjustifiable use of lethal force against a civilian who was trying to leave the scene. For their part, Trump administration officials claimed that Ms. Good was a left-wing domestic terrorist who tried to run over the ICE agent, and that the agent acted in self-defense.

In light of the killing in Minneapolis and another shooting in Portland, Ore., where Border Patrol agents shot and wounded two people in a car on Thursday, activist groups, including the organizers of the “No Kings” and “Hands Off” demonstrations last year, called for a weekend of “nationwide mobilization.”

“Renée Nicole Good and the Portland victims are just the most recent victims of ICE’s reign of terror,” one of the groups, the 50501 movement, said in a news release. “ICE has brutalized communities for decades, but its violence under the Trump regime has accelerated.”

The Trump administration has been mounting large enforcement operations in one city after another; in Minneapolis, the target has been primarily Somali immigrants. As has happened elsewhere, the federal agents descending on neighborhoods in Minneapolis have been met by protesters carrying cameras and whistles.

In Minneapolis, the public reaction to the killing of Ms. Good has been swift and angry. Law enforcement officers have used tear gas against protesters outside a federal building near the Minneapolis airport. Gov. Tim Walz, who has urged calm while denouncing the shooting in stark terms, has alerted National Guard troops in the state to be ready in case of unrest. And President Trump has dispatched more federal agents to the city.

By the weekend, demonstrations had spread to other cities.

New York City

In Lower Manhattan, demonstrators gathered in front of ICE’s New York field office under a steady rain, many of them saying they had come out for the first time in response to Ms. Good’s death.

Leah Silverman, 20, a college student from Arizona, said she happened to be in New York for the weekend when she decided to join her first protest against ICE. She said she’d been deeply alarmed by Ms. Good’s death — a “blatant murder in the street” — and by how quickly the Trump administration had moved to establish its own narrative around the shooting.

“People are willing to ignore what their eyes see,” she said. “I’m here to say that I’m disappointed and angry with what I saw.”

Washington, D.C.

Chants of “ICE out for Good!” and “Trump must go now!” echoed in front of the White House as protesters gathered Saturday in a driving rain. Some carried signs displaying Ms. Good’s likeness.

Rebecca Martin, a 46-year-old physician from Falls Church, Va., said she was motivated to brave the elements by ICE agents’ refusal to allow a bystander who identified himself as a physician to treat Ms. Good after the shooting.

“If someone has a medical need, I’m going to treat them,” she said, adding that she believed ICE’s treatment of Ms. Good was “inhumane.” “I think ICE has lost privileges to be working in public,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10nat-ice-protests-top-3pm-gljq/10nat-ice-protests-top-3pm-gljq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 21:57:11.876317

WASHINGTON (AP) — The killing of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer is reverberating across Capitol Hill where Democrats, and certain Republicans, are vowing an assertive response as President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation operations spark protests nationwide.

Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into Renee Good’s shooting death and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.

“The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. “And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.”

Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Trump and Noem said the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.

Vice President JD Vance blamed Good, calling it “a tragedy of her own making,” and said the ICE officer may have been “sensitive” from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.

But Good’s killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.

“The videos I’ve seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement.

“As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,” she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation “was devastating, and cannot happen again.”

Homeland Security funding is up for debate

The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration’s immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another federal government shutdown when money expires at the end of January.

As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good’s death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.

“We’ve been warning about this for an entire year,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.

The ICE officer “needs to be held accountable,” Frost said, “but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.”

Congressional Democrats saw Good’s killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration’s tactics.

Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.

Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents’ authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.

“More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,” said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.

Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats splinter between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump’s hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.

The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country’s largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.

Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE’s conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.

“I’m not completely against deportations, but the way they’re handling it is a real disgrace,” said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border

“Right now, you’re seeing humans treated like animals,” he said.

Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers

In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.

In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent also in Chicago shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., Good’s death “brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.”

“It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what’s going on is out of control,” he said, “that this isn’t about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.”

Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration’s policy, defended the officer’s actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.

“Nobody wants to see people get shot,” said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.

“Let’s do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they’re standing in front of your car,” he said. “She made a mistake. I’m sure she didn’t mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.”",https://wyomingtruth.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/download-11.webp,N,,2026-01-11 01:58:28.361476

Protests continue in Minneapolis as people there march in opposition to President Trump's immigration actions and the ICE shooting that killed Renee Good earlier this week. NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán is in Minneapolis and joins us now. Sergio, thanks so much for being with us.

SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Glad to be with you, Scott.

SIMON: You were out in the streets last night. What did you hear from people?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yeah. This particular protest I went to last night started outside a hotel where organizers say they believe ICE agents are staying, and it moved around downtown to a few other hotels. Now, some of the protesters tried to breach at least one hotel and vandalized at least one building, and that led to multiple arrests. Now, most people I talked to say they were out in the streets marching for two reasons. One was to honor the life of Renee Good. They wanted to remember her and process her killing together as a community. The other reason was to send a message to the Trump administration that Minnesotans do not want immigration agents in their city. That's what Minneapolis resident Dan Cragey (ph) told me.

DAN CRAGEY: The city is not safe right now with them here. I want my voice to be heard. I want my presence to be seen. And I want my daughters to see what's happening and to see what strength and resilience looks like.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Cragey also mentioned something others have told me, Scott. The city of Minneapolis has gone through so much trauma in the last five years, and they're tired of fighting.

SIMON: Before the killing of Renee Good, Minnesota had had several mass shootings just in the last year, and, of course, we recall the murder of George Floyd at the hands of local police. Does this come up in conversations you have with residents?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: A hundred percent. Residents here told me that they're sad, angry and hurt, and there's this feeling that this shooting could have the same effect and inflict as much trauma as the killing of George Floyd, which sparked some of the largest racial justice protests since the Civil Rights Movement. Yesterday, I went to the spot where Renee Good was killed. It's now a makeshift memorial full of flowers, art and candles. And there I met Ashley Burris (ph), who lives in Minneapolis. She says this moment is sad but also heartwarming because the community is coming together.

ASHLEY BURRIS: We saw it happen after the murder of George Floyd. We're seeing it happen again. No one is stronger than Minnesotans. We stand by each other. We protect each other, and we do right by each other.

SIMON: Sergio, remind us why President Trump sent a surge of immigration agents into the city in the first place.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Mostly to target the Somali community in Minnesota, which is the largest in the U.S. Last month, Trump called Somalis, quote, ""garbage"" and said he does not want them in the country. And right-wing influencers and other conservatives have been accusing Somalis of committing fraud in the state. Now, those allegations gained traction within the Trump administration and are part of the reason for the surge in immigration agents. However, despite all of this, the Somali community continues to push back. That's what Haleel Omar (ph), a Somali activist, says.

HALEEL OMAR: This administration is bringing a lot of fear, and I think that's their goal. But as Somali Americans, as Minnesotans, we're not going to fall for that. We're going to stand up because we're greater than fear. We believe in - that, you know, this storm is going to pass.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Omar says the Somali American community is also standing up for Renee Good.

SIMON: And, Sergio, the Trump administration has said it will continue its crackdown in Minnesota, right?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Yes. The administration claims they're making the community safer by launching this operation. And they're certainly not backing down, Scott. In fact, I witnessed something kind of surreal happen yesterday. A rally was taking place where Renee Good was killed, and at least one SUV with federal immigration agents drove by the memorial. That SUV was trailed by a car with anti-ICE activists who were honking. Again, surreal, but this is Minneapolis right now.

SIMON: NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán in Minneapolis. Thanks so much.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: You're welcome.

Billings protesters speak out on Venezuela attacks, ICE enforcement

With signs and chants like “Free Maduro, free him now!” and “ICE out of our neighborhoods!”, the participants vocalized their dissatisfaction not only with foreign policy, but also with recent domestic enforcement actions. One chant echoed concerns over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

“We're protesting here today because Trump has launched yet another illegal war, this time on the nation of Venezuela,” said organizer Lain Dorsey. “Trump has made it perfectly clear that the entire reason that the U.S. is going to war with Venezuela is for Venezuela's oil.”

The protest was organized by a local chapter of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO), a national group of socialist revolutionaries. Dorsey described the military action as a violation of international law.

""Trump has called Nicolás Maduro a dictator, but he's acting like a dictator by sending out his ICE thugs to kidnap men, women, and children, children from schools, and to murder civilians in broad daylight,"" said Dorsey. ""It's absolutely shameful.""

They also expressed fear that the administration's policies, both abroad and at home, could impact ordinary people, including residents of Billings.

""Trump isn't just going to war with Venezuela. He's going to war with members of our community. Our neighbors are being affected right now by his administration,"" said Dorsey. ""ICE is murdering U.S. civilians, and it could be someone in Billings next, very easily.”

The encampment plan was part of a larger effort by the city to comply with a legal settlement with the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, which had sued over the city’s handling of the homelessness crisis.

Kin, in his ruling, said the city is allowed under the Brown Act to confer with its attorneys in closed-door meetings to discuss legal strategy.

“However, what the City cannot do under the Brown Act is formulate and approve policy decisions in a closed session outside the public eye merely because such decisions are in furtherance of a settlement agreement,” Kin wrote.

Karen Richardson, a spokesperson for City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto, said her office had no comment on the decision, which was issued earlier this week.

The ruling delivered a victory to the Los Angeles Community Action Network, which advocates for homeless residents and had sued the city over the closed-door deliberations.

Lawyers for LA CAN have warned that the city’s goal of removing 9,800 encampments over four years has created a quota system that could make sanitation workers more likely to violate the property rights of unhoused residents. Under the agreement, the city must reach its encampment removal target this summer.

“The City Council approved an extremely controversial plan to clear almost 10,000 encampments entirely in secret,” said Shayla Myers, the group’s attorney. “They never disclosed the plan before they voted on it, or even after, and the only one they disclosed the plan to was the business community.”

Lawyers for the city have offered contradictory explanations for what transpired during the Jan. 31, 2024, meeting. Now, LA CAN is seeking a court order requiring that the city produce all records — including audio of the closed-door deliberations — to show what transpired.

The city’s strategy for clearing 9,800 encampments has become a major sticking point in its long-running legal battle with the LA Alliance. U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ruled that a tent discarded by sanitation workers can only count toward the city’s numerical goal if its owner has been offered housing or shelter first.

Feldstein Soto’s legal team, in a memo to the council, said later that the judge had “reinterpreted” some of the city’s settlement obligations.

In this week’s ruling, Kin found that the city violated the Brown Act a second time in May 2024, when the council went behind closed doors to take up another agreement — this one between the city and L.A. County on the delivery of homeless services.

The LA Alliance first sued the city and county in 2020, alleging that too little was being done to address the homelessness crisis, particularly in Skid Row. The city settled the case two years later, agreeing to create 12,915 new shelter beds or other housing opportunities by June 2027.

After that deal was struck, the city began negotiating an accompanying agreement with the LA Alliance to reduce the number of street encampments. Those talks dragged on for more than a year.

The LA Alliance ran out of patience, telling Judge Carter in February 2024 that the city was 447 days late in finalizing its plan and should be sanctioned. The group submitted to the court a copy of the encampment removal plan, saying it had been approved by the City Council on Jan. 31, 2024.

Video from that day’s meeting shows that council members went behind closed doors to discuss the LA Alliance case. When they returned, Deputy City Atty. Jonathan Groat said there was nothing to report from the closed session.

LA CAN demanded that the city produce any vote tally on the encampment plan. The city declined to do so, saying there was no vote.

“To this day, [we] still don’t know who voted for it, or even if a vote was taken at all,” Myers said.

Lawyers for the city have argued that they were not required to issue any report from that closed session meeting. They also have said that the Brown Act allowed the two agreements — the one on encampment removals and the other with the county — to be discussed behind closed doors.

Carter ruled last year that the city had failed to comply with the terms of its settlement agreement with the L.A. Alliance. On Tuesday, he ordered the city to pay $1.6 million to cover the group’s legal fees.

The judge also instructed the city to pay about $201,000 for fees incurred by LA CAN and the LA Catholic Worker, which have intervened in the LA Alliance case.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d34d435/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2F38%2F759ab403423da62ec5ccf982b481%2F1502909-me-100-day-fire-anniversary-ces-1637.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 22:56:57.077995

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON – A whiff of fresh air was felt and prevailed in the California Department of Justice after Trump Administration backed away from its efforts to federalize and deploy California National Guard

The action came after a Supreme Court decision leading to the subsequent withdrawal of Trump administration’s motion to stay and allowed lower court order ending the extended federalization of the California National Guard to go fully into effect.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta marked the High Court decision as a major litigation victory.

The Trump Administration’s capitulation comes on the heels of a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in a related case, Illinois v. Trump, rejecting its nearly limitless conception of presidential authority to federalize the National Guard and the activities those troops can engage in.

Prior to this, the Trump Administration’s exerted legal effort to block an order by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ending the continued federalization and deployment of California National Guard troops in and around Los Angeles.

Earlier in Washington, President Trump said his administration was removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland but added in his social media post that federal forces will “come back” if crime rates go up. Local leaders in those cities and Democrats have said the deployments, which have faced legal setbacks and challenges, were unnecessary. They have accused the Trump administion of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence to justify sending in troops.

Trump, a Republican, has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, Memphis and Portland were necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from portesters.

In Sacramento, Governor Gavin Newsom earlier issued a statement in response to President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth backing down in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — and the court returning the California National Guard to state command and control and conclusively ending their deployment in an American city, against American citizens.

“I’m glad President Trump has finally admitted defeat: we’ve said all along the federalization of the National Guard in California is illegal,” Newsom said in a statement sent to Philippine News Today.

“The President deployed these brave men and women against their own communities and without regard for the constitution and federal law,” Newsom added.

“We welcome our California National Guard servicemembers back to state service, where they can continue to serve and protect the people of California — long delayed due to Trump’s political theater,” the governor said.

“I direct California National Guard leadership to work expeditiously to return state service members home to be with their families as soon as possible following their demobilization from federal service,” Newsom said.

The latest admission of defeat by Trump and his followers comes in the wake of a 6-3 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in favor of the State of Illinois in a similar case.

The deployment of California National Guard troops ended earlier after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused to pause the District Court’s preliminary injunction order with respect to the deployment, but the troops remained federalized.

With the withdrawal filing, the Trump Administration agrees to allow the District Court’s order with regard to the federalization of these troops to go into effect, allowing for the return of command of these troops to Governor Newsom for the first time since they were initially federalized in early June.

“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a President desperate to be king. From the political display in MacArthur Park to their unlawful participation in indiscriminate immigration raids, the militaristic deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets has left lasting scars in Angeleno communities. There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical,” recalled Attorney General Bonta.

“Now, in the face of a stinging rebuke by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump Administration is backing away from its efforts to federalize and deploy California National Guard troops. I’m incredibly proud of my team who worked nights and weekends to defend the Constitution and bring about an end of the President’s unlawful overreach of executive power. While our rule of law remains under threat, our democratic institutions are holding. My office is not backing down — and we’re ready for whatever fights lie ahead,” said Bonta.

In November last year, Bonta filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. Illinois in support of Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s lawsuit challenging the federalization and deployment of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago.

In the brief, Attorney General Bonta, along with Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, argue that 10 U.S.C. 12406 does not support the Trump Administration’s extraordinary attempt to deploy members of the military to the streets of Chicago. Congress enacted

“The Trump Administration is tying itself in knots in its attempt to justify the unjustifiable — the deployment of military troops to American streets during a time of undeniable peace and order,” argued Bonta. “There is no rebellion. There is no invasion. And there is no inability of regular forces to execute the law. At least one of these preconditions must be met for the invocation of 10 U.S.C. 12406, yet the President’s evidence for any of these has been entirely unsatisfactory and some would say nonexistent. I urge the Supreme Court to reign in this Administration’s reckless interpretation of this century-old statute before the President’s vision of a militarized America is fully realized.”

Before this, Bonta also secured a final ruling blocking the unlawful deployment of California National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon over the objections of both states’ governors.",,N,,2026-01-10 23:56:35.829298

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.","The Minneapolis gathering was one of hundreds of protests planned in towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest Saturday. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Saturday. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz posted on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump’s administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he’s frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He was among thousands of protesters, including children, who braved sub-freezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, on Saturday because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on Saturday morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26010731840947-e1768088266455.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-10 20:57:00.985737

A new, 47-second video published online by a Minnesota-based conservative news site, Alpha News, on Friday, and later reposted on social media by the Department of Homeland Security, shows the shooting from the perspective of ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fired the shots on Wednesday.

With sirens blaring in the background, Ross, 43, approaches and circles Good’s vehicle in the middle of the road while apparently filming on his cellphone. At the same time, Good’s wife was also recording the encounter and can be seen walking around the vehicle and approaching the officer.

A series of exchanges occurred.

“That’s fine, I’m not mad at you,” Good says as the officer passes by her door. She has one hand on the steering wheel and the other outside the open driver’s side window.

“US citizen, former f—ing veteran,” says her wife, standing outside the passenger side of the SUV holding up her phone. “You wanna come at us, you wanna come at us, I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy.”

Other officers approach the driver’s side of the car at about the same time, and one says, “Get out of the car, get out of the f—ing car.”

Ross is now at the front driver’s side of the vehicle. Good reverses briefly, then turns the steering wheel towards the passenger side as she drives ahead, and Ross opens fire. The camera becomes unsteady and points towards the sky, then returns to the street view showing Good’s SUV careening away.

“F—ing b—-,” someone at the scene says.

A crashing sound is heard as Good’s vehicle smashes into others parked on the street.

Minnesota officials slam federal agencies

President Donald Trump’s administration has defended the ICE agent who shot Good in her car, painting her as a “domestic terrorist” and claiming Ross – an Iraq War veteran – was protecting himself and the fellow agents. The White House insisted the video gave weight to the officer’s claim of self-defence – even though the clip does not show the moment the car moved away, or him opening fire.

Local officials in Minnesota have condemned federal agencies for excluding them from the probe, and a local prosecutor said on Friday that federal investigators had taken Good’s car and shell casings from the scene.

“This is not the time to bend the rules. This is a time to follow the law… The fact that Pam Bondi’s Department of Justice and this presidential administration has already come to a conclusion about those facts is deeply concerning,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told a news briefing on Friday.

“We know that they’ve already determined much of the investigation,” he said, adding that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, within its department of public safety, has consistently run such investigations.

“Why not include them in the process?” Frey said.

Good was the fourth person to be killed by ICE agencts since Trump launched his immigration crackdown last year.

Good’s wife, Becca Good, told local media that they had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to “support our neighbours”. “We had whistles. They had guns,” she said.

The Minneapolis killing and a separate shooting in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday by the Border Patrol have set off protests in multiple US cities and denunciations of immigration enforcement tactics by the US government.

Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into Renee Good’s shooting death and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.

“The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. “And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.”

Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Trump and Noem said the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.

Vice President JD Vance blamed Good, calling it “a tragedy of her own making,” and said the ICE officer may have been “sensitive” from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.

But Good’s killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.

“The videos I’ve seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in a statement.

“As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,” she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation “was devastating, and cannot happen again.”

What to know about the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE officer in Minneapolis

Homeland Security funding is up for debate

The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration’s immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another federal government shutdown when money expires at the end of January.

As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good’s death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.

“We’ve been warning about this for an entire year,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.

The ICE officer “needs to be held accountable,” Frost said, “but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.”

Congressional Democrats saw Good’s killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration’s tactics.

Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.

Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents’ authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.

“More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,” said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.

Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats splinter between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump’s hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.

The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country’s largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.

Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE’s conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.

“I’m not completely against deportations, but the way they’re handling it is a real disgrace,” said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border

“Right now, you’re seeing humans treated like animals,” he said.

Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers

In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.

In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent also in Chicago shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., Good’s death “brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.”

“It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what’s going on is out of control,” he said, “that this isn’t about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.”

Feds’ statements after Minneapolis driver killed by ICE officer echo pattern from Midway Blitz in Chicago

Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration’s policy, defended the officer’s actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.

“Nobody wants to see people get shot,” said Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga.

“Let’s do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they’re standing in front of your car,” he said. “She made a mistake. I’m sure she didn’t mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Capitol_19089-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-10 18:56:54.517306

Complex Concepts Simplified Adverse credibility determination: A finding that the adjudicator does not believe the applicant’s account.
Conclusion Chen v. Bondi illustrates the Second Circuit’s deferential posture toward agency credibility determinations when supported by multiple inconsistencies and insufficient corroboration.","Introduction

In Chen v. Bondi (2d Cir. Jan. 9, 2026) (summary order), petitioner Yong Chen, a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China, sought review of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (“BIA”) decision affirming an Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) protection.

Chen’s claims rested on an asserted factual narrative that he practiced Christianity in China, was arrested during a church raid, and suffered abuse and related consequences (fine, medical treatment, and reporting requirements). The central issue on review was whether the agency’s adverse credibility determination—based on inconsistencies between Chen’s testimony, his asylum interview, and a supporting letter, as well as limited corroboration—was supported by substantial evidence.

Although the court issued a nonprecedential summary order, the decision is an instructive synthesis of the Second Circuit’s credibility and corroboration framework under the REAL ID Act.

Summary of the Opinion

The Second Circuit denied the petition for review. It held that substantial evidence supported the agency’s adverse credibility finding because Chen provided multiple inconsistent accounts about key and ancillary facts (including whether he was baptized, when his mother learned of his arrest, the number of people arrested, reporting cadence, and travel time to church), and he failed to provide readily available corroboration (such as letters from pastors or fellow church members) to rehabilitate his testimony.

The court further held that Chen’s explanations—nervousness, alleged interpreter issues, and claimed misunderstanding of interview questions—did not compel acceptance by a reasonable factfinder. Because asylum, withholding, and CAT relief all rested on the same discredited factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination was dispositive of all claims.

Analysis

Precedents Cited

Wangchuck v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 448 F.3d 524 (2d Cir. 2006)

The court invoked Wangchuck to justify reviewing both the IJ and BIA decisions “for the sake of completeness.” This sets the lens for appellate review when the BIA affirms and adopts aspects of the IJ’s reasoning.

Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67 (2d Cir. 2018)

Hong Fei Gao supplies the governing standard: adverse credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, and factual findings are conclusive unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude otherwise. The court also cited Hong Fei Gao for the rule that where all claims share the same discredited facts, credibility is dispositive across asylum, withholding, and CAT.

Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2008)

Xiu Xia Lin is used for two propositions: (1) strong deference to IJ credibility determinations absent a record compelling the opposite conclusion, and (2) the agency may rely on the “cumulative effect” of inconsistencies and omissions, even if some appear “collateral or ancillary” in isolation.

Likai Gao v. Barr, 968 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2020)

Likai Gao is cited to underscore that even a single inconsistency can be sufficient to sustain an adverse credibility ruling, and multiple inconsistencies do so “even more forcefully.” The court also later cites Likai Gao to endorse an IJ’s discretion to discount affidavits from interested parties not subject to cross-examination.

Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77 (2d Cir. 2005)

Majidi provides the key limiting principle on explanations: it is not enough for an applicant to offer a plausible explanation for inconsistencies; the explanation must be so persuasive that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to accept it. The court relied on Majidi to reject Chen’s attempts to neutralize discrepancies through claims of nervousness or misunderstanding.

Ming Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715 (2d Cir. 2009)

Ming Zhang supports the court’s refusal to treat “nervous and distracted” as an automatic basis to undermine the reliability of asylum interview statements, reinforcing that interview records can legitimately anchor inconsistency findings.

Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268 (2d Cir. 2007)

Biao Yang is cited for the proposition that failure to corroborate may bear on credibility, particularly where testimony has already been called into question—corroboration is often the means by which an applicant rehabilitates a damaged narrative.

Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2013)

The court relied on Y.C. to emphasize deference to the agency’s assessment of the weight of documentary evidence, including skepticism toward certain letters and unauthenticated or weakly supported documents.

Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23 (2d Cir. 2018)

Wei Sun is cited for the applicant’s burden to produce corroboration “without prompting from the IJ,” reinforcing that corroboration is not merely optional once credibility concerns arise.

Legal Reasoning

The court’s reasoning follows the REAL ID Act credibility framework, focusing on (i) inconsistencies across statements, (ii) whether explanations compel acceptance, and (iii) corroboration.

1) Inconsistencies need not go to the “heart” of the claim

The court cited 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii) to emphasize that credibility may be assessed based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods “without regard” to whether they go to the heart of the claim. Applying that standard, the court accepted reliance on both key and ancillary discrepancies, and also validated the agency’s use of “totality of the circumstances.”

2) Material inconsistency regarding baptism

Chen testified he was baptized in China on Easter 2016, but at his asylum interview he said he was never baptized because the minister said there was “no place” for such a ceremony. The court treated this as significant because it bears directly on the authenticity of religious practice, a central pillar of Chen’s narrative.

Chen’s attempts to explain the discrepancy (believing he was asked about baptism in the U.S.; denying he made the statement; blaming interpretation; nervousness) failed under Majidi v. Gonzales because the agency was not compelled to accept them, particularly given the absence of record evidence showing interpreter difficulty and the caution from Ming Zhang v. Holder about “nervousness” claims undermining interview reliability.

3) Conflict between testimony and mother’s letter on notice of arrest

Chen testified police called his mother on June 5, 2016 (the date of the arrest), but his mother’s letter said police called on June 12, 2016. When confronted, Chen both reaffirmed June 5 as the arrest date and agreed with his mother that she was notified a week later. The court accepted the agency’s view that Chen’s “nervousness” explanation did not compel a different conclusion, particularly because he initially confirmed the earlier date when questioned by DHS counsel.

4) Additional discrepancies reinforce the “cumulative effect” rationale

Consistent with Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, the court approved reliance on multiple smaller discrepancies: whether 20 or 30 people were arrested, whether reporting occurred monthly on the 12th or at month’s end, and the travel time to church (4–5 minutes vs. 10–15 minutes). In aggregate, these supported the IJ’s assessment that the overall account was unreliable.

5) Lack of readily available corroboration as a credibility “fail-safe”

Even though Chen produced some documents (fine, medical treatment, reporting requirements), the agency found a conspicuous absence of corroboration that would normally be feasible: letters from pastors, the friend who introduced him to Christianity, or other church members. The Second Circuit treated that gap as reinforcing the adverse credibility finding under Biao Yang v. Gonzales and 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), and noted that the burden to produce corroboration rests with the applicant under Wei Sun v. Sessions.

The court also endorsed the agency’s discretion to assign limited weight to certain documents and letters under Y.C. v. Holder and Likai Gao v. Barr.

6) Dispositive effect across asylum, withholding, and CAT

Because all forms of relief depended on the same factual narrative, the adverse credibility finding was dispositive across all claims, consistent with Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions.

Impact

While this decision is a nonprecedential summary order, it has practical significance in three recurring areas of Second Circuit immigration litigation:

Asylum interview statements matter: The court again confirms that inconsistencies between interview and hearing testimony can support adverse credibility, and generalized claims of nervousness will not automatically undermine the interview record (see Ming Zhang v. Holder).

Explanations face a high bar: “Plausible” is not enough; the explanation must compel acceptance to overturn the agency (see Majidi v. Gonzales).

Corroboration is strategic, not optional: When credibility is questioned, applicants should expect adjudicators to look for readily available corroboration—especially from religious communities where documentation and witnesses may exist—and the failure to provide it can lock in an adverse credibility determination (see Biao Yang v. Gonzales; Wei Sun v. Sessions).

For practitioners and applicants, the case underscores the importance of (i) reviewing asylum interview records carefully, (ii) ensuring consistency on timelines and key events, and (iii) gathering corroboration from non-family, less “interested” sources where possible.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Adverse credibility determination: A finding that the adjudicator does not believe the applicant’s account. If the claim depends on that account, the case usually fails.

Substantial evidence standard: A highly deferential review standard. The court asks not whether it would decide differently, but whether the record compels a different conclusion.

Totality of the circumstances (REAL ID Act): Credibility is judged by the overall record, including inconsistencies across statements and evidence, even on details not central to the claim.

Corroboration: Independent supporting evidence (letters, records, witness statements). If testimony is questioned, corroboration can rehabilitate it; if missing without good reason, that absence can strengthen disbelief.

Dispositive: A ruling that resolves the outcome. Here, lack of credibility ends asylum, withholding, and CAT because they rely on the same underlying facts.

Conclusion

Chen v. Bondi illustrates the Second Circuit’s deferential posture toward agency credibility determinations when supported by multiple inconsistencies and insufficient corroboration. The court reaffirmed that interview–hearing discrepancies can be relied upon; that nervousness and interpretation-based explanations rarely compel reversal absent strong record support; and that missing readily available corroboration can cement an adverse credibility finding. Even as a summary order, the decision functions as a clear roadmap of how credibility, corroboration, and “totality” analysis operate in contemporary asylum adjudication.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 04:57:47.879555

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his ""first and final warning.""

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general, there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

Polk, Woodbury, Muscatine and other Iowa counties have been sued by numerous jail inmates in recent months, each alleging they’ve been unlawfully detained in county jails by ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

An exact count of all the lawsuits against Iowa jails is difficult to calculate given the fact that Iowa’s county jails typically don’t disclose the names of inmates who are being held at the direction of ICE. In addition, public access to the federal court records related to those detentions is tightly restricted.

However, the available records show Polk County, ICE and DHS are named as defendants in at least three additional cases recently filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.

Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.

Nationally and in Iowa, many of the lawsuits surrounding ICE detainees involve the Trump administration’s six-month-old effort to expand its “mandatory detention” policy. Under that policy, ICE is holding people in jail indefinitely as their immigration cases proceed, while arguing those individuals are not entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release on bond.

Politico recently reported that more than 300 federal judges, including appointees of every president since Ronald Reagan, have rejected the administration’s “mandatory detention” theory in more than 1,600 cases.

The courts’ near-universal rejection of the administration’s position has not prevented the U.S. Department of Justice from continuing to use that rationale to jail people indefinitely. In fact, the DOJ recently appealed one judge’s ruling against ICE after it resulted in a woman’s release from the Muscatine County Jail.

Polk County man detained during traffic stop

One of the newly filed cases involves Ulises Ramirez Cruz, who sued Polk County and ICE over his detention and the refusal of the immigration courts to provide him with a hearing at which he could argue for his release on bond.

Court records indicate Ramirez Cruz has lived in Iowa for five years. He alleges that ICE agents — identified in court records only as T. Staudinger, Scroggins, Palmer and Hanson — waited outside his house on Nov. 7, 2025, and then pulled him over after he left the house, got into his car and drove away.

U.S. Attorney David Waterman argued in court that Ramirez Cruz is not entitled to a bond hearing and is subject to mandatory detention. In a recent ruling against the government, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher noted he has rejected the DOJ’s arguments in at least three other cases that have come before him, and that judges around the country have “overwhelmingly” issued similar decisions.

Locher’s order directs the immigration court to provide Ramirez Cruz with an opportunity to argue for his release on bond while the underlying immigration case proceeds.

‘Punitive detention’ alleged in Polk County case

The second recent case involves a Polk County Jail inmate, Luis Pedroso, a citizen of Cuba who has been in the United States for four and a half years. Pedroso has applied for status as a legal permanent resident of the United States, but as part of the approval process, he must prove he’s not ineligible on public-health grounds, which would involve a physical examination to rule out drug abuse and communicable diseases.

Under federal regulations, that examination must be provided by a physician selected by or approved by immigration authorities. Attorneys for Pedroso argue that the jail, Polk County Health Department and ICE are all unwilling or unable to provide Pedroso with a physician so the examination can be conducted. ICE is also unwilling to transfer Pedroso to a different jail so the examination can take place, they allege.

Pedroso’s attorneys claim ICE and the county have, in effect, denied Pedroso his status as a legal permanent resident and violated his right to due process.

“Keeping Pedroso in detention for the purpose of adjudicating his claim in immigration court transforms his detention into a punitive detention intending to punish him for the fact that he is eligible for legal permanent residency,” the lawsuit alleges.

The defendants in the case have yet to file a response.

U.S. resident for 35 years, in jail for four months

A third lawsuit involving the Polk County Jail revolves around Amir Rahimi of Centerville, a native of Iran who has lived in the United States for 35 years.

In his lawsuit against the county, ICE and DHS, Rahimi alleges he has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen for 33 years, with whom he has three children. The couple’s eldest son is in the U.S. Air Force and is currently deployed overseas, the lawsuit claims.

Rahimi alleges he was detained by federal agents when he stopped at an ICE office for a routine, scheduled appointment on July 22, 2025. At the time, he claims, ICE gave no reason for his detention except to tell him they were currently “seeking a third country for your removal” — suggesting the agency’s plan is to deport him not to Iran, but to some other country.

“After four months of detention, the legal justification for his detention still remains unclear and he has been provided with no explanation of the change in his circumstances that resulted in the deprivation of his liberty,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing Rahimi’s continued detention, citing alleged violations of Rahimi’s due process rights and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.

Feds appeal ruling in Muscatine County case

In addition to the newly filed lawsuits, a fourth lawsuit involving the Muscatine County Jail continues to move forward despite a judge’s ruling in the case in early November.

That case centers on Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.

Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.

On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail. An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing.

Reyes sued in U.S. District Court, and on Nov. 3, 2025, Judge Locher ruled in her favor, noting that the majority of courts around the nation have rejected the administration’s interpretation of the law as requiring mandatory detention.

Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.

In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher wrote that “ICE itself obviously did not believe she was subject to mandatory detention” when they released her on how own recognizance in September 2023 and again in February 2025.

Court records indicate Reyes was granted bond after a hearing on Nov. 7, 2025, and was released from custody three days later on a $6,000 bond.

Despite Locher’s ruling and Reyes’ subsequent release, the U.S. Department of Justice is now appealing Locher’s ruling.",https://ottumwaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.avif,N,,2026-01-10 22:57:16.633865

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz said on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

“We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,” Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation . Trump's administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he's frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents . More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

With so many officials making snap judgments — and the feds' lockdown of the evidence — widespread acceptance of the results seems unlikely.
The Minneapolis Bureau of Criminal Apprehensions said the agency is being barred from the crime scene, evidence and interviews.
Catch up quick: The Justice Department blamed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D), who called self-defense a ""bullshit"" reason for the shooting, for breaking ties with local investigators.
""Well, normally, I would, but they're crooked officials,"" President Trump said of sharing evidence with Minnesota officials.","Former prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys are alarmed by the Trump administration's ""highly unusual"" decision to kick local investigators off the probe into the deadly ICE shooting in Minneapolis.

Why it matters: Politicians on both sides rushed to weigh in on whether the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was justified. With so many officials making snap judgments — and the feds' lockdown of the evidence — widespread acceptance of the results seems unlikely.

""This is what a cover-up looks like,"" said Dan Gelber, former federal prosecutor and Miami Beach mayor.

""It's shocking to me that this is the route and the path that it's taking, because I do believe that it undermines the public trust in the government,"" said Eric Nelson, one of the defense attorneys for Derek Chauvin, a former police officer convicted in 2021 for the murder of George Floyd.

Driving the news: Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said on Friday that her office's concern wasn't with the FBI's own investigation, but with the lack of evidence sharing between her office and federal investigators.

The Minneapolis Bureau of Criminal Apprehensions said the agency is being barred from the crime scene, evidence and interviews.

Without evidence sharing to local prosecutors, her office can't evaluate the case for charges. Moriarty said it's typical that the FBI doesn't share all of its investigation with her office, which is why it's important to have the local cooperation.

""Our goal must be to ensure that a thorough investigation is completed at the local level, that our community can have transparency,"" Moriarty said, stressing that her office does have jurisdiction to bring charges.

Catch up quick: The Justice Department blamed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D), who called self-defense a ""bullshit"" reason for the shooting, for breaking ties with local investigators.

Because of the comment, a Justice Department official said, ""They have no intent to pursue a good-faith investigation.""

""Well, normally, I would, but they're crooked officials,"" President Trump said of sharing evidence with Minnesota officials.

Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President Vance have all defended the ICE officer.

""Given my past experience, I think it is a dangerous precedent from both sides of the political spectrum to take such marked stances this early, because the rule of law requires an investigation,"" Nelson said.

Zoom out: ""It's absurd to think the state can't investigate a homicide within the state and that somehow the federal government won't work with them. I've never seen this,"" said Gelber, a Democrat who successfully prosecuted four Miami police officers in the 1990s.

Gelber also said the Minneapolis homicide echoes another Miami police case involving Officer William Lozano, who shot and killed a motorcycle driver against department policy on using firearms to stop motorists. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a similar policy.

""I think this decision ultimately guarantees that there cannot be a fair and complete investigation of this shooting,"" former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger told Twin Cities radio host Chad Hartman.

""As long as it's being conducted solely by the FBI, which takes direction from the president and from the secretary of Homeland Security, both of whom have already expressed their opinion that this was a self-defense shooting. How does one then turn around and conduct a thorough investigation which would involve a lot more than issues related to self defense,"" Heffelfinger said.

The other side: The Justice Department would not address the criticisms on the record, but a senior official in the department said the investigation would be thorough and fair.

""The Mayor of Minneapolis has said that any claim of self-defense is 'bullshit.' They have no intent to pursue a good-faith investigation,"" the official said.

""The precedent here is very simple,"" Vice President Vance said at a White House briefing. ""You have a federal law enforcement official, engaging in federal law enforcement action: that's a federal issue. He is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job.""

A DHS memo on use of force from 2018 states that ""use of excessive force is unlawful and will not be tolerated"" and ""will be subject to all applicable administrative and criminal penalties.""

The big picture: Trump's interior immigration enforcement was unpopular before the shooting, and DOJ is reeling from a bipartisan chorus of critics accusing it of covering up the Epstein files, which the department denies.

Minnesota's elected officials pleaded with the Trump administration not to surge immigration agents in the city, predicting that a violent incident like the shooting could occur.

Mayor Frey and Gov. Tim Walz (D) repeated requests to withdraw the agents who were called into Minneapolis from across the country.

Noem said at a recent press conference that she would not pull back the agents. On Friday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office announced an expanded fraud investigation in the state.

The bottom line: ""If the American public doesn't believe in the investigation that's going to come out of this, we're even in more trouble than we were before this shooting,"" said Geoff Alpert, an expert in police use of force.",https://images.axios.com/2igC_uAqsboXWUHqLGfMbVwxm5k=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2026/01/08/1767893223143.jpeg,N,,2026-01-10 21:57:39.617473

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

“The shootings in Minneapolis and Portland weren’t the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, but they must be the end. Today, we saw communities across the country gather peacefully to mourn the lives lost at the hands of ICE and to demand accountability. These protests are further proof that public opposition to ICE and this administration’s abuses is growing by the minute. Whether it's by joining a protest, attending a know your rights training, or demanding that our Congresspeople stop funding these out-of-control agencies, Americans across the country are saying “NO. Not on our watch.”

– Deirdre Schifeling, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer, ACLU

INDIVISIBLE

“Renee Nicole Good should be alive today. Her death has sparked grief and outrage across the country as the latest horrific incident in a mounting toll of enormous harm and horror caused by ICE. This weekend, people all over are coming together not just to mourn the lives lost to ICE violence, but to confront a pattern of harm that has torn families apart and terrorized our communities. We demand justice for Renee, ICE out of our communities, and action from our elected leaders. Enough is enough.""

– Leah Greenberg, Co-Executive Director of Indivisible

POPULAR DEMOCRACY

“Every person ICE has killed had a family, a community, and a life that mattered. Pouring billions of public dollars into a rogue enforcement agency that terrorizes our communities while denying people health care, housing, food security, and education is morally indefensible and profoundly reckless. This cruelty flows directly from the agenda of fear and punishment pushed by extremists like ​​Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, embraced and strengthened by the President himself. We demand accountability for the killing of Renee Nicole Good and for the countless lives lost at the hands of ICE. The lesson is clear: this violence will not stop until ICE is abolished.”

— DaMareo Cooper, Executive Director, Popular Democracy

50501

""This weekend's actions are prompted most immediately by the tragic death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, and her murder at the hands of ICE is unspeakable. We will uplift her this weekend, and we will uplift all those in our communities whom ICE has targeted and brutalized, from Silverio Gonzales to Marimar Martinez to all of those people in marginalized communities whose names must not be forgotten. This is our moment. We must conjure the souls of our brave ancestors and remember we stand on the shoulders of giants.""

– Sarah Parker, 50501 Spokesperson and Executive Director, Voices of Florida Fund

MOVEON CIVIC ACTION

“For a full year, Trump’s masked agents have been abducting people off the streets, raiding schools, libraries, and churches. As ICE’s unnecessary, reckless, and escalatory deployment goes unchecked, the killing of civilians will only continue. None of us want to live in a country where federal agents with guns are lurking and inciting violence at schools and in our communities. This is why MoveOn members will be uniting once again this weekend in peaceful, nonviolent, powerful protests in stark contrast to the unrepentant, ruthless violence of this administration.”

– Katie Bethell, MoveOn Civic Action Executive Director

PUBLIC CITIZEN, NOT ABOVE THE LAW COALITION

“Masked, power-hungry federal agents are treating the streets of America like the Wild West. The intimidation tactics, the deadly attacks against our communities and the brazen lawlessness by immigration enforcement must stop now. As ICE and border patrol agents commandeer neighborhoods, people in detention centers, in ICE custody or simply in their own personal vehicles fear for their lives. This militarization of immigration enforcement is endangering everyone. What’s more alarming is the Department of Homeland Security, the vice president and president of the United States are endorsing ICE and CBP’s violent behavior. The Trump Administration must stop ICE deployment now, we must deeply investigate this unjust killing, and the American people must file peacefully into the streets to resist this illegal, overreaching use of government power. We must stand together to effectively defend ourselves.”

– Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen and co-chair of the Not Above the Law Coalition which formed the Disappeared in America Campaign.

NDLON

“We immigrants know what authoritarian violence is. Many of us come from countries where we had to endure the kind of hatred and terror we saw in Minneapolis. Many of us fled brutal regimes to seek survival here.”

“We grieve for Renee Nicole Good and all the victims of this Administration's shameful and senseless brutality — the growing list of the dead and injured. But we are not just sorrowful. We are defiant. We, the people, will stand together against all efforts to dehumanize us, polarize us, terrorize us and kill us.”

“They want to provoke us into responding to violence with violence, to meet hate with hate. They are desperate to justify their cruelty with ever more brutality.”

“But we immigrants know how to confront authoritarianism. We will resist the government's attacks by building community, by documenting atrocities, by protesting nonviolently, by showing kindness and solidarity at all times. We will meet them in the streets, in the courts, at the day labor corners. We will meet them everywhere. And we will win.”

“We are not afraid or discouraged. And we will not be defeated. The more we stand together as a community of determination and love, the harder it will be for them to divide and destroy us.”

– Pablo Alvarado, Co-Executive Director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network

THE WORKERS CIRCLE

“The tragic killing of Renee Good — a U.S. citizen exercising her fundamental rights — by a federal ICE agent is not just a catastrophic loss for her family and community; it is a stark warning to all of us about where unchecked power leads. This administration’s expanding use of force against our neighbors erodes the very rights and safety that define who we are as a nation. As a Jewish organization, we know what unchecked power has done in the past. We must not let that take root here, today. Now, more than ever, we must demand transparency, accountability, and policies that protect human life, human dignity and civil liberties for everyone. Allowing federal forces to act without independent oversight undermines justice and threatens the safety of us all.”

– Ann Toback, CEO, The Workers Circle

UNITED WE DREAM

“Using your first amendment rights to speak out and show up for your neighbors during the growing anti-immigrant violence in our cities should be a protected constitutional right, not a death sentence. This brutal killing is a horrifying reminder of the threat armed forces pose to our collective safety, especially at a time when local, state and federal officials have consistently called on the federal government to invest in the resources working families truly need —health care, housing, access to food— instead of indiscriminate terror in our communities. Billions poured into immigration raids for the sake of ripping apart communities in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis does nothing but lead to irreparable damage, violence and death. In 2025 alone, 32 people died in immigration detention. We demand an immediate end to this cruelty and for elected leaders at every level to speak out in defense of immigrant communities and our shared safety.”

– United We Dream

VOTO LATINO

“Under Donald Trump’s leadership and Kristi Noem’s direction of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE has become more aggressive, more reckless, and more deadly — with 2025 marking its deadliest year in two decades. The killing of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, is not an isolated failure but the predictable outcome of a political agenda that rewards force and dehumanization.”

“Trump and Noem have normalized the erosion of constitutional rights, framing brutality as enforcement and accountability as weakness. Their rhetoric and policies have sent a clear message down the chain of command: push limits, ignore safeguards, and expect protection from consequences. This is not about partisan politics — it is about defending human life and the rule of law. We stand with Renee Nicole Good’s family and with communities nationwide to demand accountability and to stop the unchecked enforcement born of Trump and Noem’s leadership before more lives are lost.”

– Voto Latino

Organized by Indivisible Grand Junction, the “ICE Out For Good” protest drew hundreds of people to the Old County Courthouse in Grand Junction. It was billed as a silent protest to honor Good and remember others who have died in ICE custody under the Trump administration. Organizers listed the names of more than 30 people who have died while in ICE custody in 2025 and two, including Good, who have died this year.

Protesters demanded accountability for ICE and called for the agency to leave their communities.

Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest Good’s killing. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.

Activists in Colorado Springs held a vigil for Good outside the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday night, an event that the Colorado Springs Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said was to condemn her killing and “honor her life in her hometown.”

“She went to the same schools that we went to … she lived in the same neighborhoods that we lived in,” said Brandon Rincon, the group’s founder, according to Colorado Springs TV station KRDO. “It just makes us want to fight for her more.”

The Trump administration last year implemented mass deportation efforts, which have prompted a series of protests as aggressive enforcement methods resulted in a spike in arrests, including of people with no criminal record or charges, and questions about due process.

Protests held in the neighborhood so far have been peaceful, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and agents guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

Minneapolis police said at least 30 people were cited and released during Friday night protests in the city that drew hundreds of people. Police said protesters threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, police vehicles and other vehicles, but no serious injuries were reported.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted ""agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.""

""This is what Donald Trump wants,"" Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. ""He wants us to take the bait.""

The Trump administration has been surging thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump's administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who ""weaponized"" their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he's frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

""Almost daily I see them harassing people,"" he said. ""It's just sickening that it's happening in our community around us.""

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, on Saturday because of the ""horrifying"" killing of Good in Minneapolis.

""We can't allow it,"" Eubanks said. ""We have to stand up.""

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday. Marchers carried signs calling for ICE to leave and voiced support for Good and immigrants.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his ""first and final warning.""

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O'Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, the car was left in park and in another case a dog was left in the vehicle.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening ""all over the city"" and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Some officers moved in after abruptly pulling out of Louisiana, where they were part of another operation that started last month and was expected to last until February.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on Saturday morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

""They do not care that they are violating federal law,"" Craig said after being turned away.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

4:26 p.m.: Gainesville protest denounces Trump Administration policies

Protesters in Gainesville once again joined protesters across the nation to denounce the policies and actions of President Donald Trump and his administration.

Coming on the heels of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shooting a woman in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, the protest in Gainesville was held the morning of Jan. 10 on West Newberry Road in front of the Wells Fargo bank at the Oaks Mall.

“We’ve been doing these every Saturday, and we first started at Tesla (car dealership on North Main Street), and have held them at other locations, but have been here since December,” said Monique Constantino, one of the leaders of Badass Feminists Gainesville, as she passed out whistles to other protesters so they can alert others if they see ICE agents in the community.

“I come out every Saturday morning and have been to every other protest because what this guy (Donald Trump) is doing is hideous and unconscionable,” said Maggie MacDonald, 81, of Gainesville. “I can’t do much, but I can do what I can. We are in a fascist state led by despicable people.”

4:05 p.m.: Immigration rally in Florida near Boca Raton urges Home Depot 'to say no to ICE'

Several hundred protesters, upset with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detentions inside and outside of Home Depot stores, staged a rally outside of one in suburban Boca Raton on Jan. 10, asking the national chain to stop cooperating with the federal agency.

""We are here today to urge Home Depot to say no to ICE and stop ICE raids in their stores and parking lots,"" said Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigration Coalition. ""They can and must say no.""

A Home Depot spokesperson, however, said it is ""just false to say that we are cooperating with these immigration enforcement activities."" The Atlanta-based chain's stores often are the day's first stop for home-improvement contractors. Multiple detentions in Florida and across the nation have targeted day laborers in this industry.

President Donald Trump is back in Palm Beach after a high profile meeting with Big Oil in which some executives voiced doubts about investments in Venezuela in the aftermath of the president’s implementation of the ""Donroe Doctrine"" in the South American country while at Mar-a-Lago for the holidays.

The president landed at Pslm Beach International Airport just before 9 p.m. aboard a smaller 757 aircraft due to maintenance schedules and a smaller staff, according to the White House.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest Saturday. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Saturday. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz posted on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump's administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he's frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He was among thousands of protesters, including children, who braved sub-freezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, on Saturday because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on Saturday morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities.

To better analyze what's happening in the video, WCCO spoke with a use-of-force expert and a defense attorney.

Peter Johnson is the founder of Archway Defense, a company that has trained state, local and federal law enforcement in firearms for the past decade. He's also a former federal air marshal. Johnson said his biggest takeaway from the video was a crunching sound he heard immediately before the gunshots, which he believes is the sound of the SUV hitting the ICE agent.

""That data point for me shows that there was contact made with the agent, who is now in reasonable fear, who could clearly articulate being hit with an SUV as reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death. And then the shots were fired,"" said Johnson.

According to Homeland Security's policy, deadly force cannot be used to stop someone who is fleeing, though it is authorized when an officer believes that someone who's trying to escape poses a serious threat to the officer or others. The two narrow circumstances outlined in the policy are:

When a person in the vehicle is using or imminently threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle.

When the vehicle itself is being operated in a manner that poses an imminent threat and no other objectively reasonable defensive option exists — explicitly including ""moving out of the path of the vehicle.""

Another point that stood out to Johnson is the face-to-face interaction the ICE agent has with Good, 37, as he walks by her window. Johnson said it proves that Good was aware of the agent's presence, whereas other videos could make it seem as if the agent suddenly appeared from out of view.

Other videos show the angle of the tires on Good's SUV when she accelerates forward, with some arguing the tires are in a direction indicating she was trying to drive away from the ICE agents. To those dissecting the videos, Johnson referenced a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Graham vs. Connor. He summarized it by saying, ""In a tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving situation, law enforcement officers are not to be judged in hindsight 20/20, but a reasonable officer's perception.""

Rob Doar is a local defense attorney. He said the video both helps and hurts Homeland Security's stance that the ICE agent fired in self-defense. As for helping, Doar said it shows how quickly things unfolded leading up to the shooting.

""I myself have questioned the second and third shots,"" said Doar. ""I think from that firsthand perspective, it makes it look like he may not have had the mental time to actually appreciate that the threat had passed.""

He too pointed out the angle of the tires, stating that the video shows there's no way the ICE agent could have seen the direction they were pointing.

""Though he may have seen some direction of the steering wheel, but it's, again, it's not clear whether he would have appreciated that,"" said Doar.

As for hurting the agent's case, Doar said it shows Good had a pleasant demeanor while also saying to the agents that she wasn't mad at them.

""That lessens the indication that he is posing a serious threat to law enforcement,"" said Doar.

He questioned the positioning the ICE agent took in front of the SUV, saying courts could analyze whether that was a reasonable spot to place himself.

Lastly, Doar noted the expletives it appears the ICE agent said toward Good after the shooting. It sounds like the agent said, ""F****** b****.""

Pertaining to the vulgar comment, Doar said, ""Self-defense is an affirmative defense where you're saying that you're fearful for your life. Courts could interpret that, or a jury could interpret as a mindset of trying to compel control or dominance over the situation rather than a sincere fear for his life.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/10/2789674c-948e-4e6d-87bd-0d166dc9d221/thumbnail/1200x630/93aae474268102c97c8e8d80378e031b/6p-sotvo1-ice-agent-video-wcco9kby.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 19:57:37.594742

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states. Many were dubbed “ICE Out for Good” using the acronym for the federal agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Indivisible and its local chapters organized protests in all 50 states last year.

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups called for a demonstration at Powderhorn Park, a large green space about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday. They said the rally and march would celebrate her life and call for an “end to deadly terror on our streets.”

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Numerous “ICE Out For Good” events are scheduled nationwide this weekend, organized by area chapters of the Indivisible movement. The Sacramento event is slated to begin at 1 p.m. and last an hour, with demonstrators gathering near the state Capitol at 15th and N streets in downtown Sacramento.

According to organizers, the weekend’s nonviolent protests and vigils hope to “demand accountability, honor the life lost, and make visible the human cost of ICE’s actions.”

Across the capital region, additional protests are scheduled for Saturday and Sunday in Davis, Gold River, Woodland, Roseville and Vacaville.

On Thursday, a group of protesters reportedly damaged and vandalized a federal building on Capitol Mall in Sacramento. No one was arrested, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is investigating the incident.

Last June, demonstrators marched from the Cesar Chavez Plaza in downtown to the area’s ICE field office and immigration court as the immigration enforcement agency increased operations around California during summer 2025.

Good, an unarmed woman, was shot and killed in her vehicle on Wednesday by an ICE officer. The Minnesota Star Tribute newspaper reported Good was observing ICE operations in a residential neighborhood when agents approached her Honda Pilot on foot.

Federal officials — including President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — claim Good ran over the officer, but multiple videos from the scene dispute the assertion.

Protest outside Roseville mall

Around 200 people converged on a busy Roseville intersection near the Westfield Galleria mall holding handmade signs expressing colorful, sometimes expletive-filled outrage over the killing of Good and the general conduct of ICE.

“I feel it’s important that I show my kids, as a Latina American, that this could happen to anyone,” said Yuki Rosas, a mother of three school-aged kids. And unfortunately, especially because we have film of the obvious, the murder of Renee Good showed that this could happen to anybody of any color. The spark has been there, it’s just now lighting up a fire.”

Mike Cherniski, a retired Hewlett Packard engineer from Roseville, held a sign calling for Noem and the officer who shot Good to be prosecuted.

“People have been sitting home watching TV in the bad weather, feeling helpless to counter the lunacy that has been happening; Venezuela, talk of invading Mexico and Greenland,” Cherniski said. ”

The Placer County Democratic Party in a video clip posted to Facebook showed several dozen protesters outside the Roseville mall morning, waving signs with slogans such as “resist fascism” and “I like my I.C.E. crushed.”

The incident has renewed scrutiny of Trump’s push to deploy heavily armed law enforcement officers to carry out an anti-immigrant crackdown across the US, with local authorities demanding that ICE agents leave their cities.

The killing of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came as the US Department of Homeland Security pushes ahead with what it has called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

They said the rally would call for an “end to deadly terror on our streets”.

Reporting from a rally in Minneapolis on Saturday afternoon, Al Jazeera’s Manuel Rapalo said the protesters have been expressing outrage “but overwhelmingly, we hear people say they’re here to demonstrate peacefully.”

“We’re also hearing a lot of calls for justice. What I’m not hearing is too much optimism that there will be justice in this case,” Rapalo said, referring to Good’s killing.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who demanded that ICE leave the city after the deadly incident, said on Saturday that 29 people had been arrested overnight as police responded to continued protests.

Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who damage property or endanger others will be arrested.

“I also worry about the type of people that are being recruited now for ICE. The recruitment rhetoric is ‘Defend your culture.’ What does that mean? I think that’s a dog whistle, basically, for ‘Let’s go after the great replacement,’” Johnson, who served in the Obama administration, said during an appearance on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe.”

“If you’re Mexican American, for example, in south Texas, interested in enforcing the law, ‘Defend your culture’ is not a message for you. If you’re a Muslim American in Michigan or Minneapolis interested in enforcing the law, going into law enforcement, ‘Defend your culture’ is not a message for such person. Basically, you need not apply,” he added.

His comments come after a woman was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis Wednesday while attempting to flee in her vehicle. One day later, two people were shot by a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Ore.

The Department of Homeland Security has said in both instances, shots were fired in self defense. Vice President Vance also said the officer involved in the Minneapolis shooting will be offered “absolute immunity.”

“My concern is high right now. The litmus test for our elected leaders in a moment like this is, are you amping it up in your rhetoric, or are you trying to tamp it down?” Johnson said Friday.

“Are you trying — for example, Spencer Cox, governor of Utah, after the assassination of Charlie Kirk there — are you trying to calm people’s fears down, or are you simply playing to your base and trying to amp it up?

Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations.","NEW YORK (AP) — The top United Nations official on Thursday said the United States has a ""legal obligation"" to keep paying its dues that fund U.N. agencies after the White House announced that it is withdrawing support from more than 30 initiatives operated by the world body.

READ MORE: U.S. will leave 66 international organizations as Trump further retreats from global cooperation

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he regretted President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from 31 U.N.-related agencies, including the U.N.'s population agency and the U.N. treaty that establishes international climate negotiations. The U.S. will also depart from dozens of other global organizations or initiatives not affiliated with the U.N.

""As we have consistently underscored, assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are a legal obligation under the UN Charter for all Member States, including the United States,"" Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for Guterres, said in a statement.

He added that despite the announcement, the U.N. entities targeted will keep doing their work: ""The United Nations has a responsibility to deliver for those who depend on us.""

The strong retort from the U.N. comes after the world body has spent the better part of the past year in a somewhat hostile and fragile back-and-forth with U.S. officials, who, after Trump's return to office, zeroed in on eliminating billions of dollars in aid and funding to international organizations like the U.N. and humanitarian assistance at large.

Through many conciliatory public and closed-door appeals, U.N. officials, including Guterres, had been able to convince Trump and his allies not to completely abandon the institution the U.S. helped found on the ashes of World War II, including through a $2 billion agreement for humanitarian assistance announced last month. But America's retreat had already influenced other Western countries, including France and the U.K., to reevaluate humanitarian funding, with many shifting that money toward military spending.

But Wednesday's announcement surprised diplomats at the highest levels of the U.N., who said they learned about the withdrawal through news reports and the White House social media. There has been no formal communication from the Trump administration outlining the decision, Dujarric told reporters.

Many U.N. officials refused to comment on the impact it would have on their agencies because they had not been given details or official word from anyone in the U.S. government.

Trump's executive order

Following a yearlong review of participation in and funding for all international organizations, Trump signed an executive order suspending American support for 66 groups, agencies and commissions.

Many of the targets are U.N.-related agencies, commissions and advisory panels that focus on climate, labor, migration and other issues the Trump administration has categorized as catering to diversity and ""woke"" initiatives.

The administration previously suspended support for the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees known as UNRWA, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO. It has taken a larger, à la carte approach to paying dues to the world body, picking which operations and agencies it believes align with Trump's agenda and those that no longer serve U.S. interests.

WATCH: The potential impacts of Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization

Some of the agencies impacted, including the U.N. Population Fund, an organization that provides sexual and reproductive health services worldwide, have long been a lightning rod for Republican opposition, and Trump cut funding for it during his first term.

The withdrawal from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, came as less of a surprise as Trump and his allies had previously withdrawn U.S. support from other climate initiatives.

The 1992 agreement between 198 countries to financially support climate change activities in developing countries is the underlying treaty for the landmark Paris climate agreement. Trump withdrew from that agreement soon after returning to the White House.

Simon Stiell, UNFCCC executive secretary, warned the U.S. that the decision to pull back will harm ""the US economy, jobs and living standards, as wildfires, floods, mega-storms and droughts get rapidly worse.""

""The doors remain open for the U.S. to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,"" he said in a statement. ""Meanwhile, the size of the commercial opportunity in clean energy, climate resilience, and advanced electrotech remains too big for American investors and businesses to ignore.""

The U.S. contribution to the UN budget

The U.N.'s regular budget, which finances its day-to-day operations and primary activities, is funded by its 193 member nations, each paying a percentage based on the size of their economy. The U.S., the world's largest economy, is supposed to pay 22%, followed by China, with 20%. There is a separate budget to fund the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations, where the U.S. is required to pay 25%.

U.N. officials said the U.S. did not pay its annual contributions to the regular budget last year, an obligation outlined in the U.N. Charter. A member that is in arrears for two full years loses its vote in the General Assembly.

""The charter is not à la carte,"" Dujarric said. ""We're not going to renegotiate the charter.""

All four other veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — China, France, Russia and the U.K. — have paid in full. China paid over $685 million.

“We’re thrilled that so many people came out to memorialize Renee Good,” Stuart protest organizer Barbara Turitz told Treasure Coast News.
On 7 January, Minneapolis resident and US citizen Renee Nicole Good was killed by an ICE agent during an immigration sweep.
The following day in Portland, Oregon, ICE agents shot Venezuelan immigrants Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras and Luis David Nico Moncada outside a hospital.
“We demand justice for Renee, ICE out of our communities and action from our elected leaders,” said Greenberg.","More than a thousand protests are planned across the US this Saturday and Sunday after ICE agents shot three people, one fatally, in Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon, this week.

“This weekend, people all over are coming together not just to mourn the lives lost to ICE violence, but to confront a pattern of harm that has torn families apart and terrorized our communities,” said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, an organizer of “ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action”.

Large crowds marched down the streets of Manhattan, New York, many carrying umbrellas amid the rainy winter weather.

In Tucson, Arizona, demonstrators lined up outside Republican representative Juan Ciscomani’s office. In downtown Stuart, Florida, a crowd gathered outside representative Brian Mast’s office. Mast, a Republican who is also chair of the House foreign affairs committee, has defended the actions of the ICE agent who shot and killed Good, saying he acted reasonably.

“We’re thrilled that so many people came out to memorialize Renee Good,” Stuart protest organizer Barbara Turitz told Treasure Coast News.

About 200 people joined a protest in Fairfield, Connecticut, outside a Home Depot store.

“We’re raising awareness of what’s happening in our country,” Meg Doyle, a member of Bridgeport Resists, who organized the protest, told CT Insider. “People can follow their own hearts about how they respond to it, but this is about showing up in the community, our beloved community, and letting people know we care about them, and that we’re angry, and we’re energized and we’re going to make change.”

Protesters in Philadelphia began their march at city hall before arriving at the federal detention center. The crowd could be heard chanting phrases such as “ICE has got to go” and “no fascist USA”, reported 6abc. The protest was one of several demonstrations held in the city in recent days.

Several North Carolina cities, including Durham and Raleigh, also joined the nationwide protests. Demonstrators carried upside-down American flags and signs that said “Stop Looking Away!” and “It’s ICE Cold in America.”

“What justice means to us is for ICE to not be in our streets any more,” Amy Aponte, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told ABC11. “It just made me realize that really, none of us are safe. You know, Renee Good is a white woman. And if they can shoot her, if they kill her, they can kill you. They can kill me for no reason.”

The action comes as tensions escalate in communities where ICE and federal agents have been deployed to crack down on undocumented immigrants, often resulting in threats, attacks and arrests of community members. On 7 January, Minneapolis resident and US citizen Renee Nicole Good was killed by an ICE agent during an immigration sweep. Footage of the shooting taken by community members attempting to disrupt ICE operations – more than 2,000 agents had recently been deployed to the Twin Cities – quickly spread across the internet. By the evening of Good’s death, thousands of people had gathered at the site of the shooting, some Democrats had threatened to withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security and the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, had told ICE to “get the fuck out” of the city. From New York to Oakland to Kansas City, thousands more took to the streets.

The following day in Portland, Oregon, ICE agents shot Venezuelan immigrants Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras and Luis David Nico Moncada outside a hospital. Protests across the country continued to swell – and so did pushback, with six protesters arrested in Portland.

For the ICE Out for Good weekend of action, events are planned in every corner of every state, from Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, to Machias in eastern Maine. Indivisible, one of the groups behind last year’s No Kings protests, is continuously updating its online tracker to note every vigil, rally and protest. Other coordinating groups include the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and the 50501 movement.

“We demand justice for Renee, ICE out of our communities and action from our elected leaders,” said Greenberg. “Enough is enough.”

Steven Eubanks, 51, told the Associated Press that he felt compelled to attend a Saturday protest in Durham, North Carolina, after the “horrifying” killing of Good.

“We can’t allow it,” he said. “We have to stand up.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd497402e3797aa98f450c25d77c1d7b826d93f/248_0_1707_1365/master/1707.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bec7a0a75688837dec44b476b749e6f",N,,2026-01-10 15:57:51.642742

“We in Minneapolis want a fair investigation.” Mr. Frey’s tone in the immediate aftermath of the shooting was more emotional.
and local enforcement agencies are hardly unusual, especially those involving high-stakes investigations into the conduct of federal law enforcement officials.","The Trump administration blocked Minnesota officials from investigating the death of the woman shot on Wednesday by a federal agent, then quietly offered this explanation: Local investigators simply could not be trusted to conduct a fair inquiry.

The investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good, 37, federal officials said, would be the exclusive province of the F.B.I., which is overseen by a director, Kash Patel, who has described President Trump as an unerring boss, and even a king.

Mr. Trump had already declared the shooting justified. Vice President JD Vance has asserted that federal agents had “absolute immunity” from prosecution. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has spoken about the incident as if it were a closed case: Ms. Good had “weaponized” her S.U.V. to kill agents, she said, even though video analysis by The New York Times suggested it was more likely that she was turning her car away from officers.

The extraordinary volley of public statements stood in striking contrast to the far more restrained approach to high-profile incidents taken by other presidents, who have typically called for calm pending the results of investigations. The all-hands effort to define Ms. Good as the only person who did anything wrong has cast serious doubt on the F.B.I.’s willingness to scrutinize the actions of the agent who killed the unarmed activist, according to former law enforcement officials who were once responsible for investigating comparable tragedies.

“It’s hard to have any trust in the federal investigation given the White House’s immediate public effort to drive an outcome,” said Vanita Gupta, a former top Justice Department official in the Biden administration who oversaw the department’s response to incidents of police violence, including the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

“Are the feds conducting any real investigation of the agent’s actions, or instead focused on trying to justify what happened by tarring the victim as a domestic terrorist?” Ms. Gupta added.

The details and direction of the F.B.I.’s investigation remain unclear. A spokesman for Mr. Patel did not respond to requests for comment.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general who oversees the bureau, said in a statement on Thursday that the F.B.I. would follow “standard protocols” to “ensure that evidence is collected and preserved.” His remarks also defended the right of officers to use deadly force when they believed their lives were in danger.

Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, struck a more circumspect and conventional tone, telling CBS News he would not draw any conclusions by watching video on social media.

“Let the investigation play out,” Mr. Homan said, “and hold people accountable based on the investigation.”

It was against this backdrop that the White House, Justice Department and F.B.I. excluded the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, an investigative division of the state attorney general’s office that often collaborates with federal law enforcement, from sharing evidence.

On Thursday, the U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis abruptly “reversed course” by informing state investigators that initial plans to coordinate efforts had been scrapped, according to Drew Evans, the state bureau’s superintendent.

A senior federal law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the remarks of the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, blaming the shooting on immigration operations the White House had ordered in his city, prompted the move.

The administration likened Mr. Frey’s finger-pointing to ordaining a predetermined outcome, even though his statements were comparable in tone to, if opposite in substance from, the Trump administration’s torrent of talk.

Mr. Trump and the team he installed at the Justice Department have repurposed the statement that Biden-era officials have used to justify the prosecutions of Mr. Trump — “no one is above the law” — to defend prosecutions of his perceived foes.

In a broader sense, they have also used the phrase to redefine justice according to his personal judgment of guilt and innocence. Over the past year, the president has granted clemency to hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters and other political allies. He has scuttled prosecutions of those he favored, like Eric Adams, the former mayor of New York.

During his first term, Mr. Trump’s demands were subject to internal pushback or slow-walked by department officials who were still able to maintain a measure of autonomy.

But over the past year, Mr. Trump’s commands have been dutifully executed by loyalists he views less as appointees than employees. When he talks, they listen.

Ms. Good “was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media hours after the killing.

“We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!” he added.

Leaders in Minnesota suggested on Friday that any investigation by the F.B.I. without their involvement would be tilted toward reinforcing Mr. Trump’s conclusions.

“Our ask is to embrace the truth,” Mr. Frey, a Democrat, said at a news conference at the end of the week. “We in Minneapolis want a fair investigation.”

Mr. Frey’s tone in the immediate aftermath of the shooting was more emotional. He called Mr. Trump’s claims that the agent acted in self-defense “bullshit,” and slammed the administration for what he argued was a decision to descend on Minneapolis to provoke a violent confrontation.

The White House and Justice Department seized on that statement to justify the decision to cut off cooperation, saying that Mr. Frey’s remarks had made it clear that local officials had no intention of conducting an investigation in good faith, according to people familiar with the situation.

“That’s bullshit,” Mr. Frey replied through his spokeswoman.

State and city officials have said they would collect evidence independently, and have urged witnesses to come forward with information. The state could, potentially, file charges against ICE officials. But in the past, federal prosecutors have successfully petitioned to have such cases transferred to federal courts, citing the supremacy clause of the Constitution, with the purpose of dismissing them.

Jurisdictional conflicts between the F.B.I. and local enforcement agencies are hardly unusual, especially those involving high-stakes investigations into the conduct of federal law enforcement officials.

The Trump administration’s decision to cut off cooperation with local law enforcement in Minnesota does not necessarily mean the investigation, run out of the F.B.I.’s Minneapolis field office, will be tainted by political interference, former agents said.

It is less certain what action will be taken by federal prosecutors. They could file a range of charges against the agent who killed Ms. Good, if they determine he acted with reckless disregard for her safety or violated her civil rights as defined under federal law.

But Ms. Gupta and other former officials said they believed the administration’s public statements suggested that the F.B.I.’s investigation was just as likely to focus on Ms. Good’s actions than on the response by the agent who fired at close range.

It was not clear if any bureau officials were present during the confrontation in Minneapolis. But over the last year, the administration has had law enforcement agencies focus on immigration, and Mr. Patel has diverted thousands of F.B.I. employees from other duties to support ICE officials.

Michael Feinberg, a veteran F.B.I. agent who was forced to retire last year, said that many of his most experienced colleagues had warned against participating, given the possibility that the bureau could be called upon to investigate incidents like the killing of Ms. Good.

“One of the major concerns many of us had when the F.B.I. was ordered to join in on these immigration operations was that it would create an implicit conflict of interest if we ever had to conduct a use-of-force or civil rights investigation of the other involved agencies,” said Mr. Feinberg, who now writes for Lawfare, a nonpartisan news site that covers legal and national security issues.

“It’s difficult to see how the F.B.I. can be a neutral arbiter,” he added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/09/multimedia/09dc-fbi-qmgh/09dc-fbi-qmgh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 15:57:07.946200

By that evening, Gapen and other members of Salem Region Indivisible had begun the work to organize a local demonstration in response.

“Because this is an egregious, horrific escalation of the abuse of power, and we’re just not going to stand for it,” he said. “There’s little that we can actually do to affect any real change,” with a single demonstration.

“We know that, but we also know that we can’t sit on our hands. And so we must demonstrate. We must get the word out. We must stand with Minneapolis,” Gapen said.

Salem Region Indivisible is organizing a protest starting Saturday, Jan. 10, at noon at the north end of the Oregon State Capitol grounds, near the intersection of Northeast Center Street and Summer Street. It’s among demonstrations that will be going on all day in the Salem area, including from other Indivisible groups in Dallas, Independence and Albany.

On Wednesday, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, who had, according to her wife in a written statement to Minnesota Public Radio, stopped to “support our neighbors” amid immigration enforcement activity.

Bystander video shows that two officers approached Good’s SUV, which was in multiple lanes but not entirely blocking traffic. The officers asked her to get out of the car, and attempted to open her door. After attempting to reverse, Good then began to drive forward with an officer standing in front of her car, the car’s tires turning to the right. The officer, who the Associated Press has identified as Jonathan Ross, then unholstered his gun and fired three shots at Good.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed afterward that Good was attempting to run over the officer, and that the officer acted in self-defense according to his training. Video analysis by The Washington Post concluded that the officer fired at least two of the three shots into the side of the vehicle after it had already driven past him.

Policing experts said that the officer’s decisions leading up to the shooting defied public safety best practices, according to reporting by the Associated Press.

The protest in Salem on Saturday is among demonstrations taking place across the country, including in Portland where, on Thursday, Border Patrol agents shot two people outside the Adventist Health hospital in southeast Portland. Their conditions have not been made public as of Friday afternoon.

Gapen said that the Thursday shooting in Portland put “an exclamation point” on this Saturday’s protest, which has a main message of “Salem stands with Minneapolis.”

The Salem Police Department has officers specifically assigned to the demonstration, and expects that it will be peaceful, said police spokesman Jonathan Hardy. There are no planned street closures as of Friday afternoon.

Gapen said he’s hopeful for a large turnout, despite the short notice. He expects it won’t be as large as the organization’s “No Kings” rally in October, which drew around 10,000 people.

“People want to do something, and they want to stand up and have their voices heard on this. Because everyone who can rub two brain cells together knows this is bulls–t and we will not stand for it,” Gapen said. “Everybody who sees the video can see clearly what happened.”

Gapen said that they hope to see elected officials in Oregon take steps to mandate that ICE officers work without wearing masks. The organization is also sharing messaging about freezing funding toward the agency.

“(Salem Region Indivisible) wants to see you out there,” Gapen said. “Show up, Salem. We need every one of us.”

Gapen said they’ll likely return to protest again the next day.

“We’ll take a break, go home, go to bed. Then we’ll come back on Sunday, do the same thing,” he said.

Protest organizers said more than 1,000 weekend events were planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ordered by President Donald Trump, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians.

Minneapolis became a major flashpoint of the Republican president's militarized deportation roundups on Wednesday, when an ICE officer shot and killed a 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, behind the wheel of her car on a residential street.

The violence came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the ""largest DHS operation ever."" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a ""reckless"" example of ""governance by reality TV.""

CONFLICTING NARRATIVES OF KILLING

On Friday night, throngs of demonstrators staged a ""noise protest"" outside a Minneapolis hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of ICE agents.

Video posted by activists on social media showed protesters, some wearing brightly colored inflatable costumes, creating a din by beating on drums, banging pots and pans, yelling through bullhorns and blowing on brass instruments and whistles. Others directed high-power flashlight beams at the hotel's windows.

The crowd thinned after yellow-vested state police in riot gear marched into the area and declared an unlawful assembly, although police ""detained, cited and released"" at least 30 people on Friday night, CNN reported.

Police were responding to ""information that demonstrators were no longer peaceful and reports of damage to property,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said on X. ""Dispersal orders were given prior to arrests.""

At the time she was killed, Good was participating in one of numerous ""neighborhood patrols"" that track, monitor and record ICE activities, according to family and local activists.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials said Good was ""impeding"" and ""stalking"" ICE agents all day, and that the officer opened fire in self-defense when she tried to ram her car into him in an ""act of domestic terrorism.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, pointed to bystander video he said directly contradicted the federal government's ""garbage narrative."" Civil liberties advocates said the video showed federal agents lacked any justification for using deadly force.

Amid the sharply differing accounts of the shooting, Minnesota and Hennepin County law enforcement authorities said on Friday they were opening their own criminal inquiry of the incident separate from a federal investigation led by the FBI.

Some Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, asserted state prosecutors lack jurisdiction to charge a federal officer with a crime, though legal experts say federal immunity in such cases is not automatic.

The crisis atmosphere led Walz - a prominent Trump antagonist who branded Trump and his Republican allies as ""weird"" during his own run for vice president last year - to put the state's National Guard on alert.

Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. As in the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to ""weaponize"" his vehicle and run over agents.

DHS on Friday identified the wounded driver and passenger as suspected gang associates from Venezuela who were in the U.S. illegally. The agency said the woman had been involved in a prior shootout in Portland but provided no evidence of its allegations against the pair.

VIDEO EVIDENCE EMERGES

Portland, Oregon, Mayor Keith Wilson, echoing Frey, said he could not be sure the government's account was grounded in fact without an independent investigation.

The deployment of agents to Minneapolis follows Trump's recent denunciations of Walz and his state's large population of Somali immigrants over allegations of fraud dating back to 2020 by some nonprofit groups administering childcare and other social-service programs.

Good was shot dead just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer crushing his neck into the pavement with his knee during a videotaped arrest in May 2020. Floyd's death sparked months of nationwide racial-justice protests during Trump's first term in office.

Bystander video of the Minneapolis incident showed masked officers approaching Good's Honda SUV while it was stopped at a perpendicular angle to the street, partially blocking traffic.

One agent is seen ordering her out of the car and grabbing onto the driver-side front door handle as the car pulls forward and steers away from the officers, one of whom jumps back and fires three shots into the front of the vehicle as it rolls past.

Video filmed by the officer who opened fire, identified through official comment and public records as Jonathan Ross, shows Good appearing calm. She is heard telling him, ""That's fine, dude, I'm not mad at you"" - moments before he opens fire as she drives forward into the street, steering the car away from him.

Noem has said he was treated at a local hospital for unspecified injuries and released.

The car's front bumper appears in the bystander video to pass Ross before he shot at Good. It is unclear from any of the footage whether the vehicle made contact with him.

In any case, Ross is shown remaining on his feet and can be seen walking after the incident, contradicting Trump's assertion on social media that the woman ""ran over the ICE officer.""

The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other U.S. cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner ""ICE Out For Good"" planned for Saturday and Sunday.

The rallies were being organized by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of ""No Kings"" protests against Trump last year.

EAJA thus limits arbitrary, unlawful, and abusive government action by removing financial barriers for people challenging unjustified government actions. The tens of thousands of people currently in immigration detention are exactly the kind of under-resourced litigants whose challenges to government action EAJA was designed to facilitate.

Why it matters: The incident outside the Whipple Federal Building in St. Paul comes amid escalating tensions and protests over an ICE agent's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

What they're saying: Omar said during a press conference she wants people to know, ""this is a blatant disregard of the law.""

Reps. Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, who represent suburban Twin Cities congressional districts, were also present and denied access after they were initially let in.

Omar said she called first to say she and the other representatives were coming, They were initially let in, but Omar claimed two officials then got a message ""that we were no longer allowed,"" declining any further access to the building.

Omar and the other lawmakers also said they were told that because the facility was funded under the Big Beautiful Bill Act, they could be denied access.

Zoom in: Omar said she saw two planes taking off, and was told they were not deportation flights, but were taking detainees to other U.S. facilities.

She said when asked, officials also claimed detainees weren't held long enough to need hygiene products, a claim Omar refutes.

The big picture: Members of Congress have dramatically increased their visits to ICE facilities over the last year, as detentions swelled after the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement efforts, Axios' Brittany Gibson reports.

The increased focus on congressional oversight resulted in 165 such visits in the 2025 fiscal year —more than the previous three years combined.

Context: By law, members can visit ICE detention sites at any time. But the agency has tried to limit that access, accusing Democratic lawmakers of using the visits for political theatrics.

Some oversight visits have been particularly contentious, including a May incident outside a new ICE facility that led to an indictment against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.).

The Trump administration refuses to allow such fraud to continue,” Rollins wrote.
“What’s abundantly clear is that Minneapolis is the latest target of the Trump administration – willing to harm Americans in service to its perceived political gain.” The Guardian has contacted Walz’s office for comment.
The Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over the past year over allegations of fraud, specifically going after the state’s Somali population.
“Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place.”","The Trump administration announced it is suspending $129m in federal benefit payments to Minnesota amid allegations of widespread fraud in the state.

The secretary of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Brooke Rollins, shared a letter on Friday on social media that was addressed to Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, and the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, notifying them of the administration’s decision and citing investigations into alleged fraud conducted by local non-profits and businesses.

“Despite a staggering, wide-reaching fraud scandal, your administrations refuse to provide basic information or take common sense measures to stop fraud. The Trump administration refuses to allow such fraud to continue,” Rollins wrote.

Rollins asked Walz and Frey to provide the USDA with justification for all federal spending from 20 January 2025 to the present within 30 days. She is also requiring that all federal payments to the state moving forward require the same justification.

“We’re communicating with state partners to understand the impacts of such a blanket cut to funding meant for residents most in need,” Brian Feintech, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis, told the Guardian in a written statement in response to Rollins’ letter.

“What’s abundantly clear is that Minneapolis is the latest target of the Trump administration – willing to harm Americans in service to its perceived political gain.”

The Guardian has contacted Walz’s office for comment.

Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, publicly responded to Rollins’ post, writing on X: “I will not allow you to take from Minnesotans in need. I’ll see you in court.”

The USDA’s announcement coincides with a federal ruling that the Trump administration cannot block federal money for childcare subsidies and other programs aimed at supporting low-income families with children from reaching five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota.

The Trump administration has targeted Minnesota over the past year over allegations of fraud, specifically going after the state’s Somali population. Federal prosecutors estimate as much as $9bn has been stolen across schemes allegedly linked to the state’s Somali population.

Trump ended legal protections for Somali migrants in the state in November 2025, claiming that “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from.”

Shortly thereafter, Trump went off on both Somalis and Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota congressional representative who is from Somalia and is a US citizen, in a xenophobic rant during a cabinet meeting.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” the president said. He called Omar “garbage” and said “we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country”.

A month later, in December 2025, the FBI announced that it was deploying additional investigative and personnel resources to “dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs” in the state, according to its director, Kash Patel. Patel said the agency had already dismantled a $250m fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the Covid pandemic in a case that led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions.

Last week, Walz announced that he would not run for a third term as Minnesota’s governor, as his handling of the fraud has fallen under intense scrutiny from Trump and Republicans. In his announcement, Walz acknowledged that the president and his political allies have taken advantage of the crisis to sow further division in the state.

“I won’t mince words here,” Walz said. “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc33ade0a7ae48f0a66cd80202cfc82cf449305/388_0_4725_3782/master/4725.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24e07ccad8f1490eae3f0618d7402f05",N,,2026-01-10 14:56:51.929999

""Say her name!""

""Renee Good.""

About 50 people showed up Jan. 9 for a candlelight vigil for Renee Nicole Good, 37, a U.S. citizen who was fatally shot by a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Jan. 6.

The vigil doubled as a protest against ICE after rumors spread that the agency was in Mansfield. Word of ICE agents gathering in the West Park Shopping Center parking lot spread like wildfire.

However, Mansfield Police Chief Jason Bammann confirmed Jan. 9 that ICE agents were not active in the city. Instead, the officers seen by the public were local law enforcement debriefing after a training exercise.

The country has been on edge since Good was fatally shot. Numerous protests have been held throughout the country, including in a number of Ohio cities.

Good was in her car at the scene of an ICE operation when she was approached by agents who, according to an eyewitness, gave conflicting orders. As Good began to leave the scene, an agent reached in the driver side window. President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good struck a separate ICE agent with her car, who then fired three shots and killed Good as the vehicle moved forward. Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called her killing unwarranted.

""Murder is why I'm here,"" local attorney Cathy Goldman said at Friday's protest, held across the street from the West Park Shopping Center on Park Avenue West. ""I'm a former prosecutor, and I know what murder is.""

Goldman said lies were her other reason for protesting.

""I'm here because they always lie first,"" Goldman said. ""Watch the video. Take your MAGA glasses off and see the truth.""

Protester lauds contributions of immigrants

Goldman said immigrants often do jobs nobody else wants and are valuable contributors to America.

She pounded on a buffalo drum, a type of frame drum inspired by Native American traditions that has a deep, resonant sound, typically played with a mallet or by hand and used in spiritual ceremonies.

Others who gathered Friday agreed. Kay Jewett, 80, of Mansfield, said she has been an activist since the 1960s at Ohio State University. She held a sign that read ""ICE: Inhumane, corrupt, evil.""

Venita Shoulders, who helped organize the protest and is a Democrat on the Richland County Board of Elections, was pleased with the turnout, considering the plan to hold a vigil began only a few hours ahead of time.

""We started getting text messages and calls from people wanting to do something to show respect for Ms. Good in Minnesota,"" she said. ""We were talking all day and said, 'We've gotta do it.'''

While honoring Good, Shoulders said attendees also wanted to keep ICE agents away from the community. One of the chants started with the question, ""What do we want?"" and continued with the answer: ""ICE out.""

""We want our community safe, and we want the immigrants who are here to feel like this is their home, too,"" Shoulders said.

Colton Stidam and Gerald Vega took turns leading chants with a megaphone. The vigil started with the pledge of allegiance.

Attendees opted for battery-operated lights instead of candles for the vigil due to the blustery conditions. They lined the ledge above the sidewalk with blue and white lights.

""This is America,"" Stidam said. ""We do not divide, we do not separate by the color of our skin, our gender.""

Vega called Good's shooting a ""national travesty.""

""This can happen anywhere. You saw it on the news,"" he said.

Friday's vigil lasted just under an hour and went on without incident.

Now, as Minneapolis reels from yet another tragedy making national headlines, Ross is at the center of debate over whether his actions during Wednesday’s confrontation were justified.

Trump administration figures, including President Donald Trump, have defended Ross and claimed that Good was an agitator who attempted to run him over with her SUV. Witnesses have told NBC News that it didn’t appear Ross was in the direct path of Good’s SUV as she tried to evade ICE officers.

Videos contradict Trump’s claim that Good “viciously ran over” Ross, showing that Good’s car didn’t knock him down and that his legs were to the side of the SUV as it moved by him while he fired.

On Friday, on a quiet, suburban cul-de-sac full of multi-level homes about 30 miles from the scene of the shooting in south Minneapolis, few neighbors were out bicycling and walking their dogs. Hockey sticks lay on porches and “let it snow” signs decorated doorways.

Some onlookers from other neighborhoods had come to observe the scene outside Ross’ house, where he lives with his wife and children. Someone had ordered pizza to the home, and a delivery driver spent some time ringing the doorbell before returning to his car, taking the pies with him. Neighbors talked amongst themselves about getting away for the weekend.

One female neighbor, who asked that she not be identified by name for fear of retribution, said she saw people packing boxes at Ross’ home Friday morning.

“What I did see was three trucks and people moving boxes out of there. I texted one of my friends right away,” she said. “I mean, they were really hustling when I was down there.”

Asked who was moving the boxes, she said, “No idea.”

Multiple neighbors told NBC News that during the presidential election, a pro-Trump and at least one “Don’t Tread On Me” Gadsden sign had been on display. There were no political signs outside the house Friday, and Ross’ political affiliation is unknown.

A neighbor who also asked not to be identified by name said everyone in the neighborhood is “freaking out.” She said the pro-Trump signage at Ross’ home was noticeable because “part of the neighborhood is not generally supportive of Trump, so the houses stick out if they are.”

So far, Ross has not made any public statements about the shooting. NBC News has made numerous attempts to reach him with no response.

None of the neighbors interviewed were aware that Ross worked for ICE, but one suspected he had some kind of involvement with the military because they saw him wearing fatigue pants.

Deployed to Iraq as a member of the Indiana National Guard from November 2004 to November 2005, Specialist Ross of the 138th Signal Battalion earned the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal among others, according to the guard.

During his time in Iraq, Ross was a machine gunner on a combat logistical patrol team, court documents show.

After he returned home, Ross joined the U.S. Border Patrol in 2007 in El Paso, Texas and worked for the agency until 2015 as a field intelligence agent who gathered and analyzed information on drug cartels and human traffickers.

That year, Ross joined ICE as a deportation officer based in Minnesota whose job, he testified in a case recently, was to identify and arrest “higher value targets.”

Ross testified that he was also a member of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force as well as a firearms instructor and field intelligence officer. Ross said some of his work involves investigating organized crime and working on national security cases.

Ross was not part of the hiring surge that began in August under Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

While Ross’ name has been widely reported, the DHS has, so far, refused to “expose the name of this officer,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. But the agency has confirmed that Ross was seriously injured in June while trying to arrest an immigrant who had refused to get out of his car.

Court records viewed by NBC News revealed that the sequence of events that left Ross bloodied and bruised bore some similarities to the scenario that ended with Good’s death.

In both cases, Ross was confronting a driver at the wheel of a vehicle.

In the June incident, Ross broke the window of a car when the driver refused to exit the vehicle and then found himself being dragged at least 50 yards when the driver hit the gas.

“I was yelling at him to stop,” Ross testified of Robert Muñoz-Guatemala, who was found guilty last month of assault on a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon. “Over and over and over again at the top of my lungs.”

Ross said in his testimony that he feared for his life and fired his Taser repeatedly at Muñoz-Guatemala.

“It didn’t appear that it affected him at all,” Ross said.

After Ross fell from Muñoz-Guatemala’s car, he was in “excruciating” pain, he said. He needed 33 stitches across all of his wounds.

Seven months after the dragging incident, Ross was on the job again in Minneapolis when he came across Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen.

In videos of the confrontation, which is under investigation by the FBI, Good’s Honda Pilot SUV is seen partially blocking traffic on a residential street with several federal vehicles in her path. Next to the SUV, a woman, who later identified herself as Good’s wife, and Ross, who is masked, are recording the scene with their phones.

One ICE officer tells Good to get out of the car and one grabs the driver’s side door handle and reaches inside the open window.

Ross moves around the SUV, making his way to the front. Witness videos show Good reversing, then moving forward, turning her wheels to the right, away from the officers.

Ross, now at the front driver’s side of the SUV, draws his gun. His video captures what sounds like him hollering “whoa,” and he fires.

Witness videos show that at the moment Ross fires his first shot into the front of the SUV, its wheels are directed away from him. His legs appear to be clear of the car. He fires the second and third shots into the open driver’s side window as the car is moving.

Ross’ phone then captures the SUV accelerating down the street. A male voice says, “f------ b----.”

Good, struck in the head, loses control of the SUV, which accelerates and crashes into a parked car about 140 feet away.

Another of Ross’ neighbors said he was “shocked” when he found out the ICE officer who shot Good lives around the corner.

“I assumed it was some ICE agent that had come into Minnesota for their operations,” said a 44-year-old neighbor who asked to be identified by his first name, which is Jonathan. “It hurts to think that as someone who’s lived here for probably quite a while, because it doesn’t to me reflect what our community is about, what our state is about.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260108-minneapolis-ICE-shooting-car-ew-326p-ad512c.png",N,,2026-01-10 11:58:50.840466

Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into Renee Good's shooting death and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.

""The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,"" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. ""And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.""

Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Mr. Trump and Noem said the ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.

Vice President JD Vance blamed Good, calling it ""a tragedy of her own making,"" and said the ICE officer may have been ""sensitive"" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.

But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.

""The videos I've seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, in a statement.

""As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,"" she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation ""was devastating, and cannot happen again.""

Homeland Security funding up for debate

The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another federal government shutdown when money expires at the end of January.

As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.

""We've been warning about this for an entire year,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat.

The ICE officer ""needs to be held accountable,"" Frost said, ""but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.""

Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.

Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.

Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of the Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.

""More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,"" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.

Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats are splintering between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.

The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.

Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.

""I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,"" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,"" he said.

Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers

In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.

In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent, also in Chicago, shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.

To Rep. Chuy Garcia, a Democrat from Illinois, Good's death ""brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.""

""It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what's going on is out of control,"" he said, ""that this isn't about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.""

Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration's policy, defended the officer's actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.

""Nobody wants to see people get shot,"" said Rep. Rich McCormick, a Republican from Georgia.

""Let's do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they're standing in front of your car,"" he said. ""She made a mistake. I'm sure she didn't mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/10/81ab91e8-a2cf-4122-aa3b-a68bd4f29d69/thumbnail/1200x630/e2b54c83486738fbf635957b030917d3/ap26005632819089.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:58:19.376452

“They should feel safe,” said Mr. Trump, who during his first term tried to wipe it out.
“I want them more than they want me and more than they want this country,” Mr. Trump said.
Still, when asked whether he disagrees on certain policies with Mr. Miller — whose views on immigration are on the far right — Mr. Trump said no.","President Trump threatened in an interview this week to strip some naturalized immigrants of their citizenship, defended an ICE agent who killed a woman in Minneapolis and offered no regrets over officers’ aggressive tactics against immigrants, protesters and American citizens.

But the president at times sought to soften his harsh, anti-immigrant image, as he has done at times. When asked if he would support a plan that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Mr. Trump said “possibly, possibly.” He said so-called Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as children, should feel “safe” in the country and that he would “love to be able to do something for them.”

“I’d love to have a comprehensive immigration policy. Something that really worked. It’s about time for the country,” Mr. Trump said, a remarkable statement for a president whose administration has spent the past year demonizing, threatening and rounding up immigrants in raids across the country.

Many of Mr. Trump’s assertions in the interview on Wednesday evening contradict the actions he’s taken since he returned to office nearly one year ago.

Immigration agents, operating at his direction, have already have already targeted some immigrants brought to the country as children. Neither Mr. Trump nor Republicans in Congress have made any effort to create new protections for immigrants like the Dreamers. And the president has effectively shut down asylum at the border, gutted the refugee program and made it harder for many foreigners looking to work in the United States.

Nevertheless, many of his comments to The New York Times were striking because of how deeply they clashed with the views of Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration policy, and significant portions of his MAGA base.

“I just want people that love our country. It’s very simple,” said Mr. Trump, when asked if his immigration policies — which in some cases favor white people — were aimed at changing the racial makeup of the United States.

Mr. Trump also said he would provide an update on his plans for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in about a year.

“They should feel safe,” said Mr. Trump, who during his first term tried to wipe it out.

He also acknowledged that he had given the directive for ICE to scale back raids on the agriculture, service and hospitality industries, which rely on immigrant labor.

“They have great people working for them who have been working for them for 25 years,” Mr. Trump said, referring to farmers who hire immigrant workers. “They’re almost like a member of the family.”

He also said he was frustrated by an immigration raid of a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia that outraged officials in South Korea.

“I was very angry about it,” Mr. Trump said. “You know why? Because they have to open a factory and you can’t take a person off the street who’s never seen a battery before and think that they’re going to make highly complex batteries.”

Mr. Trump said the United States needed skilled foreign workers at those factories to train Americans on to how manufacture complex batteries.

“I want them more than they want me and more than they want this country,” Mr. Trump said. “We need people. We’re building factories all over the country.”

And yet, in the same interview, he said his administration was examining criteria for stripping some naturalized American citizens of their citizenship, with a particular focus on the Somali community he has frequently insulted.

“You see conflicting messages sometimes from the same mouth and sometimes from two different mouths in the same agency,” said Muzaffar Chishti, a Migration Policy Institute senior fellow. “His connections to the corporate world are deep and long lasting. He is keen on having the corporate end of his base on his side. And immigration is key on having support on that side.”

When the administration issued guidance to largely pause raids at agriculture sites, meatpacking plants, restaurants and hotels — absent other criminality like human trafficking or drug smuggling — some White House officials who wanted Mr. Trump to maintain his pledge for mass deportations were taken by surprise.

Still, when asked whether he disagrees on certain policies with Mr. Miller — whose views on immigration are on the far right — Mr. Trump said no.

The identity of the ICE officer involved in the shooting has not been publicly disclosed. But DHS sources confirmed to NewsNation that he has more than 10 years of experience with the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations unit, a specially trained tactical unit.

A DHS source confirmed that the same federal officer was also involved in an incident on June 17 when he required 33 stitches after sustaining significant cuts after being dragged by the vehicle. DHS officials said at the time that federal immigration officers were attempting to detain Roberto Carlos Munoz, a 39-year-old migrant who had previously been convicted of sexually assaulting a minor.

ICE officers working in St. Paul, Minnesota, had a warrant for Munoz’s arrest and were attempting to detain him during a traffic stop, officials said. As officers were attempting to take Munoz into custody, he refused to roll down his window or exit the vehicle.

An ERO officer broke the rear window and attempted to unlock the car when officials said Munoz put the vehicle in drive. The officer was dragged about 100 yards with his arm inside the vehicle as Munoz reportedly sped up and weaved to try to shake the officer off, DHS previously announced in a news release following the incident.

The officer fired a Taser in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Munoz. Officials said that the officer was eventually freed when the vehicle knocked him out of the window.

Munoz was arrested and charged with assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.

DHS officials have characterized Wednesday’s fatal shooting as an act of self-defense on the part of the ICE officer. Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, along with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, alleges that Good weaponized her vehicle and attempted to run over federal officers with the vehicle.

“It’s clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon. Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon. So I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation,” Noem said Wednesday.

“ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement, but she refused to obey their commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.”

DHS officials praised the work of federal agents, saying they put their lives on the line each day at a time when assaults against federal law enforcement officers have increased significantly over the past year.

Vice President JD Vance said Thursday he wished Good had not reached the point where she chose to block federal officers from doing their jobs. He said that the ICE officer who shot Good was justified in his actions, saying he is protected by absolute immunity after “doing his job.”

“I know there’s an ICE officer right now who very much wishes he was not put in the position where he had to fire a gun to defend his own life,” Vance told reporters.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the federal agency’s description of events “bulls—” and a “garbage narrative.”

Minnesota elected officials say a fund will be established to assist Good’s family.

“I would like to start again extending sympathies to Renee Good’s wife and child, to the rest of the family,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday, describing the shooting as an “unimaginable tragedy.”

“Minnesotans will be there to defend her honor, and see this as a human being, not a moment in time,” Walz said.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2026/01/GettyImages-2255109761_d9eb4d.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-10 11:12:27.052635

On Monday, ICE officers pulled over Edwin Godinez, 29, and his stepbrother, Yair Napolés, 22, in an unmarked vehicle in the city located between Charlotte and Greensboro.

While starting the workday at their family's construction business, the stepbrothers learned that two of their immigrant coworkers were detained and arrested by ICE while on their way to work.

Their co-workers' work vehicle and attached trailer were left behind, so Godinez and Napolés decided to recover the vehicles. That's when officers stopped them, the men told WUNC in an interview.

But the officers did not identify themselves or give the two Mexican American men any explanation for the stop on Jan. 5.

What the viral video shows

Officers initially told the stepbrothers they were okay to record the interaction, as they remained seated in their car and provided their identification to them, according to a video that has since gone viral on Tiktok and X.

The officers appeared to have focused their attention on Napolés, who was born in Roxboro, North Carolina. Godinez was born in California.

Moments later, an officer said they were detaining the men and demanded they turn off their phones — Godinez calmly refused with one hand on the steering wheel and defended his right to record.

An officer then lunged for his phone through the window and reaches inside to open the door.

“We haven’t done anything wrong,"" Godinez said. ""You are not allowed to do this!""

Officers tried to pull out Godinez, and appear to hit him while doing so, according to the video. They also tried to remove Napolés from the passenger seat.

The officers gave conflicting demands: while trying to remove Godinez and Napolés from the car, they also yelled at them to make their hands visible, while also demanding they stop recording. One officer can be heard saying they were ""interfering with an investigation.""

Neither men were arrested, and the officers eventually left them.

""In shock, traumatized""

Both of the men told WUNC in an interview that the incident left them physically and mentally shaken and unable to work for most of the week.

Napolés says he thinks the officers believed he was lying about being a U.S. citizen.

""I think they might have thought, 'he's illegal,'"" said Napolés, in Spanish. ""They opened the car door and tried to pull me out. I felt even more scared since we had already told them we were citizens.""

Napolés said that unlike his stepbrother, he's not fluent in English, because he lived many years in Mexico.

""There's no reason why I've had to even turn off my phone,"" said Godinez. ""(The officer) is telling me to comply, but yet he's also already hurting us, and then he's trying to drag me out of the car, and for me to still also not be recording, which to me, is insane.""

The stepbrothers say they were fortunate to have captured everything on camera.

Godinez said doing so was especially important, in light of the fatal shooting by immigration enforcement agents of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

""Look at what happened to her,"" he said. ""I can only imagine what they would have done to us had we not been recording, and if they would have dragged us outside just looking for a reason to escalate the whole thing further.""

As far as their coworkers who were arrested by ICE, they were described as Guatemalan immigrants who were hardworking men and essential employees of the family company for years.

Teresa de la Rosa, Godinez's mother and Napoles' stepmother, was present recording at the scene. De la Rosa told WUNC that she had to seek medical attention after she suffered an anxiety attack.

""I never thought I would live through something like that,"" said Napolés. ""It leaves you in shock, traumatized.""

What ICE said

In an emailed statement to WUNC, an ICE spokesman said officers were targeting a previously removed illegal immigrant. Officers ""used reasonable suspicion to pull over the vehicle"" which they believed had a previously removed illegal immigrant inside.

No U.S. citizens were arrested, and the stepbrothers were accused of refusing to follow ""commands, including officers' concerns about keeping their hands visible"" according to the ICE statement.

It's the second time in recent months that a video of federal immigration agents detaining a Latino U.S. citizen in North Carolina goes viral on social media.

The demonstrations follow the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, 37, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, an incident activists say reflects “a broader pattern of unchecked violence, impunity, and abuse” by federal immigration agencies.

The movement, branded by many as “ICE Out For Good,” is gaining traction statewide. Organizers are calling for the removal of ICE agents from communities and demanding an end to what they describe as “Venezuelan occupation.”

The protests also come just days after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3, with President Trump vowing to “run” the nation until a democratic transition occurs. Critics argue the administration’s focus on Venezuela’s oil industry is fueling unrest.

Adding to tensions, two individuals were shot and injured by a federal agent in Portland on Jan. 8. Homeland Security claims both have gang affiliations, but activists say the shootings underscore systemic issues with immigration enforcement.

Here's what to know about this weekend's protests in California.

Where Californians are taking to the streets

Protests are planned across the state on Saturday, Jan. 10, and Sunday, Jan. 11, with organizers urging participants to bring signs, water, and masks. Here’s a non-exhaustive list:

Southern California

Demonstrations are planned across Los Angeles County and beyond, including Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, and other Coachella Valley communities. Faith leaders rallied in L.A. on Jan. 8, demanding a full investigation into Good’s death, while Boyle Heights saw a large turnout that evening. Expect weekend protests in Aliso Viejo, Big Bear Lake, Chula Vista, Encinitas, Huntington Beach, Laguna Hills, Lakewood, Oxnard, Pasadena, Palmdale, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara, Santa Clarita, Seal Beach, Signal Hill, Sierra Madre, Temecula, Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Woodland Hills—and notably, Palm Springs, a focal point for Coachella Valley activism.

Central Valley

Organizers confirm that rallies in Fresno, Bakersfield, and Modesto are being coordinated alongside statewide efforts, spotlighting concerns about ICE's presence in agricultural hubs. Local chapters of Indivisible and immigrant rights groups are expected to lead marches demanding accountability and policy change.

Northern California

From Sacramento to the Bay Area, protests continue in Berkeley, Chico, Concord, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Richmond, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Cruz, and more.

What should I bring to a protest?

Experts at Physicians for Human Rights suggest bringing the following:

Backpack or string bag: You won't want anything bulky and you'll want your hands free. Fanny packs can also help.

Face mask or bandanna: Useful for helping to shield your eyes from pepper spray or tear gas.

Water: You'll need to stay hydrated. Bring as big a bottle as you can, with a squirt top in case you need to quickly wash off your skin or eyes.

Glasses: Avoid wearing contact lenses, which can trap irritating chemicals. If you must wear contacts, wear shatter-resistant goggles with a tight seal. Avoid wearing makeup such as eyeliner for the same reason.

Comfortable clothes, closed shoes: You may want to cover as much skin as possible. You should also consider bringing a spare change of clothes in your bag in case your clothes get sprayed. Some protesters make a point of wearing all black, or at least clothes without obvious slogans or easily identifiable markings.

A few days of any vital medication: In case you are arrested. Ideally, they should be in a labeled prescription bottle.

Cash: In case you need bail.

Snacks: High-energy, high-protein munchies are preferred.

Many organizations advise protesters to leave their phones at home to protect their privacy, as they can easily be tracked. If you must take your phone, keep it turned off until you need it, and before you go, disable Face ID or fingerprint security and stick with the 6-digit passcode instead. You may also consider buying a cheap secondary phone to use.

Also, if you bring a phone, bring a backup power source if possible, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

What the video shows

What we know:

The video, first shared by AlphaNews, a Minnesota-based independent media outlet and obtained by FOX News, appears to show the angle of the deadly Wednesday shooting from the ICE agent’s perspective.

The video begins with the person recording getting out of their vehicle and approaching the passenger side of Good’s car.

The goal of the video appeared to be getting recorded evidence of the driver of the vehicle, as well as the license plate number.

Another person, who appears to be Good’s wife, Becca, is seen recording as well, saying, ""That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.""

An apparent ICE agent is then heard telling Good to get out of her car, after which Good can be heard calmly telling the agent recording the video, ""That's fine dude, I'm not mad at you.""

When Good attempted to drive off, it appeared that the person recording the video had to quickly jump out of the way, after which gunshots rang out.

The video then shows the rear of Good’s car before it crashed.

What we don't know:

FOX Local has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the video or who shot it.

What they're saying:

The video, which has gotten millions of views and thousands of shares, is drawing both skepticism and validation among the public.

One commenter said:

""This incident was so razor thin that both sides feel completely justified in what they think about the situation. It’s clear to me that everyone involved made an adrenaline-fueled decision through possibly some panic. Crazy.""

Another commented:

""She turns her wheel away from him. Very clearly turns her wheel.""

The video was retweeted by both the Department of Homeland Security and Vice President JD Vance.

DHS' response to the video

When attempting to verify the authenticity of the video, as well as if the video was shot by an ICE officer, the DHS simply responded to FOX Local with only a link to the video it retweeted from Alpha News' account.

Who is the ICE agent?

The ICE officer who fatally shot Good has been identified as Jonathan Ross. DHS confirmed to FOX 9 that the officer who fired his weapon on Wednesday is the same officer who was dragged 50 yards by a suspect in a vehicle back in June.

The man who dragged Ross was indicted on one count of assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous or deadly weapon, and a federal jury found him guilty in December 2025.

Protests following ICE shooting in Minnesota

Local perspective:

The reaction to Good's shooting was immediate in the city where police killed George Floyd in 2020, with hundreds of protesters converging on the shooting scene and the school district canceling classes for the rest of the week as a precaution.

On Thursday night, hundreds marched in freezing rain down one of Minneapolis’ major thoroughfares, chanting ""ICE out now!"" and holding signs saying, ""Killer ice off our streets.""

And on Friday, protesters were out again demonstrating outside a federal facility that is serving as a hub for the immigration crackdown that began Tuesday in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Authorities erected barricades outside the facility Friday.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2026/01/1200/630/shooting-still-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2026-01-10 06:56:25.944933
