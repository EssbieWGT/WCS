You're listening to TRUMP'S TERMS from NPR. I'm Scott Detrow.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be doing all sorts of things nobody ever thought was even possible.

MIKE JOHNSON: President Trump has brought back strength to the White House.

JD VANCE: We can't just ignore the president's desires.

TRUMP: This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time.

DETROW: Every episode of TRUMP'S TERMS, we bring you NPR's latest coverage of the 47th president, with a focus on actions and policies he is pursuing on his own terms and, in the process, taking the presidency into uncharted territory. Today's story starts right after this.

AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. President Trump has vowed to conduct a mass deportation of everyone who's in the country without legal status. But there are a few groups of people who live in a gray area, including DACA recipients. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is supposed to protect people from immigration enforcement, but several DACA recipients have been arrested and detained. NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi.

RASCOE: So the DACA program was created in 2012. Where does it stand today?

BUSTILLO: The program was created to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation. But DACA is not an immediate path to citizenship or even a green card. Participants instead have to renew their protection every two years. They can also be removed from the program and lose protections if they commit crimes. Currently, about half a million people are on DACA, and now many of them are in their 30s and 40s. It provides a work permit and can be adjusted if a person leaves the U.S. and comes back with a visa or marries a U.S. citizen, among other options to adjust status. And since it was created, there has been no successful effort to provide a pathway to legal status for those who are on the program. Plus, the president had already tried to repeal DACA in his first term, and he failed to do so.

RASCOE: Since President Trump couldn't get DACA repealed then, how is he approaching the program in his second term?

BUSTILLO: So far, no regulatory changes have been made to formally end the program, but parts of Trump's administration have made moves to strip benefits. For example, the Health and Human Services Department said in June DACA recipients would no longer be eligible to buy insurance through the federal health care marketplace. Then in July, the Education Department launched an investigation into five universities that offer financial help directly to DACA recipients. And as the Homeland Security Department has increased the rates of arrests, there have been reports of DACA recipients being caught up in worksite raids and even deportations. At one point, I asked DHS about this, and they told me that DACA did not confer legal status and that those without legal status are encouraged to self-deport. Now, that's a very strong message that deviates from the first public statement Trump made after he won the election last year.

RASCOE: So what did he say then?

BUSTILLO: At the time, Trump said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. Now, both Republicans and Democrats have hung on to that statement made in December as a sign that someday Trump may say he's ready to come to that negotiating table, though there has since been nearly no discussion on the issue. And instead, the focus is still on deportations.

RASCOE: DACA could be addressed not just by the president, but particularly by Congress. What can Congress do?

BUSTILLO: Right. Ultimately, any permanent solution has to come from Congress, but the coalition that cares about this issue is a little bit fractured right now. I spoke with several GOP senators and representatives that have all previously supported finding a pathway for DACA recipients. And Senate Democrats have been increasingly vocal about the urgency to find a solution because arrests are happening. Still, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and there was the consensus that nothing would happen this year. There are simply other concerns at the top of lawmakers' minds, like keeping the government from shutting down, for example. And they also said that they were waiting for the president himself to say that it's time to broker a deal. There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients. But there isn't a sense that they will move anytime soon, even as Trump's deportation efforts only grow.

RASCOE: That's NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much for joining us.

BUSTILLO: Thanks, Ayesha.

Advocates say that many have chosen that path out of fear and that immigration has shifted dramatically under the Trump administration.

“Personal rights, human rights, immigration rights.
In body camera footage from the Cato raid, a federal agent discussed the lack of access to the outside world for people in detention centers.","In the first months of the Trump administration, the country has witnessed a tightened grip on immigration. There has been a greater presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), large-scale deportation goals and policies to revoke status from individuals who have long maintained it.

Immigrants are living in fear, local advocates said, seen as tally marks on the administration’s checklist, not individuals with human rights.

“What we are talking about here is not numbers, not statistics, but people, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, coworkers and friends,” said Ana Menez-Vasquez, Western New York regional coordinator for Rural and Migrant Ministry.

According to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, during Donald Trump’s first presidential term, around 1.5 million immigrant repatriations were carried out. Under the Biden administration, from 2021 to 2025, there were 4.4 million repatriations. A large percentage of this number can be credited to 3 million expulsions under the pandemic-era Title 42 order. President Obama's eight years in office saw a total of 2.7 million deportations — more than any other president in U.S. history. Yet, President Trump is now challenging this high.

In the first eight months of Trump’s current presidency, the administration has recorded 2 million deportations — around 5% more people than his first term. Such rapid removals align with a central promise made during Trump’s 2024 campaign to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. The majority of repatriations include immigrants who have chosen to self deport. Advocates say that many have chosen that path out of fear and that immigration has shifted dramatically under the Trump administration.

“We used to have our rights and the rights of our clients, being able to enforce them with ICE or with any agency. Now they are violating all our clients' rights, not only under the Immigration and Nationality Act but under the Constitution,” said Syracuse-based immigration lawyer Jose Perez.

Perez, who continues to represent several local people in immigration cases, said even though it is illegal for law enforcement to racially profile, federal agents still are.

“The most important thing right now is to understand that we're in a climate where the rights of individuals that are not from the United States and that look different are being questioned,” said Perez. “We need immigration reform. We don't need [to be] rounding up people by the look of them, or by nationality, accent, or different cultural backgrounds.”

The Supreme Court, however, recently paused a ruling after the Trump administration’s request, allowing agents at immigration raids across Los Angeles to racially profile who they decide to stop.

Federal initiatives feel extremely targeted, Perez said. The halt on issuance of worker visas and the tightened requirements regarding the English Language Proficiency (ELP) for commercial truck drivers, are two of many.

While a raid earlier this month at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners factory has grabbed headlines, Marc Alessi, an organizer for the Syracuse Immigrant and Refugee Defense Network, said ICE is active all over – including Syracuse.

“I mean, it's kind of happening all over the place. And that's of course, because ICE's budget was just tripled in the latest, by Congress, so they now have all the resources and manpower to do things like this all the time,” Alessi said at a recent immigration rally in Fulton.

Federal officials have said that anyone in the U.S. without proper documentation are breaking the law and are therefore criminals. A spokesperson for the agency said the enforcement of policies is an effort to protect public safety and combat the “undermining of the American labor market.""

“The employment of illegal aliens also incentivizes dangerous and illegal practices, including Social Security fraud. As we saw during a recent worksite operation in Nebraska, many illegal aliens use stolen Social Security numbers and identities to unlawfully obtain wages, health benefits and employment authorization. Behind every stolen Social Security number uncovered these operations is a real American — mothers, fathers, students, and disabled workers — now facing devastating financial, emotional, and legal fallout,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

None of the 57 workers detained in the Cato raid are accused of using stolen Social Security numbers.

Yet, Perez echoed sentiments from Alessi and other advocates, saying that despite the actions a person takes, ICE agents may still detain them.

Melina Ivanchikova stood in Voorhees Park in Fulton during the Cato raid rally. Ivanchikova, an organizer with Finger Lakes Rapid Response, translated a statement on behalf of a mother whose son was recently taken by ICE.

“My son had his papers and his work permit in order, but they aren't allowing that anymore,” said the mother’s statement. “We feel fear every day. We are asking what is going to happen tomorrow, and we feel even more sad. Nobody was even doing anything wrong.”

With grit in her voice, Jessica Maxwell, director of the Workers Center of Central New York, clutched the microphone that she held stiff to her chest.

“We are seeing workers living in fear and this includes not just undocumented workers, [but also] workers with valid working papers,” said Maxwell. “This is really sending shock waves, so that now we are having people call saying, ‘I thought I would stay, but now I don't know. I have my working papers, but now I'm not sure that's enough. I don't know what to do.’ This is the kind of chaos that the community is dealing with.”

Even weeks after the Cato raid, immigrants in the area are traumatized, these local advocates said. They are now less likely to seek medical care, go to work and connect with their neighbors, regardless of their status.

“The raid at Cato Nutri-Bar did not just remove workers from a factory floor, it ripped open the fabric of our community,” said Menez-Vasquez.

As an immigration attorney, Perez emphasized the importance of knowing your rights regardless of your status as an immigrant in America. Under the Constitution, even noncitizens have the right to remain silent and refuse search, unless authorities have reasonable suspicion.

“Personal rights, human rights, immigration rights. Anything that you can think of ICE is violating right now,” said Perez. “Every single law that is in the books protecting someone not to be harassed, stereotyped, detained for reasons that are unlawful. We have situations in which U.S. citizens that speak with an accent, just like myself, have to tell ICE ‘I am citizen, and I know my rights.’”

While Perez has taken on many immigration cases in Central New York, overall, there aren’t enough resources.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but I would say, of the whole [state] of New York,” he said. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful that speak Spanish. I'm the only one in the Syracuse area that speaks Spanish and does immigration.” Immigrants typically have an incredibly hard time finding legal representation. Not only is there a shortage of immigration attorneys, but financial barriers and restricted communications at ICE facilities for detainees, including minimal to no phone, mail and email access.

In body camera footage from the Cato raid, a federal agent discussed the lack of access to the outside world for people in detention centers.

“I would not let anybody out of their cells, so we did it in an orderly fashion, had them all lined up. It’s bathroom time, or it’s f— brush your teeth time, or it’s food time. Other than that, nope, your a— is staying in there. ‘But you can’t do that.’ I absolutely can. ‘I need a phone call.’ No, you don’t. ‘I need to go to medical.’ Nope, you look good to me,” the agent in the video said, mimicking a conversation with a person detained.

Maxwell, her boots dug into the park grass, continued to speak with frustration.

“We need justice from the immigration courts. We are tired of this kangaroo court where you don't even have access to lawyers,” Maxwell added.

The immigrant communities that make up America no longer feel as safe as they once did, advocates said.

“We have witnessed the deep fear and humiliation caused when people are treated as disposable rather than as human beings. This is not about politics. This is about humanity,” said Menez-Vasquez. “Every single person deserves dignity, respect and safety. No family should have to live with the trauma of separation. No child should have to wonder if their parent will disappear overnight. We will not stand by while our neighbors are targeted or racially profiled and fear is weaponized while families are torn apart. We are here to say it's we, not they. We demand accountability. We demand compassion and we demand justice.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/spec-ice-raid,N,,2025-09-29 16:57:00.358663

WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10) joined all of his Homeland Security Committee Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to Chairman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02) demanding that Trump “Border Czar” Tom Homan testify before the Committee following reports he accepted a $50,000 cash bribe while promising access to lucrative government contracts.

“The American people deserve to know why President Trump’s so-called Border Czar allegedly used his position and influence to take bribes in his own self-interest. Congress must investigate Tom Homan’s actions and his influence on government spending,” the Members wrote.

According to reporting, the FBI recorded Homan in September 2024 accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as contractors after indicating he could help them win border enforcement deals. Federal prosecutors reportedly considered charges of conspiracy, bribery, and fraud, but the investigation stalled once Trump took office. Trump’s political appointees officially closed the case earlier this month.

Homan’s consulting firm previously advertised its ability to “open doors” to DHS contracts, boasting of tens of millions of dollars in government deals for private clients. While portions of his client list remain hidden, reporting shows that some of Homan's business partners have already profited under Trump’s $170 billion border and immigration enforcement spending spree funded by the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Goldman and his colleagues say Homan’s testimony is urgently needed to ensure DHS contracting is not being corrupted by political insiders cashing in on Trump’s extreme immigration agenda.

Read the letter here(link is external) or below.

Dear Chairman Garbarino:

We call on you to require Trump administration “Border Czar” Tom Homan to appear before the Committee to answer allegations that he accepted cash bribes in exchange for promises to deliver government contracts.

According to media reports, on September 20, 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recorded Tom Homan, now President Donald Trump’s so-called “Border Czar,” accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help undercover agents posing as business executives win government contracts related to border enforcement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI initially planned to wait to see whether Homan would deliver on his alleged promise once he became Border Czar, and were considering potential charges of conspiracy, bribery, and two kinds of fraud against Homan. However, the investigation reportedly stalled soon after Donald Trump became President in January 2025, and Trump political appointees officially closed the case in recent weeks.

Homan has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s extreme immigration enforcement tactics, positioning him to help former business partners and clients capitalize on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) border security and immigration enforcement spending. In fact, Homan’s consulting firm, Homeland Strategic Consulting LLC, previously advertised its ability to help businesses cash in on government contracts, stating, “We have a proven track record of opening doors and bringing successful relationships to our clients, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts to private companies.”

Portions of Homan’s client list remain shielded from scrutiny by Congress and the public. Nevertheless, it is well known that some of Homan’s former business partners have been turning enormous profits under the Trump administration. Scrutinizing Homan’s role in DHS contracting is critical as the administration rushes to obligate $170 billion in border security and immigration enforcement funding provided under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” As the Committee responsible for ensuring that DHS’s mission is faithfully executed, we have an obligation to take testimony, on the record, regarding the role that Homan has played in the Department’s contracting decisions since entering government in January 2025.

No one is above the law. The American people deserve to know why President Trump’s so-called Border Czar allegedly used his position and influence to take bribes in his own self-interest. Congress must investigate Tom Homan’s actions and his influence on government spending. We urgently request that you call him to testify before the Committee on this matter without delay.

Canada's government barred entry and residency for “senior officials” of the Islamic Republic in 2022 citing accusations Tehran is a state-sponsored terrorism and systematic human rights abuser.

The policy aims also to prevent the risk of so-called transnational repression by Iran or its agents among Canada's sizable Iranian diaspora community. It tasks CBSA with cases of people it deems inadmissible to Canada to the IRB for review.

Pirnoon, worked as a civil engineer and Director-General of the Road Maintenance Office at Iran’s Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization for 22 years.

The IRB found he did not to meet the statutory definition of an Iranian “senior official” or to have “significant influence over the exercise of government power,"" therefore the legal requirement for his being deemed inadmissible was not met.

Pirnoon came to Canada on a tourist visa in 2022 and was working as an Uber driver when the Canada Border Services Agency launched deportation proceedings.

Three-year track record

Official data indicates that 23 individuals have been identified as suspected senior Iranian officials and 21 cases have been referred to the IRB.

But only three removal orders have been issued, with just one removal carried out to date, though some have departed voluntarily.

Canada has previously referred identified Iranian officials in the country to the IRB to assess their status and determine whether they qualify as “senior officials.”

These include Majid Iranmanesh, a former director-general in the Vice-Presidency for Science and Technology, whom the IRB found to be a senior official and ordered removed on February 2, 2024.

Another was Seyed Salman Samani, former deputy minister and spokesperson of Iran’s Interior Ministry, who received a removal order on March 20, 2024.

By contrast, in several other cases—including Pirnoon’s—the IRB has found that an official position alone, attendance of official ceremonies or routine administrative duties do not prove actual influence over policymaking or the exercise of power.","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/6335fb00f02133d7cea3a1aad2dd23dc408fce24-960x540.jpg?rect=73,67,773,406&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-09-29 15:57:55.000995

Investigators said the women followed the agent home, livestreamed their pursuit and then posted the agent’s address online, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Once they arrived at the agent’s home, prosecutors allege the women shouted “ICE lives on your street and you should know,” according to the indictment.

The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of publicly disclosing the personal information of a federal agent, the statement said.

Prosecutors said a 25-year-old woman from Panorama City, California, is free on $5,000 bond. A 38-year-old resident of Aurora, Colorado, who is also charged in a separate case with assault on a federal officer, is in custody without bond.

And authorities are searching for the third defendant, a 37-year-old woman from Riverside, California.

“Our brave federal agents put their lives on the line every day to keep our nation safe,” Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement. “The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time.”

Doxing is a typically malicious practice that involves gathering private or identifying information and releasing it online without the person’s permission, usually in an attempt to harass, threaten, shame or exact revenge.

Attorneys for the women could not immediately be reached on Monday. An email was sent to the Federal Public Defender’s Office asking if its attorneys are representing the defendants.

According to the indictment, the three women last month followed an ICE agent from the federal building in downtown Los Angeles to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park east of LA. They livestreamed the entire event, court documents say.

In July, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to prosecute people for publishing federal agents’ personal information in response to fliers in Portland, Oregon, that called for people to collect intel on ICE.

Critics of the Trump administration’s raids have expressed outrage over federal agents wearing masks and refusing to identify themselves in public while arresting immigrants in California.

This Latine Heritage Month, I’m reminded of the strength of the women in my family in the face of migration and uncertainty, and the extraordinary community in the U.S. that welcomed us.

My brother was eventually diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that worsens over time and has no cure. By age 6, I was translating at his appointments, reading letters from doctors and helping my parents complete Medicaid forms—while balancing a childhood and a new home. It was only through constant advocacy that we managed to get him the care he needed.

Decades later, too many immigrant communities, including Latines across the country, still struggle to access basic healthcare. Many are excluded from insurance programs, forced to wait years to qualify, or unable to find providers who understand their language or culture.

By age 6, I was translating at his appointments, reading letters from doctors and helping my parents complete Medicaid forms—while balancing a childhood and a new home.

As government attacks on immigrant communities increase, the threat of deportation, family separation and criminalization keeps many from seeking the critical healthcare they need to survive. This fear is paralyzing, too many times leading to avoidable illnesses and worse health outcomes. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many of our policies deny this right to immigrants.

To make matters worse, the Republican tax and spending plan signed into law earlier this year made the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program. These programs are lifelines for millions of individuals across the nation. The aftermath means the closure of hundreds of Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide essential health services ranging from cancer treatment to contraceptive care. The law also makes it harder for immigrant communities to access affordable insurance, as the government instead pours billions into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and immigrant detention centers.

As for reproductive care, immigrants have long been unable to access abortion care because of coverage gaps or restrictions. I saw this firsthand in college while working at a family help desk at the public hospital in Boston and in a women’s health clinic—where, beyond my own life experience, I learned about the depth of health inequities and injustices that people face in this country and how they lead to adverse health outcomes.

Once, as I was helping an immigrant woman from Haiti sign up for Medicaid and food support, she confessed she had not come to the hospital or clinic even once, until she needed to give birth to her son one month pre-term. The reason? She didn’t have insurance.

As she prepared to be discharged while her son remained in the NICU, she struggled to determine how she would feed herself or her other two children without being able to work due to the early birth.

Her story, along with countless others, remains seared in my mind as living, breathing examples of the toll of inequities.

I have spent my life advocating for healthcare, starting with my own family. I often reflect on conversations with my grandmother, who had 11 children—who told me that if she had access to birth control, she would have chosen for herself how many children to have. She wanted that freedom for me and for all her children and grandchildren.

Ever since, my career has enabled me to analyze the cause of maternal death in Mexico, especially from unsafe abortions; support people seeking abortion care in California through an abortion fund; and advocate to expand health clinics through Planned Parenthood. I’ve seen how transformative it is when people have the information and care they need to shape their futures.

When people have the power to make decisions about their bodies and lives, families thrive. Our research shows that undocumented and mixed-status families are especially harmed by abortion bans and at risk of criminalization because of their status. With the possibility of Planned Parenthood being forced to close many more health centers, it will be harder to get abortion care, even in states with the right to abortion. It’s the national ban extremists have long wanted.

Misinformation also runs rampant, leaving people unsure if abortion is legal where they live. Traveling to another state can mean risking detention and family separation. Abortion bans only deepen barriers for immigrant communities.

Healthcare access, including the full spectrum of reproductive care, can make or break lives. Nobody should be denied healthcare, no one should have to choose between paying for healthcare and rent, and no one should fear deportation for going to the doctor. All of us should have access to care. Period.

Healthcare couldn’t wait for my family. It can’t wait for millions more in our communities who are denied care or too afraid to seek the care they need.

We must work together to ensure all of us can raise our families with health, safety and dignity. Latine communities across the country are vibrant and resilient.

This Latine Heritage Month, we invite you to join us in our mission to achieve salud, dignidad y justicia for every member of our community.

Together, we can ensure that no one is left behind.",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203129173.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:29.633087

Trump ordered troops to the City of Roses after falsely asserting that “domestic terrorists” had Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities in the “War ravaged” city “under siege.”

“I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” Trump said in a social media post announcing the deployment.

In response to the president’s post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signed a memo claiming to federalize 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for at least 60 days.

The law enforcement officials’ testimony were filed as part of Oregon and Portland’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s deployment.

In a declaration Monday, Craig Dobson, a Portland police official, testified that the president’s characterization of Portland and protests outside of an ICE facility in southwest Portland did not match reality.

While there have been protests outside the facility, Dobson said demonstrations have been largely peaceful and have only amounted to a few people gathering outside of the ICE facility on a nightly basis.

The protests began in June after federal officials arrested asylum seekers in Portland’s immigration court, Dobson noted.

“For the most part, nightly ICE-Facility protests since July 18, 2025, have been limited to fewer than thirty participants. The protests have been largely sedate during this time,” Dobson said. “Certainly, these protests bear no resemblance to the sustained, large protests of 2020.”

Dobson added that since the demonstrations started, the PPB has intervened to protect public safety only a few times. The bureau made 25 arrests at protests outside the facility in mid June but hasn’t made any arrests since then, despite nightly monitoring.

“The notion that the ICE-Facility protests cannot be adequately managed by those local and federal resources already present before September 27, 2025, when the federal government ordered the deployment of federal troops into the area, cannot be squared with the facts on the ground,” Dobson testified.

The assistant chief also warned that the Trump administration’s deployment could undermine public order by inciting larger demonstrations.

“The contemplated federal troop deployment is unnecessary and counterproductive. Rather than improve public safety at the ICE-Facility protests, or in Portland more generally, the deployment is likely to provoke a larger protest.”

In a separate declaration, Cameron Bailey, a captain with the Oregon State Police, said the PPB in recent months made no request for additional law enforcement assistance, indicating that the bureau believed it had sufficient resources to maintain order.

Thousands of people peacefully marched through downtown Portland Sunday to protest Trump’s deployment and ICE activity in the city. The PPB said that no reports of injuries and no arrests were made in relation to the march.

In an interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump appeared to question his own perception of Portland after speaking with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D).

“I spoke to the governor, she was very nice,” Trump said. “But I said, ‘Well wait a minute, am I watching things on television that are different from what’s happening? My people tell me different.’ They are literally attacking and there are fires all over the place … it looks like terrible.”

Hours after Trump gave the interview, however, Hegseth issued the memo claiming to federalize the Oregon National Guard troops.

The memo cited 10 U.S.C. 12406, an archaic statute that allows the president to mobilize the Guard when the country faces foreign invasion or rebellion, or when the president is unable to execute laws with regular resources.

Trump used the same statute over the objections of California leaders earlier this year to federalize thousands of National Guard troops in response to unrest in Los Angeles, which the president claimed was a “rebellion” against the federal government.

After California challenged the deployment, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined Trump was within his authority to federalize Guard troops because conditions in LA were sufficient for use of the statute.

However, the panel rejected the Trump administration’s argument that judges could not review a president’s decision to federalize the National Guard, ruling that a president could not federalize Guard troops “based on no evidence whatsoever.”

Trump’s deployment to LA eventually swelled to around 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines.

Oregon and Portland’s lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael Simon, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The Ninth Circuit could soon again confront whether Trump’s use of 10 U.S.C. 12406 was legal, as appeals from the District of Oregon are heard by the Ninth Circuit.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237687579-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:49.040040

Customs and Border Protection has 67,792 workers and would retain 63,243 during a shutdown, according to the plan.

Like the Pentagon, much of the Department of Homeland Security is considered ""essential"" to government operations and remains on duty during a temporary funding shutdown.

In stark contrast, the White House Office of Management and Budget asked agencies for plans to lay off non-essential workers rather than simply furlough them, as in past shutdowns.

Congress nearly tripled ICE’s funding this year − from $10 billion to $28.7 billion − as part of President Donald Trump’s top priority of increasing deportations. The extra funding included $50,000 bonuses to spur hiring 14,000 more agents.

The Des Moines School Board is meeting Monday night to place embattled Superintendent Ian Roberts on unpaid leave after state officials revoked his administrator license.

Roberts is being held on a deportation order following his Sept. 26 arrest by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement agents for allegedly being in the United States illegally.

The Des Moines School Board placed Roberts on paid administrative leave on Sept. 27, and the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his license on Sept. 28.

After receiving word of the revocation, the School Board added Roberts to the special board meeting agenda.

""This morning the school district learned that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners has officially revoked Dr. Roberts’ education license to practice in the state of Iowa,"" according to an Sept. 29 district news release. ""The School Board is scheduled to take action to place Dr. Roberts on unpaid administrative leave retroactive to the BOEE’s decision. This action is required by law.""

Following Roberts arrest, federal officials have said he received a court-issued ""final order of removal"" in May 2024 in relation to an earlier court case. DMPS officials have stated they were unaware of the removal order or that Roberts may have misrepresented himself as an American citizen.

“New information and confirmed facts will continue to inform our decisions as we develop a path forward,” said Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris, in the release. “Two things can be true at the same time — Dr. Roberts was an effective and well-respected leader, and there are serious questions related to his citizenship and ability to legally perform his duties as superintendent.”

The board has reached out to Roberts' legal counsel as well.

“We hope to hear from Dr. Roberts, but in the interim, we must make decisions that are fact-based, legally sound and in the best interest of our students, staff and families,"" Norris said.

The board is schedule to meet at 4:45 p.m., Central Campus, 1800 Grand Ave., Des Moines.

State revokes Ian Roberts' administrative license

The announcement of school board's intention to place Roberts on unpaid leave comes hours after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners announced that it had revoked his administrator license.

""Our office has received information that you no longer possess legal presence in the United States, therefore you (are) not able to hold a license issued by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners,"" a letter from BOEE Executive Director Micheal Cavin to Roberts dated Sept. 28 states. ""… The license issued by the Board of Educational Examiners is no longer valid and your authority to serve as superintendent is revoked.""

The Iowa Department of Education sent out a one sentence news release about the change the morning of Sept. 29.

Before joining DMPS, Roberts underwent several background checks, including one by the state's board of education examiners.

Roberts was licensed by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023. Before Sunday's revocation, Roberts' professional administrator license was set to expire Dec. 31, 2028.

Roberts has until Oct. 28 to appeal the decision, according to Cavin's letter.

Timeline

On Sept. 19, 2025, by a vote of 217-212, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican-sponsored CR (H.R.5371) to keep the government open through Nov. 21, 2025, generally extending funding at current levels with enhanced security funding for government officials and extension of some expiring authorizations related to veterans' benefits and healthcare. They included the Medicare-dependent hospital and low-volume adjustment programs, telehealth and hospital-at-home flexibilities, as well as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. The bill also would have delayed Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital cuts that are set to become effective Oct. 1, 2025. Later the same day, however, the U.S. Senate rejected H.R.5371 by a 44-48 cloture vote.

The Senate also rejected a Democrat-sponsored CR (S.2882) on Sept. 19, 2025, to fund the government at current levels through Oct 31, 2025, by a 47-45 cloture vote. Though the Democratic version included an extension of the same public health provisions as the CR (H.R5371), it also included a permanent extension of the enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs) that are set to expire on Dec. 31, 2025. The bill would also repeal the healthcare provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), Pub. L. 119-21. On Sept. 18, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis1 estimating that a permanent extension of the EPTCs would cost roughly $350 billion between 2026 and 2035 and expand health insurance coverage to an additional 3.8 million people by 2035. In addition, repealing provisions of the OBBB that restrict marketplace eligibility and enrollment – such as those targeting certain immigrants and low-income individuals – would add about $272 billion in costs and increase coverage by 2.9 million people in 2035.

Next steps are unclear as lawmakers departed for the Rosh Hashanah recess, and the House is not scheduled to return until after FY 2026 begins. President Donald Trump is now scheduled to meet with House and Senate Republican and Democratic leadership on Monday, September 29, after previously cancelling a proposed meeting with the Democratic leaders last week.

On Sept. 24, 2025, it was reported that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to consider extensive employee layoffs in unfunded programs that are not administration priorities if the government shuts down on Oct. 1, 2025. An OMB memo directs agencies ""to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) that satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) discretionary funding lapses on October 1, 2025; (2) another source of funding, such as OBBB, is not currently available; and (3) the PPA is not consistent with the President's priorities."" The memo asserts ""Federal programs whose funding would lapse and which are otherwise unfunded … are no longer statutorily required to be carried out.""

The memo was first reported by Politico, citing an OMB source as saying the following programs ""will continue regardless of a shutdown"": Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and air traffic control. Notably, each of these programs has funding from the OBBB or other mandatory or advanced appropriations that may be spent during a shutdown or involves activities easily deemed by OMB to be necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property under the Antideficiency Act.2

History of Government Shutdown and Potential Impacts

The relevant laws that govern shutdowns have remained relatively constant in recent decades. However, OMB exercises great discretion in how it defines and interprets exceptions to the law, and OMB's actions under the Trump Administration have led to great friction with Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.

The Antideficiency Act generally bars the government from incurring obligations3 or making expenditures in the absence of appropriations.4 It also bars the government from receiving voluntary services from federal personnel in the absence of appropriations that pay their salaries, except for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.""5 Accordingly, federal agencies are required to curtail many activities in the absence of an appropriation, commonly referred to as a ""government shutdown."" Every agency is required to develop and update shutdown contingency plans, which will be posted to agency websites once approved by OMB.

OMB's Circular No. A-11 (August 2025) provides that activities financed with appropriations that have not lapsed can continue to operate in a shutdown, which could include mandatory funding (i.e., reconciliation bills or entitlement program funds) or unexpired prior-year funding with valid apportionments.6 However, the salaries of agency personnel executing or supporting these legally exempted activities may be funded by lapsed appropriations, so whether a particular program will continue to operate in practice can best be determined by reviewing the agency's contingency plan. OMB states these plans will be posted to agency websites once approved by OMB.7

In the past, there have been funding gaps that led to occasional government shutdowns. In many cases, these were ""partial"" government shutdowns, as some of the 12 regular appropriations bills had already been enacted. The government was shut down previously for:

21 days, beginning Dec. 16, 1995

16 days, starting Oct. 1, 2013

35 days, beginning Dec. 21, 2018 (five of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted in advance of this shutdown; agencies and activities funded by those measures were unaffected)

two brief shutdowns in January 2019 and February 2019

In prior instances, not everything that the federal government does was discontinued during a gap in discretionary appropriations. Some activities – such as those funded by permanent, mandatory or advanced appropriations – are not dependent on a current-year appropriation, so their funding continued in an appropriations lapse. Common examples include Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and veterans' healthcare benefits.

In addition, activities funded by user fees or trust funds that are independently available outside of the appropriations process (for example, student loan processing, reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund or Medicare provider claims payments) have historically continued as long as staff responsible for processing those payments are also called into work.

Activities funded through bills outside of the annual appropriations process typically continue during shutdowns, including, for example, the advance appropriations in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, and mandatory appropriations in budget reconciliation acts such as the OBBB and American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, Pub. L. 117-2. Of note, the Trump Administration received unprecedented levels of new funding for enhanced ICE and CBP operations in the OBBB.

Even for activities funded with lapsed appropriations, the Antideficiency Act allows several excepted activities to continue, including, for example:8

activities necessary to protect human life or safety or property

activities necessarily implied by law to perform statutorily required activities

activities necessary to discharge of the president's constitutional duties or power

Unsurprisingly, U.S. military operations typically continue during a shutdown due to the vital national security interest. In addition, recent reporting indicates other safety-critical activities will remain operational, including federal law enforcement and air traffic control.

Federal government shutdowns have a wide range of impacts, the severity of which can depend on the shutdown's length. In addition to the disruption of internal government functions, the unavailability to the public of many government services and lack of access to public facilities, shutdowns can profoundly impact government contractors, public and private recipients of federal grants, and the general public.

For instance, those traveling could experience delays due to air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers having to work without immediate pay. And though social safety net programs such as SNAP will continue to function, a lengthy shutdown period could squeeze remaining funding. On the other hand, less-essential activities utilized by the general public – such as national parks – could be suspended until government funding resumes.

Some federal contracts funded with unexpired prior-year funding may be eligible to continue. It is a best practice for federal contractors and grant recipients to contact their program officer to discuss these issues in advance of a potential shutdown, as these individuals may be unavailable once the shutdown is triggered. Historically, contract activity during a CR relies on obligation authority, and agencies could place orders on existing contracts where the prior-year funding is already obligated, such as government-wide and large task-order-type contracts. For example, during prior shutdowns, contractors working on some Pentagon acquisition programs had less exposure because they had access to unused funding from multiyear appropriations. 9 The Pentagon's updated shutdown guidance released on Sept. 27, 2025, generally permits activities that are funded with unexpired appropriations, including funding provided in the OBBB, to continue during a shutdown.

The Congressional Research Service also has online resources to assist interested parties in understanding the implications and history of government shutdowns:

Contingency Plans by Agency

Historically, a week prior to a shutdown, federal agencies publish contingency plans for how they will operate in the event of a lapse of appropriations. These plans traditionally were posted together on the OMB website, but the current OMB site states each agency's website will exclusively host the contingency plan for the agency. Contingency plans lay out what functions will continue to be provided and which federal workers must report to work because they are deemed ""essential."" OMB directed agencies to update their contingency plans in August 2025, noting that plans would be published once approved by OMB.

As of today's date, a few updated agency contingency plans have been published, although more are expected in the coming days:

U.S. Department of the Army

U.S. Department of Defense (also referred to as the U.S. Department of War)

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

U.S. Department of Labor

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

Several agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), still have their guidance memos from the prior FY 2025 impasse in March 2025.

How do healthcare workers and cross-border migrants perceive the impact of limited access to antiretroviral therapy for migrants?
The guide was designed to capture the demographic characteristics of healthcare providers, information about healthcare entitlement for migrants, experiences of healthcare providers in dealing with migrants seeking healthcare services, access to healthcare for migrants in Botswana and use of health policies when providing healthcare services.
This study explored the experiences of both healthcare providers and migrants on the impact of inadequate antiretroviral therapy provision in Botswana.","Globally, an estimated 39.9 million people will be living with HIV in 2023 [1]. By the end of the same year, 77% (30.7 million) of these individuals were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), reflecting significant progress in HIV treatment access [1]. However, migrants remain disproportionately disadvantaged in accessing ART, experiencing delays in HIV diagnosis, interruptions in care, and poorer health outcomes [2]. Barriers to healthcare access for migrants include stigma, discrimination, social isolation, and disruptions in the continuity of care [2,3,4]. Additionally, some migrants report fears of ART side effects, further hindering treatment uptake and adherence [5,6,7]. Studies [3, 8] have reported that migrants often encounter legal obstacles such as lack of insurance and irregular immigration status, which restrict their access to healthcare services, including ART. A study by Ndumbi et al. (2018) [8] reported that in Spain, irregular immigration status was a significant risk factor for experiencing barriers to healthcare access, disproportionately affecting both men and women, disproportionately. Other studies [8, 9] have shown that financial constraints, such as the cost of medication and lack of employment, are prevalent among migrants, affecting their ability to initiate and adhere to ART. These challenges not only worsen health outcomes for migrants but also contribute to ongoing HIV transmission and increased public health risks in host communities.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains the epicentre of HIV epidemic, accounting to over two thirds of global HIV cases and 66% of all AIDS-related deaths [10]. While significant strides have been made in expanding ART coverage across the region, migrants continue to face disproportionate barriers to HIV treatment and care [10, 11]. Migration within SSA is driven by economic opportunities, conflict, and displacement, yet many countries lack inclusive healthcare policies that ensure ART continuity for mobile populations. Studies [12,13,14] have shown that migrant workers, refugees, and undocumented individuals are more likely to experience treatment interruptions, delays in accessing ART, and higher HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Additionally, restrictive healthcare policies, couples with language barriers, financial constraints, and legal uncertainties, further intensify disparities in HIV care for migrants in SSA [12,13,14]. These structural challenges contribute to the region’s struggle to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which aim for 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) to know their status, 95% of those diagnosed to be on ART, and 95% of those on ART to achieve viral suppression by 2030 [10, 11]. Addressing these gaps requires urgent policy reforms that integrate migrant populations into national HIV treatment programs, ensuring healthcare access for all. Despite Sub-Saharan Africa’s ongoing challenges in ensuring ART access for all, Botswana has been recognised as a leader in the HIV response, achieving 90% ART coverage among its citizens [10]. On the other hand, the country has made significant progress in reducing AIDS-related mortality and mother-to-child transmission, largely due to robust HIV treatment programs supported by The United State President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Fund [10]. However, despite efforts to expand access, migrants living in Botswana have continued to face significant barriers in obtaining ART, reflecting broader exclusionary trends across Sub-Saharan Africa. These challenges ranging from legal status restrictions to structural and institutional discrimination played a critical role in prompting policy shifts. Prior to 2019, Botswana’s national ART program explicitly excluded non-citizens, leaving migrant workers, refugees, and undocumented individuals particularly vulnerable to treatment interruptions, worsening health outcomes, and heightened risk of HIV transmission [15].

Although policy changes have since expanded ART eligibility to some migrant populations, implementation gaps, economic barriers, and healthcare discrimination continue to limit their access. The extent to which these policy changes have improved ART accessibility for migrants remains unclear, and there is limited research evaluating their effectiveness in addressing persistent challenges. Furthermore, the exclusion of migrants from ART services has contributed to the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among non-citizens in Botswana [16]. Pre-treatment and acquired HIV drug resistance have been reported at higher rates among migrants, largely due to inconsistent ART access, treatment interruptions, and lack of routine viral load monitoring. The presence of drug-resistant HIV strains poses a significant public health risk, as migrants with resistance mutations may experience treatment failure, develop multi-drug resistant strains, and contribute to ongoing transmission within the local populations [16]. These findings emphasise the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve ART adherence, implement HIVDR surveillance, and ensure continuity of care for migrants, thereby strengthening Botswana’s overall HIV response [16]. This study examines the impact of inadequate ART provision for migrants on public health, economic stability, and ethical considerations in Botswana. By highlighting the consequences of exclusionary policies and the broader implications for HIV control, the study aims to inform policy reforms that promote equitable healthcare access and strengthen Botswana’s HIV response.

Theory and study settings

This study is guided by Fassin’s (2009) [17] concept of selective blindness and Farmer’s (2010) [18] theory of structural violence. These frameworks provide critical lenses to understand the systemic barriers that migrants face in accessing healthcare services. They help to explain how policies, institutions, and social attitudes contribute to the exclusion and marginalisation of migrants within Botswana’s healthcare system, particularly in relation to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV treatment. Fassin (2009) [17] introduced the concept of selective blindness to describe how societies, institutions, and policymakers deliberately ignore or fail to acknowledge the suffering of marginalised populations. This blindness is not always deliberate, it can also stem from entrenched bureaucratic practices, economic priorities, or dominant social narratives that prioritise certain groups over others [17]. In healthcare, selective blindness can manifest in exclusionary policies that deny migrants’ access to ART, inadequate monitoring of their health outcomes, or absence of tailored interventions addressing their specific needs.

Farmer (2010) [18] defines structural violence as the systemic, institutionalised forms of oppression that prevent individuals from meeting their basic needs, particularly in healthcare. Unlike direct violence, which involves physical harm, structural violence operates silently through policies, economic systems, and bureaucratic barriers that disproportionately affect marginalised groups [18]. In the context of healthcare for migrants, structural violence is evident in the legal restrictions on ART access, financial barriers due to employment precarity, and lack of inclusive health policies that accommodate mobile population. Farmer’s framework highlights how historical and economic inequalities shape present-day health disparities, reinforcing the need for structural reforms.

Aims and study design

The study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and cross-border migrants regarding the exclusion of migrants from ARVs provision in Botswana. The following research questions guided data collection and analysis:

1.

How do healthcare workers and cross-border migrants perceive the impact of limited access to antiretroviral therapy for migrants?

2.

What challenges do healthcare workers face when delivery HIV-related services to migrant populations?

3.

How is the exclusion of migrants from ART programs perceived to affect the health of both migrant populations and the broader community?

4.

In what ways do current policies align or conflict with principles of equity and the right to health for all individuals, regardless of migration status?

A descriptive qualitative design was used that provides straightforward descriptions of experiences and perceptions [19]. This is particularly useful in areas where limited knowledge exists [20]. This study design is appropriate as it considers the subjective nature of the topic and the diverse experiences of participants and presents results that closely align with the original research questions [21]. A qualitative descriptive design captures participants’ experiences and the meanings they attribute to these experiences without aiming to develop theories [19, 22].

Recruitment and selection

Recruitment took place between May and July in 2019. Inclusion criteria were: being healthcare providers who have worked at the clinic for at least 2 years and had provided medical care to migrants. Selection for migrants was based on: being migrant, i.e. having stayed in the Botswana for more than 1 year; aged 18 years and above and have accessed healthcare services from public health facilities. A purposive sampling method was used for the recruitment process, during which the researcher identified suitable participants from the clinics. The nurse in charge of the clinic was asked for permission to conduct the study in the health facility. Healthcare providers were contacted in person and by telephone and explained the objectives of the study. Migrants were selected using snowball sampling, a method appropriate for reaching hard-to reach or mobile populations. Initial participants were approached in public health clinics and malls in Gaborone and Francistown. These individuals then referred the lead researcher to other eligible participants within their network. Contact was made through cell phone communication, allowing the researcher to schedule interview appointments at times convenient for the participants. All interviews were conducted in a secured and private office setting to ensure confidentiality and create a safe space for open dialogue.

Participants

A total of 32 participants were interviewed and included in the study. A total of 12 participants were healthcare providers. Table 1. shows the demographic characteristics of healthcare provider participants. A total of 20 in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 documented and ten undocumented Zimbabweans migrants. Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of migrant participants.

Data collection

In this qualitative study, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with both healthcare providers and migrants to explore their experiences in accessing those services. An interview guide served as a guide for conducting detailed interviews. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with cross-border migrants and healthcare providers. The guide was designed to capture the demographic characteristics of healthcare providers, information about healthcare entitlement for migrants, experiences of healthcare providers in dealing with migrants seeking healthcare services, access to healthcare for migrants in Botswana and use of health policies when providing healthcare services. The interview guide used in this study was developed specifically for this research as part of my PhD thesis and has not been previously published. An English language version of the interview guide has been uploaded as a supplementary file. Other critical areas were included in the data analysis, but more data will be published in other journals in the future.

Each interview lasted approximately 70–80 min and was recorded for transcription after obtaining consent from the participant. The interviews were recorded; consequently, the interviews were written. The lead researcher carefully observed the interviewees’ attitudes, expressions, tone and body language throughout the interviews. After conducting the interviews, a research assistant checked the transcripts carefully to ensure the accuracy of the information.

Data analysis

The data were analysed using Atlas ti version 9, following a selective blindness [18] and structural violence [18] frameworks to organize ethical themes. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted [23], guided by the concepts of selective blindness [17] and structural violence [18]. Selective blindness provided a lens to examine how healthcare policies and institutional practices systematically overlook or dismiss the healthcare needs of migrants, reinforcing disparities in ART provision and HIV treatment. Structural violence helped frame the systemic barriers such as restrictive policies, bureaucratic hurdles, and fear of deportation that prevent migrants from accessing essential healthcare services. These frameworks enabled a deeper understanding of how institutionalised exclusion contributes to health inequalities among migrants in Botswana.

All interviews were transcribed verbatim, with the sentences used as the units of analysis. The lead researcher and co-researchers independently reviewed and coded each transcript, comparing raw data and coded meanings to reach consensus on the codes and interpretations. Thematic content analysis was employed to explore the challenges, and strategies used by migrants to access healthcare services, enabling the identification of themes and patterns within the data [24]. The research team collaboratively identified themes and subthemes and organised them into a codebook. To ensure trustworthiness, standard qualitative research guidelines were followed [25, 26], including thorough review and coding of transcripts. An initial list of codes was developed based on the research question, with additional codes emerging from the data. These codes were refined into more abstract categories, leading to the creation of broader themes that illustrated the impact of inadequate provision of ART to migrants on the local population in Botswana. Manual coding and analysis were used to maintain close interaction with the data, mitigating the limitations of software analysis, such as data distancing and potential recontextualization of codes [27].

The main themes that were identified among healthcare providers participant interviews; (1) Health risks to the local population, (2) Ethical and public health implications, (3) Economic and emotional costs, (4) The need for regional health service integration. Additionally, the themes identified among migrants include 1)Barriers to Healthcare Access 2) Fear of Immigration and Police harassment 4) Challenges in accessing HIV and other essential treatments (5) Health Risks to the Local Population (6) Ethical and humanitarian concerns (7) Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV.

Health risks to the local population

The exclusion of migrants from ART services increases the health risks not only for migrants but also for the local population. Untreated migrants with high viral loads are more likely to transmit HIV, particularly in cases of unprotected sexual relationships. Addressing these risks is crucial in Botswana’s broader HIV response. Participants highlighted the direct public health risk posed by untreated HIV-positive migrants. Without ART, viral loads remain high, increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission within both migrant and local populations. A participant suggests that inclusive treatment policies would be a more effective approach to epidemic control:

Those who are not on treatment are highly infectious, and you can imagine how risky it is. If migrants were given a chance to be treated, it would be better. The best way is to enrol everyone in the treatment and stop this.” (Nurse, 14)

Another participant reinforced the notion that excluding migrants from ART increases community-wide health risks. The participant acknowledges that HIV has no borders, and failure to treat migrants has spill-over effects on the general population.

Migrants should be provided with ARVs – HIV is an infectious disease, therefore they may interact with locals and put their lives in danger.” (Nurse, 1)

The risk extends to other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can easily spread without adequate treatment. Addressing these health risks is crucial in controlling the overall HIV epidemic in Botswana.

Yes, there are health risks if migrants are denied services. For example, if a migrant has an STI or tuberculosis (TB) and we do not treat them, they will spread the infection to the rest of the population. They should be treated to protect the community. (Nurse, 3)

Ethical and public health implications

Participants question the ethical inconsistency in Botswana’s HIV response. Thus, testing individuals but denying them treatment contradicts public health ethics and the principle of equitable healthcare access. Denying ART to migrants raises serious ethical and humanitarian concerns, as healthcare should be a universal right, regardless of nationality or immigration status. A participant commented that:

Changes I would like to see in healthcare services for migrants include providing ARV treatment. If we test a foreigner and they are HIV positive but cannot access ARVs, what is the point of testing them? (Nurse, 5)

Participants emphasised that exclusion of migrants from ART jeopardises national HIV goals, particularly the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, particularly the goal of ensuring that 90% of diagnosed individuals receive ART. The ongoing transmission risk from untreated migrants makes epidemic control more challenging.

There is no way Botswana can achieve the 90-90-90 targets, especially the second 90, if all patients who test positive are not placed on ART. New infections will remain a challenge to control. (Nurse, 11)

In addition, even though the participants acknowledges financial constraints, they emphasised that migrants should not be denied ART based on nationality, aligning with ethical of universal healthcare rights.

Yes, migrants should have the same access to healthcare as those in Batswana. There are a lot of health risks when migrants are denied certain healthcare services. However, they should be accountable for their care—perhaps paying for services—but should never be denied access. (Nurse, 4)

Economic and emotional costs

Excluding migrants from ART services imposes significant economic and emotional burdens on healthcare providers and the system. Healthcare workers expressed frustration and moral distress over being unable to provide the necessary treatment, making their work emotionally exhausting. As a participant said that “It’s emotionally draining for us, assisting a person to die. I have cases of a person who tested negative and, in the long run, tested positive.” (PMTCT Coordinator, 2)

Additionally, untreated HIV among migrants increases long-term healthcare costs because the system must manage preventable HIV-related complications, new infections, and outbreaks. Participants highlighted the economic costs and treatment inefficiencies. Limited ART access leads to medication sharing, which can result in improper dosing, drug resistance, and higher healthcare costs eventually.

As one of the participants commented that:

Lack of ARVs for migrants is risky because they have relationships with the local population, leading to HIV transmission. If a Motswana is HIV positive, they may share medication with their migrant partner due to lack of access. (Nurse, 7)

Furthermore, participants also pointed out that the economic burden of delayed treatment will cost the government in the future. Preventive ART is more cost-effective than managing advanced HIV complications, which strain Botswana’s healthcare resources.

Denying ART to migrants will only cost the healthcare system more in the future. Treating someone temporarily and not ensuring continuity is not economical for the country. (Nurse, 10)

The need for regional health service integration

Participants strongly emphasized the urgency of integrating health services across borders to address the fragmented care experienced by migrants, particularly those living with HIV. The lack of regional coordination disrupts treatment continuity for mobile populations, undermining adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increasing the risk of reinfection and further transmission within and across borders.

Healthcare workers described how migrants frequently travel between neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe and South Africa, yet the absence of shared health information systems and cross-border protocols often results in treatment defaulting. This undermines both national HIV control efforts and regional public health objectives. The need for regional cooperation was framed not only as a health systems concern but also as a moral and ethical obligation to protect vulnerable populations and the broader community.

One nurse explained the consequences of failing to coordinate care across countries:

Migrants engage in relationships with locals, leading to reinfection. We need healthcare integration across countries. (Nurse, 6)

Another participant raised concerns around gaps in maternal care and the exclusion of migrant mothers from prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services due to inability to pay:

If a migrant mother gives birth here, we don’t test the baby at six weeks unless they pay first. I have seen cases where a baby was later diagnosed HIV-positive. (Nurse, 12)

The absence of regionally harmonized HIV services was also seen as a barrier to achieving epidemic control:

If we don’t integrate healthcare services across borders, migrants will continue defaulting, and we will never control the spread of HIV. (Nurse, 15)

These accounts highlight the need for stronger regional health governance structures that enable ART continuity, data sharing, and inclusion of migrants, particularly pregnant women within national HIV programs. Participants called for more migrant-sensitive health policies that go beyond national borders and recognize the interconnectedness of health outcomes in southern Africa.

Themes for migrants

Barriers to access to healthcare

The findings from migrant participants show that they experience multiple barriers to healthcare access, including financial constraints, documentation requirements, and discriminatory policies when accessing healthcare in public health facilities. High healthcare costs for non-citizens create inequities in service accessibility, forcing many migrants to delay seeking treatment or forego healthcare entirely. The requirement to provide official documents further limits access, particularly for undocumented migrants, increasing their vulnerability to preventable illnesses. These challenges create a healthcare environment in which migrants are unable to access timely care, often delaying or entirely avoiding treatment. As one participant noted:

I don’t feel equal to Batswana nationals because I pay more money at hospitals than in Zimbabwe where we are given services for free. (Migrant 1)

The requirement to present official identification was repeatedly mentioned as a restriction that excludes undocumented individuals from care:

At the clinic, they require me to present papers, or they don’t give me treatment. (Migrant 3)

Even when I am very sick, they turn me away. How do they expect me to survive? (Migrant 2)

Such experiences highlight systemic exclusion that pushes migrants further to the margins of the healthcare system, increasing their risk of preventable illness and health deterioration.

Fear of immigration and Police harassment

Another key theme of this study is that fear of arrest, detention, and deportation discourages migrants from seeking healthcare services, even when they are in critical need. Migrants reported avoiding clinics and hospitals due to the risk of being reported to immigration authorities, resulting in delayed or missed treatments. This fear-driven behaviour leads to worsened health outcomes, higher mortality rates, and increased transmission risks for communicable diseases such as HIV.

I don’t go to the clinic because I don’t have papers, and I am afraid of being detained. (Migrant 4)

In some instances, participants recounted being denied emergency care due to their migrant status:

The police once beat me, and I was very injured, but when I was taken to the hospital, they didn’t help me. (Migrant 5)

This environment of fear not only contributes to worsened health outcomes but also undermines trust in the healthcare system, deterring migrants from seeking help in critical moments.

Challenges in accessing HIV and other essential treatments

Migrants living with HIV face substantial difficulties in accessing ART, family planning services, and other essential treatments due to restrictive healthcare policies. ART interruptions increase the likelihood of HIV progression, contribute to higher viral loads, and elevate the risk of transmission. The exclusion of migrants from ART programs directly contradicts Botswana’s commitment to achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which require ensuring that 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of diagnosed individuals receive ART, and 95% of those on ART achieve viral suppression. These barriers are driven by restrictive policies that exclude non-citizens from national programs:

My fellow Zimbabweans end up dying because of being denied medication. (Migrant 6)

One of the participants reported being refused access to reproductive health services:

They refused to give me family planning pills. Migrants should have access to condoms, PrEP, and family planning like Batswana. (Migrant 8)

Interrupted ART access often resulted in poor adherence and risk of treatment failure:

I have missed doses many times because sometimes I cannot afford to travel to the clinic, and other times they tell me only citizens can get medication. (Migrant 7)

These findings point to urgent gaps in HIV care, undermining both individual health and Botswana’s efforts to meet the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets.

Health risks to the local population

The lack of ART access for migrants not only endangers their health but also poses public health risks to the local population. Without treatment, HIV-positive migrants are more likely to have high viral loads, increasing the likelihood of transmission to their sexual partners and communities. Some migrants reported sharing ART medication due to lack of access, a practice that contributes to poor adherence, treatment failure, and the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). The spread of drug-resistant HIV strains presents a significant challenge for Botswana’s HIV response and underscores the need for inclusive treatment policies that prioritise public health. Participants recognized that untreated HIV among migrants increases the risk of transmission within communities:

If migrants are not treated, they will pass HIV to other people in the community. (Migrant 9)

The practice of sharing medication, driven by desperation and inaccessibility, poses further health risks:

Some people who don’t get treatment share pills, and that is not safe. (Migrant 10)

These accounts raise concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains and the consequences for Botswana’s HIV response efforts.

Ethical and humanitarian concerns

Denying migrant access to ART and other essential healthcare services raises profound ethical and humanitarian concerns. Migrants expressed frustration at being treated as outsiders in healthcare settings despite their urgent medical needs. The exclusion of migrants from lifesaving treatments violates fundamental human rights and contradicts the principles of medical ethics, including the duty to provide care without discrimination. Migrants shared strong feelings of being treated unfairly and inhumanely within the healthcare system, particularly when denied essential care:

We are all human beings, but they don’t treat us the same way when we are sick. (Migrant 11)

Denying people treatment just because they are not from Botswana is not fair. (Migrant 12)

Such statements reflect not only a sense of exclusion but also a deeper humanitarian crisis that challenges the ethical foundations of medical practice and the right to health for all.

Mother-to-Child transmission (MTCT) of HIV

The findings indicate that pregnant migrant women struggle to access prenatal care and PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) services, increasing the risk of HIV transmission to new-borns. Limited access to ART during pregnancy results in higher rates of vertical HIV transmission, negatively impacting maternal and infant health outcomes. The exclusion of pregnant migrants from PMTCT programs contradicts global commitments to eliminating mother-to-child transmission and highlights the need for more inclusive maternal healthcare policies. Ensuring that all pregnant women, regardless of their migration status, receive comprehensive maternal and neonatal care is crucial for improving health outcomes for both mothers and children. Participants described cases where women were unable to access ART during pregnancy, resulting in infants being born HIV-positive:

I know a woman who was pregnant and couldn’t get ART, and her baby was born with HIV. (Migrant 13)

In addition to lack of care, some migrants reported experiencing disrespect and surveillance during labour:

One day, my wife was in labor, and they told the security guard to watch us because we might run away. (Migrant 14)

The exclusion of pregnant migrants from essential maternal health services not only undermines international commitments to eliminate mother-to-child transmission but also perpetuates structural discrimination against migrant women:

A nurse told my friend that migrants should not have babies if they cannot afford care, but what choice do we have? (Migrant 16)

These narratives highlight the need for more inclusive maternal health policies that ensure equitable care for all pregnant women, regardless of migration status.

This study explored the experiences of both healthcare providers and migrants on the impact of inadequate antiretroviral therapy provision in Botswana. The findings from this qualitative study show that systemic barriers that exacerbate health disparities, increase the risk of HIV transmission, and contribute to ongoing structural violence against migrants. Migration and healthcare inequalities often intersect in complex ways, resulting in the systematic neglect of marginalised populations. Fassin (2009) [17] conceptualises this phenomenon as selective blindness, which is deliberate disregard by healthcare systems and policymakers towards the needs of socially and economically vulnerable groups. This selective blindness is not accidental but embedded within institutional structures that prioritize the health of certain populations while marginalising others. In the context of Botswana, the exclusion of migrants from ART services exemplifies this selective blindness, where legal and policy frameworks consciously overlook the healthcare needs of migrants, despite their significant vulnerability to HIV.

On the other hand, the study found that migrants living with HIV face significant challenges in accessing ART and other essential treatments. Some of these challenges include; high medical costs, lack of documentation, and discriminatory policies. These challenges align with Fassin (2009) [17] notion of selective blindness, where the healthcare system consciously ignores the needs of migrants. Similarly, Farmer (2010) [18] concept of structural violence helps explain how economic and legal systems marginalise migrants, creating barriers that perpetuate health inequalities. A study done in South Africa and Thailand, showed that migrants are often excluded from national ART programs due to citizenship-based restrictions [28]. In South Africa, migrants often face denial of ART services despite having the right to free healthcare. In Thailand, only pregnant women among registered migrants are entitled to ART, reflecting discriminatory policies that limit access for migrants [29]. Furthermore, findings also revealed that healthcare providers recognise the necessity for more inclusive policies but cite logistical and resource-based constraints as barriers to universal ART provision. Expanding ART programs to include migrants is essential for Botswana to meet its UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets and reduce new HIV infections. The exclusion of migrants from ART services not only affects them individually but also poses significant public health risks to the local population. As Farmer (2010) [18] asserts, structural violence marginalises those at the intersections of socio-economic vulnerability and legal exclusion. The restricted access to ART increases HIV transmission risks, perpetuates high viral loads, and contributes to the emergence of HIV drug resistance. Studies have shown that untreated individuals with high viral loads contribute to continued HIV transmission, particularly in mobile and cross-border communities [8, 12].

Moreover, healthcare providers expressed concerns where migrants have fear of arrest and deportation, which discourages them from accessing healthcare. This fear-driven avoidance behaviour is a manifestation of structural violence, as it reflects the power dynamics that suppress and silence vulnerable populations [18]. On the other hand, healthcare providers acknowledged the challenge migrants face but, felt constrained by policies that intertwine healthcare with immigration enforcement. This selective blindness to the needs of migrants (Fassin, 2009) [17] exacerbates health inequalities, reinforcing their exclusion from critical services.Similar findings in Europe and North America demonstrate that immigration policies often act as a barrier to accessing healthcare among undocumented migrants [29, 30]. Findings also showed that migrants’ interactions with healthcare providers ranged from compassionate care to experiences of neglect and discrimination. These inconsistent experiences reflect selective blindness within the healthcare systems, where some providers consciously or unconsciously reprioritize migrant needs [17].

Healthcare providers expressed concerns that limited ART access for migrants undermines Botswana’s broader HIV control efforts. Implementing inclusive treatment strategies can help mitigate these risks and contribute to overall epidemic control. Both healthcare providers and migrants highlight the ethical dilemmas associated with denying ART based on migration status. Thus, the exclusion of migrants from essential healthcare services raises significant ethical and humanitarian concerns. Structural Violence Theory [18] also provides a useful framework for understanding how systemic healthcare inequities perpetuate harm. Similar research in high-income countries has also demonstrated that denying healthcare based on legal status contradicts global health ethics and principles of non-discrimination [3]. Addressing these ethical concerns requires policy reforms that prioritise health equity over nationality-based exclusions. The study findings reveal that migrant women face challenges in accessing prenatal care and PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) services. Similar trends have been documented in Zambia and Mozambique, where exclusion from maternal healthcare services leads to higher rates of vertical HIV transmission [11]. Healthcare providers acknowledge the importance of ensuring universal ART access for pregnant women but cite financial and policy limitations as major barriers. Expanding PMTCT programs to include all pregnant women, regardless of their migration status, is critical for achieving Botswana’s HIV prevention goals.

Strengths and limitations

This study offers valuable insights into an under-researched area by foregrounding the voices of both healthcare providers and cross-border migrants, two key yet often overlooked stakeholders in discussions about HIV service delivery in Botswana. One of its main strengths lies in its qualitative design, which enabled in-depth exploration of complex and sensitive issues surrounding ART provision, ethics, and migration. By capturing lived experiences in both urban border areas, the study sheds light on how policy gaps are experienced on the ground, and how they shape perceptions of equity and access in real-time service delivery contexts.

Furthermore, the inclusion of healthcare workers from various cadres, alongside migrants with diverse migration statuses and occupational backgrounds, enhances the richness and relevance of the findings. The study also contributes to ongoing policy conversations by situating the issue within broader ethical, public health, and human rights frameworks. However, the study is not without limitations. The findings are based on purposively selected participants from two urban settings, which may limit the transferability of results to rural contexts or other regions of the country. Additionally, while efforts were made to recruit a diverse group of migrants, those who were undocumented or in more precarious conditions may have been less willing to participate, potentially leading to underrepresentation of the most marginalized voices. Lastly, as with all qualitative research, the findings reflect participants’ subjective experiences and cannot be generalized statistically to all healthcare workers or migrants in Botswana. Despite these limitations, the study provides a strong foundation for future research and policy reform aimed at advancing health equity for migrant populations in Botswana and similar settings.",https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/journal/12939,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:35.021982

ImmigrationOS was developed by the software company Palantir Technologies, co-founded by tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Peter Thiel.

Protesters took to the streets of Newark on Sept. 29 to send a message: No to ICE surveillance database.

The protest organized by the immigration advocacy group Make The Road was centered around the technology platform ImmigrationOS, developed by the software company Palantir Technologies, co-founded by tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Peter Thiel.

The Trump Administration awarded a $30 million contract in April to Palantir to develop the software that tracks people who plan to self-deport and target gang members and those who have overstayed their visas. That will be done by collecting biographical and biometric data from government databases to identify immigrants.

Palantir was scheduled to provide a prototype of ImmigrationOS to ICE on September 25. It will be used by ICE for two years, according to the contract.

The attendees at the protest, which occurred a few miles away from Delaney Hall, the immigration detention center operated on the outskirts of Newark by ICE, expressed their concerns that the software could target immigrants, irrespective of status, and violate their human rights.

“Here in New Jersey, we believe in democracy and we believe in freedom,"" Nedia Morsy, executive director of Make The Road New Jersey, said before a press conference at Newark's Military Park. She called for the state to divest from investing pension fund money in Palentir.

Larry Hamm, the founder the Newark activist group People’s Organization for Progress, said the Palantir database is not just an immigrant problem but a problem for everyone.

""Immigrant rights are human rights,"" he said.

After the press conference, the protesters marched several long blocks across downtown Newark to Lincoln Park.

The Republican President has said repeatedly that he fully expects the government to enter a shutdown this week.
They say that because Republicans control the White House and Congress, Americans will mostly blame them for any shutdown.
It remains to be seen whether the White House meeting will help or hurt the chances for a resolution.
Negotiations between Trump and Democratic congressional leaders have rarely gone well, and Trump has had little contact with the opposing party during his second term.","Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are heading to the White House for a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday in a late effort to avoid a government shutdown, but both sides have shown hardly any willingness to budge from their entrenched positions.

If government funding legislation is not passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Tuesday night, many government offices across the nation will be temporarily shuttered and non-exempt federal employees will be furloughed, adding to the strain on workers and the nation’s economy.

Republicans are daring Democrats to vote against legislation that would keep government funding mostly at current levels, but Democrats so far have held firm. They are using one of their few points of leverage to demand that Congress take up legislation to extend health care benefits.

“The meeting is a first step, but only a first step. We need a serious negotiation,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Trump has shown little interest in entertaining Democrats’ demands on health care, even as he agreed to hold a sit-down meeting Monday afternoon with Schumer, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. The Republican President has said repeatedly that he fully expects the government to enter a shutdown this week.

“If it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down,” Trump said Friday. “But they’re the ones that are shutting down government.”

The Trump administration has tried to pressure Democratic lawmakers into backing away from their demands, warning that federal employees could be permanently laid off in the midst of a funding lapse.

“Chuck Schumer said a few months ago that a government shutdown would be chaotic, harmful and painful. He’s right, and that’s why we shouldn’t do it,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Sunday on “Meet the Press.”

Still, Democrats argued that Trump’s agreement to hold a meeting shows that he is feeling the pressure to negotiate. They say that because Republicans control the White House and Congress, Americans will mostly blame them for any shutdown.

But to hold on to their negotiating leverage, Senate Democrats will likely have to vote against a bill to temporarily extend government funding on Tuesday, just hours before a shutdown — an uncomfortable position for a party that has long denounced shutdowns as pointless and destructive.

The bill has already passed the Republican-controlled House and would keep the government funded for seven more weeks while Congress works on annual spending legislation.

Any legislation to fund the government will need support from at least 60 senators. That means that at least eight Democrats would have to vote for the short-term funding bill, because Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is expected to vote against it.

During the last potential government shutdown in March, Schumer and nine other Democrats voted to break a filibuster and allow a Republican-led funding bill to advance to a final vote. The New York Democrat faced fierce backlash from many in his own party for that decision, with some even calling for him to step down as Democratic leader.

This time, Schumer appears resolute.

“We’re hearing from the American people that they need help on health care and as for these massive layoffs, guess what? Simple one-sentence answer: They’re doing it anyway,” he said.

Democrats are pushing for an extension to Affordable Care Act tax credits that have subsidized health insurance for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. The credits, which are designed to expand coverage for low- and middle-income people, are set to expire at the end of the year.

Some Republicans are open to extending the tax credits, but want changes. Thune said Sunday that the program is “desperately in need of reform” and Republicans want to address “waste, fraud and abuse.” He has pressed Democrats to vote for the funding bill and take up the debate on tax credits at a later date.

It remains to be seen whether the White House meeting will help or hurt the chances for a resolution. Negotiations between Trump and Democratic congressional leaders have rarely gone well, and Trump has had little contact with the opposing party during his second term.

The most recent negotiation in August between Schumer and the president to speed the pace of Senate confirmation votes for administration officials ended with Trump telling Schumer to “go to hell” in a social media post.

Trump also abruptly canceled a meeting that was planned with congressional leaders last week, calling Democrats’ demands “unserious and ridiculous.”

Schumer argued that the White House coming back to reschedule a meeting for Monday showed that “they felt the heat.”

Sparing the usual litany of ""stare decisis"" factors, Justice Clarence Thomas offered a simple formula for the amount of deferential weight he gives a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court: how much he agrees with it.

“The past few months, more and more people have been coming out of the shadows to say ‘How can we help?’” He ushers them into the People’s Patrol.","It’s midmorning in Wheaton, 25 miles west of downtown Chicago.

Cristóbal Cavazos gets a call from a People’s Patrol volunteer at an industrial park near O’Hare International Airport where thousands of undocumented immigrants work in warehouses and manufacturing and food-processing plants.

The volunteer tells Cavazos she’s watching agents who might be from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency known as ICE.

Cavazos, 46, rushes to his car. He opens the hatch and packs in five-gallon buckets, drumsticks to pound on them, and bullhorns. He invites me to ride along.

Bensenville, the village that includes the industrial park, has been “a hotbed of ICE activity since Trump came in,” he says.

Cavazos leads the People’s Patrol, one of many volunteer rapid-response networks countering a Trump administration deportation blitz in the Chicago area. The idea is to locate immigration enforcement activity, record it, document abuses and, right on the spot, voice community opposition.

Cavazos’ network focuses on Chicago’s western suburbs. It’s housed at the Casa DuPage Workers Center, a small nonprofit devoted to immigrant rights.

“We saw ICE go into a factory about a month and a half ago, looking for someone,” Cavazos tells me on the way to Bensenville. “They freaked out the whole factory and they took some people from there. It’s just really sad, the way the United States crucifies [its immigrant] workers, particularly in this case. They’re essential workers that are in these factories giving us food.”

Racing toward the industrial park on an expressway, Cavazos says the People’s Patrol includes 180 people, all volunteers. The center holds trainings for the work every other Friday.

As the volunteers go about their daily lives, they all keep an eye out for immigration enforcement activity. Some make a point of driving past parking lots and businesses where the federal authorities typically gather before a day’s operations.

The ICE officers usually drive unmarked vehicles. But People’s Patrol volunteers sometimes manage to tail them. If the officers stop a motorist or try to take people from a house or workplace, the volunteers send an alert through a Facebook page and through text groups.

“We’ll send people to go check it out,” Cavazos says. “We want to go in and show the community ‘Hey, we got your back.’ We’re in the midst of a historic fight-back right now against ICE. We’re not going to leave any space to ICE. The People’s Patrol is there to fill these spaces of terror and fear with solidarity and strength.”

As Cavazos speaks, he clenches his fist. I make sure his other hand remains on the wheel.

When we arrive in Bensenville, we hear there is no immigration sweep, just a press conference about some illegal imports.

Now, however, Cavazos is getting word about immigration arrests in Elgin.

“So we’re going to head over,” he says.

Soon we are back on an expressway for another long drive across the western suburbs. I start to understand the mileage Cavazos racks up each day to help show his community’s opposition to Trump’s deportation campaign.

I ask Cavazos how he got into this work. He says he’s been fighting for immigrants since his college years two decades ago. And he talks about his parents: His mother, a South Texas native, and father, who came from northern Mexico, were migrant farmworkers. They harvested apples in Michigan, dug out potatoes in Idaho and picked cotton across the South.

“These were Mexican workers traveling during Jim Crow and Juan Crow, being asked to sit in the back of restaurants,” he says.

Some of the indignities were hazardous. Cavazos recalls his father telling stories about returning to Texas after visits to Mexico. At the border, they would be sprayed down with “some kind of a chemical to supposedly get all the germs off of Mexican workers.”

The chemicals included the toxic insecticide lindane and DDT, a pesticide later banned for killing off too much wildlife.

Eventually, Cavazos’ parents heard about jobs in the Chicago area. They settled in DuPage County. Cavazos was born in Winfield.

Throughout his childhood, he heard what his parents had gone through but also about freedom fighters, such as farmworker organizer César Chávez and Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.

“Zapata once said, ‘I would rather spend one day standing up than 1,000 years on my knees,’ ” Cavazos says.

Emulating those freedom fighters, Cavazos patrols the west suburbs to stand up to Trump’s immigration enforcement.

“We’ll be there in two minutes,” Cavazos says in Spanish to People’s Patrol volunteers calling from Elgin.

When we arrive, the volunteers tell him the day’s immigration arrests seem to be over.

But then he gets a call about a U.S. Department of Homeland Security vehicle at a hotel 20 minutes away. DHS oversees ICE, the immigration enforcement agency.

“It’s parked at the Marriott in Bloomingdale, so that is where we’re headed,” Cavazos tells me.

We pull up to the hotel and see a white SUV with markings of the Federal Protective Service, a DHS police force.

I follow Cavazos and two People’s Patrol volunteers to the hotel’s front desk.

The hotel manager informs them that Homeland Security personnel are frequent guests there. A moment later, two uniformed DHS officers stride past the desk on their way out to the SUV.

Cavazos cannot be sure the officers are working on immigration enforcement but asks the manager to boot them from the hotel nevertheless: “They’re staying here, using your premises to launch their war of terror on the immigrant communities. That goes against our values. I would invite you to just tell them to leave.”

The request seems like a long shot. Cavazos starts working his phone to get more people there and make a stronger case.

By sundown, two dozen protesters are in front of the hotel with a petition to kick the DHS officers out.

“The people united will never be defeated!” they chant in Spanish through the bullhorns, beating the buckets. After a couple hours, Bloomingdale police officers threaten to enforce a noise ordinance. Everyone leaves.

A few days later, I catch up with Cavazos at a different protest. About 75 immigrants and supporters are marching to denounce a Mexican father’s fatal shooting by an immigration officer during a traffic stop in Franklin Park.

After the march, I ask Cavazos to sit down for a few minutes. I want to hear how Trump’s deportation blitz is affecting him after fighting so long for immigrant workers.

He describes what the backlash looks like up close.

“We had a protest a couple weeks ago, and one guy came up spewing racial epithets and screaming at us, and then I had this right-wing guy come into my face,” he says.

The second man, Cavazos says, was a “tall white dude without a shirt” trying to provoke a fight.

He says incidents such as these and the Franklin Park killing have been deflating: “You feel this emptiness. And you look at your community. People that you love are afraid.”

Cavazos says his community is suffering a “dark night of the soul,” a phrase coined by St. John of the Cross, the 16th-century Spanish monk who said a feeling of abandonment by God was necessary for a more profound faith.

That monk knew about suffering. His ancestors were among the hundreds of thousands of Iberian Jews, known as conversos, who adopted Roman Catholicism to survive the Inquisition. Converso descendants, even generations later, were viewed with suspicion, labeled “swine” and singled out by blood-purity laws.

In the Chicago area, Cavazos tells me, the “dark night” has led too many immigrants to internalize Trump’s attacks and even slam rapid-response work.

“On social media, they don’t like what we’re doing and they think that we’re too out there, that we’re putting people in danger by being community organizers,” he says.

“When you feel the government attacking you,” Cavazos explains, “you just feel that you’re somehow not an essential, valuable part of the community, that you should be gone because of the color of your skin or the fact that you were not born in the United States. There are people that don’t have courage right now.”

Cavazos confides that sometimes he himself struggles to find courage.

He also gets pushback from some relatives. Cavazos says they are “evangelical Christians that think that Trump is somehow part of the Armageddon and the end of the world.” He says they tell him he is selfishly rebelling against the inevitable.

Amid the doubts and criticism, Cavazos turns to his faith.

“Every morning, I give thanks to God. I give thanks for my family. I give thanks for my organization, Casa DuPage. I give thanks to be in this moment of time, where I have some kind of influence and I’m able to organize.”

Where does all this gratitude come from?

Cavazos points to Gustavo Gutiérrez, the late Peruvian priest who pioneered liberation theology, a movement that encouraged some Catholic clergy in the 1960s and ’70s to stand up to Latin American dictators. The theology links gratitude for God’s love to solidarity with the poor and to the active struggle to build a just society.

“I give thanks for beautiful allies,” Cavazos says. “The past few months, more and more people have been coming out of the shadows to say ‘How can we help?’”

He ushers them into the People’s Patrol.

“Sometimes the only thing we have is resistance. Particularly at this moment, we don’t know where this is going to end,” Cavazos says. “But you have faith in justice. You have faith in principle. You have faith.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45cc81f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5983x3415+0+288/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2F10%2F2ea6c25842dd995f0c8d05b29890%2Fmain-image-rapid-response.JPG,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:39.704746

Officials:

Focus: Mootness Doctrine-Prevailing Party Relief

Midwest Environmental Advocates (MEA) sued Frederick Prehn (as a member and former Chair of Wisconsin’s Natural Resources Board (NRB)) along with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the NRB. MEA claimed that Prehn had “arbitrarily and capriciously” withheld or delayed the production of certain text messages and communications in response to an MEA Records Request, per the Wisconsin Public Records Law (WIS. STAT. §§ 19.31–19.39).

Prehn moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the requested communications were not “records” under the applicable law and he was not an “authority” covered under the law. The court denied Prehn’s motion but after negotiations, the parties agreed to a forensic inspection of Prehn’s digital devices, which yielded an additional 159 additional communications.

Both sides moved for summary judgment. MEA sought prevailing-part relief and Prehn argued the case was moot because he had voluntarily produced the records during litigation. The circuit court ruled in favor of Prehn.

The Court of Appeals ruled that the disputed text messages qualified as “records” in the initial suit because they were communications tied to government functions, and that mid-litigation compliance with a Records Request does not automatically render the action moot. Further, the court found that the circuit court misapplied Friends of Frame Park, particularly considering recent court decisions that clarified a ruling on the merits remains relevant even with mid-litigation compliance, in regards to attorney fees, litigation costs and damages. The court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its ruling.

The pace of ICE arrests in Wisconsin is rising during the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement surge.","Of the roughly 6.6 million immigrants who landed in the federal immigration court system over the past decade, at least 41,000 listed addresses in Wisconsin.

Those immigrants, many of them new arrivals, are now in the spotlight.

The Wisconsin Assembly voted earlier this month to bar local governments or state agencies from subsidizing or reimbursing health care for immigrants who are not “lawfully present” in the United States. One bill sponsor described that proposal as mostly “preemptive,” given that undocumented immigrants are already ineligible for most Wisconsin Medicaid coverage. The ACLU of Wisconsin is asking the state Supreme Court to prohibit local jails from holding immigrant detainees on behalf of federal immigration authorities, even while some law enforcement agencies attempt to wade further into the realm of immigration enforcement.

Many of the human details of those interactions – immigrants’ names, for instance – aren’t recorded in the spreadsheets listing immigration court hearings and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. But the records do provide clues about where new immigrants to Wisconsin came from, where they settled and how they have fared in the immigration court system.

The records also illustrate a 10-year history of shifting immigration enforcement priorities, including the beginning of the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown.

At least in Wisconsin, immigrants with legal permanent residence outnumber new arrivals. Roughly 21,000 new immigrants in Wisconsin obtained permanent residence between 2015 and 2023: the most recent year for which those data are available. Most were relatives of U.S. citizens, employees of American companies or refugees, though the number of refugees arriving annually in Wisconsin has declined. Of the nearly 7,000 immigrants in Wisconsin who became legal permanent residents in 2023, roughly a quarter were from Mexico.

Those with cases before immigration court, on the other hand, often overstayed visas or entered the country without them, complicating their paths, if any exist, towards legal permanent residency or citizenship. Most came to the U.S. within the past five years, making their way north and registering with the court using a Wisconsin address. Others arrived as children decades ago, first appearing in immigration court records well into their adulthoods.

Unlike federal district courts, immigration courts do not operate within the judicial branch, nor are immigration court judges political appointees subject to Senate confirmation. Instead, the courts operate within the U.S. Department of Justice, hearing cases of noncitizens who the federal government intends to “remove” – in other words, deport. The courts can also consider immigrants’ requests for asylum and other forms of relief.

Wisconsin has no immigration court of its own. The immigration court in Chicago handles most cases involving immigrants with Wisconsin addresses, while a court in Fort Snelling in Minnesota handles a smaller number. But other new arrivals have cases in courts as far away as California and Puerto Rico – an indication of the bewildering range of paths through the federal immigration system.

Immigrants with cases before the courts have the right to an attorney, but the federal government is not generally required to provide one. Unable to afford private attorneys’ fees, many immigrants opt to represent themselves.

Roughly a third of immigrants in Wisconsin who entered the immigration court system over the past decade have been represented by an attorney at some point in their case.

The limited address data available in court records suggests that these new immigrants have settled in major cities and rural communities across Wisconsin, often following jobs in agriculture and manufacturing. Small cities like Abbotsford and Darlington have received more of those recent immigrants per capita than Green Bay, though parts of Milwaukee and Dane County absorbed the largest numbers, both in absolute terms and per capita.

More than half of the new arrivals came to Wisconsin from Mexico and Nicaragua. Wisconsin received roughly 1 in 20 Nicaraguan immigrants to the U.S. over the past decade — behind only Florida, California and Texas, and by far the most disproportionate number in the country relative to the state’s overall share of recent arrivals.

“Most Nicaraguans (in Wisconsin) came from the northern parts of the country and are used to working in agriculture,” said one woman who immigrated to Wisconsin from Nicaragua in 2021. Wisconsin Watch agreed not to name her due to fears of legal repercussions.

A spiraling economy, nationwide protests and a violent police crackdown in 2018 prompted many of her neighbors to leave the country, she said, and word of abundant – and familiar — agricultural jobs drew many to Wisconsin. “By the time I left, only the grandparents remained,” she recalled in Spanish. “There were no more young people, no more children, no more parents.”

Nicaraguans made up the largest share of new immigrants on Milwaukee’s south side, whereas new immigrants from Mexico outnumber those from Nicaragua in the neighboring suburbs.

But the makeup of new immigrants varies substantially between Wisconsin communities. Venezuelans make up the largest share in parts of Dane County, as do Cuban immigrants in parts of Outagamie County, Vietnamese immigrants in Menomonee Falls and Indian immigrants in Oak Creek.

Representation rates vary significantly between immigrant nationalities: Only about 20% of Nicaraguan nationals had representation at some point in their case, compared to roughly 90% of Indian and Chinese nationals.

Not everyone with a case in the immigration court system lacks legal status. Some have obtained Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which currently shields nationals from a dozen countries from deportation, though Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has moved to terminate those protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti in the coming months. DHS terminated TPS for Nicaraguan nationals in early September.

ICE, a branch of DHS, can move to deport immigrants without a hearing in some cases.

ICE records through late July indicate the agency has arrested roughly 1,700 people in Wisconsin since September 2023. Roughly 45% of those arrested have left the country, either via deportation or “voluntary departure.” Those able to leave via “voluntary departure” avoid adding a removal to their record.

The pace of ICE arrests in Wisconsin is rising during the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement surge.

In recent months, those arrests have primarily targeted immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The records offer no specifics on the nature of the convictions or charges.

In that regard, Wisconsin is out of step with countrywide trends. ICE data indicates that immigrants with no criminal history made up nearly 30% of arrests nationally in 2025 as of late July, compared to just over 15% of arrests in Wisconsin.

Still, arrests in Wisconsin of immigrants with no criminal history and subsequent deportations are ticking upwards. Milwaukee immigration attorney Davorin Odrcic says the trend reflects a new set of priorities among immigration enforcement officials.

“There was an unspoken rule,” he said, that if an immigrant was seeking legal status and “not a danger to the community, didn’t have any convictions, ICE would let them go through that process.” Based on one client’s recent arrest and detention, Odrcic believes that unspoken rule has vanished.

While location data on ICE arrests is sparse and often unreliable, the agency’s records point to hundreds of arrests in Wisconsin jails and prisons over the past two years. Those figures will likely grow as Wisconsin sheriffs increasingly sign agreements to help ICE locate and take custody of undocumented immigrants detained in local jails.

Arrest data from the Biden administration included hundreds of records of arrests at an ICE office in downtown Milwaukee, the vast majority of which involved Nicaraguan immigrants with no criminal history. Only a handful of those arrests resulted in deportations, suggesting the immigrants were quickly released. Researchers at the Deportation Data Project, which collects and publishes federal immigration enforcement data, say the “arrests” may simply represent immigrants checking in at the ICE office.

Many of Odrcic’s clients are still required to check in at an ICE office periodically – a visit that has become far more daunting under Trump’s recent crackdown. “It’s a challenging situation,” he said. “I can’t advise you to blow off one of these appointments. I could advise you that there is a possibility of detention. So, I just have to leave it at that.”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/03/scales-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:57:11.306271

By Arnie Alpert, Active with the Activists

Arnie Alpert spent decades as a community organizer/educator in NH movements for social justice and peace. Officially retired from the American Friends Service Committee since 2020, he keeps his hands (and feet) in the activist world while writing about past and present social movements.

MANCHESTER—It was a relatively quiet afternoon at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport on Sunday, but those who drove by the terminal would have noticed eight people with signs protesting against Avelo Airlines. The protest was timed to coincide with the departure of Avelo Flight 605, headed to Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, where another demonstration took place.

Avelo, a budget carrier which flies passengers from MHT to three North Carolina airports as well as Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, has for months been flying shackled immigrant prisoners between domestic airports under contract to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency with primary responsibility for carrying out President Donald Trump’s “mass deportation” agenda. Avelo has also operated “removal flights” carrying deportees from Arizona to Guatemala. The practice has aroused a nationwide protest movement, including a boycott, intended to pressure the company to end its involvement in the deportation business.

Avelo is not transporting immigrants out of Manchester. But they are one of three airlines that has been flying them out of Portsmouth under contract with ICE.

“We want them to cancel that contract,” said Jimmy Trinh, a spokesperson for the Southern NH chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which organized the demonstration. “Our goal is to pressure them to make it financially unfeasible for them to run these flights. And if they cancel their contracts, we’ll stop trying to pressure them, but if not, we’re perfectly fine with them going out of business.”

The Houston-based carrier is the only airline with an ICE contract that also has scheduled commercial flights. Many of the ICE flights, including those which have departed from Portsmouth International Airport, are “shuffle” flights which transport detainees to airports closer to the border, from which the prisoners are taken to detention prisons, grouped with others from their home countries and put on removal flights, mostly to Latin America.

The other airlines which have operated ICE flights from Portsmouth, Global X and Eastern Air Express, are charter companies and therefore more immune to consumer boycotts.

According to Human Rights First, which publishes the monthly ICE Flight Monitor, ICE contracts directly with CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts the flights to airline firms such as Avelo. In July, Avelo was responsible for 20% of all ICE flights and 10% of removal flights, the group said.

“This combined protest between North Carolina and New Hampshire is to demonstrate the resolve of us all across the country to get Avelo to drop their contract with ICE. Avelo’s decision to try to profit off of human trafficking is a clear demonstration of their willingness to collaborate with this administration in its attempts to terrorize our immigrant communities,” DSA said in a statement prior to the protest.

“We are not asking people to make the difficult choice of confronting a violent deportation machinery directly, we are asking them to make simple changes to their spending habits here on this airline, and any other airline that might try to do the same. Avelo is making money by destroying our communities, we have to show them we won’t let them,” the group said.

DSA also protested at MHT on August 6. Another group held signs protesting Avelo’s ICE flights on a busy Manchester road leading to the airport on May 31.

In Durham, North Carolina, where Avelo Flight 605 landed at Raleigh-Durham (RDU) at 5:07 PM, members of Engaged Durhamites for Democracy held their own protest. “We have been demonstrating since late April to put pressure on Avelo to stop coordinating with ICE to deport passengers,” said Kathryn Pollak, a spokesperson for the group. “They often fly passengers without due process and in shackles, which causes moral distress for Avelo flight crews as they cannot keep their passengers safe. We hope that by doing a joint event with Manchester we can raise awareness further to those traveling on that Avelo flight, encouraging them to not fly Avelo until they sever their contract with ICE.”

Pollak’s group, which is affiliated with Indivisible, has been protesting at RDU every week since April, and now has a permit for a quiet protest inside the airport terminal every Monday.

Indivisible’s “Ground Avelo” campaign, and another called the Coalition to Stop Avelo, have both been promoting protests and a boycott. In addition to its attention to potential passengers, Ground Avelo is calling for pressure to be put on Avelo’s university partners, the states and municipalities which run airports, and the company’s leadership, which together they label as the “pillars” that hold up the company’s business. By weakening the pillars, they believe they can push the airline to cease its involvement in mass deportation.

It’s not clear whether the protests and boycotts are having an impact, but Avelo recently announced it will suspend its Manchester flights in January. “Avelo unfortunately made the difficult decision to pause service at MHT, with their latest flight scheduled to depart on January 5, 2026. They plan to continue to explore opportunities in MHT and hope to return for the summer 2026 season once they identify the right mix of markets and frequencies,” says a statement on the MHT website.

The airline has suspended flights from Portland Airport in Maine and will end all its West Coast flights in October.

Reporting on early September protests at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Travel and Tour World said there is a “growing national movement aimed at drawing attention to the role of airlines in facilitating deportation flights. Across the United States, similar protests have been staged targeting airlines involved in deportation activities. The movement has garnered increasing support, with more protests expected in the coming weeks.”

The online publication, which calls itself, “the premier digital B2B [Business-to-Business] integrated media platform in the travel and tourism industry,” added, “As the focus on deportation flights intensifies, the question of the ethical responsibilities of airlines operating in the U.S. continues to be a point of contention. These protests have brought to light the increasing desire among travelers and tourism stakeholders for more transparency and accountability in the way airlines collaborate with government agencies on sensitive issues like immigration and deportation.”

Avelo passengers I spoke with inside the terminal were unaware of the airline’s connection to ICE flights. One, a Durham resident named Matt, said he would consider joining the boycott.

Jade Curtis, a resident of Dover who was outside the terminal with a sign reading, “No Human Being is Illegal,” said she had been unaware of the Avelo-ICE connection until recently. “As soon as I heard about it I was definitely on board to come down here and protest it and make more people aware.”

Avelo’s deportation flights have also drawn the concern of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents Avelo workers. In a September 18 letter to Avelo’s CEO, the union president, Sara Nelson, said, “Our Union and the Avelo flight attendants we represent have grave concerns about safety on Avelo flights flown for the Department of Homeland Security to deport detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE flights). Based upon reports we are receiving from our members, Avelo is not following FAA safety requirements.

“Recent press reports have documented how ICE flights by other airlines have not accounted for passenger safety in the event of an emergency,” Nelson’s letter continued. “Flight attendants were not trained on evacuation of restrained passengers, and were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA. No modifications were made to the aircraft cabin to ensure restrained passengers could be evacuated in an emergency. No protocols were developed to apply FAA safety rules such as requirements for emergency row exits. Unfortunately, these issues are now occurring on Avelo ICE flights.”

An Avelo flight on September 5 appears to be the most recent immigrant transfer flight from Portsmouth, according to local activists who have been monitoring the airport. They say it was carrying 30 people.

In its latest ICE Flight Monitor, Human Rights First reported, “Since taking office on January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has pursued an unprecedented mass deportation agenda. U.S. officials have adopted a range of new tactics to achieve this objective, including expanding the use of expedited removal, sending people from the United States to offshore detention facilities in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, terminating protected legal statuses, disappearing people without due process including to a high security prison in El Salvador, and forcibly transferring individuals to other countries of which they are not citizens. These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to non-existent transparency, while thousands of people’s lives are uprooted from communities across the country and their rights are systematically violated.”

“Before removal, individuals are often moved repeatedly between ICE detention centers and staging facilities via domestic ‘shuffle flights.’ These frequent transfers not only disorient individuals but also make it significantly harder for them to access legal counsel and maintain contact with family. Between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the Trump administration carried out at least 4,422 shuffle flights—a 43 percent increase from the same period in 2024—including a monthly record of 805 flights in August 2025 alone. Among them were at least 81 flights to offshore detention facilities at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay Naval Base—six of which occurred in August. At the military base, individuals are detained thousands of miles from the United States and face abuse and mistreatment.”

Reports of inhumane conditions in ICE detention facilities as well as those run by private prison companies continue to reach the American public. “Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention, as revealed in a stark new court filing,” The Guardian reported on September 28.

Manchester-Boston Regional Airport is owned by the City of Manchester and is governed by a public board with members appointed by the City and the Town of Londonderry. Jimmy Trinh from Southern NH DSA said, “I think our next actions are going to be focused on pushing changes at the municipal level to keep them [Avelo] from returning to MHT.”",https://indepthnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Avelo-protesters-outside-MHT-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:59:08.929228

Mexico City. Labor and migrant advocacy organizations from seven Latin American countries and the United States deliberated this Sunday to call for “unity among the continent’s governments against the imperialist policies” of President Donald Trump, which also includes the defense of Venezuela. They agreed to convene a Continental Day of Action for the Right to Migrate in all countries of the hemisphere during the second week of March 2026.

The announcement came at the conclusion of the Continental Conference For the Rights of Migrants and National Sovereignty held in Mexico City on September 27 and 28 at the headquarters of the National Union of Workers of the Metropolitan Autonomous University (SITUAM). This conference brought together 120 representatives from various organizations working with migrant populations.

“Resistance against Trump’s policies is growing in the United States, as seen in the street demonstrations. In Panama, the people are fighting to defend the Canal. In several countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, people are fighting against imperialist interference and its agents, like Bolsonaro and his generals. In other cases, such as Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina, they are fighting against puppet regimes. These are expressions of the same cause: the defense of national sovereignty. The fight for the right to migrate is part of the fight for workers’ rights and human rights,” they stated in a statement.

They also acknowledged that Presidents Lula Da Silva (Brazil), Claudia Sheinbaum (Mexico), Gustavo Petro (Colombia), Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) and Xiomara Castro (Honduras) have vigorously spoken out in defense of migrants, but “until now each one acts on their own, and the adversary is too strong to confront individually, when what is desirable is the unity of the continent’s governments against imperialist policies.”

The meeting addressed the increasingly restrictive conditions of U.S. immigration policies, particularly under the Donald Trump administration.

“Imperialist policy is the main cause of forced migrations driven by free trade policies, ‘structural adjustments,’ the ‘War on Terror,’ and the ‘War on Drugs,’ which displace populations and are systematically used against national sovereignty. In this regard, French colonialism, still present in the Caribbean, has a complementary effect, suffocating peoples seeking independence.”

“The most striking case of aggression today is against Venezuela, with economic attacks, lethal attacks on vessels, and threats of military intervention. We call for the unconditional defense of our sister country,” they stated.

They also highlighted the effects of these measures on migrant communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, which in January 2025 reached a record high of 53 million people, equivalent to 15.8% of its total population, while in 2023 the number of unauthorized immigrants reached 14 million, mainly from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

The participants called on the region’s governments to coordinate policies for migrant reception, job placement, and healthcare, emphasizing that, to date, each country has acted individually in response to a continental phenomenon.

The impacts of economic, trade, and security policies that have led to forced displacement and mass migration were also discussed, as well as the need for Latin American governments to articulate a common position regarding these structural causes.

But the employers that profit the most from H-1B workers — including workers who are relatively low-paid — would still have an incentive to request visas.","After the White House’s startling changes to the nation’s high-skilled visa program, employers have moved from shock to acceptance.

Some are strategizing how to work with the new rules. Others are making plans to litigate. And many wish the Trump administration had heeded the piles of ideas to fix the program’s central, widely acknowledged failing.

Since the early 2000s, demand for specialized workers has far outstripped a cap that remains where it stood when the H-1B program started in 1990. The government allocates the visas randomly, and outsourcing companies have learned to flood the system with applications for relatively low-paid positions.

The Trump administration said it wanted to stop that practice and reserve the coveted visas for the most valuable workers so they do not displace American software programmers, researchers and engineers. The solutions the administration chose — a $100,000 fee for new visas and a complex weighting system to favor higher-paid jobs — are unlikely to accomplish that.

Instead, loopholes appear likely to allow outsourcing companies to adapt while start-ups, universities and research organizations lose out, according to experts from across the political spectrum.

“Something that addresses the right problem and sounds good on paper can still lead you down the exactly same problematic road,” said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank that has studied the H-1B program.

‘A really high barrier’

Any comfort that might have come from certainty about the administration’s long-awaited action was erased by the likelihood of legal challenges to the new rules. A provision for exemptions based on the “national interest” — which the White House suggested it might grant to doctors, for example — has kept workers and employers hoping for clemency.

“They want to create a really high barrier that gives them discretion to bring people to them to make a deal,” Mr. Lettieri said.

Immigration officials aggressively denied H-1B applications in Mr. Trump’s first term, but the support of tech leaders including Elon Musk raised hopes that Mr. Trump might look more favorably on foreign talent now.

The H-1B is America’s largest visa category for workers with specialized skills. The annual limit is 85,000, and employers that aren’t subject to the cap — including nonprofit universities and hospitals — usually expand the total by at least 50 percent. The visa can be extended for up to six years, or longer if the worker has a pending green card application. In 2019, the last year the Department of Homeland Security provided data, there were about 583,420 H-1B visa holders in the United States.

Almost since its inception, the program has been plagued with instances of employers who substituted foreign visa holders for American workers and paid them less. In the early 2000s, the federal government embraced a lottery to allocate scarce visas, with no mechanism to elevate exceptional talents over more run-of-the-mill workers.

Despite the program’s shortcomings, economists have generally found that H-1B visa holders boost American productivity and raise wages even for American workers. Politicians and policy experts on both sides of the aisle have called for changes to maximize the program's value.

“It’s all random chance, which is insane for a program that should be our flagship high-skilled immigration program,” said Jeremy Neufeld, director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress.

Some possible fixes

To squeeze more benefits from the system, Mr. Neufeld has proposed ranking applications by compensation, so that only the highest-paid workers would be assured visas. Alternatively, the government could devise a points system — similar to Canada’s — that would capture other desirable characteristics such as youth and language skills that aren’t reflected in compensation. Policymakers could also reduce abuse by awarding more green cards, which allow workers to switch jobs for better offers.

Some solutions would require congressional action. Lawmakers have proposed fixes like requiring employers to look harder for domestic applicants before recruiting outside the country, or banning layoffs of workers who are replaced by visa holders. They have also considered more targeted measures to crack down on wage suppression by outsourcing companies. The Biden administration finalized a rule in its last days allowing for tougher oversight.

The $100,000 fee, however, came out of nowhere.

“Up until this weekend, business felt aligned with the Trump administration on the need to modernize the H-1B program,” said Jennie Murray, president of the National Immigration Forum, which helps companies integrate their foreign-born workforces and pushes for immigrant-friendly policies.

The White House said the fee would ensure that employers only submit petitions for workers they need so much that they’re willing to pay an extra $100,000 to get them. But the employers that profit the most from H-1B workers — including workers who are relatively low-paid — would still have an incentive to request visas.

“If they keep the H-1B worker for six years, it’s a worthwhile investment,” said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the labor-aligned Economic Policy Institute.

The largest tech companies could afford the fees, improving their chances in a crapshoot that right now gives them only one in five odds. And the fee is only required for people applying from outside the United States. It is easier for multinational corporations to bring their desired workers into the country on other visa types before transferring them to an H-1B, allowing them to skip the fee. More than half of H-1Bs are granted to people who are already in the United States.

“Primarily, we’ll see small businesses being locked out of the program,” said Cecilia Esterline, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, a think tank. “It’s kind of incoherent.”

A small edge for higher-paid jobs

The other major element of the changes to the H-1B program comes from a proposed rule that would take effect after several months of comment and review. It is intended to give higher-paid positions an edge in the lottery. But rather than ranking them by compensation, it would tie the lottery to four wage thresholds based on occupation and region, giving additional weight to the higher wage levels.

That means a relatively well-compensated worker in a less lucrative profession — like journalism or nursing — could have a better shot than a recent college graduate entering a highly paid field with the potential to earn much more in the future. Employers would still be able to bring people in at the lowest wage levels, which an earlier version of the rule proposed in 2020 would have effectively prevented.

“The whole point — which I emphatically agree with — is to select high-wage H-1B workers,” said George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for more restrictive immigration policy. “This would undermine the basis for the entire rule.”

Todd Schulte, the president of the pro-immigration group FWD.us, favors a simple wage floor that would ensure that the visas go only to the highest-paid workers. The median annual compensation of H-1B holders is $120,000. One approach would be to cut out everyone below that level.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/business/00h1b-mess/00h1b-mess-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:58:29.133399

There are reports Israeli drones have struck near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Al-Helou Hospital has also been shelled. Doctors and patients, including 12 premature babies, are trapped in the hospital.

Doctors Without Borders says it has been forced to suspend activities in Gaza City. The group’s emergency coordinator in Gaza, Jacob Granger, said, “We have been left with no choice but to stop our activities as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces.”

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City but say there is nowhere safe to go. This is Rami Al-Hassi, who lost a leg in an Israeli attack. He spoke as he attempted to flee Gaza City on foot.

Rami Al-Hassi: “I am walking from Beach camp since yesterday 6 a.m. I got the artificial leg recently, and I can’t walk for long. I arrived at 10 p.m. to another place. We slept outside in the desert, and it was cold. I was heading south. Look at the situation. … There were airstrikes from the quadcopter, shellings from tanks, from the ships also, and targeting all the houses. We didn’t have any other options. We had to leave without clothes. We don’t have blankets or clothes or anything.”

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with President Trump at the White House today. It’s his fourth trip there since Trump returned to office in January. They are expected to discuss a 21-point U.S. plan for ending the war in Gaza. One U.S. proposal calls for installing former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the head of a transitional authority to rule Gaza. On Sunday, Netanyahu met in New York with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who once called Gaza’s waterfront property “very valuable.”

On Friday, Netanyahu addressed the United Nations and vowed to “finish the job” in Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “But we’re not done yet. The final elements, the final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City. They vow to repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again, no matter how diminished their forces. That is why Israel must finish the job. That is why we want to do so as fast as possible.”

Netanyahu spoke to a largely empty room at the U.N. after over 100 diplomats from more than 50 countries walked out in protest. Thousands also protested Netanyahu outside the United Nations, with many calling for him to be arrested for war crimes.

In Israel, hostage families also held protests. This is Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan has been held in Gaza for nearly two years.

Einav Zangauker: “I’m looking you in the eyes, Netanyahu. If you come back without an agreement, a hell awaits you here that you cannot even imagine. The protests and strikes of the past weeks will seem like child’s play compared to what I’m preparing for you. If you sabotage the agreement again, we will chase you until the end of time. You will not have a single moment of peace.”

The Trump administration revoked the visa for Colombian President Gustavo Petro after he joined a pro-Palestinian protest outside the United Nations in New York. During the protest, he called for an international force to end Israel’s genocide. He also urged U.S. troops to disobey orders from President Trump.

President Gustavo Petro: “The global force has to be bigger than that of the United States. That’s why, from here, from New York, I ask all the soldiers of the Army of the U.S. not to point their guns at people. Disobey the orders of Trump. Obey the orders of humanity.”

After the U.S. revoked his visa, Petro wrote online, “Revoking it for denouncing genocide shows the U.S. no longer respects international law.”

NBC News is reporting that U.S. military officials are drawing up options to possibly launch drone strikes inside Venezuela. In recent weeks, the U.S. has attacked several boats in the Caribbean that officials claimed were carrying drugs. On Friday at the United Nations, Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto accused the U.S. of targeting Venezuela in an effort to steal Venezuela’s oil and gas.

Yván Gil Pinto: “Today the aggression is aimed at Venezuela, a peaceful and supportive country like Venezuela. It cannot be accused of having weapons of mass destruction or nuclear weapons. Today the United States invents vulgar and perverse lies that no one believes, neither in the United States nor in the world, to justify an atrocious, extravagant and immoral military threat. That is why we once again thank world public opinion and that of the United States, the governments and peoples of the world, the denunciation of this attempt to bring war to the Caribbean and South America in order to promote a regime change that would allow them to steal Venezuela’s incalculable oil and gas wealth.”

The state of Oregon has sued the Trump administration after President Trump directed troops to be deployed to Portland, the state’s largest city. In a social media post, Trump said the troops are needed to “protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.” Trump added, “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.” Oregon Governor Tina Kotek denounced Trump’s call for troops.

Gov. Tina Kotek: “There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city. … We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon stoking fear, creaking conflict and, frankly, escalating a situation that is under control. Any, any federal takeover with military troops in our state is a threat to communities across Oregon.”

President Trump confirmed that he will be attending a meeting of the country’s top generals and admirals ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, scheduled for tomorrow. The orders provided no reason for the unusual and unprecedented event. Eugene R. Fidell, a military law expert at Yale Law School, told The Washington Post that the last-minute meeting “should be tremendously concerning to the American people.” Earlier this year, Hegseth called for a 20% reduction of four-star generals and fired more than a dozen senior military officials. It comes as the White House has recently renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War.

The Supreme Court ruled Friday to allow the Trump administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid that had been approved by Congress. The court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing, “The stakes are high: At issue is the allocation of power between the executive and Congress.” A lawyer who represents the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which sued the Trump administration, said that the ruling “will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.” Meanwhile, the conservative majority on the court warned that their decision was a temporary one and “should not be read as a final determination on the merits.”

In international news, Russia launched nearly 600 drones and more than 40 cruise missiles at Ukraine, hitting Kyiv and other cities over Saturday night and into Sunday morning. The onslaught killed at least four people and wounded at least 70. It comes as Bloomberg reports that British, French and German envoys privately warned Russia that NATO members would shoot down any Russian aircraft violating European airspace. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had received a Patriot defense system from Israel and that two more systems would arrive in the fall.

Missouri’s governor signed into law Sunday a new Trump-backed congressional map designed to flip a seat in Kansas City currently held by Democrats over to the Republicans. The seat is held by Democratic Congressmember Emanuel Cleaver, and the new map reduces the number of Black and minority residents in Cleaver’s district. At least three lawsuits have been filed in Missouri contending that the map is illegal since it takes place outside the usual once-in-a-decade cycle for redrawing congressional maps. It comes as Texas approved a new congressional map earlier this year that would flip five Democratic-leaning seats.

Assata Shakur died in Havana on Thursday at the age of 78. Shakur was a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army. Shakur was convicted in the May 2, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead. She was shot twice by police during the incident. In 1979, she managed to escape from jail and later fled to Cuba, where she received political asylum. She long proclaimed her innocence. We will hear Assata in her own words later in the show.

September 29, 2025 9:35 am

RICHMOND, VA – Dr. Badar Khan Suri’s legal team on Friday urged the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the lower court’s rulings that ordered his release on bail.

Dr. Suri is a postdoctoral scholar from India at Georgetown University’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding focused on peace and conflict resolution. He is married to a Palestinian-American U.S. citizen and is the father of three young children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. On the basis of a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Dr. Suri somehow poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy, the government canceled Dr. Suri's visa, arrested him outside his home, and then transferred him to five different ICE facilities across three states, before leaving him in a Texas detention center thousands of miles away from his wife and children for months. His time in detention left him scarred both physically and emotionally, and recently he had to get a tooth extracted due to lack of dental care while detained.

“My children need me, my wife needs me, my academic community and students need me, and my research requires my full focus. I humbly submit that I should not be punished for something I did not do, nor should I be made a tool for political gains—whether by the groups who initiated these attacks or by those who amplified the smear campaigns against me,” said Dr. Suri.

“Throughout my career, I have been a small but consistent voice for the inalienable rights of oppressed people facing occupation and inhumane practices. I have done so out of a sense of justice and humanity, and I intend to continue in that spirit. I firmly believe that there is nothing wrong in standing for human dignity and compassion.

“I place my faith in this honorable court, with the hope that my rights will not be suspended, that justice will prevail, and that I will remain free to fulfill my responsibilities to my family, my students, and my community.”

The Trump administration is now asking the court to permit it to redetain Dr. Suri because, it says, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider his case in the first place. This comes months after the district court in Virginia ruled that Dr. Suri’s habeas case alleging violations of his constitutional rights may remain in Virginia, and shortly thereafter, released him on bail.

“Dr. Badar Khan Suri should never have been detained,” said Noor Zafar, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “The government’s argument essentially boils down to the sweeping assertion that it can use immigration laws to silence speech it disagrees with and no federal district court has authority to review the constitutionality of its actions. This dangerous and unprecedented argument not only chills Dr. Suri’s and his family’s speech but that of other noncitizens who seek to speak up in support of Palestinian rights. We are asking the court of appeals to reject this frightening proposal.”

This is not the first case in which the Trump administration has made extreme arguments about federal court jurisdiction. A federal court already ruled against the Trump administration when it found that it can review former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil’s First Amendment claims challenging his arrest and detention. Another federal court ruled against the Trump administration when it ordered the release of Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi on bail back in June. And yet another federal court ruled against the Trump administration when it ordered Tufts student Rümeysa Öztürk to be transferred back to Vermont from Louisiana and released on bail.

Dr. Suri is challenging his arrest and detention under the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. He is represented in his federal lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Virginia, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the HMA Law Firm, and the Immigrants and Non-Citizens Rights Clinic at the CUNY School of Law.

Della Valle was detained by Customs and Border Protection on Christmas Day 2024, heading to St. Thomas to vacation with his family.
Supporters say Della Valle first fled cartel violence in Mexico as a teenager.
""Carlos is an important member of our community,"" said Jason Gill, a pastor in Downingtown who is friends with the Della Valles.
""Thank you for all you have done and continue to do,"" Della Valle said in a recorded message.","More than 100 people filled Valley Forge Presbyterian Church in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday for a bilingual rally and vigil supporting Carlos Della Valle, a longtime Downingtown resident who is being held in immigration custody.

Della Valle has lived in Chester County since 1997. It was there that he met his wife Angela, and together, they raised their son Alessandro. Della Valle was detained by Customs and Border Protection on Christmas Day 2024, heading to St. Thomas to vacation with his family. His family says he was released on bail within a week, but taken back into custody in August after his case shifted to the immigration system. His family says he is now being held at a detention facility in Louisiana.

Supporters say Della Valle first fled cartel violence in Mexico as a teenager. His sister-in-law, Deanna Brown, told CBS News Philadelphia he was caught in Colorado at age 19, when federal officials had him sign a document agreeing not to return. She said he did not have a translator at the time and did not understand what he was signing.

""He did not speak English, so he signed this piece of paper not knowing what it was,"" Brown said. ""And then they deported him, and he came right back, because he knew that he was trying to escape crime and poverty.""

Brown added that although he illegally re-entered the U.S., Della Valle has since built what she called an honest life, working steadily, paying taxes and raising a family in Chester County.

""Carlos belongs here,"" she said. ""He may not have that citizenship in paper — but through and through, he loves his country.""

Speakers alternated in English and Spanish during the two-hour event, urging attendees to write to lawmakers and contribute to a legal fund for the family. Supporters also heard a brief recording of Della Valle's voice from detention.

""Carlos is an important member of our community,"" said Jason Gill, a pastor in Downingtown who is friends with the Della Valles. ""The community deeply believes it's important for him to be here.""

The rally followed a similar event last week in Downingtown. Family members say the uncertainty is devastating but expressed gratitude for the outpouring of community support.

""Thank you for all you have done and continue to do,"" Della Valle said in a recorded message. ""Thanks again.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/29/2aabe876-4050-4ee5-ae3a-7e6c3325803e/thumbnail/1200x630/74c04402ae74e85ec12c51514898a0a6/snapshot-4.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:59:27.524066

What the sheriffs shared The survey asked Illinois sheriffs: Whether they regard immigration enforcement as solely a federal responsibility or one shared with local law enforcement.
Grootens said he was “obligated” to follow federal law above any state statute, including by cooperating with federal law enforcement.
Advocates express concern Activists have responded with concern that Illinois sheriffs would cooperate with ICE in violation of the TRUST Act.","CHICAGO — As the U.S. government escalates immigration raids in Illinois and nationwide, some Illinois sheriffs are expressing support and a desire for greater cooperation with federal immigration enforcement despite state laws that limit their involvement.

A survey of Illinois sheriffs by the Medill Illinois News Bureau for Capitol News Illinois revealed that over two-thirds of those who responded are frustrated by the state law and would favor repeal or changes. A few described actions that appear to conflict with state restrictions.

“What are they going to do to you?” Adams County Sheriff Anthony Grootens asked regarding the consequences of violating state law. “Are they gonna have me lock myself up in my own jail?”

The Illinois TRUST Act, signed in 2017 by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, and the Illinois Way Forward Act, signed in 2021 by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, limit sheriffs’ involvement in civil immigration enforcement. Under state law, local officers may not hold someone for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, grant agents access to jails or share nonpublic information unless there is a federal criminal warrant or court order.

The Medill Illinois News Bureau and Capitol News Illinois sought to survey Illinois sheriffs about how they perceive their roles in immigration enforcement. Of the 102 Illinois sheriffs, 28 responded to reporters or answered survey questions electronically. Medill Bureau reporters reached out to unresponsive sheriffs at least three times over several months by phone, mail, email and sometimes in person.

Sheriffs surveyed come from geographically diverse regions of the state, although the state’s 21 northernmost counties, aside from Cook County, did not respond. Sheriffs’ views varied widely. Some said they had no opinion due to their county’s lack of immigration activity. Others said they favor repealing or revising state limits to allow more cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Grootens — who formerly worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration — said, in his opinion, sheriffs are “obligated” to cooperate with federal immigration agents, and any state laws contrary to that violate federal law.

“It’s kind of like when you’re in the military, you don’t follow illegal orders,” Grootens said.

Contrary to Grootens’ interpretation of the law, legal scholars and a federal judge have cited the precedent set in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1997 ruling in Printz v. United States to note that the federal government cannot compel state and local officers to administer federal programs.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul reiterated the legality of the TRUST Act in a statement, noting that his office is currently reviewing potential violations but “will not conduct any investigations in the media.”

“The courts have spoken on the constitutionality of the TRUST Act, and my office has successfully defended the law in court against multiple challenges. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that the Supremacy Clause does not preempt the TRUST Act,” Raoul said. “Any law enforcement officer or agency that unilaterally declares that the TRUST Act violates the Supremacy Clause, contrary to the courts’ rulings, is wrong.”

The Pew Research Center estimated in 2023 that roughly 550,000 people were living without legal status in Illinois, making the stakes of local law enforcement cooperating with ICE high.

Of the 28 responding sheriffs, 25 said they recognized the state law as binding, while three said they have or would cooperate with ICE. But 17 of the sheriffs who recognized the law as binding also expressed reservations, confusion or disagreement with its purpose. Some expressed support for the mission of ICE, while acknowledging that they have limited scope to cooperate with the agency.

“I’ve got no problem getting on the news and supporting what ICE is doing,” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Bullard Sr. said. “We believe in what they’re doing.”

Bullard said he would not break the law to work with ICE but hoped lawmakers or the courts would overturn the TRUST Act so that he could do so legally.

Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said the “underlying premise” of the Trust Act is to build trusting relationships with immigrant communities and help them feel safe that they can come forward to report suspected criminal activity.

“Local police cooperation with ICE, on the other hand, discourages immigrant victims and witnesses of criminal activity from coming forward, driving wedges between local police and immigrant communities that damage public safety for everyone,” Tsao said.

Opponents argue the law shields immigrants from federal enforcement and puts communities at risk. The Illinois Sheriffs’ Association has long opposed the TRUST Act.

“The ISA has consistently opposed legislative efforts to restrict local involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Our position remains that local agencies should retain the discretion to cooperate with federal authorities when public safety is at stake,” the association said in a statement.

What the sheriffs shared

The survey asked Illinois sheriffs:

Whether they regard immigration enforcement as solely a federal responsibility or one shared with local law enforcement.

Whether they had observed any increased ICE presence in their county.

Whether they had received requests for cooperation from ICE, including access to databases, facilities or people in custody.

Whether they did or would comply with those requests.

About their opinions on the TRUST Act.

Responses fell along a spectrum, and reporters organized them into four primary categories — from sheriffs who steadfastly support the act to those who feel it shouldn’t be followed.

Follow TRUST Act, echoed bill rationale

These sheriffs include: Dustin Heuerman (Champaign) and Ronnie Stevens (Fayette).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply fully with the TRUST Act and would not cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance, as limited by state law. They also drew a distinction between civil and criminal code violations, rather than treating immigration as a criminal issue.

These sheriffs said they considered those without legal status in their communities to be law-abiding, hardworking or less likely to report crimes if local law enforcement participated in civil immigration enforcement — echoing the rationale behind the bill.

“Undocumented immigrants are less likely to do that (report crime) if they feel their citizenship status will be requested or they may be deported,” Champaign County Sheriff Dustin Heuerman wrote. “I have tried to make it very clear to the immigrant community that citizenship status does not matter to my deputies — just crimes against the Illinois Compiled Statutes.”

Fayette County Sheriff Ronnie Stevens said he did not think those in his community would be less likely to report crimes without the TRUST Act. At the same time, he didn’t see a need for those without legal status, a civil issue, to be considered potential criminals.

“I’ll be quite honest with you, we know quite a few of those are probably here illegally, but they don’t cause no problems,” Stevens said in an interview. “I mean, granted, the federal government says they are (breaking laws), but on the criminal side of it, they are pretty law-abiding. They stay pretty low key, and they stay in the residences usually at night.”

Both sheriffs referenced the TRUST Act unquestionably as the law. Stevens said he “absolutely would not allow” ICE access to his facilities or databases.

“What I think about the Trust Act doesn’t matter. It is the law,” Heuerman wrote.

Follow TRUST Act, expressed no opinion

These sheriffs include: Justin Oliver (Brown); Bruce Kettelkamp (Christian); Thomas Dart (Cook); William Rutan (Crawford); Chad Howard (Perry), and Richard Watson (St. Clair).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply fully with the TRUST Act, but either had no opinion or declined to share it. In some cases, adherence to the TRUST Act was not an active choice, but simply the reality of living in a small, rural area with little to no immigration activity.

Several of these sheriffs reported they’ve had no ICE presence for many years and said immigration enforcement does not impact them. Brown County Sheriff Justin Oliver, for example, said he had not engaged with ICE in around 10 years. Crawford County Sheriff William Rutan, who has served since he was initially elected in 2014, similarly said he had never spoken with ICE agents about anyone in his community.

Rutan emphasized his intention to uphold the law both for those with legal status and those without it. “The only thing that I’m concerned with is people who’re breaking the law as far as hurting people in my community,” Rutan said.

Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said he would adhere to the state laws. “We follow the legislation that says, if they’re not being held for a local crime, then that’s up to the federal government,” Kettlekamp said of immigration enforcement. “I would say, due to the lack of presence currently, it does not affect how we do our daily operations as is.”

Perry County Sheriff Chad Howard said he does not ask or retain information about citizenship status and would not provide ICE access to databases, facilities or individuals in custody. He declined to comment on what he thought of the TRUST Act.

St. Clair County Lt. Jesse Carmack issued a statement on behalf of Sheriff Richard Watson but declined to participate in the full survey. “The position of the St. Clair County Sheriff’s Office in Illinois is that the immigration laws have not affected us,” Carmack said.

Cook County recently has been at the center of federal actions to deport immigrants, putting tremendous public attention on Sheriff Thomas Dart’s office. The Department of Homeland Security began its immigration enforcement campaign called “Operation Midway Blitz” earlier this month, already resulting in hundreds of arrests in the Chicago area, according to a DHS official.

On Sept. 12, federal agents conducting a traffic stop fatally shot a Franklin Park man who legally immigrated from Mexico, sparking protests and calls for transparency from Gov. JB Pritzker.

Dart’s office responded to questions about the TRUST Act by saying the department “follows the laws of Illinois and does not have an opinion on this matter.”

The response said the sheriff’s office does not ask for or retain citizenship status or allow ICE access to their databases, facilities or people in custody.

Following recent ICE operations targeting individuals detained in the Cook County Jail, DHS accused the jail of not cooperating, consistent with Dart’s response to the survey.

However, an investigation by South Side Weekly found that ICE is able to indirectly access sensitive data through a loophole in the jail’s contract with a system used for notifying crime victims of changes in offender custody status.

Follow TRUST Act, but expressed reservations

These sheriffs include: Kent Martin (Coles); Paul Kuhns (Effingham); Matthew J. Link (Henderson); Jeff Bullard Sr. (Jefferson); Pete Sopczak (Johnson); Shawn Kahl (Macoupin); Wayne Strawn III (Marshall); Nicholas Petitgout (McDonough); Matthew R. Lane (McLean); Mark Oller (Menard); Gary Carroll (Moultrie); David Greenwood (Pike); Randy Kern (Pulaski); Joshua Boedigheimer (Putnam); Andrew Hires (Richland); Martin Edwards (Warren), and Ross Schultze (Washington).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply with the TRUST Act and would not cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance prohibited under state law. However, these sheriffs also described the TRUST Act as problematic or overly restrictive.

Safety and transparency concerns

A subset of sheriffs surveyed mentioned safety concerns resulting from the TRUST Act, either for the public, for officers or both. McLean County Sheriff Matthew R. Lane and Putnam County Sheriff Joshua Boedigheimer both stated they believed it would be safer for all parties for ICE to collect individuals from the custody of local law enforcement rather than tracking them down in public.

“It’s much safer in my opinion and other sheriffs’ opinions that ICE would be able to take that individual from a jail area rather than trying to find them in public and create more of a situation that may not be necessary,” Boedigheimer said.

The jail handoff also minimizes chances for the public to intercede, he said.

Coles County Sheriff Kent Martin similarly mentioned concerns that sheriffs’ inability to assist could jeopardize the safety of ICE agents. Sheriffs also said the law limits their capacity to manage traffic where ICE is operating or provide ICE with pertinent local information, such as directions or neighborhood dynamics.

Martin said he thought it could lead to somebody getting hurt.

“I don’t understand why we can’t even do anything to assure the safety of our fellow officers,” Martin said. “I don’t understand the logic behind that.”

Warren County Sheriff Martin Edwards and Moultrie County Sheriff Gary Caroll said the inability to talk with ICE hinders their ability to provide accurate information about ICE operations to their communities.

“People call up, they see excitement, they see activity, they want to know what the hell’s going on,” Edwards said. “I wouldn’t know. So again, what good does that do us to operate in the dark?”

Limiting resources

Some sheriffs expressed frustration that they could not cooperate with federal agents on immigration in the way they can work across agencies for other issues.

“I believe that all law enforcement should be able to cooperate with federal law, so I don’t know what the difference would be between federal immigration and a federal warrant for drugs or murder or anything else,” said McDonough County Sheriff Nicholas Petitgout. “We’re held to help them in any other type of criminal enforcement, so for the state of Illinois to tell us that we can’t help them with this specific topic, I don’t agree with it.”

Petitgout said he considered immigration to be a shared responsibility between federal and local law enforcement but said he would not give ICE access to databases, facilities or people in custody, stating that such actions are illegal.

Henderson County Sheriff Matthew J. Link and Warren County Sheriff Martin Edwards similarly mentioned the conflict between state and federal law.

“It’s a frustrating position for us because we do everything in our power to hold criminals accountable and protect our communities, but you have a federal law that says one thing and an Illinois law that says another, and we’re sworn to uphold the constitution of both,” Link said.

For Link and others in this group, the conflict was mostly theoretical — Link said he has never had contact with ICE in 23 years working in law enforcement in the county. Edwards, too, said he had not seen ICE agents in years, but he took issue with the TRUST Act on principle.

Marshall County Sheriff Wayne Strawn III said he did not “personally” agree with the TRUST Act, mentioning the federal government’s responsibility for controlling U.S. borders.

Menard County Sheriff Mark Oller said he would not be interested in proactively seeking out and arresting individuals residing in his county without legal status but said the prohibition on cooperation with federal law enforcement did not sit well with him.

“I wouldn’t see myself being the person to go and shake them (a family) down to see their status, but if it was some kind of a foreign gang or foreign criminal, I would be for protecting the law-abiding people in the area,” Oller said. “It’s just kind of weird where they make a law where you don’t cooperate with federal law enforcement.”

Sheriff Paul Kuhns of Effingham County said he’d like a chance to use ICE and immigration law to remove individuals arrested for other crimes.

“I’m not so concerned about the people that are here working hard, feeding their families, obeying the law,” Kuhns said. “But if I have someone that’s breaking the law or a threat in my community, I should be able to use federal immigration laws and federal enforcement officers to help me deal with that.”

The sentiment was echoed by Macoupin County Sheriff Shawn Kahl.

“I think that if they’re violent criminals and they’re running loose and they have a detainer, we should be able to detain them and hold them until they can be picked up,” Kahl said. “If you’re a violent illegal citizen, you should be arrested. Period.”

The Attorney General’s office stated that the TRUST Act does not prevent local law enforcement from coordinating with federal officers “related to criminal court proceedings or to execute a federal judge’s orders.”

Legislative disconnect

Many sheriffs expressed frustration that they felt legislators did not properly consider their input on the TRUST Act.

“We’re at the table on just about any situation that moves through, but again, it often times feels like we’re not heard or not listened to and they have an agenda and they push it through,” Richland County Sheriff Andrew Hires said.

Hires added that sheriffs’ inability to cooperate with federal immigration officials is “completely wrong” and said it “should be corrected.”

Johnson County Sheriff Pete Sopczak used stronger language when discussing the TRUST Act and its passage by the General Assembly.

“We call things ‘TRUST’ Act and we call it the ‘HOPE’ Act,” Sopczak said. “Springfield doesn’t run the state, Chicago does, and they’ve masterminded the language they use to make everything sound great.”

To Sopczak, the state law does not reflect that ideal.

“They can’t even use our bathroom,” Sopczak said, referring to the prohibition on allowing ICE agents to use facilities or equipment for investigative or immigration enforcement purposes. “It’s sad, is what I think. All law enforcement has to be able to work together.”

Hoping for repeal

Several sheriffs shared a hope that a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in February against the city of Chicago and the state would overturn the TRUST Act. The lawsuit attacked the jurisdictions’ sanctuary laws, claiming they deliberately impeded the work of federal immigration officials.

U.S. District Court Judge Lindsay Jenkins dismissed the lawsuit in July, stating the federal government “may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”

Prior to Jenkins’ dismissal of the suit, Washington County Sheriff Ross Schultze and Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Bullard Sr. had been confident it would succeed.

“We’re waiting for that to get to the Supreme Court because we’re very sure that the Supreme Court will overturn the TRUST Act and all the sanctuary state policies in this state,” Bullard said in May.

The Justice Department did not amend its complaint by the required August deadline and the case was dismissed with prejudice, according to the court docket. However, Pulaski County Sheriff Randy Kern suggested that he and other sheriffs are working to devise plans to fight the TRUST Act.

“We’re getting a game plan together,” Kern said when asked for clarification.

Have cooperated or would cooperate with ICE

These sheriffs include: Anthony Grootens (Adams); Shannon Bradley (Gallatin), and Jerry Suits (Pope).

Sheriffs in this category said they cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance, in apparent conflict with the TRUST Act, or would do so given the opportunity. They cited safety concerns or the laws of the federal government as taking precedence over those of the state.

“Whether you’re federal, local, state — whatever level you’re at — I just feel like we all need to work together,” Gallatin County Sheriff Shannon Bradley said.

While Bradley said he has not had communication with ICE, he said he would cooperate with a request from the agency.

Bradley said his office currently asks someone when arrested whether they are a U.S. citizen through a “generic form” the sheriff’s office has used since he has been there, at least 15 years. Asking an individual arrested about citizenship status appears inconsistent with the TRUST Act’s limits on inquiring about immigration status in most contexts.

While Pope County Sheriff Jerry Suits said immigration is not significant in his county and he has not had communication with ICE, he said he would cooperate with a request from the agency.

“We don’t want to break any laws but we want to do the right thing,” Suits said. “I’m going to do whatever it takes to keep Pope County people safe.”

Grootens, the Adams County sheriff, was the only Illinois sheriff who said that he has already cooperated with ICE on a civil immigration matter.

His rationale, he said, is: “It’s not whether they commit a crime here or not, they committed a crime by crossing over into the United States illegally.”

In an apparent violation of the TRUST Act, Grootens said the Adams County Sheriff’s Office has transferred two men into ICE custody this year.

Grootens said he was “obligated” to follow federal law above any state statute, including by cooperating with federal law enforcement. “I don’t think that we can just turn our backs on federal law enforcement.”

While he said he understands Pritzker’s stance and the state’s position, Grootens said he believes the federal government “trumps” it.

Advocates express concern

Activists have responded with concern that Illinois sheriffs would cooperate with ICE in violation of the TRUST Act.

The ACLU of Illinois sued two sheriffs in 2019 — from Ogle and Stephenson counties — for allegedly violating the TRUST Act. Court dockets show that both cases resulted in settlements for the plaintiffs represented by the ACLU.

Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at ACLU of Illinois, said some of the comments by sheriffs in this survey were “deeply disturbing.”

Both the ACLU and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights emphasized the role of the Illinois Attorney General in upholding the TRUST Act.

Raoul said his office has provided guidance to law enforcement about the TRUST Act since its enactment and remains committed to working with agencies to bring them into compliance. But he didn’t comment specifically on whether he’s currently investigating any county.

“We rely on Illinois law enforcement officers to enforce state laws, and we expect that they will comply with those laws – including the TRUST Act,” Raoul said. “The TRUST Act gives my office the responsibility to investigate violations where appropriate.”

Tsao, the senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, called on sheriffs to remember their oath.

“Sheriffs and other law enforcement officers are sworn to uphold our laws,” Tsao said. “They might disagree with some parts of the law, but they must enforce it.”

His previous offences included a 20-month prison sentence in the UK for actual bodily harm and assault by beating.
Court documents showed he had been accused of domestic violence against five women, including his current partner.
The court ruled it would be “unduly harsh” to separate Pinho from his child.","A migrant accused of attacking five of his girlfriends has avoided immediate removal from the UK.

Hamilton Jorge Da Silva Pinho, a Portuguese national, was judged to pose a “risk of serious harm” after he threw an electric heater and a steam mop at a partner, as part of a history of domestic violence.

He also threatened to to hit the woman with a weight and throw acid at her, an immigration court was told, and was subject to a restraining order against another woman.

Despite having being jailed for almost a year, Pinho was allowed to stay in the country by a lower-tier immigration tribunal judge because of the emotional effect deporting him would have had on his child, with whom he did not live.

The Home Office appealed against the ruling and its challenge was backed by an upper tribunal which set aside the case to be heard again.

It is the latest case exposed by court documents in which foreign-national offenders and illegal migrants have won appeals against deportation in the lower courts by claiming it would breach their rights to a family life under article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Pinho entered the UK in 2009 with his parents and was given leave to remain for five years in November 2019. His previous offences included a 20-month prison sentence in the UK for actual bodily harm and assault by beating.

Court documents showed he had been accused of domestic violence against five women, including his current partner. He had also had verbal arguments with his mother.

He had been prosecuted for threatening and abusive words or behaviour, theft, shoplifting, battery and destroying property, and the restraining order to which he was subject will be in place until 2028.

Deportation blocked in 2023

The Home Office sought to deport Pinho in November 2023 but was blocked by the first-tier tribunal.

The court admitted he posed “a medium risk” of harm to children because of abusive drunken behaviour in front of them, but found that this risk had been minimised by restrictions including alcohol monitoring and curfew.

The court ruled it would be “unduly harsh” to separate Pinho from his child. The judge said: “I find that the evidence demonstrates a particularly close relationship and very strong emotional bonds, and that there is a strong likelihood of emotional damage to the child if [Mr Pinho] is deported to Portugal.

“I do not accept that contact via modern means of communication will be any sort of substitute for the regular in-person care and responsibility that [Mr Pinho] provides for his child.

“Overall, I find that, on balance, the evidence demonstrates that the long-term effect of [Mr Pinho’s] deportation on his child would be unduly harsh.”

In its appeal against that verdict, the Home Office claimed Pinho had “failed to accept responsibility for all of his offending”.

It said the first-tier tribunal judge had noted that Pinho had an “entrenched pattern of abusive behaviour toward female partners’ and there was a ‘risk of serious harm to his child, ex-partner and future partners’”.

Pinho’s two-year-old child lived with his mother who was the primary carer. The child was born two months before Pinho was sent to prison. He was released in September 2024.

Judge Helen Rimington accepted the Home Office appeal at an upper-tier tribunal, saying there had been a “procedural error”, with the lower-tier judge “exceeding his powers in considering the human rights appeal”.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000323135567_17591447102710_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9T0aesusvN1TE7a0ddd_esI.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-09-29 09:57:34.149647

In her Labour conference speech, Shabana Mahmood will outline a series of new conditions migrants have to meet to qualify for indefinite leave to remain.

Under the proposals, legal migrants will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status.

Labour says the policy draws a clear dividing line between the government and Reform UK, which says it would abolish indefinite leave to remain.

Currently, migrants can apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, giving them the right to live, study and work in the UK permanently.

Labour plans to double the period it takes to gain the status from five years to 10, and a consultation was announced in May as part of a package of plans to cut immigration.

Reform said it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas that force migrants - including non-EU nationals who already have the status - to reapply every five years.

Labour says this would force workers who have been contributing to the UK for decades to leave their homes and families.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Reform UK's policy was ""racist"" and ""immoral"" in an interview with the BBC.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves echoed his comments on Monday. She told the BBC people in the UK illegally should ""be sent home"" but it was ""quite a different thing"" to deport those living and working in the UK legally.

""Those policies are racist, and we will call them out,"" she added.

In response, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the Daily Express that Labour ""do not believe in border controls"" and said the prime minister's comments were a ""desperate attack"".

Zia Yusuf, Reform UK policy chief, told BBC Breakfast that people have ""perfectly legitimate concerns about immigration"" and ""are smart enough to know if somebody is voting for a policy that Starmer calls racist, what do you think Starmer thinks of you?""

He added that the UK ""should not fund benefits and welfare for foreign nationals"".

Ministers are keen for migrants to prove they have integrated in the UK if they want the settlement status.

That includes meeting conditions such as making National Insurance contributions, not taking any benefits payments and giving back to their communities.

Labour says some foreign nationals could earn earlier settlement, based on their contribution or skills.

The main theme of Labour's conference is taking the fight to Reform UK, which is leading in UK-wide national opinion polls.

In her speech, Mahmood is also expected to say patriotism ""is turning into something smaller, something more like ethno-nationalism"".

Mahmood will argue that ""fair migration"" and secure borders are integral parts of an ""open, generous, tolerant"" country.

She will tell party members ""you won't always like what I do"".

But she will warn them if the Labour government does not succeed, ""working people will turn away from us"" and ""seek solace in the false promises"" from Nigel Farage's party.

Mahmood will also speak about her parents' experience of arriving in the UK, arguing the acceptance of migrants depends on their contribution to local communities.

She will talk about how she was a victim of shoplifting, when she worked behind the counter of her family's corner shop as a child, and why that has motivated her to crack down on theft.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland filed a joint lawsuit Sunday against Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the deployment of the National Guard to the city.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, calls the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland “heavy-handed” and unlawful.
It also says the move violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from being used for civilian law enforcement.
“Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the lawsuit says.","Officials in Oregon have filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Portland, adding to legal battles against President Trump’s use of troops in major cities.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland filed a joint lawsuit Sunday against Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the deployment of the National Guard to the city.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court, calls the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland “heavy-handed” and unlawful.

The president, in a post on his Truth Social platform Saturday morning, directed Hegseth to “provide all necessary Troops” to deploy to Portland. The move stems from protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the city, with Trump claiming the building was “under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.”

The court filing, though, argued that the protests have involved fewer than 30 people in recent weeks and no arrests have been made since mid-June.

“Defendants’ heavyhanded deployment of troops threatens to escalate tensions and stokes new unrest, meaning more of the Plaintiffs’ law enforcement resources will be spent responding to the predictable consequences of Defendants’ action,” the lawsuit states.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D), appearing at a press conference alongside state Attorney General Dan Rayfield (D) and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson (D), called the deployment “an abuse of power and a disservice to our communities and our service members,” according to KOIN 6 in Portland.

Kotek also marched with residents in downtown Portland on Sunday, saying in a post on social platform X that “we don’t need military intervention here.”

As governor, Kotek controls her state’s National Guard. The lawsuit alleges that Trump does not have the authority to seize control of the Oregon National Guard under Title 10, Section 12406 of the U.S. Code, which gives the president the capacity to federalize state national guards if the country is facing an invasion or rebellion or the president “is unable with the regular forces to execute the law.”

The lawsuit also says Trump’s order violates the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that authority not delegated to the federal government is reserved for states. It also says the move violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from being used for civilian law enforcement.

“Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the lawsuit says. “Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News that the president’s actions were “lawful” and would “make Portland safer.”

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” she said.

This decision is no surprise for those of us who study the 4th Amendment.
Even if the 4th Amendment doesn’t prevent them, can’t race-based discrimination and police violence often be addressed through civil rights lawsuits?
The recent decision virtually declaring that the 4th Amendment allows police to engage in express racial profiling may not be the final word on the matter.
If the 4th Amendment is to retain meaning, it must be interpreted to constrain — not enable — the racialized policing practices that have become routine in America.","Earlier this month, the Supreme Court rendered obsolete the 4th Amendment’s prohibition on suspicionless seizures by the police. When the court stayed the district court’s decision in Noem vs. Vasquez Perdomo, it green-lighted an era of policing in which people can be stopped and seized for little more than how they look, the job they work or the language they speak.

Because the decision was issued on the Supreme Court’s “shadow docket,” the justices’ reasoning is unknown. All we have is Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s solo concurrence defending law enforcement’s use of race and ethnicity as a factor in deciding whom to police, while at the same time playing down the risk that comes with every stop — prolonged detention, wanton violence, wrongful deportation and sometimes even death. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her impassioned dissent (joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson): “We should not live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.” But now, we do.

The practical effect of this decision is enormous. It strips away what little remained of the guardrails that prevented police (including agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement) from indiscriminately seizing anyone with only a flimsy pretext.

Now there is no real limit on police seizures. History teaches us that people of color will bear the brunt of this policing regime, including the millions of immigrants who are already subject to police roundups, sweeps and raids.

This decision is no surprise for those of us who study the 4th Amendment. The police have long needed very little to justify a stop, and racial profiling is not new. Yet prior to the Vasquez Perdomo order in most instances, police had to at least articulate a non-race-based reason to stop someone — even if as minor as driving with a broken taillight, not stopping at a stop sign long enough, or walking away from the police too quickly.

Now, police no longer need race-neutral person-specific suspicion (pretextual or real) to seize someone. Appearing “Latino” — itself an indeterminate descriptor because it is an ethnicity, not defined by shared physical traits — along with speaking Spanish and appearing to work a low-wage job is enough, even if you have done nothing to raise suspicion.

Some might believe that if you have nothing to hide there is no reason to fear a police stop — that if you just show police your papers or offer an explanation you can go on your way. Even if that were the case, this sort of oppressive militarized police state — where anyone can be stopped for any reason — is exactly what the 4th Amendment rejected and was meant to prevent.

Moreover, ICE agents and police are not in the business of carefully examining documents (assuming people have the right ones on them) or listening to explanations. They stop, seize and detain — citizens and noncitizens alike. If lucky, some people are released, but many are not — including citizens suspected of being in the country illegally, or individuals whose only alleged crimes are often minor (and the product of poverty) or living peacefully (often for years) in the United States without legal status. And as evidenced by plaintiffs in this case, even if eventually released, a single stop can mean harassment, violence, detention or a life permanently upended.

Even if the 4th Amendment doesn’t prevent them, can’t race-based discrimination and police violence often be addressed through civil rights lawsuits? U.S. Code Section 1983 allows individuals to sue officials who violate their rights. But the reality plays out differently. In a recent decision, this Supreme Court dramatically limited class-action lawsuits, the primary vehicle that would allow widespread relief. The court has created a world in which law enforcement can largely act with impunity under the doctrine of qualified immunity. And there is likely no recourse if a federal official such as an ICE agent violates one’s constitutional rights, as the Supreme Court has sharply limited the ability to sue federal officials for money damages even if they commit a clear constitutional wrong.

The recent decision virtually declaring that the 4th Amendment allows police to engage in express racial profiling may not be the final word on the matter. We hope it isn’t. But longstanding court doctrine had already allowed racial profiling to flourish under the guise of seemingly neutral language of “reasonable suspicion” and “consent.” By allowing a further erosion of the limits on seizures, the Court entrenches a system in which the scope of one’s constitutional rights depends upon the color of one’s skin.

On August 3, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents detained Santiago, 28, at the airport while she was attempting to catch a flight to Austin. Nearly two months later, she’s still being held in an immigration processing facility in El Paso.

“She’s holding on,” said her brother Jose, who wanted to be identified by his first name only in case of retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. “[But] it’s been over a month, so that takes a toll.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment. However, in statements to other media outlets, DHS cited a past arrest for narcotics and trespassing as a reason to keep Santiago detained. However, she was never prosecuted for that arrest due to “insufficient information.”

On Tuesday, federal Judge Kathleen Cardone extended a restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting or removing Santiago to a different facility. However, she did not rule on her release.

A separate judge already terminated the immigration case against Santiago in early September, ruling that she cannot be deported because she has lawful status through DACA.

Despite an immigration judge dismissing Santiago’s case, the Trump administration has refused to release her. “They’re arguing, even though they can’t support it, that they can detain her indefinitely,” said Bridget Pranzatelli, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, who has worked on Santiago’s case.

More troubling still, the 28-year-old community organizer is set to renew her DACA status in 2026. Pranzatelli raised concerns that she won’t be able to renew if she’s still in government custody, putting her status at risk.

“If they keep her in detention until her renewal period comes up and she is unable to renew,” said Pranzatelli, “then they will have de facto terminated her DACA status without going through the processes that are required by the regulations.”

The consequences of this case could extend far past Santiago. “The government holds this position that they are able to initiate removal proceedings against anyone who is not a citizen of the United States,” said Pranzatelli, “and that during the pendency of those removal proceedings, a person can be detained. … That is just not what the law says.”

Immigration experts told The Intercept that the Trump administration is attempting to end protections for Dreamers without the risk of the public outrage that followed President Donald Trump’s attempt to end the program during his first term.

“It’s obvious that they’re trying to evade a public reaction,” said Diana Pliego, a senior strategist at the National Immigration Law Center. “What they’re trying to do is quietly end it, essentially slashing and killing DACA in front of us, one case at a time, one individual at a time.”

According to a tracker launched by a coalition of immigration organizations, including the National Immigration Law Center and United We Dream, nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained within the last year.

“We’re really concerned,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal policy for the immigrant advocacy organization, United We Dream.

Macedo do Nascimento said that the Trump administration appears to be intentionally going after DACA recipients, who should not ordinarily be targets for deportation.

“There are two cases right now, that we’re aware of, Jean Carlos and [Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira], where ICE showed up to in Paulo’s case, to his mother’s house while he was dropping off his kids, specifically to apprehend him, and then in Jean Carlos’s case, to his own house specifically to detain him,” she said. “So that shows that de-prioritization is not happening anymore.”

They’re trying to “kill DACA by 1,000 cuts,” said Macedo do Nascimento, noting that the administration has been urging Dreamers to “self-deport.”

Santiago’s friends and family told The Intercept that detention has taken a significant toll on her.

“Physically and psychologically, the conditions are extremely dehumanizing,” said Christine Miranda, a close friend and colleague of Santiago’s.

Miranda, who met Santiago a decade ago while working together as organizers, said that Santiago was committed to standing up for her community despite the risks. Now, as she sits in detention, Miranda said that community has shown up to support her, hosting rallies and organizing on behalf of her release.

“She is truly a lifelong community organizer, both at the small scale of connecting with people personally, and the big scale of leading massive actions or rallies or marches,” Miranda said. “She had a lot of personal clarity that fighting for yourself and for others is worth it.”

Santiago’s brother shared similar sentiments. “She was very kind as well, and very compassionate,” said Jose. “That led her to become a community organizer and fight for everyone’s rights, especially the immigrant rights.”

Santiago arrived in the United States when she was only 8 years old from Oaxaca, Mexico. Her brother said it would be “devastating” if his sister were deported. “She’ll be torn away from her community,” he said. “We don’t really have connections in Mexico, so it will be a very harsh reset to life.”

Looking beyond this specific case, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., said the Trump administration could not be allowed to disappear its critics.

“As authoritarians, Trump, Noem, Miller, and the rest of the Administration are abusing their power to silence dissent. Despite the legal protections for DACA recipients and green card holders, we are witnessing the disappearance of community activists, like Catalina Xóchitl Santiago, who are challenging the rise of fascism in our nation,” wrote Ramirez, in a message to The Intercept. “We have to stand up for Dreamers and immigrants and protect our civil and constitutional rights.”

A ruling on whether to release Santiago from detention is expected any day now.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/signal-2025-09-26-143648_72129e.jpeg?fit=1420%2C915&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-09-29 11:58:56.368139

She said she's stopped attending festivals celebrating Latino heritage in Bucks County and avoids large group activities.","The ACLU and other groups have sued to block Bucks County's 287g program, arguing that it gives local law enforcement overly broad federal authority.

The sheriff testified that deputies would only screen criminal defendants and not check the immigration status of victims or witnesses.

Local Latino residents testified that the program has created fear in the immigrant community, causing them to alter their daily routines.

A Bucks County judge is expected to decide next month if the sheriff can implement a controversial program that grants county deputies the power to act as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

Following a second four-hour hearing Friday, Sept. 26, Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey Trauger indicated that he hoped to issue an order before the end of October, ahead of the Nov. 4 general election.

Bucks County Sheriff Fred Harran, a defendant in the lawsuit, is seeking reelection. The Republican incumbent, a retired Bensalem director of public safety, is running against Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler, an attorney and a U.S. Army veteran.

The hearing Friday was a continuation of a Sept. 16 proceeding regarding a lawsuit filed earlier this year seeking to prevent the implementation of the ICE program, known as 287g, which gives local law enforcement agencies authority to enforce immigration law while performing routine duties.

The ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project sued Harran and Bucks County on behalf of immigrant and civil rights organizations. They're seeking a preliminary injunction to halt implementation of 287g until the court decides the lawsuit's merits.

Defendant Bucks County has also filed a cross claim against Harran seeking to nullify the 287g agreement on the grounds that Harran applied for the program without approval from the county commissioners.

The Pennsylvania Sheriffs’ Association, a professional organization, has also filed a claim as an interested party. Bucks County is among 10 county sheriff offices with approved 287g programs, according to the latest federal data.

In a surprise development Friday, Harran’s attorney, Wally Zimolong, produced ICE paperwork that Harran signed July 3. The paperwork appears to limit the scope of powers that Harran and his 16 deputies could exercise under 287g agreement.

These documents were significant because in the earlier hearing Harran testified that he didn't request a modification of the ICE agreement limiting its scope of authority, and that it was unnecessary because he could choose what parts he wanted to follow and ignore the rest.

At the Sept. 16 hearing, Trauger repeatedly urged the parties to reach a compromise limiting the scope of the 287g agreement based on what Harran testified he planned to do, but nothing has materialized.

When Harran was questioned about his previous testimony that he didn't change the agreement, Harran said that he had forgotten about it.

In another new development, Harran testified that ICE recently notified him that the federal government would begin reimbursing local government expenses, including equipment and officer salaries and overtime related to 287g activities.

Previously, the feds only paid for officer training and left local governments responsible for covering all other costs for the program.

Under cross-examination, however, the sheriff said that he would have to apply to seek reimbursement and that this might require approval from county commissioners.

Harran also repeated his assurances that deputies wouldn't be checking the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses or individuals at the Bucks County Justice Centeron civil matters, such as child support or protection from abuse petitions.

But he said they'll screen criminal defendants against names in the ICE database to see if they're wanted for immigration law violations.

Detainer paperwork would be prepared for defendants identified as being in the country undocumented, but the responsibility for issuing the detainer will rest with ICE agents, not deputies, Harran said. If ICE approves a detainer, deputies would transfer the person to a detention facility.

“I know what I’m doing and what I intend to do,” Harran added. “We are not stopping and interviewing, that’s not my job. It’s ICE’s job.”

But what Harran said he'd do under the ICE agreement versus what he's permitted to do under the broad authority of the agreement has surfaced as a recurring central theme in the case before Trauger.

Two Bucks County residents, who are Latino, testified Friday that the looming possibility that county deputies could act as ICE officer has resulted in fear and suspicion within local immigrant communities.

Karen Rodriguez, a member of Make the Road PA, one of the lawsuit plaintiffs, testified that she's changed her behaviors since learning that Harran joined the 287g program, even though she is a U.S. citizen born in Puerto Rico.

She said she's stopped attending festivals celebrating Latino heritage in Bucks County and avoids large group activities.

Rodriguez also testified that she no longer attends a Sunday Spanish-language Mass at a Bristol church fearing that she could be detained in an ICE raid. She added other Latino congregants have stopped attending the Mass.

“The members there have the fear,” she said. “People are terrorized right now.”

Bucks County resident Heidi Roux, a U.S. citizen who was born in El Salvador, testified that she has stopped speaking Spanish in public, and that she is more conscious now about how she dresses.

Recently she also told her son to keep a Spanish language book he's reading at home, fearing it could make him a target for racial profiling.

Roux, the director of immigration justice for The Welcome Project PA, testified that she has received death threats over her vocal opposition for 287g, though she did not report them to local police.

Over the last few months, Roux testified that she met with Harran four times to talk about the 287g program, and to urge him to rescind participation.

Under questioning, Roux described her relationship with Harran as cordial, calling him a “frienenemy."" She also testified that she doesn't believe the sheriff would racially profile her.

“He said I don’t have to worry about it because I look Italian,” Roux said.

But she's less confident about how deputies will interpret the scope of their authority.

“This is not an a la carte menu,” Roux added. “You ordered the whole menu and now you’re only ordering the pancakes.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

During an extraordinary gathering of hundreds of U.S. generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia, tomorrow, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is planning to address the army leaders on military standards and the “warrior ethos,” according to multiple sources. Trump yesterday said he would attend the meeting, saying that “It’s really just a very nice meeting talking about how well we’re doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.” According to a former defense auditing official, the likely cost of the army leaders’ travel to the event is in the millions of dollars. Tara Copp, Ellen Nakashima, Dan Lamothe, Alex Horton, and Noah Robertson report for the Washington Post; Yamiche Alcindor and Alexandra Marquez report for NBC News.

Trump on Friday called for Microsoft to “immediately terminate the employment of” Lisa Monaco, Microsoft’s head of global affairs, alleging without proof that Monaco is a “menace to U.S. National Security.” Monaco served as Deputy Attorney General under the Biden administration.

Tulsi Gabbard’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence last month eliminated the group that writes the Global Trends report. The report, published every four years, outlines the future risks to the United States and the world. The Office said that it found the draft 2025 report to “violate professional analytic tradecraft standards in an effort to propagate a political agenda” and that the group “had neglected to fulfill [its] purpose.” According to former officials, some of the report’s warnings, in particular on climate change, had become politically inconvenient. Julian E. Barnes and Helene Cooper report for the New York Times.

The Energy Department has added “climate change,” green,” “emissions,” and “decarbonization” to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s “list of words to avoid,” according to a Friday email seen by POLITICO.

Amiry’s release comes weeks after the Taliban announced an agreement with the United States on prisoner exchanges. The Taliban continue to hold at least three U.S citizens, a U.S. official told the New York Times. Elian Peltier and Adam Goldman report.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The U.N. Committee Against Torture last week sent a request to Ghana to halt onward deportations of at least five migrants who were recently deported from the United States to Ghana.

Mattathias Schwartz and Chris Cameron report for the New York Times.

Attorney General Palm Bondi announced on Friday that she will send Justice Department agents to ICE facilities to protect immigration officials “to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” Kaanita Iyer reports for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Negotiations over the latest iteration of Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza are “at their final stages,” Trump told Axios yesterday, asserting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “on board” with the plan. In a statement, Hamas said that the group has not received any new ceasefire proposals from mediators, and stressed that negotiations have been suspended since Israel’s failed attempt to kill its leaders in Doha three weeks ago. U.S. officials suggested that Arab and Muslim countries have been in touch with the militant group on the proposal. Barak Ravid reports.

Netanyahu will give Israel’s response to the newest U.S. proposal for a Gaza ceasefire when he meets Trump in the White House later today, according to a senior Israeli official. Other Israeli officials suggest Netanyahu is expected to present reservations to the plan during the meeting and push for changes. Netanyahu yesterday said that the deal has “not been finalized yet.” Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland report for Reuters; Tal Shalev, Oren Liebermann, and Kit Maher report for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The Israeli military has killed at least 18 people across Gaza today and advanced to within a few hundred meters of Gaza City’s Al-Shifa and Al-Helo hospitals, according to medics. The Médecins Sans Frontières medical charity late on Friday said it had been forced to suspend its activities in Gaza City after its clinics were encircled by Israeli forces. Nidal Al-Mughrabi and May Angel report for Reuters; Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas conflict has now surpassed 66,000 deaths, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday. Samy Magdy, Melanie Lidman, and Giovanna Dell’Orto report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The vast majority of officials and diplomats gathered at the U.N. General Assembly Hall on Friday appeared to walk out as Netanyahu took the stage for his address. In his speech, Netanyahu said that Israel would “finish the job” in Gaza, and claimed that the Israeli intelligence services were livestreaming his speech to the phones of people across Gaza. Gaza residents told CNN they had not received any messages or streams related to the speech. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report for Axios; Tal Shalev, Jennifer Hansler, and Oren Liebermann report.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities yesterday with nearly 600 drones and 48 missiles, killing at least four people in the capital. “This vile attack came virtually as the close of U.N. General Assembly this week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday. Marc Santora reports for the New York Times; James Waterhouse and Rachel Muller-Heyndyk report for BBC News.

The United States is considering Zelenskyy’s request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, Vice President JD Vance said yesterday. Tomahawk missiles have a 2,500km range, which would allow Ukraine to strike targets deeper inside Russia. Steve Holland reports for Reuters.

Defense ministers from ten EU countries agreed on Friday to develop a drone wall along their borders with Russia and Ukraine to detect, track and intercept drone incursions into European airspace. “Russia is testing the EU and NATO, and our response must be firm, united and immediate,” EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said. Lorne Cook reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Moldova’s pro-European ruling party won a majority over the Russia-leaning Patriotic Bloc in yesterday’s parliamentary election. “The people of Moldova have spoken […] they chose democracy, reform, and a European future, in the face of pressure and interference from Russia,” President of the European Council Antonio Costa said on social media. Dan Peleschuk reports for Reuters.

Denmark this week banned all civilian drone flights to “simplify security work” for the police ahead of a European Union summit in Copenhagen, the Danish transport minister said yesterday. Nick Thorpe and Tabby Wilson report for BBC News.

Israel has reintroduced its demand for a humanitarian corridor to Syria’s southern province of Sweida in Israel-Syria security talks, four sources told Reuters. A Syrian source said the demand had derailed plans to announce a deal this week. In previous talks in Paris, Syria rejected this same request as a breach of its sovereignty. Maya Gebeily reports.

The Indian government on Friday detained Sonam Wangchuk, the leader of a popular protest movement in Ladakh, accusing him of instigating violent protests that threatened national security. The protests in Ladakh last Wednesday, associated with Wangchuk’s arrest, called for greater governmental autonomy in the region. Anupreeta Das and Hari Kumar report for the New York Times.

IRAN

The U.N. Security Council on Saturday reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, activating the snapback mechanism. While Tehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Friday that Iran had no plans to leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court granted an injunction on Friday, allowing the Trump administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid previously appropriated by Congress. The majority wrote that based on its “preliminary view” of the case’s merits, the plaintiffs did not have a legal right to bring a lawsuit under the relevant federal statutes. The short, unsigned order on the court’s emergency docket was issued over the dissent of three liberal judges. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Oregon and Portland yesterday sued to block Trump from deploying the state’s national guard, arguing that the move amounts to an unconstitutional abuse of power. “Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry”, the lawsuit contends. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to uphold Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. In a pair of petitions, the government lawyers argued that the Constitution’s promise of citizenship was conferred on “freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” Abbie VanSickle reports for the New York Times.

A coalition of 20 state Democratic attorneys general in May filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Trump administration is threatening to withhold billions of dollars of disaster-relief funds unless states agree to certain immigration enforcement actions.

But they argued conditions put forward by the Trump administration requiring them to commit state resources to immigration enforcement put at risk funding for everything from mitigating earthquake and flood risks to managing active wildfires.
For the remaining programs, the government argued that this was a contract dispute that should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims.","A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled on Wednesday that it’s unconstitutional to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get funding for disasters, which is overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A coalition of 20 state Democratic attorneys general in May filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Trump administration is threatening to withhold billions of dollars of disaster-relief funds unless states agree to certain immigration enforcement actions.

In a ruling granting a summary judgment to the plaintiffs and denying one for the federal government, U.S. District Judge William Smith found that the “contested conditions are arbitrary and capricious” and that the actions are unconstitutional because they are “coercive, ambiguous, unrelated to the purpose of the federal grants.”

“Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,” Smith wrote.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the ruling was a “win for the rule of law and reaffirms that the President may not pick and choose which laws he and his Administration obey.”

“Today’s permanent injunction by Judge Smith says, in no uncertain terms, that this Administration may not illegally impose immigration conditions on congressionally allocated federal funding for emergency services like disaster relief and flood mitigation. Case closed,” he said.

In their complaint, states argued that for decades they counted on federal funding to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters. But they argued conditions put forward by the Trump administration requiring them to commit state resources to immigration enforcement put at risk funding for everything from mitigating earthquake and flood risks to managing active wildfires.

The Department of Homeland Security “seek to upend this emergency management system, holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage unless States promise to devote their scarce criminal enforcement resources, and other state agency resources, to the federal government’s own task of civil immigration enforcement beyond what state law allows,” the plaintiffs wrote.

They argued successfully that this not only was unconstitutional but that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

“The conditions are arbitrary and capricious under the APA because DHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation, failed to consider the reliance interests of the states, and departed from longstanding funding practices without adequate justification,” Smith wrote.

The government had argued that the challenge was moot since it had already decided to exclude 12 of the 18 programs from having to comply with the immigration requirements. For the remaining programs, the government argued that this was a contract dispute that should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims.

“Even if that were not so, Congress intended for the FEMA grant programs at issue to address national security and terrorism concerns that rely on the cooperation that the conditions promote,” the government wrote in court documents. “Congress did not preclude the placement of the challenged conditions on the grant programs at issue, and Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to these programs.”

A spokeswoman for DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement Wednesday that the administration believes that “cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding.”

“The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,” she said.

They include at least 107 career Justice Department senior managers in the span of eight months, out of roughly 320 career leadership positions immediately below presidential appointees included in a government directory.
The Justice Department is simultaneously hemorrhaging many more trial attorneys and other career employees.
At the Justice Department, approximately 4,500 employees, largely non-leadership positions, took deferred resignation offers, according to a June budget report.
In some cases, the Justice Department replaced a departing career manager with a political appointee, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.","At least a third of senior career leaders have left the Justice Department since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, taking with them centuries of combined expertise, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis.

The departures, both voluntary and involuntary, represent an unprecedented level of departures in recent memory, former officials said, with the divisions enforcing civil rights, immigration, and environmental laws among the hardest hit.

They include at least 107 career Justice Department senior managers in the span of eight months, out of roughly 320 career leadership positions immediately below presidential appointees included in a government directory.

The loss of so many senior managers, many of whom have spent their entire careers rising through the department’s ranks, could take generations to rebuild. The Justice Department is simultaneously hemorrhaging many more trial attorneys and other career employees.

“You’re talking about an incredible brain drain which doesn’t even take into account all of the other people who have been lost,” said Pamela Hicks, former chief counsel for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who was fired early in Trump’s second term.

Stuart Gerson, who led the Justice Department’s civil division during the George H. W. Bush administration and served as acting attorney general early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, said the departures mean DOJ will “lose both excellence of ability and institutional memory that’s extremely important, both in terms of maintaining credibility in the courts and getting it right.”

The department’s civil rights division, created in 1957 by landmark civil rights legislation to enforce anti-discrimination law, was most impacted. Over 76% of career managers, including members of the Senior Executive Service, departed between the start of the new administration and mid-September, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.

The DOJ division enforcing federal environmental laws has lost over half of its career leaders, the analysis shows.

Political appointees routinely change over when new presidents take office. But it’s “almost unheard of” for career members of the Senior Executive Service to leave the Justice Department because of a change in administration, said Stacey Young, who founded Justice Connection, an organization that supports current and former department attorneys.

“There’s no precedent for this,” said Young, a former DOJ lawyer.

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t return requests for comment.

Refocused Priorities

The exodus comes as the Trump administration has refocused the department on conservative priorities, including surging federal law enforcement resources to major cities and targeting universities for diversity initiatives. It also follows the White House’s January executive order calling to “prioritize accountability” among the Senior Executive Service, who “must serve at the pleasure of the President.”

The high-level turnover tracks what’s happening elsewhere in the department. At the Justice Department, approximately 4,500 employees, largely non-leadership positions, took deferred resignation offers, according to a June budget report.

The administration has also forcibly reassigned or demoted dozens of career managers across the department, prompting many to leave earlier than they’d originally planned. Some longtime career managers were pushed into the so-called sanctuary cities working group, widely viewed as a demotion. The last exiled member of that group left last month.

David McConnell, a veteran career leader who left in February, said departures of this scale are disruptive to the workforce. McConnell retired earlier than he’d planned after he was reassigned to the sanctuary cities group.

“It was certainly destabilizing when I was just suddenly gone when everyone was counting on me being there,” said McConnell, a former director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.

Several senior career leaders who were removed have challenged their terminations. Joseph Tirrell, formerly director of the DOJ’s ethics office, has contested his firing in a Washington federal court, alongside other fired DOJ employees. Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer has lodged a challenge at the federal board that hears civil servant disputes and testified before Congress about her removal.

In some cases, the Justice Department replaced a departing career manager with a political appointee, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.

Impacted Divisions

The losses have been felt most acutely in the civil rights division, where nine sections, including those that specialize in civil rights violations in education, employment, and voting, lost their chiefs. A number of deputy chiefs across the division are also no longer at the department, including some after forced demotions.

The departures follow leadership’s decision to pivot the civil rights division’s work to align with the Trump administration’s ideological priorities and away from its traditional advocacy on behalf of historically marginalized groups.

As career leaders have left, so have the trial attorneys working under them. As of July, DOJ disclosed to a Democratic senator that 368 civil rights division employees, including both attorneys and staff, had left during the second administration.

Mikael Rojas, who served in a political role at the division during the Biden administration, said that political appointees in the division “took a lot of our direction from the career staff” to do their jobs.

“They are the subject matter experts,” Rojas said.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses the immigration courts, saw over 62% of those managers exit since January.

The Justice Department’s tax division has lost more than a third of its career managers under the current administration, while the national security division saw about half depart.

The civil division, whose attorneys have handled much of the litigation against federal policies, has lost at least a quarter of its career managers.

Methodology

The analysis is based on the Office of Personnel Management’s database of leadership-level positions reported under legislation requiring the government to publish a directory of certain executive branch leaders, including Senior Executive Service members and other high-level managers.

Current employment statuses for the individuals listed were verified by reviewing OPM’s information, public LinkedIn posts, news reports, Justice Department webpages, as well as by conducting interviews with current and former employees, as of mid-September. Employees who took the deferred resignation offer, and who are technically on administrative leave through this month, are counted as departures.

OPM relies on individual agencies to report the positions and managers as of June 30, and the directory may omit some career leadership positions that should have been included. The reporting is required under the PLUM Act, passed in late 2022 to increase transparency in government.

The analysis likely represents an undercount as civil servants continue to leave their posts.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/b027bac/2147483647/crop/5000x1927+0+623/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2Fc9%2F2c20cd184c1ba248c1c35b68a166%2F358927359.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:57:55.251166

We continue to monitor developments on the progress of the Bill.","First Constitutional Court judgment

In June 2017, the Court held that sections 34(1)(b) and (d) of the Immigration Act were unconstitutional in that these provisions:

do not require the detainee to be informed of the right to legal representation;

do not require the automatic judicial review of a detention before the expiry of 30 calendar days;

do not allow the detainee to make oral or written representations to the court, or appear in court in person;

do not permit the detainee to make representations to the court on whether the grounds advanced by an immigration officer meet the standard of good and reasonable grounds; and

deny the detainee the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention by appearing in court.

The declaration of invalidity was suspended for a period of 24 months and the Court ordered that pending the correction of the defect within 24 months (by 28 June 2019), any illegal foreigner detained in terms of section 34 of the Immigration Act must be brought before a court in person before the expiry of 48 hours from the time. Since then, this has been the position with foreigners being brought before court.

Second Constitutional Court judgment

In October 2023, the Court supplemented and clarified the order in the First Constitutional Court judgment by allowing a detainee to appear before a court in person when a court is considering whether to extend a detention period beyond 30 days, and by introducing the “interests of justice” criterion as a guideline for immigration officers and courts in the exercising of their discretion under the Immigration Act.

The Court ordered that, pending the enactment of remedial legislation within a period of 12 months, and if remedial legislation is not enacted, the following provisions will apply:

an immigration officer must apply the interests of justice criterion when considering the arrest and detention of an illegal foreigner in terms of section 38(1) of the Immigration Act;

a detained person shall be brought before court within 48 hours from the time of arrest;

the court must apply the interests of justice criterion when the arrested person is brought before it;

the court may authorise the further detention of the person if it concludes that the interests of justice do not permit the person’s release;

if the further detention of the person is ordered, they must again be brought before court prior to the expiry of the authorised detention period, and the court must again apply the interests of justice criterion at that stage;

the court may then again authorise the further detention of the person, but by no more than 90 calendar days, if it concludes that the interests of justice do not permit the person’s release; and

whenever the person concerned is brought before court, they must be given an opportunity to make representations to the court.

""Donald Trump is using federal agents to stoke fear and violate constitutional rights,"" Pritzker said.","United States Border Patrol agents, wearing bulletproof vests and carrying rifles, were observed patrolling in downtown Chicago on Sunday afternoon.

Agents have been patrolling the Chicago River on boats in recent days, and Sunday were seen walking down one of the city’s busiest streets as increased federal intervention continues in the city.

Footage captured at Millennium Park showed agents interacting with four people - two children and two adults - and placing them in the back of a pickup truck. It remains unclear if they were arrested.

The videos of the masked agents sparked intense reactions on social media, including from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who accused the Trump administration of using “provocative” tactics in continuing to deployed armed agents in the city.

“While Chicagoans and visitors are enjoying another gorgeous Sunday, they are being intimidated and threatened by masked federal agents flaunting automatic weapons for no apparent reason,” he said. “This is another brazen provocation from the Trump administration that does nothing to make our city safer. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.""

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker echoed similar concerns following the reports.

“This is not making anybody safer — it’s a show of intimidation, instilling fear in our communities and hurting our businesses,” he said. “We cannot normalize militarizing American cities and suburbs.”

In an exclusive interview with NBC News on Sunday, President Donald Trump called Chicago a “crime-ridden mess,” and indicated that he is still considering sending armed troops into the city of Chicago as part of “Operation: Midway Blitz.”

“Any place where there is big trouble, we want to go and help out,” he said.

Trump also said that his administration sent additional FBI resources to the city earlier this year on an “information gathering mission.” He also claimed credit for reductions in crime, though there is no available data tying reduced crime to the presence of FBI agents.

“We sent the FBI in about six months ago on an information gathering mission and that’s what they’ve done and they’ve done a good job,” he said. “They actually brought down crime a little bit in Chicago. But, you know, that was minor compared to what has to be done. But we sent them in five months ago and we brought it down about 20 percent, 25 percent.”

NBC Chicago reached out to Border Patrol for information about if anyone had been arrested on Sunday, but hadn't received a response as of the late evening.

Agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have arrested hundreds of individuals in the city and suburbs in recent weeks as part of an increased effort to deport more individuals who are in the country without legal status.

Protests at a Broadview facility have garnered national headlines, with multiple arrests made and tear gas deployed against activists at the scene.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Saturday that she is sending more federal troops to ICE facilities around the country, with a strong message to protestors.

""If you so much as touch one of our federal officers, you will go to prison,"" she said.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also issued a statement Saturday addressing the Trump administration's plans to send more federal agents to Chicago and other cities, and the ongoing protests in Broadview.

""Donald Trump is using federal agents to stoke fear and violate constitutional rights,"" Pritzker said. ""It's unlawful and un-American.

(KOIN) — Tensions rose throughout Sunday as hundreds of protesters gathered at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland one day after President Donald Trump formally announced his intent to deploy federal troops to Portland.

As night fell and the crowd thinned, the tension reached a boiling point. Federal agents engaged protesters and apparently took at least one into custody, although that has not been confirmed. One protester apparently punched another protester, then ran to the police for help as he was chased by the crowd. Bike patrol officers separated some from engaging with each other before vacating the block.

By 10 p.m. the crowd had largely dispersed. Only about 60 people remained from the much larger group just an hour earlier. But the Portland police moved in at that point and pushed protesters back and out of the street, apparently arresting at least one person.

By 11 p.m. there were only about 30 people outside the ICE facility. However, someone in the crowd apparently used bear mace near some protesters, causing some to move quickly out of the area. The bear mace was initially believed to be pepper spray.

At one point in the late afternoon, about 300 protesters were on the sidewalks outside the ICE facility on Southwest Macadam.

By 5 p.m. protesters were blocking the streets in front of the ICE building. KOIN 6 News observed some rising tensions and the possible use of pepper spray. Armed uniformed personnel wearing masks were visible on the rooftop of the ICE building looking down to the street filled with people.

Large helicopters, believed to be federally operated, flew overhead for hours.

There were two separate events on Sunday: this one outside the ICE facility, and an earlier event on Portland’s downtown waterfront.

In a Sunday release ahead of the planned events, Portland police said they activated their Incident Command Team. Those resources include Dialogue Liaison Officers (wearing white uniform shirts), Rapid Response Team, Sound Truck, as well as their Air Support Unit.

The downtown waterfront rally organized by the Protect Oregon coalition – which includes the ACLU of Oregon, labor unions and other community organizations – began at the Battleship Waterfront Memorial along Southwest Naito Parkway to drive home the message, “No military takeover of our communities.”

Both Gov. Kotek and Mayor Wilson were among those who marched in this rally.

“This is an abuse of power and a misuse of the military,” said Sandy Chung, Executive Director, ACLU of Oregon. “Oregon is home, not a military target. Violence has no place in our politics or our communities. The military should not come to Oregon.”

Oregon files suit

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson held a joint press conference Sunday to announce new litigation following President Trump’s announcement he would deploy federal troops to Portland.

Rayfield said the request for a temporary restraining order was filed at 2 p.m. Sunday, slightly more than 4 hours after learning Trump invoked Title 10, which allowed him to order the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

Rayfield said the plaintiffs are the State of Oregon and the City of Portland in the request for a temporary restraining order filed in the District Court of Oregon.

“We hope to be in front of a judge within a week,” Rayfield said.

‘Authorizing Full Force’

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he is sending the federal troops to “protect” the city and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities from antifa and other “domestic terrorists.”

The president also said he was “also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” though it was unclear exactly what he meant.

Numerous local leaders at the city, state and federal levels denounced the message, leading to a press conference held by Gov. Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson on the banks of the Willamette River.

It was there Kotek said she spoke with the president Saturday and told him in no uncertain terms that there was no need for federal troops to be sent to Portland.

But she added, “We had no proactive communication from the White House until I reached out.”

Saturday night, dozens of protesters maintained a spot on the sidewalks in front of the ICE facility as large helicopters and drones buzzed the skies over the area.

Before dark, about 100 of the protesters came from the Portland peace team with different religious leaders and families with flowers. They marched peacefully in front of the building on SW Macadam as drones — believed to be operated by authorities inside the ICE building — flew overhead.

It appeared that at least one protester was arrested by ICE agents, but there has been no confirmation of that by officials at this time.

In a Sunday release ahead of the planned events, Portland police said they have activated their Incident Command Team. They say those resources include Dialogue Liaison Officers (wearing white uniform shirts), Rapid Response Team, Sound Truck, as well as their Air Support Unit.

However, PPB noted larger groups of officers may be observed to “make targeted arrests for specific crimes committed.”

“PPB members may also investigate crimes and conduct follow-up investigations into criminal activity later and will forward cases to the Multnomah County District Attorney for prosecution when feasible,” the release added. “As a reminder, just because arrests are not made at the scene, when tensions are high, that does not mean that people are not being charged with crimes later.”

Festeryga, No. 23-20337, 2025 WL 2621301 (5th Cir. Sept. 11, 2025), the plaintiff law firm sued its former associate attorney in Texas state court and sought a TRO and expedited discovery.

In an effort to stave off the discovery, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss (and did agree to a limited document production). He never set the motion to dismiss for hearing, and he then removed the action to federal court. The district court remanded the case, finding that filing the state court motion to dismiss prior to removal waived the right to remove the case to federal court.

The Fifth Circuit decision followed the case's prior en banc decision in Abraham Watkins Nichols Agosto Aziz & Stogner v. Festeryga, 138 F.4th 252 (5th Cir. 2025), reversing In re Weaver, 610 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir. 1980), which had prohibited appeal of waiver-based remand orders. On return from the court's en banc decision, the Fifth Circuit panel found:

No one disputes that [the defendant] removed within the 30-day statutory window. Yet the district court held that by filing a TCPA motion in state court and securing its automatic stay of discovery, he ""reflect[ed] an intent to invoke the jurisdiction of the state court.""

....

Waiver, in our circuit, is no casual affair. A defendant's intent to remain in state court must be ""be clear and unequivocal,"" and ""the right of removal is not lost by action in the state court short of proceeding to an adjudication on the merits."" In practical terms, waiver occurs only when a defendant has ""invok[ed] the jurisdiction of the state court in resolving the issues presented by the original complaint."" Anything less—mere procedural skirmishing—does not suffice.

....

This case illustrates why. [The defendant's] TCPA motion—while potentially dispositive—could not be decided without a hearing, and it was his responsibility to set one. He never did. Filing a motion that sits idle is not the same as ""submitt[ing] the cause to adjudication on the merits."" Other circuits agree: a dispositive motion, unaccompanied by a hearing or ruling, does not trigger waiver—particularly when, as with the TCPA, the motion carries collateral procedural effects (like staying discovery, expediting proceedings, or shifting burdens) apart from any merits decision. Defendants may have sound tactical reasons to file such a motion without any intent to seek a merits ruling. The district court therefore erred in treating Festeryga's filing, standing alone, as ""clear and unequivocal"" waiver.

Festeryga, 2025 WL 2621301 at *3 (footnotes omitted).

Festeryga makes clear that one can add waiver-based remand orders to the very small category of remand orders that may be appealed in the Fifth Circuit.

Francisco Garduño, who remained in his position as head of the National Immigration Institute until April, was ordered by a judge to make the public apology, among other steps, during a temporary suspension in his prosecution for failing in his responsibility to protect those in his custody.

There were “human rights violations that never should have happened” due to “omissions by personnel of the (National Immigration Institute),” Garduño said at an event in Mexico City.

He called for “those responsible” to be punished and for reparations to be made without recognizing his own responsibility in the tragedy.

In addition to the 40 killed, more than two dozen people were injured. Most of the victims were from Central America and Venezuela.

Two Venezuelan migrants have been charged with homicide for starting the fire.

Dozens of victims’ relatives were present, including some who wept when their loved one’s names were read, along with representatives of the immigration agency and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

Two migrants allegedly started a fire on March 27, 2023, inside the Ciudad Juarez detention center to protest conditions. Security cameras inside the facility showed smoke quickly filling the cell holding several dozen male migrants, but no one with keys attempted to release them.

In January, the judge in Garduño’s case gave him 18 months to take several steps that could lead to the closure of his case. Several of his subordinates face charges including homicide.

Lawyers representing the victims and their families, worried Garduño will escape prison time, have challenged the suspension of his trial but accepted the idea of a public apology because it was the first time they would face the former official in person.

On Friday, some victims and relatives were allowed to address Garduño.

Claudia Araceli Varela, a relative of one of the victims from El Salvador, said she wanted those responsible held accountable, not pardoned. She told Garduño his apology was “forced” and chastised him for not using his authority to order the cell door opened when the fire started.

“I feel angry, rage, they’re making him do it, he doesn’t do it from his heart, so it’s not worth it,” said Wilson Alexander Juárez, a 23-year-old Guatemalan scarred by burns on his body, who watched from the front row while gripping a walker.

Juárez wanted to be present because it was the first time he saw Garduño up close, he said.

“He’s never showed his face,” Juárez said.

Marcos Zavala, a lawyer with the Foundation for Justice, one of the organizations representing the victims, said Garduño’s public apology “doesn’t end anything.”

Prior to taking over the National Immigration Institute, Garduño had run Mexico’s prison system. When U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on imports unless Mexico did more to control migration, then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador put Garduño in charge.

There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients.","Congressional Republicans are waiting on President Trump to signal he is ready to negotiate a permanent solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Over the last decade, DACA has received varying degrees of support from Republican lawmakers. The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.

As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and Democrats are raising concern that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the immigrant rights group Home is Here. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.

""I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job,"" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year introduced a bill that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. ""President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater.""

Salazar's bill has received bipartisan support. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.

Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.

""The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many,"" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. ""America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies.""

The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress

In 2017, 34 Republicans signed onto a letter urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that ""reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do.""

But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's first attempt to repeal the program failed. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.

""Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""Congress always tries to kick the can down the street.""

During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that ""no one is prioritizing DACA"" for enforcement.

On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.

""The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary,"" Chishti said. ""As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate.""

House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal

Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.

""I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record,"" Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. ""That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it.""

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus members earlier this month to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.

""I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country,"" he said. ""So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way.""

Separately, earlier this year the caucus sent a letter to the White House requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.

Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.

""The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation,"" Schulte said.

Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.

""If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything,"" Graham said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to legalization for DACA, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.

""I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here,"" Tillis said.

Sen. John Cornyn, who, in the past spoke strongly about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.

""These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon,"" Cornyn said. ""Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon.""

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

President Trump has vowed to conduct a mass deportation of everyone who's in the country without legal status. But there are a few groups of people who live in a gray area, including DACA recipients. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is supposed to protect people from immigration enforcement, but several DACA recipients have been arrested and detained. NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi.

RASCOE: So the DACA program was created in 2012. Where does it stand today?

BUSTILLO: The program was created to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation. But DACA is not an immediate path to citizenship or even a green card. Participants instead have to renew their protection every two years. They can also be removed from the program and lose protections if they commit crimes. Currently, about half a million people are on DACA, and now many of them are in their 30s and 40s. It provides a work permit and can be adjusted if a person leaves the U.S. and comes back with a visa or marries a U.S. citizen, among other options to adjust status. And since it was created, there has been no successful effort to provide a pathway to legal status for those who are on the program. Plus, the president had already tried to repeal DACA in his first term, and he failed to do so.

RASCOE: Since President Trump couldn't get DACA repealed then, how is he approaching the program in his second term?

BUSTILLO: So far, no regulatory changes have been made to formally end the program, but parts of Trump's administration have made moves to strip benefits. For example, the Health and Human Services Department said in June DACA recipients would no longer be eligible to buy insurance through the federal health care marketplace. Then, in July, the Education Department launched an investigation into five universities that offer financial help directly to DACA recipients. And as the Homeland Security Department has increased the rates of arrests, there have been reports of DACA recipients being caught up in worksite raids and even deportations. At one point, I asked DHS about this, and they told me that DACA did not confer legal status and that those without legal status are encouraged to self-deport. Now, that's a very strong message that deviates from the first public statement Trump made after he won the election last year.

RASCOE: So what did he say then?

BUSTILLO: At the time, Trump said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. Now, both Republicans and Democrats have hung on to that statement made in December as a sign that someday Trump may say he's ready to come to that negotiating table, though there has since been nearly no discussion on the issue. And instead, the focus is still on deportations.

RASCOE: DACA could be addressed not just by the president, but particularly by Congress. What can Congress do?

BUSTILLO: Right. Ultimately, any permanent solution has to come from Congress, but the coalition that cares about this issue is a little bit fractured right now. I spoke with several GOP senators and representatives that have all previously supported finding a pathway for DACA recipients. And Senate Democrats have been increasingly vocal about the urgency to find a solution because arrests are happening. Still, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and there was the consensus that nothing would happen this year. There are simply other concerns at the top of lawmakers' minds, like keeping the government from shutting down, for example. And they also said that they were waiting for the president himself to say that it's time to broker a deal. There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients. But there isn't a sense that they will move anytime soon, even as Trump's deportation efforts only grow.

RASCOE: That's NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much for joining us.

BUSTILLO: Thanks, Ayesha.

The suit was announced by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield within hours of Gov.
Tina Kotek receiving a memo from Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which he authorized the troop deployment for 60 days.
“Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,” Rayfield said in a statement.
Mayor Wilson condemned the arrival of National Guard troops.","The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit Sunday to block President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy 200 National Guard troops to Portland.

The suit was announced by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield within hours of Gov. Tina Kotek receiving a memo from Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which he authorized the troop deployment for 60 days.

According to the order seen by Fox News Digital, the federally controlled Oregon National Guard would be stationed in Portland to protect federal property “where protests are occurring or likely to occur.”

Kotek, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, and Rayfield, all Democrats, responded by jointly filing the challenge in federal court, arguing the administration’s move is “unlawful” and unnecessary.

“Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,” Rayfield said in a statement.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had directed Hegseth to send “all necessary Troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any other ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists.”

Kotek also said Saturday she had spoken directly with the president before Sunday’s order and had urged him not to send in troops.

“Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media,” Kotek told reporters at a news conference at Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

“There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city,” she added.

Despite those objections, federal agents began arriving in Portland over the weekend, with one clash already reported outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

Mayor Wilson condemned the arrival of National Guard troops.

“We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., urged demonstrators to avoid confrontations with federal agents. “Their goal is to create an engagement that will lead to conflict,” he said.

The lawsuit follows a similar case filed by California in June, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.

“This will only serve to divide us as a nation and community under the guise of caring about public safety,” Rayfield said. “The number of necessary troops is zero.”

“As standing policy, the Department does not comment on active litigation. We have no comment on this nor the Oregon ARNG deployment at this time,” a Department of War spokesperson told Fox News Digital.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/112390388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-29 00:56:32.790781

Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of national injunctions, it has yet to address the order's constitutionality.
The Impact of Ending Birthright Citizenship Trump's initiative to end birthright citizenship has sparked a vigorous legal battle since he signed the executive order during his second term.
Simultaneously, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) initiated an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.","President Donald Trump has called upon the Supreme Court to uphold his executive order that seeks to terminate automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants residing in the United States unlawfully or temporarily. This development, reported by the Associated Press on Saturday, marks the beginning of a legal process that could lead to a final decision by mid-2026.

On the first day of his second term, Trump signed a decree that challenges more than a century of the 14th Amendment's interpretation, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil, with exceptions like children of foreign diplomats. Up until now, federal courts across various states have blocked the enforcement of this measure, arguing that it infringes upon the Constitution.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of a nationwide injunction, while a federal judge in New Hampshire issued a similar ruling as part of a class-action lawsuit. In the appeal, Solicitor General D. John Sauer contended that judicial decisions have nullified ""a policy of utmost significance to the president and his administration,"" granting ""without legal justification, the privilege of citizenship to hundreds of thousands of unqualified individuals.""

Legal Challenges Against Trump's Executive Order

Immigrant rights organizations have labeled Trump's attempt as unconstitutional. Cody Wofsy, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated, ""This executive order is illegal, period, and no maneuver will change that reality."" Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of national injunctions, it has yet to address the order's constitutionality.

Nearly all courts reviewing the matter have agreed that it violates or is likely to violate the 14th Amendment, which was established after the Civil War to ensure citizenship for African Americans freed from slavery. Trump's administration's appeal encompasses two ongoing cases. A potential hearing before the Supreme Court justices could take place between this winter and next spring, but a decision on whether to accept the case will take several months.

The Impact of Ending Birthright Citizenship

Trump's initiative to end birthright citizenship has sparked a vigorous legal battle since he signed the executive order during his second term. The measure aims to radically alter the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, historically guaranteeing this right to all born within U.S. territory, save for exceptions like diplomats' offspring.

The order immediately met with lawsuits from civil rights groups and various states, resulting in judicial suspensions across different courts. Amidst the litigation, the legal battle escalated through federal channels, yielding conflicting rulings regarding the order's validity. While some judges questioned the decree's constitutionality, others allowed parts of the government's plan to proceed.

This uncertainty led to an unprecedented cascade of legal and administrative procedures, impacting immigrant families and state agencies responsible for civil registration. Simultaneously, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) initiated an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.

A leaked document, scrutinized by experts, suggests establishing criteria to exclude children of immigrants in irregular or temporary situations. Although its implementation hinges on the Supreme Court's final ruling, the draft indicates an intention to apply new eligibility standards retroactively, potentially affecting thousands of previously issued birth certificates.",https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1759098286-trump-pide-corte-suprema-eliminar-ciudadania-nacimiento-hijos-inmigrantes.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 23:56:31.047101

WHAT STARTED THE INVESTIGATION AND THE BIG QUESTION STILL UNANSWERED DAYS AFTER HIS DETAINMENT. WILL MAP OUT THE DISTRICT’S NEXT MOVES AND HOW ROBERTS ARREST COULD SHAPE CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLICY, BOTH AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL IN THE YEARS TO COME. THIS IS IOWA’S NEWS LEADER. THIS IS KCCI EIGHT NEWS CLOSE UP. GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR JOINING US FOR KCCI EIGHT NEWS CLOSE UP. I’M CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER AMANDA ROOKER. IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR THE DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT. ITS SUPERINTENDENT, DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS, HAS BEEN DETAINED BY FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. AND IT’S NEWS THAT’S SHOCKING. AND IT HAS BEEN JARRING FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND ALL ACROSS THE STATE. ROBERTS IS NOW IN THE WOODBURY COUNTY JAIL UP IN NORTHWESTERN IOWA. HE WAS ARRESTED FRIDAY AFTER A TRAFFIC STOP. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND HAD NO WORK AUTHORIZATION. THE AGENCY SAYS HE INITIALLY FLED LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUT WAS LATER FOUND WITH A LOADED GUN, A KNIFE AND A LARGE SUM OF CASH. HIS ARREST HAS SPARKED PROTESTS, BOTH HERE IN DES MOINES AND AT THE JAIL WHERE ROBERTS IS BEING HELD. NO ICE, NO FEAR. IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE. MEANTIME, DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SAY THEY’RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY THE BEST WAY THEY CAN. THE ACCUSATIONS ICE HAS MADE AGAINST DOCTOR ROBERTS ARE VERY SERIOUS, AND WE ARE TAKING THEM VERY SERIOUSLY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR TODAY, WE STILL DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE FACTS. YESTERDAY, THE DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD VOTED TO PLACE ROBERTS ON PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. IN A MOMENT, WE’LL TALK WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR. BUT FIRST, HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW. ROBERTS HAS BEEN WITH THE DISTRICT SINCE JULY OF 2023. THE DISTRICT SERVES ABOUT 35,000 STUDENTS. ICE SAYS AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE ISSUED A DEPORTATION ORDER IN MAY 2020 FOR DMP. DMPS SAYS THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT ORDER. HIS MOST RECENT CONTRACT, SIGNED IN MAY, SHOWS THAT ROBERTS MAKES $286,000 A YEAR. SCHOOL LEADERS SAY DISTRICT RECORDS INDICATED THAT ROBERTS IS A US CITIZEN. ROBERTS DID PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK THROUGH THE FIRM. BAKER EUBANKS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE DISTRICT SAYS HE PASSED ANOTHER CHECK WHEN HE APPLIED FOR HIS ADMINISTRATOR LICENSE WITH THE IOWA BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL EXAMINERS. THAT WAS GRANTED IN 2023. KCCI HAS ALSO LEARNED THAT ROBERTS IS BEING REPRESENTED BY THE PARISH LAW FIRM. WE ASKED HIS ATTORNEY TO CONFIRM WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS DES MOINES SUPERINTENDENT IN 2023. THE LAW FIRM DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER, SAYING IT’S STILL GATHERING THE FACTS. THESE PAST 48 HOURS HAVE BEEN A WHIRLWIND FOR EVERYONE WHO KNOWS, THE DES MOINES SUPERINTENDENT. HE WAS VERY TIED IN AND WELL RESPECTED IN THE COMMUNITY, KCCI KAYLA JAMES TELLS US ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STOP THAT STARTED IT ALL DURING A, QUOTE, TARGETED ENFORCEMENT OPERATION ON FRIDAY IS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS ICE AGENTS APPROACHED DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS IN HIS VEHICLE SHORTLY AFTER, THE DEPARTMENT SAYS ROBERTS SPED OFF AND LATER ABANDONED HIS VEHICLE NEAR A WOODED AREA. INSIDE THE VEHICLE, ICE REPORTS WERE A LOADED GUN, $3,000 IN CASH AND A HUNTING KNIFE. I WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT THAT SAME MORNING. PEOPLE LIVING IN AND AROUND EWING TRACE TRAILER PARK SAY THEY SAW ICE AGENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE IOWA STATE PATROL IN THE AREA. KCCI WAS THE ONLY MEDIA OUTLET THERE. AS LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS SWARMED THE AREA. I’M SEEING STATE TROOPERS AT THIS POINT AND THEY’RE, YOU KNOW, COMING OUT, GUNS DRAWN AND STUFF LIKE, WHAT IN THE WORLD? YEAH. SO I WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT. WHILE KCCI CREWS DID SEE DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS SAFETY OFFICERS AROUND THE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTIGATION HAVE NOT YET SHARED WITH US. IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AT EWING TRACE TRAILER PARK WAS CONNECTED TO ROBERTS DETAINMENT. ROBERTS WAS FOUND AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. I WAS ON MY WAY TO MEET HIM UP AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR AN EVENT, A FUN RUN WITH STUDENTS AT WINDSOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS WHERE PHIL RADER, DMPS DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, SAYS HE AND ROBERTS WERE SET TO MEET FRIDAY MORNING, BUT THEN HE RECEIVED A TEXT A LITTLE BEFORE NINE, SIMPLY SAYING THAT SOMETHING CAME UP. HE HAD AN EMERGENCY. HE WASN’T GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. AND THEN 45 MINUTES LATER, RADER SAYS HE RECEIVED A FACETIME CALL FROM ROBERTS PHONE DOCTOR. ROBERTS WAS INTERESTED, AS HE ALWAYS IS, YOU KNOW, WAS READY FOR THE WORKDAY. CLEARLY. BUT WAS SURROUNDED BY 3 OR 4 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, AND HE APPEARED TO BE CUFFED AT THE TIME HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS HIS BACK, RADER SAYS. EVERYTHING ON THE SUBMITTED I-9 FORM INDICATED ROBERTS WAS A CITIZEN. THE DISTRICT SAYS ROBERTS UNDERWENT A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK THROUGH BAKER EUBANKS, THE FIRM TELLS KCCI IT PERFORMED THE BACKGROUND SCREENING IN APRIL OF 2023, BUT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE I-9 OR WORK ELIGIBILITY SERVICES. ROBERTS REMAINS AT THE WOODBURY COUNTY JAIL IN NORTHWEST IOWA. DES MOINES BASED PARRISH LAW FIRM IS REPRESENTING HIM IN DES MOINES. KAYLA JAMES, KCCI EIGHT NEWS IOWA’S NEWS LEADER. GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS SAYS ROBERTS ARREST WAS SHOCKING, PARTICULARLY HIS ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO EVADE AUTHORITIES. BUT SHE SAYS, QUOTE, WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS THAT MUST BE ENFORCED. I’M JOINED NOW BY DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR JACKIE NORRIS. JACKIE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION. IT’S ONE THAT HAS CREATED A LOT OF EMOTION IN OUR COMMUNITY, OUR STATE, EVEN OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE’S A LOT OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. AND SO WE WANT TO GET OUR VIEWERS THE MOST CLARITY WE CAN. THIS MORNING. DHS SAYS THAT WHEN DOCTOR ROBERTS WAS ARRESTED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE WORK AUTHORIZATION AND THAT HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY WHEN THE DISTRICT HIRED ROBERTS IN 2023. WAS IT THE DISTRICT’S IMPRESSION THAT HE DID HAVE WORK AUTHORIZATION, AND WHAT WAS HIS IMMIGRATION STATUS AT THAT TIME? THIS IS ALL NEW INFORMATION, AND WE ARE SEEKING THE FACTS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS. WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS HIRED, I WAS NOT BOARD CHAIR, BUT WE RETAINED A SEARCH FIRM. DID THE BACKGROUND CHECK, JUST LIKE THE STATE OF IOWA AND GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL EXAMINERS DID THEIR LICENSE CHECK. AND SO WE FOLLOWED ALL OF THE PROPER PROCEDURES. AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO UNFOLD, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THERE’S NOT LEGITIMACY AROUND THAT RIGHT NOW. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING, YOU KNOW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW WERE THERE NO RED FLAGS THAT POPPED UP? IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY YOU WANT TO SAY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS? THERE WERE NO RED FLAGS. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS WORKED IN MULTIPLE STATES, THAT HAS SERVED ON BOARDS, THAT HAS BEEN A SUPERINTENDENT BEFORE. AND SO WE FOLLOWED ALL OF THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS. AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FACTS. AND THE FACTS ARE WHAT WE ANTICIPATE. DOCTOR ROBERTS ATTORNEY IS GOING TO OBTAIN WHEN HE IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THEM FROM THE DETENTION FACILITY IN ICE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE GOING FORWARD IN HOW THE DISTRICT VETS EMPLOYEES? THERE IS NOT BECAUSE WE FOLLOWED THE PROCESS, IS THERE IS THERE POTENTIAL DISCREPANCIES, THOUGH, IN WHAT THAT PROCESS BRINGS UP? I MEAN, IS THERE MORE POTENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE TO DO ON THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BACKGROUND CHECKS OR COORDINATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? I THINK THIS IS SPARKING A FAR BROADER CONVERSATION THAN JUST DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND I THINK IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT, BECAUSE CITIZENSHIP IS CLEARLY SO COMPLEX. AND SO THE THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE WATCHING THIS, WE’VE GOT 30,000 STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO RETURN THROUGH OUR DOORS ON MONDAY. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT AS THE CITIZENSHIP PROCESS WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH, WE ALSO HAVE TO ASSURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. AND SO TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO AS WE’RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT, YES, THE CITIZENSHIP PROCESS. WE NEED INFORMATION. RIGHT. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. SO WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY. JUST LIKE I’M SURE YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND THE STATE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. BECAUSE WE BOTH ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALSO HAVE TO ALLOW WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND LEAD OUR DISTRICT. RIGHT. AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE PREPARED TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM ON MONDAY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MONDAY, BUT FIRST, JUST ONE OTHER THING. I THINK BECAUSE THE TIMELINE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE, HE WAS HIRED IN 2023. IT WASN’T UNTIL 2024 THAT AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE GAVE HIM THAT DEPORTATION ORDER, THOUGH THE DISTRICT HAS SAID IT WAS NOT NOTIFIED ABOUT THAT DEPORTATION ORDER. IS THERE AN AGENCY THAT’S SUPPOSED TO REACH OUT AND NOTIFY? I MEAN, JUST HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I MEAN, WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED. WE FOUND OUT ON FRIDAY, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID. AND SO AGAIN, BROADER CONVERSATION, I THINK A CONVERSATION FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW IT CHOOSES TO NOTIFY PEOPLE AND IF THEY NOTIFY EMPLOYERS. WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED. NOW, YOU KNOW, AS YOU’VE BROUGHT UP, OUR STUDENTS ARE WATCHING, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY. STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE RETURNING TO CLASSES ON MONDAY. WHAT DO PARENTS AND STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW? YEAH. SO I’M SO PROUD OF OUR INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT, MATT SMITH, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HIM, WE DIRECTED THAT COMMUNICATION. REGULAR COMMUNICATION GOES TO PARENTS, GOES TO STAFF. HE’S CONVENED THE STAFF ALREADY. AND THE MESSAGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT PARENTS ARE COMFORTABLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILD ABOUT THIS AND THAT TEACHERS ARE TOO. AND AND LOOK, I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THROUGH THE LENS OF CHILDREN, THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT THEY SAW IN THEIR CLASSROOMS THAT WAS SPARKING ENERGETIC CONVERSATIONS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DOCTOR ROBERTS IS A HUMAN BEING. AND AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES IN THE CITIZENSHIP STATUS THAT WE ARE NAVIGATING THROUGH. YEAH, WE KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WALKOUTS PLANNED IN DMPS HIGH SCHOOLS. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE DISTRICT TO HANDLE POTENTIAL PROTESTS AS THEY POP UP THIS WEEK? YEAH, SO THE STAFF HAS HAD THAT CONVERSATION AND IT’S IMPORTANT TO BALANCE, RIGHT, CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING AND ALSO FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND SO I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN THE STAFF’S ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THOSE TWO THINGS. AND THEY’RE PREPARED TO TO DO SO. NOW, I KNOW IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, DURING PRESS CONFERENCES AND THINGS, YOU NOTICED THE NOTE, ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DOCTOR ROBERTS HAS MADE IN HIS MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF LEADERSHIP IN THE DISTRICT. WE HAD HIM ON CLOSE UP RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT THE REIMAGINING EDUCATION BOND REFERENDUM. THERE’S A $265 MILLION BOND REFERENDUM THAT WILL GO BEFORE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. HE WAS, YOU KNOW, A BIG PART OF SPEARHEADING THAT. WHERE DOES THAT STAND RIGHT NOW? YEAH, I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT REIMAGINING EDUCATION WAS ACTUALLY CATALYZED BY A BIG BOARD VISION TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EDUCATION. AND OUR COMMUNITY INFORMED THAT OUR TEACHERS, INFORMED THAT OUR STAFF AND STUDENTS INFORMED THAT. AND SO OUR JOB IS TO TAKE THIS BIG VISION AND CONTINUE TO MOVE IT FORWARD. AND SO WE MOVE FORWARD AS PLANNED. WE ASSURE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE A PLAN. WE ARE EXCELLENT STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND OUR KIDS NEED IT. THIS IS ABOUT OUR KIDS. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN. I DID JUST REMEMBER I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND AND DMPS POLICY. I KNOW DHS SAYS THAT THEY DID FIND A LOADED WEAPON IN A DISTRICT VEHICLE THAT WAS IN DOCTOR ROBERTS POSSESSION. WHAT IS DMPS SCHOOL POLICY ON? IS THERE EVER A TIME OR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A WEAPON WOULD BE ALLOWED IN A DISTRICT VEHICLE? YOU KNOW, WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE SAFE. AS WELL. BUT THE ANSWER IS GUNS DO NOT BELONG IN STUDENT IN SCHOOL, PROPERTY, RIGHT? IN SCHOOL VEHICLES, SCHOOL VEHICLES. AND THEN VERY QUICKLY, I KNOW YOU’RE HERE IN YOUR CAPACITY AS SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR. YOU ARE ALSO RUNNING FOR US SENATE. THERE’S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS MAY IMPACT YOUR CAMPAIGN. WHERE DOES YOUR CAMPAIGN STAND RIGHT NOW? RIGHT NOW I’M FOCUSED ON DOING MY VOLUNTEER JOB, AND THAT IS CHAIR OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND I’M SO PROUD TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT. JACKIE NORRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. OKAY. THANK YOU. STILL TO COME ON CLOSE UP, DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS ARREST HAS NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS. WE TALK WITH CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN ABOUT HIS CALL FOR MORE ANSWERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELANDECURITY. OF PEOPLE RALLIED IN DOWNTOWN DES MOINES AFTER DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS WAS DETAINED. SUPPORTERS CARRIED SIGNS DENOUNCING ICE AND PRAISING ROBERTS, SAYING HIS WORK WITH STUDENTS MAKES HIM WORTH FIGHTING FOR. TEACHERS, PARENTS AND KIDS WHO WERE THERE TOLD KCCI THAT THEY WANT LAWMAKERS TO KNOW THAT THEY OPPOSE ISIS ACTIONS IN IOWA. NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HEATED REACTION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS, AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN REPRESENTS IOWA’S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, WHICH INCLUDES DES MOINES. HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CALLING FOR CLARITY AFTER ROBERT’S SHOCKING ARREST. REPRESENTATIVE NUNN JOINS US THIS MORNING. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. AMANA, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO JOIN THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK, FIRST AND FOREMOST, IOWANS DESERVE TO HAVE FACTS IN THIS CASE. AND IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO GET AFTER THE ROOT CAUSES THAT ESTABLISH THIS. THERE’S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE KNOW. THERE WAS CLEARLY A COLOSSAL FAILURE THAT ALLOWED SOMEONE WHO DIDN’T HAVE A LEGAL IMMIGRATION STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES TO BE HERE LEADING ONE OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY. IT ALSO IS CHALLENGING THAT IN THIS CASE, THE INDIVIDUAL DIDN’T EVER TELL, THE SCHOOL BOARD, DIDN’T TELL THE STATE, AND DIDN’T TELL THE COMMUNITY IN A POSITION OF TRUST WHAT HAD HAPPENED. WE KNOW THAT THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES NEEDS REFORM. IT’S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I’VE LED ON. I’M PROUD THAT FOR 800 IOWANS IN THE THIRD DISTRICT, THEY’VE COME THEM THROUGH A VERY ARDUOUS IMMIGRATION PROCESS. WE’VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THOSE FOLKS. THIS IS A CASE WHERE SOMEONE INTENTIONALLY WITHHELD INFORMATION AND A BIDEN ERA REMOVAL ORDER FROM 2024 ENDED UP BEING A SITUATION WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE NOW BEEN LEFT WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THIS LACK OF INFORMATION. SO HOLDING EVERYONE FROM THE STATE IS DOING NOW, UP TO ICE AGENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING CLEAR INFORMATION, IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO, BOTH IN OUR ROLE IN OVERSIGHT, BUT IN HOLDING TRANSPARENCY SO THAT IOWANS KNOW THE TRUTH AND THAT WE DON’T HAVE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. RIGHT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE ARE RECORDS, COURT DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS ON. I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE REQUESTED ALL THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ROBERTS IMMIGRATION STATUS. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW THE TIMELINE ON WHEN HE ENTERED THE COUNTRY AND HIS CITIZENSHIP STATUS REMAINS UNCLEAR, HIS CITIZENSHIP STATUS WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS SHOULD ICE HAVE RELEASED THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT MADE ITS INITIAL PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT ROBERTS ARREST? WELL, THIS IS WHY WE IMMEDIATELY MOVED FORWARD WITH AN OFFICIAL OVERSIGHT INQUIRY INTO ICE ON HOW THIS HAPPENED. I EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO OUR COMMUNITY, BOTH WHEN HE CAME IN, IF THERE WAS A PREVIOUS GUN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN 2020, AS WELL AS WHEN WAS THAT FINAL EXECUTION ORDER TO SAY HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY? IT WAS CLEAR THAT UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY FELT THAT HIS APPEAL, NEARLY A 25 YEAR PROCESS, HAD EXPIRED, AND HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE. AT WHAT POINT DID HE KNOW THAT? AND WHY DID HE FAIL TO TELL OUR COMMUNITY THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY? IS THERE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR DHS TO HAVE NOTIFIED THE DISTRICT THAT A DEPORTATION ORDER WAS GIVEN IN 2024? WHETHER THERE’S A LEGAL REQUIREMENT OR NOT, THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE DOING THIS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I THINK IS VERY CHALLENGING AS WE GO FORWARD RIGHT NOW, IF ICE IS GOING TO BE OPERATING IN OUR COMMUNITY CANDIDLY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. NOW, THAT ALSO MEANS UPHOLDING THE LAW. IT DOESN’T MEAN THAT YOU GET TO HIDE BEHIND THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO NOT TELL YOUR EMPLOYER, TO TELL YOUR COMMUNITY THAT YOU’VE BEEN OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN A NON LEGAL STATUS. SO WE’LL BE HOLDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS. AND I THINK, CANDIDLY, IOWANS ACROSS THE BOARD ON EITHER SIDE WANT TO KNOW THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SOMETHING WE SUPPORT, IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TRUST. TRANSPARENCY IS THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. AND MAKING SURE THAT ICE IS PROVIDING THOSE DOCUMENTS IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO, AS WELL AS WORK WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS PROVIDING. I THINK THE KEY QUESTION HERE, WHERE WAS THIS I-9 THAT IDENTIFIED WHETHER HE WAS A US CITIZEN OR NOT? HOW DID HE HAVE A WEAPON IF HE WAS NOT A US CITIZEN? AND WHY DID HE RUN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BEGIN WITH? THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE. ALSO, ON THAT VERIFICATION PROCESS ON THE I-9, ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK, THE DISTRICT SAYS, YOU KNOW, THEY DID A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK AND THAT HE PASSED IT. THEY SAID THAT WHEN WHEN HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS, THERE WERE NO RED FLAGS THAT POPPED UP TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT A US CITIZEN, WHICH I THINK HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERING ACROSS OUR STATE, POTENTIALLY ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. ARE THERE GAPS IN THE VETTING PROCESS? IS THERE ANYTHING ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT THIS SITUATION ISN’T HAPPENING IN OTHER PLACES? YEAH, AND I THINK YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HERE. LOOK, IF THE THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION HERE COMMITTED PERJURY AND LIED ON THE I-9, IF THERE WAS FRAUD COMMITTED, THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER. WE KNOW THIS. 10 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAME IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY AND HAVE A PATHWAY AREN’T BEING SUBVERTED BY RESOURCES GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT ON PEOPLE WHO KNOWINGLY SHOULD NOT BE HERE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS LEVEL OF FOLLOW UP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT WE’RE USING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE WE’RE HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AT THE EMPLOYER LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYEE LEVEL. I WANT TO HAVE A PATHWAY THAT WE ARE ALREADY WORKING ON, AND I’M MEETING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS TO SAY WE’VE GOT TO HAVE A BETTER IMMIGRATION SYSTEM NOW THAT WE ARE SECURING OUR BORDER, NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS IN OUR NATION’S HISTORY. LET’S GET TO A PATHWAY WHERE WE’RE PROVIDING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME HERE CANDIDLY, PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY A CLEAN PATHWAY TO DO THIS. SO THIS TYPE OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE ISN’T SOMETHING THAT TRIPS SOMEONE UP AND WORSE, ISN’T THE TYPE OF THING THAT ALLOWS AN ILLEGAL TO STAY IN OUR COUNTRY AND POTENTIALLY BE A HARM AGAIN. AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR. THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS THAT’S RIGHT. HOWEVER, I MEAN, DOCTOR ROBERTS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS WELL RESPECTED IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS, I THINK, HAS SHOCKED THE COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PROFILE NATURE OF THIS DETAINMENT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO THE OVERALL PATTERN OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY RIGHT NOW? WELL, LET’S NOT BE UNSYMPATHETIC HERE. I MEAN, I THINK YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I’VE WORKED WITH DOCTOR ROBERTS, BUT I’VE ALSO WORKED WITH A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE TRYING TO COME HERE THE RIGHT WAY. EACH OF THEM HAVE VERY POWERFUL STORIES OF WHAT THEY WANT TO BRING TO OUR COMMUNITY. BUT I KNOW THIS WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW, WHEN YOU RUN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE TRUE ARE THAT HE WAS NOT HERE LEGALLY, THAT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE, AND THAT HE DIDN’T TELL OUR COMMUNITY THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT. AND THAT IS BOTH HEARTBREAKING. BUT IT’S ALSO A REALITY THAT WE CAN’T ALLOW THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR TO BE REWARDED WHILE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COME HERE THE RIGHT WAY AND ARE NOT BEING TREATED THE SAME WAY. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO WITH THE PASSAGE OF REAL BORDER SECURITY HERE IS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL PATHWAYS AND LOOK TO BUILD A LEGAL PATHWAY FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO CONTINUE TO COME AND EXPAND. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE SORRY TO STOP YOU THERE, BUT WE’VE GOT TO GO TO BREAK. CLOSE UP. WE’LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS FOR WATCHING. STAY WITH US. LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL ARE SCRAMBLING TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. THIS IS A LIVE LOOK FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS MORNING. AND WE’RE JOINED THIS MORNING BY CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. NOW, THE LAST THAT I HEARD, HOUSE MEMBERS HAD NOT BEEN CALLED BACK TO CAPITOL HILL AT ANY POINT BEFORE TUESDAY AT MIDNIGHT. IF THERE ISN’T A DEAL BY THEN, THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN. IS THAT STILL? THERE’S NO PLAN TO BE BACK TO D.C. BEFORE THEN. YEAH, AMANDA, WE DID OUR JOB. WE PASSED A BUDGET, AND WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE NEXT RESOLUTION HERE. AS WE CONTINUE TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS, IT WENT TO THE SENATE, THE SENATE REPUBLICANS WERE UNABLE TO PASS THEIR VERSION. THEY TOOK UP THE DEMOCRAT VERSION. THE SENATE DEMOCRATS WERE UNABLE TO PASS THEIR VERSION. AND CANDIDLY, THE SENATE NEEDS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND HERE’S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE LITERALLY 3 MILLION IOWANS WHO ARE DEPENDING ON A GOVERNMENT THAT FUNCTIONS THAT THEIR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY. WE’VE GOT 15,000 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, NEARLY 2000 OF WHICH ARE DEPLOYED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. THOSE FOLKS LOSE THEIR PAYCHECK. IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN’T BE FUNDED. THERE’S 240,000 IOWANS WHO NEED SNAP, WHO WILL NOT GET THAT. IF DEMOCRATS CANNOT WORK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD A FUNDING BILL JUST TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT LIGHTS ON. LOOK, WHEN I WAS IN REPUBLICAN MY FIRST TERM, I FOUGHT TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN. WHEN JOE BIDEN WANTED TO BE THERE. WE’RE DOING IT NOW, AND WE EXPECT THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME. CONGRESSMAN, THAT’S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. YEAH. LET’S KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN. WE’LL CLOSE UP. WE’LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS BREAK. STAY WITH US. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR KCCI EIGHT NEWS. CLOSE UP. WE’LL SEE YOU BACK HERE NEXT SUNDAY. HAVE A GREAT DAY.

At least 200 National Guard members will be deployed to the city to ""protect federal property"" where protests are ""occurring or likely to occur"", according to a memo sent by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday.

Trump on Saturday said he had authorised the use of ""full force"" if needed to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centres.

Oregon has responded by suing the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of the National Guard to Portland is ""unlawful"".

The lawsuit, filed on Sunday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, called the move ""provocative and arbitrary"", and said it ""threatens to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry"".

The deployment marks a further expansion of troop deployments in US cities, amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on illegal immigration.

Trump claimed it would help protect ""any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"", characterising the city as ""War ravaged"" in a Truth Social post.

Democratic lawmakers in Oregon have pushed back, rejecting Trump's assertion that Portland needed federal intervention.

""There is no national security threat in Portland. Our communities are safe and calm,"" said Oregon Governor Tina Kotek on Saturday.

Trump promised retribution - how far will he go?

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland has been targeted by protesters since early June, sometimes leading to violent clashes.

As of 8 September, the US Attorney's Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest.

The DHS said on Friday that demonstrators had ""repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing centre"" in Portland.

The department stated that several individuals had been arrested and charged with federal offences in a post on social media.

""Rose City Antifa, a recently designated domestic terrorist organisation, illegally doxed ICE officers,"" it wrote.

""They published their home address online and on public flyers. Individuals associated with Antifa also sent death threats to DHS personnel.""

Rose City Antifa has said it was not responsible for the flyers.

Inside Chicago's split communities as Trump vows to deploy troops

Trump's use of National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal, judge rules

Earlier this week, Trump signed an order formally designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation.

Antifa, short for ""anti-fascist"", is a loosely organised movement of primarily far-left activists.

Legal experts have pointed out that there is no legal mechanism in the US that would formally establish any group as a domestic terror organisation. Such efforts, they said, could face constitutional challenges under the First Amendment, which protects free speech and assembly.

Democratic lawmakers have criticised both the president's rhetoric and the reported actions of ICE agents in the state.

Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday that there were ""credible"" reports that federal agents ""may be replaying the 2020 playbook"" - a reference to federal forces being deployed in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody.

""I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump's attempt to incite violence,"" Wyden said.

Local lawmakers have also accused ICE of going after people who are not an actual danger to society.

""ICE has said they're targeting people for arrest and detainment who have committed crimes. That's what they told us. But that's not what we are seeing,"" said Democratic house representative Suzanne Bonamici.

Lawmakers cited recent incidents, including the detention of a father outside his child's preschool and a wildland firefighter who was arrested while battling fires in the Olympic National Forest.

They also pointed to a statistic published by the Cato Institute, a US think tank based in Washington DC, which reported that 65% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f730/live/021eaaf0-9c01-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 00:56:29.914357

Already, he has been held for over 100 days in five different facilities, and I risk losing him from the country as you read this article.

My father is a prominent Atlanta journalist who runs his own, independent Spanish media outlet, MG News, where he livestreams major Georgia news.

In detention, my father has not always been safe.

Unfortunately, his coverage of law enforcement and ICE raids caught up to him at a “No Kings” protest over the summer. Local police arrested him while he was recording law enforcement alongside other journalists. Since then, prosecutors have dropped criminal charges related to his coverage of the protest and we have tried to pay bond multiple times. Regardless, for over 100 days, he’s been detained by ICE.

In the past week, the Board of Immigration Appeals has reopened my dad’s 13-year-old immigration case, which had been settled. And in an order we received Tuesday night, the BIA ordered my father be removed, asserting that his previous voluntary departure order was dissolved without bond payment.

This simply isn’t the case.

In 2012, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted my father voluntary departure, meaning he could leave the country on his own within 60 days on the basis of paying bond. Though he paid, he appealed to the board and landed on an agreement with the government that he could stay with work authorization, which my father had until the BIA reopened his case last week. He had never been issued a final removal order until Tuesday.

My father’s vocation is journalism. He is a storyteller, a truth-seeker, a man who believed — and still believes — that people deserve to know what’s happening in their communities, in their governments, and in the world around them. He is neither a threat nor a criminal.

As my father has been transferred from facility to facility, my siblings and I have tried to follow him wherever he goes. He has been transferred five times in total, from DeKalb County now to Folkston ICE Processing Center, nearly five hours away from us. We would make the drive anywhere and any day.

Without him here, I feel like part of me is missing.

In detention, my father has not always been safe. He was placed in solitary confinement. Known for his journalism, even by others inside, he has had inmates take photos of him and threaten to hurt him should my family not pay $60 a day. What else could we do? We paid.

Since then, I have stepped up at MG News and overseen the team in his absence. But we run the risk of bankruptcy, and it hasn’t been easy, as I rely on my father.

In 2021, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor and suffered a stroke during a related surgery. My dad has been the person who kept me going during recovery. He drove me to my medical appointments, helped me manage my care and, most importantly, lifted me up when I felt like giving in to the pain. Without him here, I feel like part of me is missing. His absence has made my recovery harder, and my life emptier.

My mother, who has always been so strong, cannot sleep at night without him. My sister tries to stay brave, but I see her break down crying when she thinks no one is watching. My little brother, who is only 14, doesn’t talk about it, but I know how deeply it hurts him to go through high school without his dad by his side.

I do my best to support them, but I am still sick myself; my pain is frequently overwhelming. My dad has always held our family together. I feel like we are adrift without him, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot fill the space he left behind. I need my dad home — not only for my health, but for our family’s survival.

But I can’t give up hope. My father does not deserve to be in detention, separated from his family. This fight is not over. I will continue to fight for my father, for his freedom, and the freedom of all those who ask the hard questions, who tell the stories some people would rather keep hidden, who hold power to account.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250926-mario-guevara-se-551p-81c414.jpg",N,,2025-09-28 23:56:22.788909

The information was reported this Saturday by the Associated Press (AP), which explained that the appeal filed by the Department of Justice kicks off a process that could lead to a final decision from the judges by mid-2026.

The decree, signed by Trump on his first day of the second term, challenges over a century of interpretation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, with exceptions such as the children of foreign diplomats.

So far, federal courts in different states have blocked the implementation of the measure, considering that it violates the Constitution.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco determined that a nationwide pause was necessary, and a federal judge in New Hampshire issued another ruling in the same vein within a class action lawsuit.

In the submitted brief, Attorney General D. John Sauer argued that judicial decisions have invalidated ""a policy of utmost importance to the president and his administration"" and that they grant ""without legal justification, the privilege of citizenship to hundreds of thousands of unqualified individuals.""

Immigrant rights organizations called Trump's attempt unconstitutional.

Cody Wofsy, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that “this executive order is illegal, period, and there is no maneuver that can change that reality.”

Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of nationwide judicial suspensions, it has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of this order.

Almost all the courts that have reviewed it have agreed that it violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, designed after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship to African Americans freed from slavery.

The appeal by the Trump administration encompasses two ongoing cases.

A possible hearing before the Supreme Court judges could take place between next winter and spring, but the decision to accept or reject the case will take several more months.

The intention to eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States has sparked an intense legal battle since President Donald Trump signed the executive order during his second term.

The measure proposes a radical change in the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically guaranteed this right to all individuals born on U.S. soil, except for some exceptions such as the children of diplomats.

The order was met with immediate demands from civil rights organizations and several states, which successfully obtained court injunctions in various courts.

In the midst of the litigation, the legal battle escalated to various federal levels, with conflicting rulings on the validity of the order.

While some judges questioned the constitutionality of the decree, others allowed certain parts of the government's plan to proceed.

The uncertainty generated an unprecedented cascade of legal and administrative procedures, affecting both immigrant families and state agencies responsible for civil registration.

Meanwhile, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has began implementing an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.

The document, leaked to the media and analyzed by experts, proposes establishing criteria that exclude children of immigrants in irregular or temporary situations.

Although its implementation depends on the final ruling of the Supreme Court, the draft reveals the intention to retroactively apply new eligibility standards, which could affect thousands of previously issued birth certificates.

Protests outside the Broadview ICE facility have been happening for several days.

Protesters rally against immigration enforcement

Meanwhile, the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, a grassroots organization dedicated to fighting the Trump administration's policies and actions in Chicago and beyond, organized events in the city on Sunday.

Even before Sunday's show of force downtown, dozens of people came out across the city's North and Northwest sides for what is being called a day of action.

""We think it's important that we show the majority of us are opposed to what Trump is doing. We're opposed to ICE. We're opposed to the militarization of our cities,"" said protester Geri Kahn.

Protesters, many of them members of Indivisible Chicago, fanned out from Irving Park and Lake Shore Drive in Buena Park to Welles Park in North Center, taking heart from the support of passing motorists.

""We want to make a big statement that the American people, the majority of the American people, are not with the Trump administration,"" said protester John Bachtell.

In Humboldt Park, people also came out, but there, their purpose was different. Their eyes were firmly focused on getting people to the ballot box.

""Our actions for today are writing postcards to voters in Virginia to remind them to get out and vote because they have a really important Supreme Court election coming up,"" said Kristen Vandawalker with Indivisible Chicago Northwest.

It is an effort to encourage political action from those who might feel their impact, in what is already a blue state, is limited.

""Sometimes people feel like they can only take so much action or have so much impact within the state so it's good to have, hey there is something really important happening in Pennsylvania we can help with or Virginia or whatever,"" said Jessica Jorsch with Indivisible Chicago Northwest.

Sunday's actions are all a prelude to what is expected to be a large-scale No Kings protest coming up three weeks from now on Saturday, Oct. 18 in Grant Park.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17899998_092825-wls-maher-ice-ops-5p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-28 19:56:37.914068

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose deportation saga has captured headlines across the U.S., has been moved to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. The transfer, confirmed by his attorneys in a recent court filing, marks a new chapter in a case fraught with legal, logistical, and humanitarian challenges.

Abrego Garcia’s journey through the American immigration system has been anything but straightforward. Previously held at the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia, the Maryland-based father has faced mounting obstacles while preparing his defense against charges in a high-profile human smuggling case. According to the status update filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, his lawyers argued that detaining him in Virginia created “substantial burdens” for their Nashville-based team—making trial preparation arduous and slow.

Access to Counsel Remains in Question

The decision to relocate Abrego Garcia was presented as a move to ease those logistical hurdles. An official from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reportedly assured that the Pennsylvania facility would grant his legal team better access. Yet, as his attorneys pointed out, travel from New York to Pennsylvania is hardly a trivial undertaking, raising doubts about whether the transfer truly improves the defense team’s ability to meet with their client. “It is not appreciably easier for New York-based members of his defense team to travel to Pennsylvania, either,” the status update noted.

His lawyers communicated to the court that they would provide further updates once they could better assess Abrego Garcia’s access to counsel and his ability to prepare for trial at Moshannon. This uncertainty underscores a recurring theme in complex immigration cases: the tension between administrative convenience and the constitutional right to a fair defense.

Humanitarian Concerns at Moshannon Valley

Beyond the legal intricacies, the humanitarian conditions at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center have come under sharp scrutiny. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys raised alarms about his safety following reports of a detainee’s suicide by hanging just last month. They also cited ongoing issues, including assaults among detainees, poor medical care, and inadequate food provisions.

Such concerns are not isolated. According to Reuters, advocacy groups have repeatedly flagged deficiencies in privately-run detention centers, warning that systemic neglect can endanger the well-being of those held inside. For Abrego Garcia, these fears are compounded by his history: he was previously held for months in a notorious Salvadoran prison after the U.S. admitted to wrongly deporting him, a fact that adds layers of complexity to his current predicament.

Official Statements and Public Perception

When asked for comment, ICE deferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a statement provided to abc27 News, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’s assistant secretary for public affairs, described Abrego Garcia as “a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” stressing that he would not be allowed to “terrorize American citizens.”

Notably, Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime. His attorneys have pushed back against the characterization, highlighting that the United States itself acknowledged wrongful deportation in his case. These starkly contrasting narratives—official condemnation versus legal advocacy—reflect a broader debate in American immigration policy, where labels and allegations can often overshadow due process.

As the case unfolds, the spotlight remains on the fundamental question: can Abrego Garcia receive a fair trial amid shifting venues, logistical barriers, and fraught public discourse?

Looking Ahead: Legal Updates and Advocacy

For now, Abrego Garcia’s defense team is focused on monitoring his access to legal counsel at the Moshannon Valley facility. In their most recent update, they refrained from filing a motion regarding difficulties at the previous detention center, signaling that their next steps depend on how conditions develop in Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, advocacy organizations continue to call for greater transparency and oversight in detention practices, warning that cases like Abrego Garcia’s exemplify the risks inherent in a system driven by administrative expedience and political rhetoric. The outcome of his trial—and the process leading up to it—will likely serve as a touchstone for broader debates on immigration reform and detainee rights in the United States.

The transfer of Kilmar Abrego Garcia highlights the precarious balance between administrative efficiency and the imperatives of justice. As legal teams grapple with access issues and safety concerns, the case serves as a reminder that behind every headline are human lives shaped by the decisions of powerful institutions.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tmp9hfj364n.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 18:57:18.429556

“We must come together to live our city’s shared values of freedom from fear and sanctuary from federal overreach in the days ahead, no matter what our city may face,” Mayor Keith Wilson said in a letter to the city council on January 21.

In the past eight months, the city has reaffirmed that commitment by joining a lawsuit against the Trump administration and issuing a zoning violation notice for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer.

On Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memorandum announcing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard would be “called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days.”

The City of Portland and the State of Oregon then filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration had overreached its mandate in federalizing the Oregon National Guard in response to unrest.

Most of the protests outside the ICE facility, about 2 miles south of downtown, have been peaceful, but occasionally have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days in the summer.

President Donald Trump on Saturday followed through on his pledge to make the city a target of his next National Guard deployment, saying in a social media post he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “provide all necessary troops” to Portland, a city he described as “war ravaged,” to protect ICE facilities he claimed are “under siege” by Antifa and “other domestic terrorists.”

In the lawsuit, lawyers for the state and the city said the move breached the principles of the US Constitution and risked stoking new unrest.

“Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry,” their court filing alleges. “Defendants’ deployment of troops to Oregon is patently unlawful.”

The filing names Trump, Hegseth, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and their departments as defendants.

The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard in the state illegal and permanently prevent such action being taken by the Department of Defense again.

However, the White House said Trump’s use of the National Guard would make Portland safer.

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to CNN Sunday.

Trump has previously said, without evidence, that “paid terrorists” are wreaking havoc in Portland.

Last week, Trump refocused attention on Antifa – the loosely organized group of leftists and anarchists who are known for anonymity and destructive masked demonstrations – designating it as a “major terrorist organization.” The White House emphasized incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the United States to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.

Here is what we know about what is ahead for the city famous for loud protests and liberal politics as its standoff with federal immigration officials gets more tense.

Being a ‘proud’ sanctuary city could put federal funds in jeopardy

In spite of the president’s ire, Portland has doubled down on sanctuary city status, making it the first thing you see on its official website. Now the city council is moving toward an ordinance that would make it legally binding, prohibiting any Portland government organization from assisting in federal immigration enforcement, except for providing information that is already available to the general public.

The decision could be a costly one for Portland. The administration announced it would withhold a variety of federal grants – including FEMA funding, highway grants and airport improvements – from cities it classified as “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including some cities that don’t use that term. For Portland, that puts $350 million in jeopardy.

Portland joined 15 other local governments in a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration earlier this year, and a judge blocked the government from freezing those funds. But the administration is appealing, denying that they are cutting federal funding “in an indiscriminate or wholesale manner.”

Alongside Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, sanctuary cities have been the biggest direct targets of Trump’s second term, with three different executive orders specifically mentioning them and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to make a list of them.

In response, Louisville, Kentucky, dropped its policy refusing to hold immigration suspects in its local jail for ICE, with the mayor acknowledging that “millions of dollars in federal grants were at stake.”

From Portland, the message has been much different.

“As a proud sanctuary city in a sanctuary state,” Mayor Wilson said, “we are committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all who live here, working together to strengthen our community.”

Portland first called itself a sanctuary city nearly a decade ago with a nonbinding resolution saying the Portland Police Bureau “shall not cooperate with ICE except as expressly required by Federal Law.” This week, the city council discussed taking things further by making its sanctuary status permanent.

“I think that when we are facing such an extreme level of federal overreach … then we do have a responsibility to act boldly in ways that we haven’t had to act before,” said council member Angelita Morillo during a committee meeting Tuesday. “These are unprecedented times, and we have to do unprecedented things.”

None of the members of the public who testified at the meeting spoke against the proposal, which does not yet have a final vote scheduled.

ICE facility is the target of both protests and legal challenges

The story of protests against the ICE facility on Macadam Avenue is most starkly told through photos taken there over the past two years.

As the months wear on, you see an ordinary-looking tan brick and stucco building in an industrial area is gradually swallowed by increasing layers of fencing, its lower-level windows suddenly blocked by plywood, a concrete retaining wall covered in anti-ICE graffiti.

Protester Deidra Watts told The Associated Press earlier this month that she feels ICE’s actions against immigrants are cruel and require a loud response.

“In the face of that, there has to be people who will stand up and make it known that that’s not gonna fly, that that’s not something the people agree with,” Watts said.

In the summer, protesters blocking the processing facility caused it to be closed for several days, CNN affiliate KATU reported, something the Trump administration blamed on “anarchists and rioters.”

But the building has become a magnet for a wide variety of protesters, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported, with daytime demonstrators mostly coming from religious organizations, quietly holding signs and monitoring the movement of migrants in and out of the building until the mantle is picked up by rowdier protesters at night.

While protesters have tried to shut down the building physically, the city government is trying to do it by other means.

So far this year, federal prosecutors have charged 27 people with federal charges for activity outside the facility, said Jessica Biggers, a spokesperson for the US Attorney for the District of Oregon. Most of the charges are for assaulting a federal law enforcement officer or failing to obey a lawful order, the district attorney’s office said in press releases.

Portland sent a notice to the building’s private owners last week, saying ICE has committed code violations by boarding up windows and keeping some detainees in the holding facility for longer than 12 hours.

“Federal records show that ICE violated its land use conditions of approval 25 times in 10 months,” the notice states.

The building used by ICE is owned by a family partnership whose beneficiaries are not listed publicly. An attorney for that partnership did not return requests for comment on the zoning violation notice.

Morillo, the council member, acknowledges it’s questionable whether the city could force the ICE facility to close, even if the legal violations aren’t addressed. And her proposal to add extra fees on buildings used for federal detention raised concerns from another council member.

“If we start to begin to cherry pick on who and how the federal government gets to rent places, that’s concerning to me,” said council member Loretta Smith.

The Trump administration says shutting down the processing facility, where undocumented migrants have to periodically check in with immigration officials, would actually make things harder on immigrants.

“If the city allows further separation of families by forcing ICE to operate processing elsewhere, that is on them,” ICE said in a statement to CNN affiliate KATU. “Lending no hand to ICE in the name of ‘sanctuary,’ means also lending haven for criminals that has proven to be a great risk to public safety and national security.”

Destructive protests of 5 years ago still on leaders’ minds

While city leaders have been largely supportive of the right to protest outside the ICE facility, they have also made it clear they do not want a repeat of the city’s most notorious demonstrations in 2020.

The murder of George Floyd in May of that year touched off protests – frequently violent – in major cities around the country, but the demonstrations in Portland continued for more than 100 consecutive nights.

Through that summer, a grim routine developed where peaceful marches would devolve into vandalism and threats against police officers. The Portland Police Bureau would declare a riot and order protesters to disperse, eventually responding physically against protesters. There were more than 6,000 uses of force by police during that period, according to city records.

In what turned out to be a foreshadowing of rhetoric that would get even hotter in his second term, Trump in July 2020 called Portland a “beehive of terrorists” and deployed the National Guard to protect federal buildings downtown.

Locally, the response was more complicated, with police frequently criticized for their use of force and tear gas. Eventually then-Mayor Ted Wheeler – who also served as the commissioner of police – banned the bureau’s use of CS gas, but a study later found so much gas had been deployed on a single night in June across 18 downtown blocks prior to the ban that it became a public health danger.

In 2022, the Biden administration’s Justice Department criticized the Portland Police Bureau, saying it didn’t do enough to review its procedures and see if its use of force was warranted.

Ultimately, most of the people arrested – including some accused of rioting – were released without charge after Multnomah County’s District Attorney’s Office announced in August 2020 it was declining to prosecute cases against protesters who did not use force, steal or damage property.

“If we leverage the full force of the criminal justice system on individuals who are peacefully protesting and demanding to be heard, we will cause irreparable harm to them individually and to our society,” former DA Mike Schmidt said at the time.

While hundreds of people who were arrested went free without charge during that turbulent year, prosecutors are now pointing to those past protests in a warning to people who hope to send a message about ICE.

“Let’s not kid ourselves,” Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez said in June. “In the past, the voices of tens of thousands of peaceful protestors have been drowned out. Their message was hijacked by a small number of individuals with a message of vandalism, destruction and violence.”

And local officials have made it clear that, regardless of any concerns about more flare-ups in the tense standoff between ICE and protesters, they don’t want the Trump administration’s help.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/sipausa-62273384.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-28 20:57:12.946967

The other reminder of the Hyundai raid is the inverse — that in a system that utilizes minorities as scapegoats for the nation’s problems, anyone can be next.
Today it’s Hispanic migrants, but who knows if this raid will be the last on Asian American communities.
Asian Americans ought to care just as much about Hispanic communities facing immigration raids as our own.","When I first heard about the immigration raid on a Hyundai factory in Georgia, which led to the arrest and deportation of some 300 Koreans, I was shocked. I’d always empathized with the plight of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., but I seemed to have forgotten that this group includes Asian Americans.

In fact, I later learned that as of 2015, there were around 230,000 undocumented South Koreans in the U.S. — the eighth highest number of any country. It has since fallen below the top 10, so exact figures are not published, but the number almost certainly remains significant.

I should know that immigration issues affect the Korean community. My grandmother has been trying for years to get back into the U.S. to visit her son and grandkids without success. But the arrest of these Koreans shocked me and other Asian Americans I know because systemic racism has conditioned us to think of primarily Hispanic people as “illegal.” There is data to back this up — a 2019 study found that immigrants from Mexico and Central America were significantly more likely to be perceived as “illegal” than their Asian and European counterparts.

The response to this raid highlights a troubling trend with recent border politics: the racialization of “illegality.” The extent to which Hispanic immigrants are dehumanized in political discourse is evident in our reaction to news like the Hyundai raid — when suddenly we remember that what we are doing to one group of people could happen to our own communities, too. The fact that we only start caring when we are scared for ourselves is the root of the problem.

This is what a system which necessitates dehumanization does. You can’t tear a mother away from her baby without dehumanizing both. And in the U.S., racism is the lubricant for systemic dehumanization.

Recently, this implicit pattern has been codified by the Supreme Court, which ruled that racial profiling is acceptable grounds for immigration stops. Now, legally, simply being Latino is suspicious. Speaking Spanish is suspicious. Hanging out outside Home Depot is suspicious. After we’ve come so far in calling out and addressing profiling of and police violence against Black Americans, this state-sponsored discrimination feels like a step decades back.

The other reminder of the Hyundai raid is the inverse — that in a system that utilizes minorities as scapegoats for the nation’s problems, anyone can be next. Today it’s Hispanic migrants, but who knows if this raid will be the last on Asian American communities. Scapegoats only work because we are trained to believe one group of people is “not like us,” when in reality, they are us. Asian Americans ought to care just as much about Hispanic communities facing immigration raids as our own.

Luckily for Koreans, South Korea remains a major ally and economic partner in Asia, and Seoul’s energetic condemnation of the raid seems to have given their citizens at least a modicum of protection. A senior U.S. diplomat to Korea expressed regret over the raid and the treatment of the Korean workers, and even Donald Trump toned down his rhetoric following the backlash. Many Latin American countries, however, don’t seem to have the same leverage to protect their citizens from having their rights stripped away.

This disparity in treatment highlights the ways in which global inequality is felt even within the borders of the U.S., where we enjoy first-world privilege. Ultimately, calling a human born elsewhere illegal is to say that they do not deserve the same privileges we enjoy on a daily basis. That they do not deserve to raise their families as our neighbors, to pursue what is left of the American dream. And to say that someone does not deserve these human rights is to call them less than human.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/2fef2888-d713-49b1-a981-85a519d7bd21.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-28 17:56:43.243707

Ayala-Uribe was pronounced dead at 2:32 a.m. on Sept. 22. He had been referred to the hospital the previous day to evaluate an abscess on his buttock and was scheduled for surgery. ICE reported that he was also hypertensive and displayed abnormal tachycardia. The cause of death remains under investigation by DHS.

Ayala-Uribe came to the U.S. as a young child and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protection in 2012. His renewal request was denied in 2016 following a DUI conviction. He was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Aug. 17 during an enforcement action at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for 15 years, and was transferred to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center on Aug. 22 for immigration proceedings.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto, Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening, and he was escorted to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair. However, about an hour and a half later, medical staff cleared him to return to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, as reported by the L.A. Times.

Family members told the Times that ICE provided limited information as his health declined. “He was telling them that he was sick, he wasn’t feeling well. He’s tried asking for help, but they wouldn’t really do anything,” said his younger brother, Jose Ayala. A fellow detainee reportedly contacted the family late Sunday to report that Ismael was shaking severely and had finally been sent to the infirmary, and officials then informed the family of his death the following morning.

Ayala-Uribe’s death is the 14th reported in federal immigration custody so far in 2025, the L.A. Times reported. Advocates have highlighted concerns about medical care and staffing at Adelanto, one of California’s largest ICE detention centers, which is operated by the private firm GEO Group.

Some current and former staff members told the Times that an influx of detainees and inexperienced hires may have contributed to inadequate medical response.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice called for an independent investigation, stating that “no one should profit from immigrant incarceration, and no family should endure loss due to neglect.” ICE and the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that all detainees have access to comprehensive medical care and 24-hour emergency services.

Ayala-Uribe’s family plans to hold a press conference with their immigration attorney on Tuesday, Sept. 30, at 1:00 p.m. in Downtown Los Angeles to discuss the circumstances of his death.

Congress should review the pertinent documents, the FBI’s audiotape and bring Homan in for under-oath questioning.","A restaurant takeout bag with $50,000 inside. A former (and future) government official. Allegations of a Department of Justice cover-up. It sounds like a Matt Damon movie, but it’s just another day in 2025.

The Justice Department has halted the investigation of border czar Tom Homan, who MSNBC reported was caught on tape last September accepting a cash payment from FBI agents posing as businessmen seeking government contracts. But that won’t end the matter — nor should it.

Americans deserve to know whether Homan, who styles himself an aggressively by-the-book cop unwilling to look past any immigrant’s slightest infraction, is guilty of soliciting bribes. That’s especially important now, when Homan is poised to oversee a massive expansion of immigration enforcement funding. Homan has denied wrongdoing, but he has not specifically denied taking the money in the sting operation conducted last September.

At the time of the alleged incident, Homan was a private citizen leading a consulting firm. Homan, who had occupied prominent roles at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in President Barack Obama’s administration and in the first Trump administration, reportedly told the undercover agents that he expected to play a key role in a second Trump administration and could steer border-related government contracts their way. That is according to internal documents reviewed by the MSNBC reporters who broke the story, and multiple figures they interviewed.

The administration has tried to characterize the exchange as entrapment — a weaponized operation designed by a Democratic administration to ensnare one of President Donald Trump’s most trusted advisers on immigration.

But Homan was not the initial target of the FBI’s investigation. He only came into it when agents were alerted to his alleged solicitation of bribes. And the agency was led at the time by Christopher Wray, a Republican whom Trump appointed in his first term. (Wray resigned under pressure from the White House in January and was replaced by Kash Patel on Feb. 20.) Once Homan allegedly took the bribe, there arose an obligation to investigate further. That obligation remains.

House and Senate Democrats are opening separate inquiries, and they are right to do so. Those inquiries should, by all rights, be bipartisan. Congress is charged with oversight of the executive branch. Republicans, however, remain supine, unable to muster the backbone for their most basic check-and-balance duties. They are taking their cues from the White House, which has been vigorous in decrying the reports and the investigation.

News of the FBI’s decision to bury the probe — for “no credible evidence” according to an FBI statement — broke as Trump was claiming credit for firing U.S. Attorney Eric Siebert for failing to find enough evidence to charge one of Trump’s sworn enemies, New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Trump also recently demanded in a social media post that Attorney General Pam Bondi move “now” to prosecute his political adversaries who, he said, “impeached me twice and indicted me (5 times!) over nothing.” Any illusions of an independent Justice Department are being shattered by a president bent on using it as an instrument of retribution.

Congressional Democrats may have trouble picking up where the DOJ left off, because without a majority in either the House or the Senate, they can’t compel testimony or call hearings. Nevertheless, it’s imperative to get to the bottom of what happened here.

Republicans’ “big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill contained an unprecedented amount of money for detaining and deporting immigrants. The immigration agencies carrying out Homan’s orders will get a gusher of new funds washing through them — enough to hire a small army of new officers and pay for countless contracts. Taxpayers deserve to know that those dollars will be well spent.

Homan’s administrative powers are limited, and do not give him direct control over either hiring or vendor contracts. But this is an administration where everything is fungible, and as border czar, Homan’s influence is profound. The details of how the funds will be disbursed remain far too vague, even though months have passed since Congress greenlit that funding.

As a civilian, Homan operated a consulting firm that secured immigration-related government contracts. One of his clients was the GEO Group, a major player in detention facilities and private prisons. After Trump’s November victory, GEO CEO Brian Evans told investors, “We’re looking at a theoretical potential doubling of all our services.” ICE maintained in April — when his connection with GEO was reported by The Washington Post — that Homan “has never been involved in any contract discussions or decisions at ICE since being named border czar.” GEO has not commented. Yet the Department of Homeland Security has recently awarded GEO a number of new contracts, including a 15-year contract for $1 billion announced Feb. 27.

That announcement came shortly after the FBI’s probe was shuttered, according to MSNBC’s reporting. In late January or early February, then-Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told the DOJ he didn’t support the investigation. That was a mistake — a perceived cover-up could result in a much larger scandal.

In December 2024, Homan had told Rolling Stone that as incoming border czar he would recuse himself from decisions on government contracts, “therefore there is no conflict of interest.” The old Cold War phrase “trust but verify” comes to mind.

Instead, we have Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche declaring that the matter has been given a “full review” and “no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing” has been found. Case closed, nothing to see here.

That is hardly the transparency Trump promised for the Washington “swamp.” It does nothing to restore the credibility of Homan, the FBI or the Justice Department.

This administration, with its loose ethics and disregard for rules, has not earned that level of trust. Perhaps no administration in recent memory has. Congress should review the pertinent documents, the FBI’s audiotape and bring Homan in for under-oath questioning. What happened to the cash? When did the administration learn of the investigation? What steps have been taken to prevent conflicts of interest?

Eleven people were arrested outside the ICE facility Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to the platform X, previously known as Twitter.
“ICE agents at Broadview have also unholstered their guns repeatedly, pointing machine and hand guns directly at protesters.","BROADVIEW — A day after the mayor of suburban Broadview sounded the alarm about ICE officials “making war” in her community, federal authorities appeared to double down Saturday, arresting at least one journalist and using chemical weapons on protesters and members of the press.

In a Friday letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson asked that the agency stop “deploying chemical arms, such as tear gas, pepper spray, etc. against American citizens, our residents, and our first responders,” at the ICE processing facility, 1903 Beach St. in Broadview.

After the letter was covered by the media, Broadview police were warned by ICE of increased enforcement action Saturday, which they believe is an act of retaliation by Homeland Security for speaking out.

“In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ‘stop making war on our community,’ ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be ‘a s*** show’ in Broadview today,” a press release from the village said.

The Sun-Times reports that agents fired pepper balls into a group of about 75 protesters Saturday evening and made several arrests.

Steve Held, a journalist with investigative upstart Unraveled Press, was among those arrested Saturday, according to Unraveled and other journalists on the scene. Unraveled said on social media early Sunday that Held was “safe” and among those released by federal authorities overnight.

Raven Geary, Held’s colleague at Unraveled, was shot in the face with a pepper ball by federal officers on Friday and sought medical attention afterwards, Block Club reporters witnessed.

“We have never witnessed anything like what ICE has unleashed on our communities this week,” Unraveled said in a statement posted to social media Sunday.

Eleven people were arrested outside the ICE facility Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to the platform X, previously known as Twitter.

In a joint statement ahead of Saturday’s planned protest, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, State Sen. Robert Peters and Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) urged civilians to stay away from further protests near the facility — fearing that ICE will be willing to use lethal force on peaceful protesters.

“ICE has escalated their use of tear gas, pepper rounds, and rubber bullets, shooting protesters and members of the press in the face without provocation on numerous occasions,” the letter states. “ICE agents at Broadview have also unholstered their guns repeatedly, pointing machine and hand guns directly at protesters. ICE is willing to use lethal force, as we’ve seen in the recent killing of Silverio Villegas Gonzalez in Franklin Park.”

Federal officers representing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were seen assisting Homeland Security agents outside the Broadview facility Saturday.

Tensions have been escalating outside of the processing facility in the western suburb since Sept. 19, when federal officers began shooting pepper spray balls, deploying tear gas and throwing flash bang grenades at protesters attempting to block federal vehicles from entering and exiting the premises.

Friday’s protest saw federal officers unleash more violence on protesters, including a sniper who shot baton rounds into a crowd of hundreds packed into a parking lot adjacent to the facility.

Saturday’s action comes as President Donald Trump announced a deployment of federal troops to ICE facilities in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere – authorizing “full force” on protesters he described as extremists.

In a statement Saturday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he is “monitoring the federal deployments” and in close contact with Broadview police.

“I urge members of the public to remain calm, stay safe, and document what you see with your phones and cameras,” Pritzker said. My senior team has also asked legal organizations to support monitoring on the ground. By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/092625-Broadview-ICE-Protest-Colin-Boyle-1903.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 16:56:42.165812

In 2022, the congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill that would have created an independent immigration court system – but the bill ultimately died.","Dana Leigh Marks had the kind of career most immigration judges dream of.

At 32, she won a precedent-setting supreme court case that made it easier to claim asylum in the US. In the decades that followed, she led the National Association of Immigration Judges to gain collective bargaining rights, fought to protect immigration courts from political meddling and blazed a trail for a generation of female judges.

Now retired at 71, she’s seen her share of political ups and downs over her 10 years as an immigration lawyer and 35 years on the bench. But nothing could have prepared her for what she’s seen the Trump administration do to the court systems she once served.

“I have seen my entire career destroyed by Trump in six months,” said Marks, reflecting on the state of her profession while sipping coffee near her home in Marin county, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, where she spent much of her career. “I’m flat out terrified on all fronts.”

Whip-smart, with a shock of white curls, Marks can speak more freely than a sitting immigration judge. And the picture she paints is alarming.

Trump’s immigration crackdown has thrown the already backlogged courts into chaos. More than 100 immigration judges have been fired since Trump was sworn in, including roughly a third of the judges in San Francisco, home to one of the largest immigration courts in the country. People across the US are routinely arrested outside their court hearings by Ice agents “acting like the Gestapo”, Marks said.

She described her former colleagues as under siege. “If I were an immigration practitioner now, I’d tell my clients that they have to act like they’re in a war zone,” she said. “Be prepared for any eventuality, because it is so random and so chaotic.”

Despite the grim subject matter, Marks is full of wisecracks and seems to have her spirits permanently set on high – gushing at every passing dog and baby.

“Immigration judges do death penalty cases in a traffic court setting” is among her oft-quoted zingers.

She describes the frenetic work of an immigration judge as like “the guy behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz”: managing dockets, juggling courtroom tech and interpreters, typing verbatim notes while monitoring audio recording levels, then issuing immediate oral rulings with few clerks and barely any time to think. It’s an already frenzied job, and one she believes the Trump administration is intentionally trying to make harder.

Humor aside, her message for the public is a serious one: that the Trump administration is “attacking” immigration courts “on all fronts” in order to eliminate them entirely by proving they’re “dysfunctional”. There’s a backlog of 3.6m cases waiting to be adjudicated, and Marks believes the courts have been purposefully starved of resources.

“I feel like the immigration courts are the canaries in the coalmine,” she said, “and what’s happening to them is an illustration of what might happen to other court systems if we don’t stop it.”

A critical eye and an open mind

Marks’ interest in refugees and the immigrant experience comes from her own family’s lucky escape to America.

“I was raised with an awareness of immigration to begin with,” said Marks. Her Jewish grandmother fled pogroms in Lithuania and was on one of the last boats to the US before the first world war severely restricted transatlantic migration. By the 1920s, the US enacted laws imposing strict quotas on refugees from eastern and southern Europe that almost completely shut down legal pathways for Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.

Marks grew up in a diverse part of west Los Angeles, and spent a year in Chile after Salvador Allende’s election, where she learned Spanish and saw first-hand the dissonance between US media coverage of his presidency and how Chileans talked about politics around dinner tables. She learned to read and listen to many perspectives with a critical eye and an open mind.

She wanted to be a social worker, but went to law school and nearly dropped out before falling in love with immigration law. “You met the world coming into your office,” she said, describing her years in private practice.

In 1987, at the age of 32, she won the supreme court case known as INS v Cardoza-Fonseca, which expanded asylum eligibility by granting relief to those with a “well-founded fear” of persecution. The morning after that victory, she started her training to become a judge.

Alongside her work in court, she led the National Association of Immigration Judges for nearly two decades and recruited half a dozen female judges to the bench. She prided herself on using compassion and humor to lower the tension in her courtroom: when people feel heard and judged fairly, they’re more likely to accept your decisions, she said, even when you rule against their claim.

Marks retired in 2021 to become “Nana Dana” and care for her grandchild, but she remains deeply engaged in the field, speaking at conferences, advising the National Association of Immigration Judges, educating law students, officiating weddings and serving on the advisory board of the non-profit Justice Connection.

What’s been playing out now in courtrooms, in policy memos and on the streets has chilling echoes of the authoritarian eras her Jewish ancestors fled.

Among her more recent concerns is the push to recruit hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges. In late August, the Trump administration scrapped the rule requiring temporary immigration judges to have spent a decade practicing immigration law before qualifying for the bench. Days later, 600 military lawyers were cleared to fill vacant judge seats. All of this is “absolutely unprecedented”, said Marks. “I don’t want to slam military lawyers, but there is the concern that they’re being picked because there’s a perception that they will just follow orders.”

Political interference in the court

For Marks, political encroachment on immigration courts has been “a slow creep that now has gone to light speed”.

A hallmark of American democracy is the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. But this has never been so for immigration courts, which are overseen by the Department of Justice, a part of the executive branch rather than the judicial branch.

“Deep in my bones, I always felt the placement of the immigration court in the Department of Justice was wrong,” she said. “The boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge.”

The court’s placement has led to political interference and underfunding by both parties in power, and Marks wanted to fight back. She spent decades advocating for the nation’s immigration court system to be moved out from under the political whims and meddling of the justice department and into an independent judiciary. In 2022, the congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill that would have created an independent immigration court system – but the bill ultimately died. Marks thinks reviving that bill should be a top priority for Democrats.

She believes everyone across the political spectrum should be incensed by the current level of meddling with due process: from firing immigration judges, to pressuring them to toss out asylum cases so they can be reassigned as emergency deportations, to turning courthouses into traps where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents scoop up immigrants to meet deportation quotas, and more.

“Americans were raised with the golden principle that everybody deserves due process, and I really think the majority of Americans believe that, and that that’s what makes us exceptional in the world,” she said.

“What kills me, as a lawyer, is that Trump turns everything on its head and blows through clearly established legal precedent as if it doesn’t exist. Fealty to precedent is the core of our legal system.”

If there’s a silver lining for her, it’s that she predicts the administration’s embrace of chaos will ultimately backfire. For example, she thinks that dropping military reservists on to the bench for six-month stints is a recipe for failure. Rather than expediting the backlog of asylum cases, it will unleash chaos, “screw up the records” and “make appeals go wild”.

“If you build by chaos, even if you’re right in what you construct,” she quipped, “it’s going to crumble.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f427fe2ca1a220fb01b06eafecded1b377f6e923/189_0_4081_3264/master/4081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27bd7586827656224c0ed5df1f74aaba",N,,2025-09-28 15:56:44.727644

Iowa Democrats are rallying behind a school superintendent who was arrested by ICE on allegations that he is in the country illegally this week, and they are led by a school board chair who once held a key role in the Obama White House.

After ICE arrested Ian Roberts, the superintendent for Des Moines Public Schools (DMPS) last week, school board chair Jackie Norris called for people to have ""radical empathy"" as Roberts' case plays out. Norris previously served as White House chief of staff for then-first lady Michelle Obama. Meanwhile, Republicans in the state legislature are also launching a probe into how the board chose Roberts in the first place.

Norris supported Roberts in a statement on Friday in which she said that officials ""do not have all the facts.""

""There is much we do not know,"" Norris said. ""However, what we do know is that Dr. Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined over two years ago.""

""During his time with our district, he has shown up in ways big and small and has advocated for students and staff, and has begun introducing concepts that will help us reimagine education for future generations,"" she continued.

Norris said Roberts joined the school district in July 2023 after having served in various school districts across the U.S. for ""over 20 years."" Norris was not the chair of the school board at the time Roberts started, but she has been a member since 2021.

Meanwhile, Republicans in the Iowa legislature are calling for a wider probe to ensure proper hiring practices are being followed across the state. Iowa's House Government Oversight Committee also sent a letter to the DMPS directing it to preserve documents related to Roberts' hiring.

""I will not hesitate to introduce and pass legislation to mandate enhanced hiring protocols, increase transparency in district operations, and protect the resources allocated to our schools through the appropriations process,"" State Rep. Austin Harris said. ""Iowa’s families deserve nothing less than a safe, lawful, and effective education system for their children.""

DMPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

ICE alleges that Roberts is in the country illegally from Guyana. They say he is not legally permitted to work in the United States and had a final order of removal from a judge issued in May 2024.

Roberts was arrested after allegedly driving away from law enforcement. He later abandoned his car in the woods, and Iowa State Patrol ended up finding him, according to a press release.

""This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,"" ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement.

The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden’s presidency.","After days of clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration jail in his home state of Illinois, Democratic US senator Dick Durbin on Sunday renewed demands to meet with Trump administration immigration officials.

Durbin wrote on X that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) must be “accountable for its actions” amid the administration’s “cruel immigration crackdown”. The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois.

For the preceding few days, federal officials have arrested protesters at the Broadview facility as Ice operations have escalated in Illinois.

Durbin, along with Illinois representative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, have been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions.

According to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested.

Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. But Ice in Chicago told Durbin and Ramirez they were “unable to support a visit”, according to the letter, and instead offered a meeting to the Democratic delegation. Ice on Friday postponed that meeting “to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The Democratic pressure on Ice comes as protesters have clashed with officials at the Broadview site in recent days. On Saturday night, officials deployed pepper spray and rubber bullets and arrested a number of protesters outside the controversial immigration jail.

In one video posted online on Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility.

The Trump administration has called the protesters “rioters”, accusing them of inciting violence. On Saturday afternoon, Ice posted on X: “Rioters will not deter Ice from its law enforcement mission. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. Full stop.” In another post on Sunday morning, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said 11 people were arrested outside the Ice facility – and that officials had confiscated two guns during the arrests.

In response, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, decried the force used by federal officials at the site. He also called on protesters and bystanders to “document what you see with your phones and cameras”.

“The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzker posted on X. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”

Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHS launched an operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. The operation led to an increase in the number of federal officials in the area targeting immigrants.

Already, the operation has led to a number of scandals for Ice and the Trump administration. Earlier in September, Ice shot and killed an immigrant they were trying to arrest in the Chicago area. Despite DHS saying an officer was “seriously injured” by the immigrant before the shooting, video later released seemed to contradict DHS’s claims.

A recent court filing by immigrants rights groups has also claimed that US citizens have been rounded up during the immigration enforcement operations in the area.

DHS says it launched Midway Blitz to target immigrants in the state, alleging that Pritzker and his “sanctuary policies” – a term meant to describe limitations on local police’s cooperating with federal immigration agents – welcomed undocumented immigrants.

The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden’s presidency.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7247d72da82c539bdf5afa22037be83715f5e25/815_0_4206_3367/master/4206.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bda96b8ff3de12216fd2ab2ee0a40adc",N,,2025-09-28 14:56:57.806577

ICE shooting victim update

What's new:

Stephany Gauffeny says she kept expecting a call from her husband after Joshua Jahn opened fire at the Dallas ICE facility.

But the call Gauffeny did receive was not one she was prepared for. Her husband, Miguel Angel Garcia, a Mexican national, was shot during the deadly attack.

The two other victims in the attack, one of whom has died, were identified by the Department of Homeland Security earlier Saturday.

What they're saying:

""They called me, 'Your husband is in the hospital and he’s alive. That's all we know. Go to the hospital,'"" Gauffeny said.

Garcia now lies in a hospital bed in grave condition.

""It's a lot of uncertainty... We don't know if he’s going to wake up, will he ever wake up, or if he does wake up. We don't know what function he can have. You know, anything can change,"" Gauffeny said.

""Let him know the kids love him. The kids miss you. Please fight for our kids and for the baby on the way. He was really excited to meet the baby,"" Gauffeny said.

A man with so much to fight for had been on the final steps of fixing his immigration status right before the attack.

""And I just try to let him know, I'm here with you. I know you hear me. No, don't give up praying for you. I'm sorry this happened to you,"" Gauffeny said.

And while he fights for his life, his wife is fighting for change.

""Justice for him. He was under ICE custody,"" Gauffeny said.

""For this to not happen again. These types of attacks… and for this to be prevented. For detainees to have more protection if they're under their custody,"" Gauffeny said.

And for people to know his name

""I just want people to know. To put a face to a name. You hear about, ‘Oh victim,’ but he was more than just a victim. He was a real person. He is a real person. He has a lot of people who love him. A son, a father, a friend,"" Gauffeny said.

""A human being. Just because he was a detainee doesn’t mean he was a criminal,"" said Gauffeny.

According to ICE, Garcia had been convicted of DWI and evading arrest. DHS included that he was previously convicted for giving fictitious information and fleeing police.

What's next:

The family is trying to raise money right now to cover hospital expenses, as well as help support Garcia’s family as he was their sole provider.

Dallas ICE facility shooting

The backstory:

The FBI is investigating Wednesday morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility as an act of targeted violence.

Officials said a sniper on the roof of a nearby building fired indiscriminately at the detention center, hitting three detainees who were arriving in a transport van. One of those detainees was killed, and two others were critically injured. No law enforcement officers were hurt.

Sources identified the shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who had ties to North Texas and Oklahoma. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as agents approached him.

While a motive for the shooting has not been released, bullets reportedly found at the scene had an anti-ICE message.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/screenshot-2025-09-26-164821.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-28 19:56:54.899235

leaders and Mr. Trump negotiate with them.
But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed.
“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that.
“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement.","President Trump will meet with the four top congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, the day before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, the lawmakers said.

Congress faces a Tuesday deadline to fund the government, which will require lawmakers to agree on a spending measure that can win at least 60 votes in the Senate. But Republicans control only 53 seats and need support from Democrats, who have been demanding that G.O.P. leaders and Mr. Trump negotiate with them.

But even as leaders of both parties agreed to a meeting, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump intended to reach a bipartisan compromise or if he was summoning Democrats to press them to accept Republicans’ funding proposal.

In an interview on CNN, Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that the president was “always open to discussion.” But when pressed on whether Mr. Trump intended to negotiate a deal, Mr. Johnson sidestepped the question and accused Democrats of holding government funds hostage for “partisan demands.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Monday’s meeting was “only a first step” and emphasized the need for a bipartisan agreement to keep the government funded.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” he said. “But my hope is it’ll be a serious negotiation”

Republicans have been trying to advance a temporary funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, or C.R., that keeps federal spending levels flat. Such measures have become routine on Capitol Hill to avoid shutdowns, and Republicans have pointed out that they repeatedly agreed to such bills in the past.

Mr. Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leaders, have tied their support to securing funding to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and to reversing the cuts to Medicaid and other health programs that Republicans made unilaterally over the summer.

“Our position is clear,” Mr. Jeffries said on Sunday in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “Cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save health care”

Mr. Trump has rejected Democrats’ funding demands as unreasonable. Last week, he canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders after a phone call with Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader.

Mr. Schumer told “Meet the Press” that he called Mr. Thune on Friday to press him to set up a meeting with Mr. Trump and the other congressional leaders, and that the White House agreed to the meeting on Saturday night. “I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,” he said.

But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed. He told NBC that he was open to discussing the insurance subsidies at a later date but that he still did not think it appropriate to address them in a stopgap measure to fund the government.

“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that. I think we all are.”

Republicans’ stopgap bill would keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thune both maintained on Sunday that the seven-week continuing resolution would give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan spending bills that would help them address the Affordable Care Act subsidies.

“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement. “Democrats can either vote for a clean, short-term, nonpartisan C.R. that prioritizes the American people, or they can choose a completely avoidable shutdown that prioritizes politics above all else.”

But Democrats have urged swifter action, saying that the subsidies need to be addressed before millions of Americans enrolled in plans under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, start to sign up for health care coverage in November.

And furious over the White House’s repeated efforts to cancel spending that Congress previously approved, they have suggested that bipartisan spending agreements also need safeguards to restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back such funding.

They have also condemned a recent threat by Trump administration officials to fire scores of federal employees during a shutdown, accusing the White House of trying to intimidate them into dropping their proposal.

Trump’s climbdown comes days after he scrapped a planned meeting to discuss the crisis with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the respective Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate.

The president accused the pair of making “unserious and ridiculous demands” in return for Democratic votes to support a Republican funding agreement to keep the government open beyond Tuesday night – but left the door open for a meeting “if they get serious about the future of our nation”.

Johnson, appearing on CNN, said he spoke with Trump at length on Saturday, and that the two Democrats had agreed to join him and John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, for an Oval Office discussion Monday.

He did not say if Trump would be negotiating directly with the Democrats – but portrayed Trump as keen to “try to convince them to follow common sense and do what’s right by the American people”.

Schumer, talking to NBC’s Meet the Press, said he was “hopeful we can get something real done” – but was uncertain of the mood they would find Trump in when they sat down for the 2pm ET discourse.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said.

“We don’t want a shutdown. We hope that they sit down and have a serious negotiation with us.”

According to CBS News on Sunday, meanwhile, Trump is not hopeful the meeting will lead to an agreement.

The network’s chief national correspondent, Robert Costa, told Face the Nation he spoke with Trump by phone Sunday morning and that a government shutdown “looks likely at this point based on my conversation … He says both sides are at a stalemate.”

Costa said: “Inside the White House, sources are saying president Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse.”

If no deal is reached, chunks of the federal government are set to shut down as early as Wednesday morning, with the White House telling agencies to prepare to furlough or fire scores of workers.

Republican and Democratic leaders have been pointing fingers of blame at each other for days as Tuesday’s deadline for a funding agreement approaches.

The narrow House Republican majority passed a short-term spending bill known as a continuing resolution earlier in September that would keep the government funded for seven weeks – but it faces opposition in the Senate, where it needs the support of at least eight Democrats to pass.

Democrats have made the extension of expiring healthcare protections a condition of their support, warning that planned Republican spending cuts would affect millions of people.

“If we don’t extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, more than 20 million Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, deductibles, in an environment where the cost of living in America is already too high,” Jeffries told CNN on Sunday.

“We’ve made clear that we’re ready, willing and able to sit down with anyone, at any time and at any place, in order to make sure that we can actually fund the government, avoid a painful Republican caused shutdown, and address the healthcare crisis that Republicans have caused that’s [affecting] everyday Americans.”

But Trump and Republicans have repeatedly accused their political opponents of exploiting the issue to force a shutdown while there was still plenty of time to fix healthcare before the subsidies expire on 31 December.

“The Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, not right now, while we’re simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates,” Johnson said.

“There is nothing partisan about this continuing resolution, nothing. We didn’t add a single partisan priority or policy rider at all. We’re operating completely in good faith to get more time.”

Thune, on Meet the Press, also attempted to blame Democrats for the potential shutdown and said “the ball is in their court” as to the next development.

“There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now, we could pick it up today and pass it, that has been passed by the House that will be signed into law by the president to keep the government open,” he said.

“What the Democrats have done is take the federal government as a hostage, and by extension the American people, to try [to] get a whole laundry list of things that they want.”

But US senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has previously urged his party leadership to be stronger in standing up to the Trump administration, said the problem was Republicans handing “a complete blank check” to the president to spend money on his own political interests, and not those of the nation.

“Until now the president has said he’d rather shut down the government than prevent those healthcare costs from spiking,” he told CNN.

“Democrats are united right now on this question. I’m glad we’re finally talking. We’ll see what happens.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/590b2dbe8c19e337f811fba45e219e1a0e11bf3f/170_0_4619_3697/master/4619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7e70de0d0f99485d64e653bb60b607e",N,,2025-09-28 13:56:53.447042

U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Gregory Bovino was on the scene in Broadview beginning Saturday morning, and he seems to have stayed through the evening.

Bovino was seen driving by the Broadview ICE facility in a caravan first thing Saturday morning. He was being filmed by ICE agents around him.

He was seen returning Saturday night, leading federal agents in front of the building in Broadview. That was really when the most intense moments unfolded, as clouds of tear gas filled the air.

Several journalists, including CBS News Chicago's teams, were caught up in the chaos.

Several people were detained as agents and protesters clashed when the gates opened, and demonstrators would attempt to block the road.

Bovino was the top Border Patrol agent in California's El Centro sector until he was given command of a broader immigration enforcement campaign across the state in June.

Over the past several months, Bovino has become one of the most visible public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to detain those living in the country unlawfully. He has accompanied rank-and-file agents on arrest operations and posted slickly edited videos of those sweeps on social media.

Saturday was the first time Bovino was seen in action in Chicago. He posted a video to X showing multiple ICE detainments outside Home Depot stores and other areas in the city.

Back in Broadview, the village said its fire department was told agents would launch enforcement all day by deploying chemicals like tear gas and pepper spray against citizens, residents, and first responders.

""It's scary because they are already firing non-lethal rounds at us,"" said Bryan Brannon, who has been protesting outside the facility all week. ""I worry that at some point they are going to get scared and start using lethal rounds or something.""

The Village of Broadview issued a news release Saturday reading in part: ""In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ""stop making war on our community"", ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be 'a s**t show' in Broadview today.""

The village said the profanity was used in a verbal comment between Broadview police and ICE. When asked about the expletive, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was made up.

""This is made up,"" Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Our law enforcement enforces the rule of law. Period.""

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement reacting to the federal deployment in Broadview, saying in part, ""Illinois will always defend Americans' right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard. We denounce any violence against the general public, members of the media, and law enforcement or first responders.""

He was held in the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City, in northwest Iowa, about 150 miles from Des Moines.

The Des Moines school board voted unanimously to place Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid leave during a three-minute-long special meeting. The board said Roberts was not available to carry out his duties for the 30,000-student district and stated that officials would reassess his status after getting more information.

After the meeting, school board president Jackie Norris read a statement, saying word of Roberts’ arrest Friday made for a “jarring day” but noting that board members still didn’t have all the facts.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents detained Roberts because he was in the country illegally, didn’t have authorization to work and was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024. ICE agents stopped Roberts while he was driving a school-issued vehicle, and the agency said he then fled into a wooded area before being apprehended with help from Iowa State Patrol officers.

He was held in the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City, in northwest Iowa, about 150 miles from Des Moines.

“I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,” Norris said. “The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.”

Norris said Roberts has retained a Des Moines law firm to represent him. Lawyer Alfredo Parrish confirmed his firm was representing Roberts but declined to comment on his case.

Norris also repeated that the district had done a background check on Roberts before he was hired that didn’t indicate any problems and that he signed a form affirming he was a U.S. citizen. A company that aided in the search for a superintendent in 2023 also hired another firm to conduct “comprehensive criminal, credit and background checks” on Roberts that didn’t indicate any citizenship issues, Norris said.

Also Saturday, the Iowa Department of Education released a statement saying Roberts stated he was a U.S. citizen when he applied for an administrator license. The department said the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners conducted a criminal history check with state and federal authorities before issuing a license.

The department said it is reviewing the Des Moines district’s hiring procedures for ensuring people are authorized to work in the U.S.

Roberts had previously said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent much of his childhood in Brooklyn, New York. He competed in the 2000 Olympics in track and field for Guyana.

ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.

A former senior Guyanese police official on Saturday remembered Roberts as a middle-distance runner who could have risen through the ranks of the South American country’s police force had he not emigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Retired assistant Guyana Police Force commissioner Paul Slowe said Roberts entered the Police Force after graduating from the country’s standard military officers’ course.

“He served for a few years and then left. He was not dismissed or dishonorably discharged at all; he just moved on,” Slowe told The Associated Press. “He was a good, promising and disciplined man.”

And that is the mark of fundamentalism: not just to speak, but to declare speech holy.
We imagine fundamentalism as the product of religion alone, but in truth it is about power.
It is time to see the truth we’ve trained ourselves to ignore: that the politics of faith are not a distant problem but a domestic one.
That prophecy and scripture are invoked to shape our laws, and our laws shape our lives.","I was a political science student in college when 9-11 happened. Almost overnight, the air in our classrooms thickened with talk of the Middle East—of regimes and sects, of the supposed sickness in other people’s faith. At the same time, I sat in lectures on American government, absorbing lessons on freedom, the separation of church and state, and the principles that anchor a democracy. The story was tidy: Extremism existed “over there,” and here was civility, rationality, liberty.

But even then, I felt the story was too neat. We were trained to see extremism as foreign, an affliction of others. No one asked us to look for it in our own pulpits, in our own chambers of power, where faith is wielded not only as belief but as authority.

For decades, we were told that extremism abroad is born of poverty, oppression, and lack of democracy. That dignity and fair governance could inoculate against violence. Yet here at home, the extremists are not poor. They are not desperate. They are wealthy, white, and privileged, carrying Bibles in one hand and power in the other. These are the people shaping foreign policy, writing the rules of engagement, and insisting that God Himself is on their side.

It is easy to sneer at fundamentalism when it wears a beard and prays to a different God. We do this without noticing how our own leaders claim the same divine sanction. Take Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who recently said, “Those who bless Israel will be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be cursed,” a statement guiding policy on the basis of religious prophecy. As a result, borders are drawn and redrawn, not by maps or treaties, but by the conviction that scripture demands it. Tanks move forward because some believe the end times will be hastened by the blood spilled today. I have heard lawmakers speak of Israel not as a nation among nations, but as a ticket for their own salvation—a stage for the rapture. Lives are traded away for a promise written in ancient ink. Too often, it is prophecy, not policy, that carries the weight of law.

The divine is always invoked to conquer, to exclude, to strip away the humanity of others.

Charlie Kirk was another voice in this chorus. His platform rested on the claim that his words bore the imprint of Jesus Himself. And that is the mark of fundamentalism: not just to speak, but to declare speech holy. Not just to pass laws, but to claim the laws come from God. When movements convince their followers that every act of war, every border drawn, every vote cast is sanctified, fundamentalism is no longer a fringe—it is the system itself.

This is America’s problem. We imagine fundamentalism as the product of religion alone, but in truth it is about power. It thrives in systems that punish dissent and demand obedience. It flourishes where inequality is already deep, where racism already wounds. Whether it calls itself Christian nationalism or Zionism, the fruit is the same: oppression disguised as divine order.

Christian nationalism, in particular, is theater. Fear of the stranger is the script. The Gospels are props—quoted when convenient, discarded when not. The gun becomes holy; violence is celebrated as sacrament; scripture appears only to bless white entitlement and empire. And somehow, the divine is always invoked to conquer, to exclude, to strip away the humanity of others.

“Love the stranger as yourself” has been rewritten into “expel the immigrant.” “Turn the other cheek” has become “press his cheek into the ground.” The inversion is so stark you can only call it blasphemy.

It is time to see the truth we’ve trained ourselves to ignore: that the politics of faith are not a distant problem but a domestic one. That prophecy and scripture are invoked to shape our laws, and our laws shape our lives. That the moral high ground, so often claimed, is little more than a thin veneer of power and entitlement.

We are not exempt from the damage. We are participants in it. And we cannot keep pretending that America’s fundamentalists are not pulling the strings.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56522936&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C242%2C0%2C243,N,,2025-09-28 13:56:57.523951

“Federal workers stay for the mission.
Several thousands of additional federal workers have been fired as part of reduction in force mandates ordered by the administration.
“It’s a huge grieving process,” said a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who took the deferred resignation offer.
Another employee at the US Department of Agriculture was fired in February as a probationary employee, reinstated in April only to take the deferred resignation offer.","The Trump administration is set to oversee the largest mass resignation in US history on Tuesday, with more than 100,000 federal workers set to formally quit as part of the latest wave of its deferred resignation program.

With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a government shutdown, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.

Workers preparing to leave government as part of the resignation program – one of several pillars of Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts to the federal workforce – have described how months of “fear and intimidation” left them feeling like they had no choice but to depart.

“Federal workers stay for the mission. When that mission is taken away, when they’re scapegoated, when their job security is uncertain, and when their tiny semblance of work-life balance is stripped away, they leave,” a longtime employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) told the Guardian. “That’s why I left.”

The total resignation program is set to cost $14.8bn, with 200,000 workers paid their full salary and benefits while on administrative leave for up to eight months, according to a Senate Democrats’ report in July.

Trump officials argue this outlay is worth it. The Office of Personnel Management claimed the one-time costs lower longer-term spending by the federal government. It also criticized job protections of federal civil servants, claiming the government should have a “modern, at-will employment framework like most employers”.

A spokesperson for the White House claimed there was “no additional cost to the government” as employees would have received their salaries regardless of the program. “In fact, this is the largest and most effective workforce reduction plan in history and will save the government $28bn annually,” they added.

The total number of expected departures through the delayed resignation and voluntary separation programs, attrition, and early retirement programs is about 275,000 employees, the spokesman said.

Several thousands of additional federal workers have been fired as part of reduction in force mandates ordered by the administration. The mass exodus is the largest single-year decline in civilian federal employment since the second world war.

Federal employees who took the deferred resignation offer requested to speak anonymously in hopes of returning to the federal government in the future and to protect future job prospects.

They are entering a lagging job market as the unemployment rate in August 2025 ticked up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021, and only 22,000 jobs were added amid disruptions and uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs.

“It’s a huge grieving process,” said a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who took the deferred resignation offer. “Myself and many others that I know really hoped that we would finish our careers with the government. We felt very tied, especially in the VA, to the mission.

“Many of us thought we could do better for our clients, for our veterans outside of the VA, and a lot of us were so burnt out from the six months before the deferred resignation that it was actually a mental health decision for many as well.”

Communicating why they left has been challenging while searching for a new job, the VA employee said. “The job market stinks right now,” they said. “It’s great to not be working 60 to 70 hours a week any more, but you also lose your support system from those that stayed, and from those that may judge you for leaving.”

An archaeologist at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and military veteran, said they “loved” their job, but took the deferred resignation out of fear and pressure from the administration. “I was forced to accept the resignation plan. “Not physically, or through any legal means, but through fear and intimidation,” they said.

They cited comments from Russell Vought, Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget, who said of federal workers last October: “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down … We want to put them in trauma.”

“This is exactly what happened,” the USDA worker said. “I was scared to go to work. Scared that the next day would be the day I would get fired, or barred from future service, scared I would wait too long to leave and not find a job, and just living everyday like a raw nerve.”

The public vilification of federal workers has pushed many to take the resignation program, the archaeologist suggested, as they were constantly inundated with threats of cuts and firings.

Another employee at the US Department of Agriculture was fired in February as a probationary employee, reinstated in April only to take the deferred resignation offer.

“At that point, I felt they could terminate me at any time,” they told the Guardian. “It’s hard to focus on your work when they can just send you an email and you can be gone, and they completely changed the terms of my work. I was hoping things would stabilize and there would be an opportunity to go back, but now it doesn’t look like there will be an opportunity.”

The American Federation of Government Employees and other labor unions representing federal workers filed a lawsuit that is still ongoing over the deferred resignation program earlier this year, alleging the buyout circumvents congressional authority, undermines statutorily required functions of government agencies in losing employees en masse, and was enacted with the threat of firings.

“Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” said AFGE president Everett Kelley in February. “This offer should not be viewed as voluntary.

“Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration’s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e118071ad5e69be7099b8403cf5ab345f95f9dd8/46_255_4681_3745/master/4681.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad4dbc2a2321a203097c548009e3b819",N,,2025-09-28 12:57:41.821573

He has begun funding a pro-immigrant campaign, bought anti-Trump advertisements in newspapers and is preparing to spend his fortune fighting what he sees as creeping authoritarianism and tyranny within the United States.","As a child in Cuba, Mike Fernandez watched as his teachers were replaced with government instructors, books vanished from classroom shelves and ultimately, Communist Party officials took over his dad's tiny sandwich stand.

Now the self-made billionaire and longtime Republican campaign donor watches uncomfortably from South Florida as President Donald Trump takes many of the same steps he saw under Fidel Castro.

Like many people who fled to the United States from authoritarian regimes, Fernandez says the United States appears to be at a tipping point, with Trump centralizing power to silence dissent and punish people he's declared as enemies, while bullying private businesses to fall in line.

""There's something wrong, and we all know it,"" Fernandez told USA TODAY. ""Many people are hoping it's going to go away on its own, and it's not going to go away on its own.""

The billionaire émigré added: ""I'm scared of how fast we're moving.""

Trump argues that the 2024 election he won represents a mandate from American voters who endorsed his muscular leadership approach. Trump has justified his actions as necessary to secure the United States from both an ""invasion"" of immigrants and what he describes as the unwillingness of Democratic officials to stamp out visible homelessness, halt certain types of crimes and prevent civil disorder.

A historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in August of his first years in office − both as the 45th and 47th presidents − are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations. In Gallup's polling, roughly 40% currently approve of Trump's job performance.

Despite the unfavorable polling, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would serve a third term as president ‒ although the Constitution prevents him from being elected again ‒ and openly mused about how other countries have cancelled elections during war or other national emergencies.

Warning signs of authoritarianism

People who have fled authoritarian regimes say it's a combination of actions that are cause for concern right now in the United States, especially after Trump declared at activist Charlie Kirk's funeral that he ""hates"" his opponents. Those interviewed by USA TODAY raised a host of parallels they see between the authoritarian leadership of their native countries and Trump's actions over the last eight months:

Routine use of military forces to disperse anti-government protests, especially over the objection of local officials, as happened in California and Washington, DC.

Declarations that certain rights, especially for certain groups, must be curtailed because of a national emergency, such as ending due process hearings for accused undocumented immigrants.

Singling out of minority groups for harsh and selective prosecutions, often based on old laws. The White House has argued its immigration crackdown largely reflects a return to enforcing existing law that successive past presidents ignored.

Reduced access to legal counsel, especially for those targeted minority groups.

Nationalization of businesses deemed critical to the government's success. Trump announced on Aug. 22 that the federal government would purchase a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, and has expressed interest in buying into other companies as well.

Frequent reminders of the government's power and role in dominating public life, in part with monuments and banners dedicated to the leader. Earlier this year, three federal buildings in DC were festooned with giant images of the president.

Lack of free and fair elections, with leaders manipulating the system to remain in power. Trump has pressured several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redistrict to make it easier for Republicans to win seats in Congress. He has also spoken against popular mail-in ballots, saying without evidence that they are ripe for fraud.

Using government power to punish or silence opponents and journalists, and declaring them enemies, as Trump has most recently done with late-night host, Jimmy Kimmel.

The Trump administration has argued that each one of these actions is necessary and consistent with its Make America Great Again agenda, and that the Biden administration was guilty of many seemingly authoritarian measures, too.

Tanks as common as ice cream trucks

For Eddie Flores, growing up in El Salvador meant seeing military tanks rolling through neighborhoods as often as ice cream trucks. Flores' family fled the country's devastating civil war when he was 7.

Last year, he became the first Salvadoran-born immigrant elected mayor of South San Francisco.

Now, along with balancing the city's biotech cluster and creeping gentrification, he's also helping coordinate neighborhood groups opposed to Trump's mass immigration sweeps. More than a third of the city’s residents are Hispanic, and despite concerns ahead of the city’s popular Cultura Fest in August, no disruptions occurred.

In the Los Angeles area, Trump's ICE agents have swept up thousands of undocumented immigrants, sometimes chasing them through the streets or farm fields. Protests against the ICE raids became violent, and Trump then deployed active-duty Marines and members of the California National Guard onto city streets over the objection of local officials.

Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, and has threatened to unleash his newly renamed ""Department of War"" into Chicago.

""I constantly tell my staff that we have to remain proactive and have systems in place before any harm arrives,"" Flores said. ""It's about consistently showing up for your neighbors, not just when they are in need, so they don't have to live in the shadows.""

He added: ""Authoritarianism has no place in a country built on pluralism, and we as leaders have to safeguard that promise.""

Recognizing patterns of behavior

For a 41-year-old immigrant from the Middle East, the United States had long been a bastion of freedoms ‒ a place where the right to criticize the government is written into the nation's founding documents. Several members of his family have been detained in his home country for years for speaking out against their leaders.

""We came here to express ourselves and have found ourselves in this dilemma that we'd never thought we'd face,"" said the man, who USA TODAY agreed not to identify.

The man, a legal researcher who lives legally in the United States, is worried he might be targeted by the federal government for speaking freely. ""It's very, very ironic that we now suggest to folks who are visiting us from outside the United States to delete apps, delete text conversations, delete images even though they are completely innocent.""

The man, who is also a human rights expert for a nonprofit, said he's watched in fear as Trump has attacked the rule of law, singled out minority groups for harsh prosecution and declared emergencies or accused people of terrorism to justify some of his actions. He said Americans should heed the warnings of refugees like him who have lived under oppressive regimes and can recognize the patterns playing out.

It's easy for people in society's mainstream to think what's happening to minority groups will never happen to them, he said, adding that he has been disappointed more Americans haven't been trying to halt Trump, given the country's founding system of checks-and-balances brought by the courts, Congress and a free press.

""It's going to reach you at some point, and when it does, there'll be nobody there for you because you were never there for them,"" he said.

Echoing childhood memories

Like many other people who sought safety in the United States, Davis, California, resident Griselda Gonzalez said watching federal troops patrolling Los Angeles conjured up painful childhood memories.

The Salvadoran native can vividly recall when she was 10, as guerrilla fighters stormed her hometown of San Salvador, the nation’s capital. The complex and brutal civil war in her country killed thousands. Visions of explosions and constant gunfire, even in the smallest neighborhoods, sometimes pop into her head.

Today, she's a married mother of three with a successful family-owned commercial moving company. But she said she's shocked by how much the United States now resembles the country she fled: constant threats of military deployments, along with ICE raids targeting people who look like her.

""Five years ago, we were all fighting for our lives with COVID-19,"" said Gonzalez, who became a naturalized citizen in 2014. ""Now we're worried about fighting for our basic rights?""

Done staying quiet

Fernandez, the Cuban refugee and American-made billionaire, became a U.S. citizen after serving as an Army paratrooper. He said he's long been content to influence U.S. politics by funding political candidates, most of them Republicans.

But after watching how Trump and the people around him are behaving ‒ including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom he once strongly supported ‒ Fernandez said he's done staying quiet.

He has begun funding a pro-immigrant campaign, bought anti-Trump advertisements in newspapers and is preparing to spend his fortune fighting what he sees as creeping authoritarianism and tyranny within the United States.

""If I go back to zero, I will do so because I came here with nothing and I owe this country to reinvest to defend it from within,"" Fernandez said. ""I think I owe it to the country. I owe it to my children and grandchildren to come back to a place where due process matters.""

The American people have more power than they think, said Fernandez.

""The more we speak as a group, the less likely we are to be targeted. I see myself being targeted already. Will I stop? No,"" he said, encouraging everyone to speak out against what he sees as the president's anti-Americanism.

""America used to be a great country,"" he added. ""It isn't anymore, in the way it's been designed by the current administration.""

Mr. Trump signed an executive order this week targeting antifa, a loosely defined left-wing antifascist movement.
In his order, Mr. Trump said that he was declaring antifa a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not actually exist under U.S. law.","But for Mr. Trump, who has long favored images of himself surrounded by military leaders, such a setting may prove irresistible.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who summoned the generals and admirals, is expected to speak about grooming and fitness requirements, and other aspects of what he calls a shift toward a “warrior ethos” at the Pentagon.

Mr. Trump appeared unfamiliar with the meeting when he was asked about it during an Oval Office appearance on Thursday, but he quickly said it was good that Mr. Hegseth had organized it.

“Let him be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,” Mr. Trump said. “You act like this is a bad thing. Isn’t it nice that people are coming from all over the world to be with us?”

Few details about the event have been disclosed, not even to the officers expected to attend. The secrecy has sparked alarm at a time when Mr. Trump is accelerating military action against drug trafficking boats that he says are coming from Venezuela, as well as deploying the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and Memphis for law-enforcement purposes and using troops to guard federal facilities.

Military specialists have voiced increasing alarm over Mr. Trump’s tendency to treat the military as an arm of politics. Speaking to troops at military bases, the president often uses the occasion to bash his political rivals, liberals and the news media.

During a speech at Fort Bragg in June, Mr. Trump led troops to boo journalists and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

On Saturday, two Democratic senators on the Armed Services Committee, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, criticized Tuesday’s meeting as a costly and disruptive political stunt that posed potential security risks.

“This gathering would represent an unprecedented concentration of senior military leadership in one location simply to hear you speak about standards and ethos at significant cost and with potentially serious security implications,” the senators said in a letter to Mr. Hegseth.

“For an administration obsessed with rooting out waste, this abrupt, time and resource-intensive meeting of our military’s top commanders,” the senators continued, “is absurd.”

But even as leaders of both parties agreed to a meeting, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump intended to reach a bipartisan compromise or if he was summoning Democrats to press them to accept Republicans’ funding proposal.

In an interview on CNN, Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that the president was “always open to discussion.” But when pressed on whether Mr. Trump intended to negotiate a deal, Mr. Johnson sidestepped the question and accused Democrats of holding government funds hostage for “partisan demands.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Monday’s meeting was “only a first step” and emphasized the need for a bipartisan agreement to keep the government funded.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” he said. “But my hope is it’ll be a serious negotiation”

Republicans have been trying to advance a temporary funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, or C.R., that keeps federal spending levels flat. Such measures have become routine on Capitol Hill to avoid shutdowns, and Republicans have pointed out that they repeatedly agreed to such bills in the past.

Mr. Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leaders, have tied their support to securing funding to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and to reversing the cuts to Medicaid and other health programs that Republicans made unilaterally over the summer.

“Our position is clear,” Mr. Jeffries said on Sunday in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “Cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save health care”

Mr. Trump has rejected Democrats’ funding demands as unreasonable. Last week, he canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders after a phone call with Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader.

Mr. Schumer told “Meet the Press” that he called Mr. Thune on Friday to press him to set up a meeting with Mr. Trump and the other congressional leaders, and that the White House agreed to the meeting on Saturday night. “I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,” he said.

But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed. He told NBC that he was open to discussing the insurance subsidies at a later date but that he still did not think it appropriate to address them in a stopgap measure to fund the government.

“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that. I think we all are.”

Republicans’ stopgap bill would keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thune both maintained on Sunday that the seven-week continuing resolution would give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan spending bills that would help them address the Affordable Care Act subsidies.

“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement. “Democrats can either vote for a clean, short-term, nonpartisan C.R. that prioritizes the American people, or they can choose a completely avoidable shutdown that prioritizes politics above all else.”

But Democrats have urged swifter action, saying that the subsidies need to be addressed before millions of Americans enrolled in plans under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, start to sign up for health care coverage in November.

And furious over the White House’s repeated efforts to cancel spending that Congress previously approved, they have suggested that bipartisan spending agreements also need safeguards to restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back such funding.

They have also condemned a recent threat by Trump administration officials to fire scores of federal employees during a shutdown, accusing the White House of trying to intimidate them into dropping their proposal.

It would likely be the first official visit to Egypt in decades by a sitting U.S. ambassador to Israel, and is expected to include a meeting with Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, according to the three officials.

It is not yet clear what role the current U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Herro Mustafa Garg, who was appointed during the Biden administration, will play in the talks.

The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Huckabee’s visit comes amid strained relations between Israel and Egypt, largely over the war in Gaza, which borders both nations.

Egypt has criticized Israel’s ground assault on Gaza City, where nearly one million Palestinians were sheltering until recently, fearing that the fighting could force hundreds of thousands of Gazans across the Egyptian border into the Sinai Peninsula, which also borders Israel.

Israeli news media has reported that Israeli officials raised concerns to Washington about an Egyptian buildup of military forces in the Sinai. The Egyptian government said publicly last week, in a statement responding to media reports about the troop buildup, that its troops were in Sinai to defend Egypt’s borders against all threats. Egypt has also denied Israel’s contention that the troops were there in violation of the peace treaty it signed with Israel in 1979.

Mr. Huckabee is expected to address the tensions between the two countries, both of which receive substantial U.S. military aid, during his visit to Cairo, the three officials said.

The talks will also include a new plan to end the war that President Trump shared with Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week, according to two of the officials.

Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Huckabee, a vocal supporter of the state of Israel, as ambassador shortly after being re-elected.

Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel after they signed the 1979 peace treaty, ending decades of wars. They have since gradually developed ties, sharing intelligence, striking major energy deals and maintaining direct communication between their leaders.

But the ongoing Gaza war, started by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has driven a wedge between the two countries. Egypt has acted as a mediator, alongside Qatar and the United States, in cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.

Earlier this month, Israel struck a residential building in Doha, Qatar’s capital, where senior Hamas leaders were staying, killing five people affiliated with Hamas and a member of the Qatari internal security forces. Since the attack, it has remained unclear whether cease-fire negotiations will resume, and if Qatar will continue to play a role as a mediator.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt condemned the strike, warning that Israel was risking its diplomatic ties with Arab states. He said the strike “places obstacles before any new peace agreements and even strains the existing peace accords with countries in the region.”

Like Mr. Trump’s other dispatches of federal forces, the Portland directive was quickly opposed by state and local officials, who called it unnecessary.

Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said in an afternoon news briefing that she had spoken with the president and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, on Saturday, and that she had told them to stay out. She did not plan to approve the use of the state’s National Guard, she added.

“Portland is doing just fine. I made that very clear to the president,” she said from the city’s downtown riverfront, as bicyclists and pontoon boats passed behind her. “We got this. We are doing fine. There is no insurrection. We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon.”

Ms. Kotek, who said that she learned of the president’s declaration after “waking up to the news on social media, like everyone else,” declined to reveal what Mr. Trump had told her, other than that he had agreed to continue talking.

Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post that, at Ms. Noem’s request, he had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.”

He added: “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

It was not immediately clear what Mr. Trump meant by “full force.” Portland is one of the Democratic-led cities that has been in the president’s sights; he previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago to combat crime, though he has not yet done so.

In a statement, the Pentagon said it was “aware of the president’s directive to mobilize military personnel to Portland.”

Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in an interview that Oregon’s state and congressional leaders had not heard from the administration before the president’s social media post, despite repeated requests for information and for a chance to provide input. He and other civic leaders said they were puzzled by what they viewed as a fixation with Portland.

“Anytime he sees a TV show that involves even a mention of Portland, he gets all worked up. You can set your clock by it,” he said. “A lot of his policies come by whim. So we need to push back, push back, push back until he gets another whim.”

Mr. Wyden said that he and other Democratic members of Congress were exploring ways they might respond if the administration did take steps they considered abuses of presidential power.

Demonstrators have been camped outside the ICE building near the Willamette River in southwest Portland for several months, rarely numbering more than two dozen. Brief, isolated skirmishes have broken out between protesters and federal law enforcement, but they have been confined to a few blocks in a neighborhood outside the urban core.

A charter school that rented space next to the ICE building moved out this fall, citing the heavy use of tear gas by federal agents and potential health risks for students.

Demonstrators have been pushing city leaders to use municipal land-use laws to close the federal facility. The ICE building has been used for immigrant processing since 2011, and city code bans the federal agency from detaining people there for more than 12 hours. This month, Mayor Keith Wilson, a Democrat, announced that the city would investigate whether the federal agency had violated local laws by holding people for longer than allowed.

Federal descriptions of how events have unfolded at the building in Portland run counter to accounts from local law enforcement and demonstrators.

“We’re certainly not on fire,” Bob Day, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau, said in an interview this week. “Some of what you are seeing out there just does not accurately reflect what’s happening in this city.”

Protesters at the ICE building in Portland said their days have taken on a familiar pattern: They position themselves just outside the garage gate, then chant and hold up signs when federal cars leave every 40 minutes or so.

Their efforts draw little to no response during the day and early evening. But later, usually after a nearby streetcar stops running around midnight, federal agents regularly leave the building to confront them and attempt to drive them away.

“They get violent,” said Andy Siebe, a participant in 2020 protests in Portland who was outside the ICE building Saturday afternoon. They rested in a camping chair and spoke with the many passers-by who honked in support, dropped off supplies or took pictures.

“Tear gas, batons, bear spray, rubber bullets, shields,” Mx. Siebe said.

Portland police officers have been ordered to stay out of the way when federal law enforcement officials clash with demonstrators, but to intervene when they see people committing acts of violence or vandalism.

There had been only 15 or 20 people participating in the latest protests each night, Mx. Siebe noted, adding that the federal activity would “change things.”

“It’s going to get people who stopped paying attention engaged again,” they said.

The shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas this week that killed one detainee and critically injured two others has left the agency particularly sensitive to any potential security concerns at its facilities. The F.B.I. said it was investigating the attack as “an act of targeted violence.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that “President Trump and Secretary Noem are taking action to restore law and order following weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities, assaults on law enforcement and the terrorist attack at our ICE facility in Dallas.”

She added: “We are not going to allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement.""

Mr. Trump signed an executive order this week targeting antifa, a loosely defined left-wing antifascist movement. He threatened “investigatory and prosecutorial action” against those who financially support it.

In his order, Mr. Trump said that he was declaring antifa a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not actually exist under U.S. law. Anti-fascism, like fascism itself, is a broad political ideology rather than a specific organization, and the United States does not have a domestic terrorism law.

Since July, the Department of Homeland Security has been focused on protesters outside an ICE facility in Portland, saying that month that the site was “under siege.”

“Rioters have attacked law enforcement officials, destroyed federal property, and have posted death threats at the facility,” the agency said in a statement in July.

In a news conference on Friday night, Portland civic leaders responded to reports of an increased federal presence, urging calm and telling residents that they believed Mr. Trump wanted to bait protesters into violent interactions with law enforcement.

“We’re in the midst of a renaissance, not chaos,” said Mr. Wilson, the city’s mayor. “If you walk out on the streets of Portland, or any day, you’ll see people with hope and businesses flourishing.”

He added: “As leaders, we are focused on bringing everybody together, not dividing us, and certainly not being part of a made-for-TV event.”

The Des Moines school board voted unanimously to place Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid leave during a three-minute-long special meeting. The board said Roberts was not available to carry out his duties for the 30,000-student district and stated that officials would reassess his status after getting more information.

After the meeting, school board president Jackie Norris read a statement, saying word of Roberts' detention Friday made for a ""jarring day"" but noting that board members still didn't have all the facts.

In a statement on social media, Norris said the school district had ""no confirmed information"" about why Roberts was detained and the associate superintendent would be stepping in in his place. The school said they had not been told of the ""next potential steps"" by immigration authorities.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents detained Roberts because he was in the country illegally, didn't have authorization to work and was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024. ICE agents stopped Roberts while he was driving a school-issued vehicle, and the agency said he then fled into a wooded area before being apprehended with help from Iowa State Patrol officers.

""I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,"" Norris said. ""The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.""

Norris said Roberts has retained a Des Moines law firm to represent him. Lawyer Alfredo Parrish confirmed his firm was representing Roberts but declined to comment on his case.

Norris also repeated that the district had done a background check on Roberts before he was hired that didn't indicate any problems and that he signed a form affirming he was a U.S. citizen. A company that aided in the search for a superintendent in 2023 also hired another firm to conduct ""comprehensive criminal, credit and background checks"" on Roberts that didn't indicate any citizenship issues, Norris said.

Also Saturday, the Iowa Department of Education released a statement saying Roberts stated he was a U.S. citizen when he applied for an administrator license. The department said the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners conducted a criminal history check with state and federal authorities before issuing a license.

The department said it is reviewing the Des Moines district's hiring procedures for ensuring people are authorized to work in the U.S.

According to CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI, the district said Roberts underwent a background check in 2023 by a private contractor, and during the hiring process, he made the board aware of a firearm charge related to a hunting rifle, and provided ""sufficient context and explanation"" to move forward.

Roberts was licensed by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, the district told KCCI.

Roberts had previously said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent much of his childhood in Brooklyn, New York. He competed in the 2000 Olympics in track and field for Guyana.

ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.

A former senior Guyanese police official on Saturday remembered Roberts as a middle-distance runner who could have risen through the ranks of the South American country's police force had he not emigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Retired assistant Guyana Police Force commissioner Paul Slowe said Roberts entered the Police Force after graduating from the country's standard military officers' course.

""He served for a few years and then left. He was not dismissed or dishonorably discharged at all; he just moved on,"" Slowe told The Associated Press. ""He was a good, promising and disciplined man.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/28/abd01b0a-a212-4496-933b-4746bbc5399b/thumbnail/1200x630/9218c3d720aecb386793c9d6072cfa1a/ap25269735494982.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 13:57:17.515604

Deployments in Portland would mark the fourth US city where Trump has sent National Guard troops for duty, assigning them to assist immigration officers, clean up streets and help fight local crime. National Guard troops have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis. California Governor Gavin Newsom successfully challenged Trump’s deployment of Guard troops in his state, but the White House is appealing the federal court ruling.

Trump didn’t specify on Saturday whether he was referring to Guard troops or regular military. Governors control each state’s National Guard, though Trump was able to federalize Guard troops in the capital because it’s a federal district.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek told a news conference that she was “abundantly clear” in conversations with Trump and Noem that the deployment was unnecessary.

“There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security. There is no need or legal justification for military troops in our major city,” she said. “Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community that he has posted about on social media and I conveyed that directly to him.”

“Let’s not take the bait,” she told residents. The governor also warned that property damage or violence in response to the deployments “will not be tolerated.”

The Pentagon said it’s poised to back the Homeland Security Department and will provide updates when available. “We stand ready to mobilize US military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President’s direction,” department spokesman Sean Parnell said by email.

Oregon officials suggested Trump’s actions would only inflame the situation.

“Our nation has a long memory for acts of oppression, and the president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement. US Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, urged residents in a social media post “to reject Trump’s attempt to incite violence.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uhGyncamJoeQ.QwDIm9M_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_holding_pen_162/aa34d3a258a42a81fa4f51645b3d1110,N,,2025-09-28 11:58:09.406522

Chris Mason

Political editor

The stand out remarks from the prime minister in his interview with Laura were about Reform’s idea to scrap Indefinite Leave to Remain - which Sir Keir Starmer sees as immoral and racist.

We’ll be seeing plenty of Starmer in the next few days and he will keep returning to the dividing line he now wants to draw between Labour and Reform.

In essence, his pitch is that Labour need to be united against their common opponent - Nigel Farage.

But it is precisely that threat from Reform which has accelerated the fears and jitters of Labour MPs and activists, and so the talk is about whether the prime minister is up to that battle ahead.

The grumpiness is broad and it is deep within the parliamentary party, even if there is also a breadth and a depth to the view that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, rather overdid it with his interventions in the last few days.

Burnham is appearing at a fringe event at the conference this afternoon which I’ll be heading to - assuming I can get through the door as I suspect it’ll be rammed.

The prime minister will argue that navel gazing and leadership speculation is what contributed to the Conservatives' calamitous collapse in popularity and Labour must not make the same mistake.

But Labour MPs are not blind to opinion polls that suggest Armageddon for the party and point to the cavernous depths of Starmer's unpopularity.

""He makes Corbyn look loved,"" one backbencher observed to me ruefully.

Labour conference under way

Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool is now under way.

Delegates representing voters and trade unions will be taking part in voting on the party's policies, with speeches expected over the coming days from major figures.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is due to speak tomorrow, with Keir Starmer scheduled to give a keynote speech on Tuesday afternoon.

One of the biggest moments from today's programme was Starmer accusing Reform UK of wanting to ""tear the country apart"", and accusations that Nigel Farage's plan to deport legal migrants is ""racist"" and ""immoral"".

Reform has hit back, with the party's Zia Yusuf claiming its plan will ensure migrants contribute to British society.

We'll be closing our page shortly, but before we go we'll leave you with a final word from our political editor Chris Mason.

The world stands with Palestine, activist Greta Thunberg says

We also heard from climate activist Greta Thunberg during the programme.

Speaking from one of the boats in a flotilla trying to bring aid in to Gaza and to ""show that the people of the world stand with Palestine"", adding that the territory is under ""Israel's illegal and inhumane siege"".

Kuenssberg questions their approach at taking aid in, saying that flotillas have been the target of many Israeli attacks. She asks why Thunberg didn't take the route that the Catholic Church takes into Jerusalem, suggested by Italy.

Thunberg says that they have seen these types of proposals before but that Israel is not working in the interests of the Palestinians and that they have been lied to countless times.

When asked about the dangers of the mission, Thunberg says there have been ""escalated attacks and threats"", and instead asks why Israel would attack ""a peaceful humanitarian mission"" trying to take aid to a ""starving population"".

""I don't think anyone would risk their life for a publicity stunt... have you asked people in Gaza if they think it is?""

Israel has insisted it acts in accordance with international law and facilitates the entry of aid, and has repeatedly said it would not allow the flotilla to reach its intended destination.

What is Reform's migration policy?

More on what Reform has proposed now.

On Monday, the party announced it would abolish the right of migrants to qualify for permanent settlement in the UK after five years, should Reform win the next election.

Under the plans, migrants would need to reapply for new visas with tougher rules, and Reform would abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), which gives people rights and access to benefits.

Under the current system, migrants can apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, giving the right to live, study and work in the UK permanently.

It is a key route to gaining British citizenship and allows people to claim benefits.

Reform's policy chief Zia Yusuf said the changes would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of people having to apply and ultimately losing their settled status in the UK"".

""Many of those who will lose their leave to remain are entirely dependent on the welfare state and will leave voluntarily upon losing access to benefits,"" he said.

""Those that don't will be subject to immigration enforcement as part of our mass deportation programme.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/cda0/live/0d0a0360-9c42-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 11:57:39.736745

A short drive from Main Street, two rectangular holes form a checkerboard pattern in a grassy lawn connecting a Catholic church with a nearby schoolyard. Six Grinnell College researchers spent the summer here digging, scraping and screening the soil, most of whom have never been to Wyoming before.

The Iowa-based researchers are looking for artifacts from when a mob burned down what was once the Rock Springs Chinatown.

In 1885, labor tensions boiled over in the Union Pacific Railroad's coal mines, stemming from an argument over who had the best work opportunities. The mob, many of them European migrants, blamed the Chinese.

""And it was right here where we're standing,"" said Professor Laura Ng, from four feet deep in the trenches of the dig site, where she's guiding students mapping diagrams of burnt down building foundations.

After burning several blocks once made up of homes and shops, the mob killed 28 Chinese people and injured another 14, in what is one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history.

""[Because of this], there's going to be a layer that is very distinctive in the archaeological record,"" said Ng.

In what she refers to as the ""burn layer,"" Ng's team has found artifacts, ranging from pottery sherds, animal bones, an ornamental door handle and a wooden beam from an old building.

The town dates back to the 1860s, when Union Pacific's nearby coal deposits lured thousands of immigrant laborers to the mines and railyards as the company neared the completion of the transcontinental railroad.

As a result, Rock Springs has long proudly called itself the ""Home of 56 nationalities."" It's had an International Day celebration for more than a hundred years.

Rock Springs turns a corner

But now, the town is digging up this part of its migrant history and finding new ways to shed light on a dark moment in its past.

A new statue was dedicated this fall to mark the 140th anniversary commemoration already memorializing the 55 other nationalities whose labor in the coal mines also built the town.

Until recently, Rock Springs' main monument was a small plaque fixed to a boulder to recognize the 28 killed in the massacre. But it sits on a grassy median, turned away from the road that passes by the site of the old Chinatown, making it easy to miss.

Over Labor Day weekend, the town unveiled a much more prominent monument to commemorate the 140th anniversary.

""[The] bronze statue 'Requiem,' standing more than seven feet tall, depicts a Chinese miner amidst the ruins of Chinatown, holding the remnants of a ceremonial dragon flag,"" Rock Springs Mayor Max Mickelson read during the statue dedication. He was joined by his town council, which for the most part, supported the statue.

The town's growing acknowledgement of its past comes at an odd time for a county that voted 76% for the president in 2024, which since being reelected has tried to erase negative depictions of the country's past.

Local students, who now learn about the massacre at school, helped host the more than 200 attendees at the statue ceremony while the county's two history museums helped fundraise for the statue.

A memorial like this one is long overdue, according to the mayor.

At the same time, he acknowledges the irony of honoring the town's migrant history while Sweetwater County, home to Rock Springs, cracks down and renews contracts with ICE, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Wyoming's state highway patrol and National Guard followed suit earlier this summer.

""As someone who is a descendant of immigrants that came to this country from Europe, I find it very frustrating that as a country we have decided to take an anti-immigrant stance,"" Mickelson said.

Like 76% of the county he lives in, Mickelson voted for President Trump in 2024. But he said the crackdown wasn't what he voted for.

""We have real problem areas where those resources would be better put than tracking down somebody who is here working, putting up stucco,"" Mickelson said.

He'd rather see resources directed toward the drug and human tracking that have recently plagued his town.

As a self-dubbed ""Old School Republican"" and a critic of the president's immigration policies, Mickelson said it's an awkward time to be a member of the party.

The mayor has several friends who migrated to Rock Springs as teenagers and have since received citizenship. Immigrant labor is still important to his town, which now relies on mining the mineral trona, used in baking soda, trona mining rather than coal, with just under 20% of residents Hispanic or Latino, according to the Census Bureau.

""We don't love America any more than those people. They worked really hard to get here,"" Mickelson said.

Descendants of the massacre join the commemoration

This summer, Ricky and Grace Leo returned to their hometown of Rock Springs to join the archaeology dig.

Despite growing up there, it wasn't until 2019 that the couple learned about the massacre — and that they have ties to it.

""We didn't know that we were related to the people that died in the massacre,"" Grace said.

The massacre wasn't something the couple learned about when they attended the local high school.

A chance run in with Rock Springs archaeologist Dudley Gardner at a history conference, considered one of the experts on the massacre and western Chinatowns, turned into the Leos later becoming one of the hosts of this fall's commemoration.

At the Labor Day ceremony honoring those who died in the massacre, traditional lion dancers performed and visitors from across the country recited the names of those killed with traditional blessings. The Leo family organized lectures, ceremonial blessing rituals and cooking demonstrations ahead of the unveiling of the statue.

Ng has also made the effort to reach out to the descendants of the massacre and the survivors. At least five made it to the ceremony, the majority of whom had never heard about the massacre until recently.

Robert Lew, who lives in California, was one of them.

He knew his father grew up orphaned in Rock Springs. But only learned at 75 years old, after talking with the archaeologists, that his ancestors also made a life in the Wyoming town much earlier.

""In terms of [learning about] my great-grandfather and 1885 in the massacre, that was only two weeks ago, three weeks ago,"" Lew said. His daughter Beth Lew-Williams is an esteemed scholar of Chinese-American history.

While here, Lew talked with a young man from Rock Springs, who said he was glad to see his community become more familiar with the massacre.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x900+0+83/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2F07%2F041bdbb34e09b731ed1750dfb701%2Flion.png,N,,2025-09-28 11:57:42.914710

The White House asked for a 65% increase for the Department of Homeland Security.
In a shutdown, agencies that interact directly with individuals and provide government services would largely suspend operations or face budget shortfalls.
He served in the same role atop the White House budget office in the first Trump administration.
“This is a way of culling the herd of the federal regulatory agencies.” That’s largely consistent with what Vought outlined in Project 2025.","Under the Trump administration’s plans for a government shutdown, the Labor Department would cut off most activities — then fire thousands of employees. National parks would close, and their staffs could face layoffs. Phone help lines at the Internal Revenue Service would go unstaffed, perhaps permanently.

National Guard deployments to major cities — D.C., Memphis and Portland — would continue. Immigration raids and deportation activities would be unaffected, though officers would work unpaid.

If Congress fails to fund the government next week, the White House is preparing for a shutdown that would reflect the purest version of President Donald Trump’s vision for the federal government, guided by White House budget director Russell Vought, an architect of the controversial Project 2025 playbook for Trump’s second term.

Federal funds expire when the fiscal year ends Tuesday night, and Congress appears deadlocked over a stopgap measure that would keep agencies online for seven weeks while long-term negotiations continue.

Under the Vought plan, the only agencies that would remain operating apace are those that received money in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the $4.1 trillion tax and immigration package that Congress passed in July. The Defense and Homeland Security departments were the main beneficiaries.

The result, both during and potentially after a shutdown, could be a federal government dramatically reoriented to defense, immigration and law enforcement — and not much else.

“Trump is pretty clear about this and Russ Vought has been clear for his entire career,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and periodic Trump adviser. “They want a smaller government. They would like to get back to a balanced budget. … They think that many government programs are inefficient or actually destructive, and they are prepared to aggressively pursue every opportunity that the left gives them to reshape the government.”

Traditionally in government shutdowns, employees considered vital to public safety and protecting government property continue to work unpaid, and those who are not are furloughed until Congress approves new agency funding.

But Vought earlier this week told agencies to prepare for mass firings if a shutdown takes hold, and even after that to “retain the minimal number of employees necessary.”

Representatives from the White House and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment.

Many Republicans, including OMB officials, say the cuts are avoidable. The GOP-controlled House passed a funding patch free of partisan policy riders earlier in September. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, but need Democratic votes to head off a filibuster; Democrats in the upper chamber say they won’t consider a federal financing bill that does not include renewed subsidies for health insurance programs.

“We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown,” OMB wrote to agencies this week, “and the steps outlined above [layoffs] will not be necessary.”

But Trump’s budget, released in May, calls for substantial cuts along the same lines. The White House asked Congress to dock the annual appropriation for the State Department by nearly 84%, the Department of Housing and Urban Development by more than 43%, and the Labor Department by roughly 35%.

The White House asked for a 65% increase for the Department of Homeland Security. The GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill included more than $160 billion for immigration restrictions, largely for DHS, though that funding is spread over several years.

Trump’s annual budget also set specific desired staffing levels for each federal agency. It called for a 5% staffing cut across the federal government for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, compared with the final fiscal year of the Biden administration.

That would eliminate more than 114,000 jobs, while adding several thousand for immigration enforcement and border security. Five agencies — responsible for helping homeless Americans, administering foreign aid, investigating chemical safety incidents, protecting consumers from unsafe products and more — would have no staff under Trump’s May budget, and 14 other agencies would lose at least a third of their employees.

Congress has not approved that framework, nor any annual financing bills, giving Vought and the White House broad latitude to shape the federal government’s operations if funding lapses.

In a shutdown, agencies that interact directly with individuals and provide government services would largely suspend operations or face budget shortfalls.

The anti-hunger program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, generally keeps some contingency funds on hand, but those can run out after a number of weeks. Federal housing subsidy programs could face similar funding crunches.

The Small Business Administration would largely halt issuing new loans or providing support for existing loans. Agencies that review permits for everything from public demonstrations to transportation projects would be shuttered.

Programs that do not rely on annual appropriations are unaffected in a shutdown. Those include benefits and staff for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

Those social safety net programs are the main driver of the United States’ $37.4 trillion of debt, not the federal workforce or agency spending.

The U.S. spent $6.8 trillion in the last completed fiscal year; $4.1 trillion of that amount was tied to benefit programs, not the individual agencies that Congress funds each year.

Of that agency spending, the Defense Department — with Trump and the GOP’s budget bill supercharged with $168 billion in additional resources — receives more than half the funding.

Some Republicans have for years hoped to leverage shutdowns to winnow the government workforce. Federal personnel officials classify employees without jobs in public safety or national security as “nonessential” during shutdowns. Those workers are furloughed, but entitled to back pay when Congress approves fresh funding. “Essential” employees — including military service members, transportation security screeners and law enforcement officers — work unpaid.

“If we’re running a big budget deficit and we can’t pay our bills and we have all these nonessential workers, then let’s not have all of them,” said Stephen Moore, a conservative economist and informal Trump policy adviser.

“It makes little sense to furlough many and then pay everybody for not being there. Why would you do that to the taxpayers? What you do is say, ‘What are the jobs that we don’t want?’” said Grover Norquist, an anti-tax crusader and conservative political operative. “And this is a political decision. The president got elected to do this stuff in the executive branch.”

Vought’s layoff threat follows what the U.S. DOGE Service attempted in the early months of Trump’s second term. Tech entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy declared in a November op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that their organization’s goals were to implement “regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings.”

DOGE accomplished little of that, according to nonpartisan analyses of the group’s activities, and Republican lawmakers privately lament the lost potential — and political headaches — of Musk’s high-visibility “move fast and break things” ethos.

But Vought, people in and around the administration say, has been quietly potent, drawing on four years out of government to surgically plan measures that overhaul the executive branch and Trump’s power. He served in the same role atop the White House budget office in the first Trump administration.

“He’s been thinking about it for years, spent the four years in the wilderness, trying to think through how to dramatically shrink and reshape the federal government,” Gingrich said. “And while for a brief period he was overshadowed by Elon Musk, the fact is that the steady work at OMB has been extraordinary in beginning to move the government away from big government, socialism and centralized bureaucracy, and back towards a much more limited government and a more decentralized government and a government with lot less regulatory power.”

Agencies that Republicans feel have stymied economic growth or trained harsh scrutiny on favored industries could face the largest cuts in a shutdown, Moore said.

“If you don’t have the regulators, they can’t regulate,” Moore said. “This is a way of culling the herd of the federal regulatory agencies.”

That’s largely consistent with what Vought outlined in Project 2025. “The modern conservative president’s task,” he wrote, “is to limit, control and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people.”",,N,,2025-09-28 18:57:14.078305

That is why the court treats it as an emergency when a lower federal court blocks a Trump administration policy.","With so many things happening everywhere all at once, the start of a new supreme court term on 6 October may be flying under the radar. It shouldn’t.

The state of checks and balances in the country is among the more ominous indicators of the health of America’s democracy: in the executive branch is a president who is keen on exercising every lever of power that he has – as well as some he does not – to enrich himself and his allies and to suppress dissent and political opposition. The legislature is dominated by a regime-friendly political party that is too happy to roll over and accede to the president’s wishes, repeatedly failing to exercise the congressional powers that could rein in the executive branch.

Because the executive and legislature branches seem to have jumped the constitutional shark, some people continue to hold out hope that the judicial branch, with the supreme court at its apex, will offer a way out of this mess. That would be a mistake: like Congress, the Republican majority on the supreme court has lined up behind most of the president’s sweeping assertions of novel powers. The supreme court has blocked lower federal court rulings that had reined in the president’s authority to withhold federal medical research grants for ideological reasons. It has allowed the executive branch to deploy roving immigration patrols to engage in racial profiling; to expel noncitizens to countries on the brink of civil wars where they could face torture, trafficking or death; to fire non-regime friendly officials (in violation of federal law); to dismantle entire departments and more.

But one specific case on the court’s docket for this term illustrates its role in a more far-reaching rightwing project that goes back all the way to the end of the civil war.

Louisiana v Callais is a major challenge to what remains of the Voting Rights of Act of 1965, and could radically rework the structure of political representation in the United States. A successful challenge to the VRA would allow the Republican party to further cheat democracy by engaging in even more partisan gerrymandering and erasing several legislative districts held by Democratic officials, many of whom are racial minorities.

Callais arises out of the 2020 redistricting process, when Louisiana, like other states, drew new congressional maps. The resulting maps gave Black voters fewer opportunities to elect the candidates of their choice than white voters, significantly diluting their voting power.

Louisiana has six congressional representatives in a state that is about one-third Black, but drew maps that allowed Black voters to select only one-sixth of the state’s representatives. Lower courts concluded the maps violated section two of the VRA. Passed during the civil rights movement to address a long history of disenfranchisement, the VRA prohibits voting policies that have the effect of disadvantaging Black voters, including in electoral representation. In response to these judicial decisions, the Louisiana legislature took another crack at maps that accomplished its partisan objectives – such as preserving Republican speaker of the house Mike Johnson’s seat – while also affording Black voters political opportunities. A group of white voters challenged those maps as unconstitutional racial discrimination. Their theory was that the legislature, by trying to ensure both Black voters and white voters were represented, had somehow discriminated against white voters.

The case is even bigger than a fight about the future of the VRA; it is also bigger than the Republican party’s decades-long campaign against the VRA. The case is part of a broad effort to not only reinterpret the Reconstruction amendments – the constitutional amendments passed after the civil war to ensure equal rights and due process – but also to weaponize them against democracy and civil rights. That conflict is being waged in both the supreme court and the White House, and its roots go back more than a century to the aftermath of the civil war.

The big picture helps to underscore what is at stake: the future of the United States as a multiracial democracy.

The story of Louisiana v Callais begins with the project of Reconstruction, the effort to reconstitute the United States after the civil war and the end of slavery. Reconstruction was an ambitious undertaking that sought to integrate Black Americans into the polity and to protect their rights against the states and political movements that already wanted to claw them back on the heels of the civil war.

Part of this era entailed the passage and ratification of the Reconstruction amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments that outlawed slavery, guaranteed equal protection, and prohibited racial discrimination in voting, among other things. The people who drafted the 15th amendment saw the measure as a way to allow Black voters “to choose from among his fellow citizens the man who suits him for his representative”, as senator John F Edmunds put it in 1869. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson detailed in an oral argument a few years ago, a report submitted by a congressional committee on Reconstruction said “that the entire point” of the project was to secure rights of formerly enslaved people. “The legislature who introduced [the 14th] amendment said: ‘Unless the constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen,’” Jackson said.

Reconstruction was an ambitious project that produced real gains. Within a few years, former Confederate states sent Black representatives and senators to Congress and elected Black leaders to state political offices. The federal military conducted voter registration drives in the south; through Freedmen’s Bureau offices, the federal government helped set up thousands of schools that educated hundreds of thousands of children who had been enslaved.

In part because of these successes, Reconstruction encountered resistance that became violent. That included the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, which enforced racial hierarchy through a campaign of terror.

The many varied opponents of Reconstruction channeled several talking points. One was the idea that the very project of Reconstruction was too radical and had to be limited so as to preserve a pre-existing constitutional order of white supremacy that Reconstruction had sought to remake. The anti-Reconstruction movement scored important victories with supreme court decisions from the late 1800s that narrowly interpreted provisions in the 14th amendment and weakened the federal government’s oversight of states’ regulation of elections.

Another anti-Reconstruction trope was the notion that federal civil rights protections were no longer needed since slavery was a thing of the past. And, this line of argument continued, because federal protections for Black freedmen were unnecessary, retaining the protections was actually unfair to the people who were prohibited from disenfranchising or discriminating against them. Along these lines, when Andrew Johnson vetoed a congressional statute, he insisted that since slavery had been “abrogated”, federal protections for freedmen therefore “operated in favor of the colored and against the white race”. When the supreme court invalidated the Reconstruction-era Civil Rights Act in 1883, it, too, insisted that the time for federal civil rights protections for freedmen was up, since “there must be some stage in the progress of [freedmen’s] elevation when he takes the rank of a mere citizen and ceases to be the special favorite of the laws.” (This was less than two decades after the end of the civil war.)

In short, opponents of Reconstruction tried to weaponize the principles of Reconstruction against it. Southern sympathizers maintained that prohibiting former Confederate states and Confederates from discriminating against Black Americans was itself a kind of discrimination – discrimination against the Confederate states and would-be discriminators.

This logic has endured: decades later, white business owners even challenged the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits businesses from engaging in racial discrimination, as a violation of the 13th amendment, which prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude.

Civil rights organizers and leaders continued to press forward the vision that Reconstruction offered. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was a milestone in their efforts. The VRA had two main elements: section two, prohibited voting discrimination on a nationwide basis. The other, section five, required certain jurisdictions with especially bad histories of voting discrimination to get federal permission before changing their voting laws or policies. The latter system was known as preclearance.

The VRA had barely become law before the modern Republican party decided to attack the statute and to specifically use the federal courts to do so. President Richard Nixon opposed renewing the preclearance process; members of his administration referred to it as “punitive” legislation – arguing, essentially, that it was unfair to, and discriminated against, the former Confederate states. Nixon reportedly promised to appoint supreme court justices who would not make the south a “whipping boy” (of all things) on civil rights; to the supreme court, he appointed a southerner, Lewis Powell, who would later warn that expansive interpretations of the VRA would turn American “cities into jungles”. Nixon also appointed William Rehnquist, who was accused of challenging Black and Latino men’s voting credentials during elections. (Rehnquist denied doing so).

Later Republican administrations continued the fight against the VRA. Ronald Reagan also opposed renewing the law, referring to it as “vindictive, selective” and “humilitary [sic]” to the poor former Confederacy. His assistant attorney general called the VRA’s protections against voting discrimination a kind of “government-imposed discrimination”. (Again the same refrain: anti-discrimination is the new discrimination.) His administration produced a legal document warning that expansive interpretations of the Reconstruction amendments, which allowed Congress to adopt expansive civil rights protections, had “extreme consequences” and must be rejected. The Reagan administration hired a young Samuel Alito after he professed interest in apportionment, or how legislatures draw districts. The administration also hired a young John Roberts who helped the administration’s (unsuccessful) effort to oppose renewing and expanding the VRA. Both men are now poised to decide whether section two of the VRA can limit how states apportion representation.

This effort – to weaponize the principles of equality against it – would return with Bush v Gore, the case that halted Florida’s efforts to accurately count the votes in the 2000 presidential election and, in the process, handed the presidency to George W Bush. Bush’s litigation team argued that manually recounting votes in the jurisdictions affected by lingering uncertainty resulting from machine tabulation was a denial of equal protection. Their argument was that manually recounting ballots only in those areas affected by tabulation uncertainties was unequal – in other words: “equal” protection required potentially disenfranchising voters in the affected areas, which had comparatively large groups of minority voters. The lawyers who pressed this theory included Roberts, Amy Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, all of whom now sit on the supreme court.

The Trump administration has picked up these ideas and pushed them to further extremes. In an array of executive orders and guidance letters, the administration has insisted that civil rights laws actually prohibit measures that are designed to achieve equality. It has invoked federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination to insist that schools must discriminate against certain speech. It has decided that federal anti-discrimination law bars efforts designed to achieve diverse schools and businesses. It has argued that federal anti-discrimination measures actually require some discrimination against some disfavored groups.

The Roberts court has channeled these same ideas into its decisions. It was unfair and unequal to “punish” the south, Roberts wrote for the Republican justices who invalidated the preclearance process in 2013. That system was too extreme in giving the federal government that kind of control over elections, he added.

True equality, the Roberts court has ruled, actually requires a prohibition on schools trying to achieve diverse student bodies by considering applicants’ race. The time for schools’ race-conscious measures designed to achieve racial diversity and representation is over, according to this court.

So too is the time for protecting the rights of minority voters, the court said when it invalidated the VRA’s preclearance system in 2013. Preclearance was no longer necessary, the court said, because section two’s nationwide ban on voting discrimination could do all the work.

But the court has decided to consider whether section two’s time is up as well. In 2023, Kavanaugh openly stated that Congress’s authority to “authorize race-based redistricting … cannot extend indefinitely into the future”. He was referring to the VRA’s requirement that legislatures ensure Black voters are represented, not to legislatures’ frequent practice of ensuring (only) white voters are represented. The latter is apparently neutral and fine, whereas the former is seen as suspect. No wonder Justice Elena Kagan remarked in an oral argument that “in recent years”, the VRA “has fared not well in this court”.

Which brings us to Louisiana v Callais. Multiple courts relied on section two of the VRA to strike down a set of legislative maps that did not afford Black voters with equal rights or equal opportunities as white voters. That set off a redistricting process where the Louisiana legislature had to ensure the state’s maps provided Black voters with political representation.

Now the supreme court is being asked to find section two illegal – to say that considering political equality is a kind of discrimination. The argument is that prohibiting legislatures from discriminating against Black voters, by denying them political opportunities, actually discriminates against white voters.

Callais is emblematic of several themes that have defined the work of the Roberts court to date and that the court will expand upon still. Front and center is the notion of conservative grievance – the idea that Republican constituencies are the real victims of subordination today, their power diminished by pluralism, modernity, civil rights, democracy, you name it. Conservative grievance imagines that there is no discrimination except for discrimination against white, Christian conservatives and the super rich. That’s not reality, as there is no evidence of widespread discrimination against white people.

The conservative grievance mindset insists that the constitution and civil rights laws protect social and religious conservatives’ prejudices. The idea is that if you squint hard enough, it turns out that civil rights protections actually prohibit measures that are designed to secure civil rights.

The court has played a pivotal role in the rightwing project translating these grievances into a redesign of American law and politics. In cases on racial discrimination, the court has insisted that measures prohibiting racial discrimination actually discriminate against white people. In cases on LGBTQ+ equality, the court has insisted that measures prohibiting discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual people actually discriminate against religious and social conservatives who are opposed to LGBTQ+ equality. In addition to Callais, another case on the court’s docket for this term invites more of this thinking: that case asks whether it is unconstitutional to prohibit conversion practices that seek to counsel people out of being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender – a form of “therapy” a UN expert has said can amount to torture. The court will also consider whether federal civil rights protections against sex discrimination permit – or even require – discrimination on the basis of gender identity, against trans student athletes.

The reality of the court’s shadow docket – the set of orders and decisions the court issues without full briefing, oral argument, advance notice and often on an emergency basis – is that we do not know which other matters will make their way up to the court over the next year. The shadow docket is one of the primary vehicles the court has used to weigh in on much of the litigation concerning the Trump administration – and specifically to block lower court rulings and greenlight many of the administration’s claims of new, sweeping presidential authority.

In the last three months alone, the shadow docket is where the court allowed the administration to continue to withhold almost $800m in medical research grants; to fire officials in violation of federal law; to take steps to dismantle the Department of Education; to have roving immigration patrols engage in racial profiling and more. In one of the many cases where the court’s Republican appointees voted in favor of the Trump administration on the shadow docket, Justice Jackson wrote what the supreme court is doing is “Calvinball but with a twist”. In Calvinball, the fictional game played in the Calvin and Hobbes comics, there are no rules. Here, there is one rule – “this administration always wins”, Jackson quipped.

But the supreme court’s governing rule may be a little broader and even more terrifying than that. The Republican justices seem to think that not only are Republicans entitled to power, they are also entitled to use that power to do whatever they want. That is why the court treats it as an emergency when a lower federal court blocks a Trump administration policy.

That is also why the court seems to look at the VRA’s prohibitions on racial discrimination as illegitimate. This is also another iteration of the Republican justices’ refrain that the constitution is colorblind – that it does not permit officials to take race into account for any reason.

The theory is a work of historical fiction: as Jackson illustrated by pointedly quoting from Congress’s report on Reconstruction, Reconstructionist lawmakers argued that the Reconstruction amendments authorized measures that would benefit Black Americans, rectify discrimination against them, and prevent future discrimination as well. Moreover, the “colorblind” theory has been somewhat less than colorblind in practice. In the context of the VRA case, for example, “colorblind” constitutionalism would permit legislatures to redistrict in ways that result in white voters being overrepresented, but would prohibit laws from requiring legislatures to ensure that Black voters are represented as well. That is not being colorblind; it is racial hierarchy. In the recent past, “colorblind” constitutionalism has led the court to say that colleges considering race as one factor in an applicant’s file to ensure colleges are diverse is unconstitutional, but immigration officers considering race as one factor in who to detain and deport is perfectly legal.

So-called colorblind constitutionalism has always been a tool to reinforce Republicans’ power. A century ago, it was a way of resurrecting the Confederacy and dismantling Reconstruction. Soon it could pave the way for the end of the law that made the United States a multiracial democracy.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e2cfb4355401d5915777012dc43730c9ce3410/266_129_2506_2005/master/2506.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29213e4bcb105b9ad229b8b7d7722a24",N,,2025-09-28 12:57:49.398631

KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

In an early-morning post on Truth Social, Trump said he has authorized “full force” if necessary to protect “War ravaged Portland.”

Saturday’s announcement is the latest move the president has made in deploying troops in cities and states run by Democrats.

In his post, Trump said the decision was made to protect the city and ICE facilities “under siege by ANTIFA, and other domestic terrorists.”

An increase in federal agents was already witnessed on Friday. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson held a press conference Friday night, acknowledging the buildup and pushing back on the controversial deployment, calling it a “big show.”

“I want to be clear about the situation we face. We now have a sudden influx of federal agents in our city. We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose,” Wilson said.

KATU recorded one incident where an ICE officer, seemingly unprovoked, shoved a protester to the ground. It is unclear what was said, if anything, prior to the confrontation.

Instances of physical confrontation and loud noise into late hours of the night outside of the ICE building are why some area residents believe more federal troops should be brought into the area.

""Every night, there's tons of protesters basically being vagrants on the street,"" David Schmidt, a Portland resident said. ""The people that live in all these buildings right here have hell to go through. They are making noise constantly, even when nobody from ICE is outside. So for hours, they would be out here just disrupting the public here that lives here.""

Others believe a greater presence of federal officers will do the opposite of protecting the peace, referencing to the protests across Portland in 2020.

""I just remember watching night after night, everything that was going on with the interactions between police and protestors, and I'm just worried that we're going to see things blow up like they did in 2020,"" Portland resident Ocean Hosojasso said. ""It's because our president and the federal government, they're looking for a fight.""

The move is not without precedent. The Trump Administration has deployed the National Guard and other active-duty troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. He has also threatened to deploy troops to several other cities, like Chicago and Memphis, Tenn.

The President has also ramped up his rhetoric against Portland in recent weeks, saying that living in Portland is “like living in hell.”

Some people protesting outside of the ICE facility said they are rallying to prove that statement untrue.

""I know that our city gets this loud and unfair reputation that 'everything 's on fire,' 'everything's a disaster,' but you come here and it's peaceful,"" Hosojosso said.

The number of troops being deployed to the city and the overall objective are still unknown.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley warned the public that Trump would try to create chaos, . “Don’t take the bait,” he said.

“Our responsibility is to, yes, express our views. Yes, protest,” Merkley said. ""But best done at a distance from these federal troops, wherever they might be and whatever they are doing, because their goal is to create an engagement, an engagement that will lead to conflict.”

Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago but has yet to follow through. A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Trump’s crackdown on crime or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops' arrival. Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.

Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to requests for information, according to AP.

stated that the order to send troops to Portland ""came as a surprise to many in the Pentagon,"" and that many officials were not sure what the orders actually entailed.

The source said they expect the deployment to look similar to Los Angeles and Washington's National Guard missions, which were focused on ""supporting federal and local law enforcement,"" mainly through logistical support.

A history of protests in Portland

Portland has been at the in the past for protests, some of which became violent, especially following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police in 2020.

The Trump administration sent hundreds of agents at the time, including U.S. Border Patrol officers, to protect federal property from vandalism.

Recent protests have been

Earlier this month, after it was used to detain people overnight or for more than 12 hours, which is a violation of its conditional land use approval.

KATU crews reported a few protesters outside the ICE building on Saturday morning, all standing across the street.

""You can do something,"" Bonnie Berg said outside of the ICE facility. 'Show up. Put your body on the streets. Show people that you care about humanity. It makes a difference.""

The Trump administration claimed that this year, while a video surfaced late August showing a protester outside the building.

In response to a KATU inquiry to the White House regarding when troops would be deployed and what their tasks will be, a spokesperson responded with a timeline of different protests this year at the ICE facility, starting in early June.

Local officials respond

Portland officials have strongly opposed President Trump's proposal to deploy federal troops to the city, arguing that such a move is unnecessary and could escalate tensions.

At a press conference held on Saturday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek stated, ""There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city."" She emphasized that while the Oregon National Guard is prepared to protect residents, it is not needed in Portland.

Mayor Keith Wilson echoed this sentiment, asserting, ""The number of necessary troops is zero in Portland and any other American city.""

Both leaders criticized the use of outdated media coverage such as old protest clips circulating online to misrepresent the city and called for federal support in areas like education and infrastructure instead of military intervention.

They stressed the importance of peaceful protest and community support, urging residents to oppose the administration's policies constructively. Wilson concluded, ""We have a place at the table for everyone willing to lend us a hand and that should include the federal government.""

""Everybody has a right to peacefully assemble,"" Hosojosso said. ""Everyone has freedom of speech, and it's your God-given duty to use those rights, and if you don't use them, then your first amendment rights are going to be a trophy.""

Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, representing Oregon's First Congressional District, joined the call against federal troop deployment, describing it as a ""gross abuse of power by the president.""

She noted, ""Nowhere did I see one single indication that we need military troops here."" Bonamici highlighted Portland as a thriving community, stating, ""It's a place where here today we see the sun shining, people out in the streets, shopping in our stores, going to our amazing restaurants.""

Portland's Chief of Police Bob Day reaffirmed the city's commitment to peace and safety, ""The men and women of the police bureau will continue to show up and to provide the highest level of service and safety to ensure peace for Portland, for all Portlanders.""

Day emphasized the city's track record of peaceful protests and the bureau's non-involvement in immigration enforcement.

Vanessa Sturgeon, representing the Portland Metro Chamber and the Downtown Portland Clean and Safe, expressed the business owner community's opposition to federal troop deployment.

""Portland is a city on the rise,"" she said. ""We are working to tackle our biggest challenges together. We don't always agree, but we do agree that we love this city and it does not need federal troops.""

""We don't want our retail hospitality and vibrancy to be impacted like we see in Washington, DC,"" she said.

Things appeared to be peaceful, with members of the group mostly standing around while music played in the background. A couple kicked a soccer ball around in the street.

It should be noted that neighbors are done with it. Many have talked to KGW over the past few months about the nightly noise, the tear gas, the pepper balls. One nearby school even relocated because the use of chemicals and munitions went onto the school grounds, making the area unsafe. They're fed up.

There was one new development Saturday night. KGW received multiple calls from neighbors in that area about what appeared to be multiple helicopters flying overhead, something that was confirmed by KGW's crew at the scene. KGW has been unable to confirm with officials who's operating them, or where they came from.

There have been no confirmed reports of any additional military personnel in the city. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she has not authorized the National Guard to deploy to the city, and neither the White House nor the Pentagon have given any kind of timeline around when, or if, the troops could arrive.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told The Associated Press that the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available. ""We stand ready to mobilize U.S. military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President’s direction,"" Parnell said.

A spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard, Lt. Col. Stephen Bomar, said via email to The Associated Press that ""no official requests have been received at this time"" for Guard support. ""Any requests would need to be coordinated through the Governor’s office,"" he added.

Immigrants born in 1990 had a significantly lower incarceration risk than native-born Americans for all races and ethnicities born in the same year.
All (legal plus illegal) Hispanic, Asian, Black, and white immigrants as groups each have a lower incarceration rate than white native-born Americans.
Immigrants are not driving a crime wave in the US.","Fear of street crime and criminals is a politically charged issue. Politicians stoke that fear to gain the consent of voters, from the anti-Black Willie Horton commercial ads of US GOP President George H. W. Bush against Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidential campaign of 1988 to President Donald Trump’s 2016 and 2024 successful runs for the White House. After decades of economic globalization and climate disruptions, the tough-on-crime platform has evolved from anti-Blackness to migrant demonization. While the former remains central to US politics, the latter demonizes the national origin of criminals, actual and fictional, right up to the president castigating immigration as an invasion creating social ruination at the United Nations recently.

How does such rhetoric match up with data on incarceration for immigrants and the native-born in the US.? We turn to a new study from the Cato Institute, a contributor to the Department of Government Efficiency, a wrecking ball on federal programs and workforce, and Project 2025, the Trump White House’s playbook for restructuring US democracy.

Cato scholars Alex Nowrasteh and Krit Chanwong analyzed annual data from the American Community Survey and found that incarceration rates for immigrants are far lower than those for the native-born.

To this end the duo plotted “the incarceration risk for individuals born in 1990 by immigration status. For the 1990 cohort, native-born Americans were 267% more likely to be incarcerated than immigrants by age 33. Eleven percent of native-born Americans in that year-born cohort have been incarcerated compared to just 3% of immigrants. Other countries really are sending their best.”

In contrast, White House border czar Tom Homan is involved with federal immigration raids that, according to him, are “targeting the worst of the worst.” Homan allegedly took $50,000 in a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting recently.

What about the incarceration risks for immigrants and native-born Americans who are Asian, Hispanic, Black, and white?

Immigrants born in 1990 had a significantly lower incarceration risk than native-born Americans for all races and ethnicities born in the same year. All (legal plus illegal) Hispanic, Asian, Black, and white immigrants as groups each have a lower incarceration rate than white native-born Americans. Asian illegal immigrants have the lowest incarceration risks at around 0.08%.

Here’s a reason why immigrants may have lower incarceration rates. “Noncitizen criminals who are incarcerated are deported after serving their sentences,” according to Alex Nowrasteh and Krit Chanwong, “which means they don’t respond to future American surveys because they are no longer on American soil. Put another way, our study measures whether the respondents have ever been incarcerated.”

All things equal, one thing is clear. Immigrants are not driving a crime wave in the US. There is a wave of corporate crime stateside, however, with companies such as Boeing and its 737 MAX aircraft crashes a case in point.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=55673576&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-09-28 11:57:52.910594

Trump announced Saturday morning he plans to send troops to Portland at the request of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The president said he directed War Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide “all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” adding he was authorizing full force, if necessary.

Hours later, Wilson said during a news conference the number of necessary troops is “zero” in Portland, “and any other American city.”

“This is an American city,” Wilson said. “We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target.”

The mayor alleged the president would “not find” lawlessness or violence in the city, claiming video footage showing violence in the city was from five years ago was “recycled and then recycled again.”

“If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries or produce from a farmers’ market,” Wilson said. “We’ve had hard conversations, and we’ve done important work in the years since that footage was taken, we reformed our public safety system. We’ve refocused our community and on our economy, and we’ve redoubled our efforts to help our most vulnerable.”

Since June, protests have erupted near an ICE facility in Portland, where city officials cited land use violations, including improper detainee holding times and boarded-up windows.

The building has been vandalized with anti-ICE graffiti and clashes between protesters and federal agents have occasionally turned violent, leading to the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs.

Video obtained by Fox News Digital confirmed another violent protest in August, with footage showing protesters rolling out a guillotine, lighting fires and fighting with authorities — forcing law enforcement to disperse the crowd with munitions.

Instead of sending troops to protect the federal facility, Wilson suggested the president send “hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers” to Portland instead of a “short, expensive and fruitless show of force.”

“I am so deeply disappointed with the federal government’s irresponsibility,” he said. “At the end of the day, this may be a show of force, but that’s all it is. It’s a big show, and after the big show, everyone goes home. That’s what I want to happen here today in Portland. We have a long and proud tradition of peaceful protest. We have a long and proud track record of being at the forefront of positive social change.”

“There are new risks today, risks that we do not yet fully understand,” he continued. “The administration has refused to elaborate on what they mean when they say they will deploy full force against our city and citizens.”

In his announcement on Saturday, Trump did not say he would deploy full force against the city of Portland and its citizens, as Wilson claimed.

The president said he would send “all necessary troops” to protect the city and its ICE facilities, authorizing full force against domestic terrorism “if necessary.”

Portland, a sanctuary city since 2017, has resisted federal immigration enforcement, making it a focal point during the administration’s immigration enforcement initiative.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Wilson, warning the city’s sanctuary policies undermine U.S. interests. She demanded Portland affirm compliance with federal law and end practices that obstruct immigration enforcement.

In petitions submitted to the high court on Friday, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to hear arguments on the issue early next year, which would likely result in a ruling by June.

If the high court acquiesces in that schedule, it would effectively highlight Trump's anti-birthright citizenship drive months before the Congressional midterm elections that will be pivotal for Trump to keep carrying out his agenda, as reported by Politico.

A ruling in the US President's favour would be a major victory for his immigration agenda, while a defeat would allow him to blame the justices for blocking one of his key priorities.

Trump expressed urgency on the issue by signing an anti-birthright executive order on his first day back in office in January, but it has never been implemented because four federal judges hearing lawsuits over the effort ruled that it clearly violates the 14th Amendment and longstanding Supreme Court precedent.

""The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists, and temporary visitors,"" Sauer wrote. ""The plain text of the Clause requires more than birth on US soil alone,"" Politico reported.

However, all the district court judges who have considered the issue in recent months rejected that position, often in withering terms. They pointed to a broad legal consensus that nearly everyone born in the US acquires citizenship automatically at birth. The leading Supreme Court case on the issue, Wong Kim Ark v. US, held that a child born in the US to parents from China was entitled to US citizenship.

The Trump administration brought several birthright citizenship cases to the Supreme Court earlier this year, but only to ask the justices to use them as a vehicle to narrow the practice of individual federal judges issuing nationwide injunctions to block federal government policies. The high court granted that request in a 6-3 ruling in June, but did not opine on whether the underlying Trump policy is constitutional, Politico reported. (ANI)

It appears to show ICE officers pinning a man to the ground in Hyattsville in the middle of an intersection. During the scuffle, an agent's firearm appears to get loose and once retrieved, the agent seems to point it toward bystanders.

In a statement from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the agency tells WJZ Job Arias-Mendoza was arrested Sept. 24, calling him a ""dangerous criminal"". The agency says he entered the United States illegally from El Salvador at an unknown date and time. It also says Arias-Mendoza has prior arrests for first-degree assault, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, concealing a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.

The nine-minute video showing Arias-Mendoza's arrest has drawn some concern on social media and in Hyattsville. It seems he was yelling ""help me"" to bystanders, as well as shouting ""I am American. I love America"".

DHS says Arias-Mendoza actively resisted federal law enforcement and attempted to bite an officer. He also had multiple knives and drugs in his possession, according to the agency.

In a video showing the struggle, an ICE officer has his gun drawn before putting it in his belt. Seconds later it appears to get loose and fall onto the street. After a brief tussle, the officer retrieves the firearm and appears to point it at bystanders.

Witnesses confront officers

Later in the video, officers appear to answer questions yelled by the crowd.

When asked why ICE is arresting Arias-Mendoza, an officer says, ""Because he is a criminal, how about that?""

One bystander asked why the firearm was pointed at the crowd, the officer defended his actions saying, ""You were coming…I don't know you. I have to protect my people"".

At the end of the video, another officer seems to walk toward bystanders, asking if they want to be next.

Halle Blitzstein is an immigration attorney who is not affiliated with this case. She says ICE officers can use force if warranted during an arrest.

""If they have the reasonable grounds to believe that force is necessary to protect themselves or other persons,"" Blitzstein said. ""But in that video, it looks like the weapon fell out of the holster, and then everything got out of control.""

The case involves five migrants who were deported from the United States to Ghana on Sept. 5 as part of a third-country deportation deal.
A bisexual man from Gambia, K.S., has already been deported by Ghana to Gambia, where he is in hiding.
In their sworn statements, the migrants described abysmal conditions both during their initial deportations from the United States and at Dema Camp.","The United Nations human rights office has called on Ghana to halt the deportations of migrants who were recently deported from the United States and had U.S.-court-ordered protections against being returned to their home countries, where they faced the risk of torture.

While it remained unclear how Ghana would respond to the request, the move adds diplomatic pressure on Ghana to comply with long-held humanitarian standards enshrined in the Convention Against Torture, an international treaty the United States and Ghana are both party to.

The request, made on behalf of the U.N.’s Committee Against Torture, also highlights how President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation effort could potentially run afoul of international law. The United States has been enlisting the help of foreign governments — including Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and Eswatini — to receive “third country” deportees, or people who are not their own citizens.

In a letter dated Sept. 22, the U.N. office said it had called on a “state party” to refrain from deportations while the committee considered a complaint under the torture convention. The letter was provided to The New York Times by Patrick Taurel, a member of the legal team representing a group of third-country migrants deported by the Trump administration to Ghana. Taurel said the complaint had been filed on his clients’ behalf, and identified Ghana as the state party.

Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court in Washington had considered a request to block the deportation of the migrants earlier this month. At the time, she excoriated the Trump administration for what she said appeared to be a deliberate scheme to ignore the migrants’ court-ordered protections, which were issued after immigration judges determined that they were more likely than not to face persecution, torture or death if returned to their home countries.

However, Chutkan ultimately ruled that, because the migrants had already been sent out of American jurisdiction, her hands were tied.

Neither the embassy of Ghana in Washington nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to requests for comment.

The case involves five migrants who were deported from the United States to Ghana on Sept. 5 as part of a third-country deportation deal.

But in sworn statements submitted in court, the migrants said they were told by U.S. and Ghanaian officials that they would be sent from Ghana to their home countries — even though the officials were informed of the protective orders.

Legal papers in the case identified the plaintiffs by little more than their initials and nationalities, for their protection. In a sworn statement, one, D.A., recounted that he had been beaten and tortured by police officers and soldiers in Nigeria who said that if they ever saw him again, they would kill him.

A bisexual man from Gambia, K.S., has already been deported by Ghana to Gambia, where he is in hiding. Gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

As recently as Sept. 15, D.A. and three other migrants were being held at a remote detention facility in Ghana known as Dema Camp, whose location has not been disclosed. Their lawyers declined to say if they were still in Ghana for fear of putting them in more danger.

In their sworn statements, the migrants described abysmal conditions both during their initial deportations from the United States and at Dema Camp.

While in U.S. detention Sept. 5, the migrants said, they were awakened late at night, shackled and put on a military cargo plane without being allowed to notify family or legal counsel, and, in at least one case, without identification documents. They said that some of them were placed in straitjackets for up to 16 hours during the flight, and D.A. claimed that his straitjacket was secured so tightly that he has had difficulty walking ever since.

Third-country deportations have been the subject of a number of U.S. court challenges. In June, the Supreme Court ruled that a group of deportees held on a U.S. military base in Djibouti could be sent on to South Sudan, overruling a lower-court judge who had found that they must first be given an opportunity to be heard about the risk of torture. Trina Realmuto, one of the lawyers representing the Djibouti deportees in a class-action lawsuit, said that the U.N. committee’s proceeding could have broader implications should it turn up evidence that undercut “diplomatic assurances” made to the United States by foreign governments that deportees would not be tortured or persecuted.

In a statement, Gianna Borroto, a member of the legal team representing the deportees in Ghana, said the move by the U.N. committee “should serve as a stark warning to other African nations considering entering into similar agreements” with the United States.

Her cousin in Delaware is convinced Portland is currently a “war zone.”

“I’ll have to send (my cousin) a video of what it’s really like here,” she said, laughing.

Erbaugh was one of about a dozen protesters who gathered outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland on Saturday afternoon, holding signs and picketing after hearing President Donald Trump would be “authorizing full force” to troops in handling political demonstrations in the city.

Erbaugh lives about 10 blocks from downtown and visits it every day. She debated taking her daily walk on Saturday, wondering if the headlines she had seen were true, anticipating tear gas-filled air, but instead, all she found were people with signs and cars honking.

“We need to get that word ‘dangerous’ out of here,” protestor Terry Scannell said. “The president is painting a picture that’s not correct.”

In the hours following Trump’s call for troops to protect the ICE facility, protesters outside the building were light. A majority of protesters, including one dressed in a chicken suit and another supporting a towering inflatable version of Elon Musk, congregated along South Macadam Avenue. Others walked the length of Bancroft Street, viewing memorials of immigrants who were deported.

Calley Ekberg, a Portland educator, works at an area high school with a significant immigrant population. Her gut reaction to the news was to blurt out an expletive.

“Sadness,” is what Ekberg said she was feeling, standing staring at the ICE facility. “Sadness for the city and community who will be directly impacted by this.”

Much of her time is spent walking through Portland, a place she said is one she loves and thinks is beautiful.

“I walk around here so much and feel comfortable. It’s a false narrative in opposition to how it looks and feels to me,” Ekberg said in response to the president’s description of the city.

Trump earlier in September described living in Portland as “like living in hell,” and, at the time, mentioned his consideration of sending federal troops, as he recently threatened to do in other cities like Chicago and Baltimore.

The national depiction of Portland as a violent and unmanageable city has led some to cheer Trump’s actions, including U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer — who previously served as the mayor of Happy Valley and as a congresswoman representing parts of the Portland suburbs south to Bend. She praised Trump’s plan on Saturday, writing on social media that Portland has transformed from a “beautiful place to live” to a “crime-ridden war zone.”

Back Macadam Avenue, one couple stopped by on their way to the Portland Saturday Market. Jim Lempea, a 49-year resident of Portland, said they took a detour from their market plans to “see it before Trump makes it a chaotic place” expecting more protestors and clashes with federal troops in the coming days.

Lempea believes that what the president wants is chaos.

“We’ve had issues like every other city. Who doesn’t?” Lempea said. “We wanted to come by to see the calm before the storm.”",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/09/IMG_3388.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 09:56:26.072223

Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the immigrant rights group Home is Here.
""President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it.
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered.
Sen. John Cornyn, who, in the past spoke strongly about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.","Congressional Republicans are waiting on President Trump to signal he is ready to negotiate a permanent solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Over the last decade, DACA has received varying degrees of support from Republican lawmakers. The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.

As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and Democrats are raising concern that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the immigrant rights group Home is Here. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.

""I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job,"" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year introduced a bill that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. ""President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater.""

Salazar's bill has received bipartisan support. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.

Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.

""The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many,"" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. ""America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies.""

The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress

In 2017, 34 Republicans signed onto a letter urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that ""reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do.""

But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's first attempt to repeal the program failed. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.

""Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""Congress always tries to kick the can down the street.""

During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that ""no one is prioritizing DACA"" for enforcement.

On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.

""The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary,"" Chishti said. ""As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate.""

House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal

Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.

""I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record,"" Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. ""That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it.""

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus members earlier this month to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.

""I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country,"" he said. ""So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way.""

Separately, earlier this year the caucus sent a letter to the White House requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.

Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.

""The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation,"" Schulte said.

Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.

""If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything,"" Graham said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to legalization for DACA, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.

""I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here,"" Tillis said.

Sen. John Cornyn, who, in the past spoke strongly about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.

""These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon,"" Cornyn said. ""Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fab%2F64%2Fdd8eb86b498fb315209bc9dc03e3%2Fgettyimages-2150990688.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:57:02.757238

Federal officials’ requested emergency relief from the nation’s highest court, as Congress already approved the money.
This marks the third time that the Trump administration has tried to appeal to the Supreme Court over the issue.
“The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief,” the justices said.
“It arises from the refusal of the President and his officers to obligate and spend billions of dollars that Congress appropriated for foreign aid,” Kagan said.","The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the Trump administration to freeze $4 billion in foreign aid funding. Federal officials’ requested emergency relief from the nation’s highest court, as Congress already approved the money.

This marks the third time that the Trump administration has tried to appeal to the Supreme Court over the issue. The funds are set to expire at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

What the judges said

In its majority ruling, justices argued that the president should be able to withhold the funds as “the asserted harms to the Executive’s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm faced by respondents.” In addition, justices said the government made a “sufficient showing” that the Impoundment Control Act precludes the lawsuit brought by nonprofit organizations seeking to enforce the appropriations.

However, the majority noted that the order should not be read as a final determination on the case.

“The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief,” the justices said.

Three justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented. Kagan wrote in the dissent that the emergency application raises important issues about the relationship between the president and Congress.

“It arises from the refusal of the President and his officers to obligate and spend billions of dollars that Congress appropriated for foreign aid,” Kagan said.

She argued that the majority on the court went too far in its ruling, and that the Trump administration’s appeal does not meet SCOTUS’ standard for emergency relief.

“We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,” Kagan said.

Attorney Nicolas Sansone with Public Citizen Litigation Group, who represents the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition plaintiffs, said the Supreme Court ruling “erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order.”

“It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,” Sansone said in a statement.

Previous ruling

The Supreme Court’s latest order comes after a ruling earlier in September by federal Judge Amir H. Ali, where he sided with the nonprofit organizations suing the federal government. These organizations have previously said that the $4 billion that is being frozen is meant to go to food security programs; helping other countries build their trade capacity and assist victims of torture, according to The New York Times.

Ali said in his Sept. 3 ruling that the administration has to “comply with the appropriations laws unless and until Congress does change the law.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25247479307704_AP_PhotoJ_Scott_Applewhite_File_clean.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 11:57:28.899580

“What the US government is doing to me breaks all the norms of immunity on which the functioning of the United Nations and its General Assembly is based,” Petro wrote on social media on Saturday.
“It is necessary to configure a more powerful army than that of the United States and Israel combined,” Petro told the crowd.
It was also during this speech that he urged US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump” and “obey the orders of humanity,” according to Reuters.
Colombia’s Interior Minister Armando Benedetti wrote on social media that Netanyahu’s visa should have been revoked instead.","The Trump administration on Friday revoked left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro’s visa after he spoke to crowds of protesters in New York City, urging US soldiers not to point their guns at innocent civilians and to disobey the orders of US President Donald Trump.

The US State Department wrote on social media on Friday that Petro had “urged US soldiers to disobey orders and incite violence” and that it would revoked Petro’s visa “due to his reckless and incendiary actions.”

“Mr. Trump has violated the founding principles of the UN,” Petro wrote on social media Saturday in response to the news.

Petro, who was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), criticized Trump in a speech before the UN on Tuesday, in which he called him “complicit in genocide” for backing Israel’s war on Gaza and urged the UN to open criminal proceedings against Trump’s air strikes on boats in the Caribbean alleged to be transporting drugs.

While the Colombian leader had returned to his home country by the time he learned his visa had been revoked, he condemned the move as a major breach of international law.

“What the US government is doing to me breaks all the norms of immunity on which the functioning of the United Nations and its General Assembly is based,” Petro wrote on social media on Saturday.

He pointed out that heads of state attending UN proceedings are supposed to receive total immunity.

“The fact that the Palestinian Authority was not allowed entry and that my visa was revoked for asking the US and Israeli armies not to support a genocide, which is a crime against all of humanity, demonstrates that the US government no longer complies with international law,” Petro continued. “The United Nations headquarters cannot continue to be in New York.”

Petro was not the only one to question whether the UN could continue to meet in the US after the Trump administration’s actions.

“This is the first time the US revokes a head of state’s visa for comments made during a UNGA visit,” Center for Economic and Policy Research senior research fellow Francisco Rodríguez pointed out on social media. “Both [Fidel] Castro and [Hugo] Chávez gave fiery off-site speeches in NY without retaliation. The action undermines the UN’s viability as a global forum and risks violating the 1947 HQ Agreement.”

The agreement states in part that those granted immunity to attend UN gatherings “shall not be required to leave the United States otherwise than in accordance with the customary procedure” applied to all diplomats.

Craig Mokhiber, a human rights lawyer and former UN official, wrote: “This is just the latest breach of the obligations of the US to the UN. Member states must get serious about moving the UN to a safer host country. And the US-Israel axis must be held accountable.”

Israel’s nearly two-year assault on the Gaza Strip, which several human rights experts and bodies including a UN commission have named a genocide, was a key point of contention during the 80th session of the UNGA.

Petro emerged as a major voice in defense of the Palestinians in Gaza, calling for the creation of an international armed force to enter Gaza and end the genocide.

He repeated that call when he spoke to protesters outside the UN on Friday, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to speak.

“It is necessary to configure a more powerful army than that of the United States and Israel combined,” Petro told the crowd.

It was also during this speech that he urged US soldiers to “disobey the orders of Trump” and “obey the orders of humanity,” according to Reuters.

Colombia’s Interior Minister Armando Benedetti wrote on social media that Netanyahu’s visa should have been revoked instead.

“But since the empire protects him, they go after the only president who was capable of telling him the truth to his face,” Benedetti said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237011049-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 11:58:04.018293

We don’t have secret police in this country.” Demonstrators have protested outside of the Broadview facility on Fridays for weeks.","The co-founder of Chicago independent media outlet Unraveled Press was detained this evening while covering the ongoing protests outside of the Broadview ICE facility.

Video posted to social media platform Bluesky shows Steve Held being detained by federal agents around 7:20 p.m. Prior to his detainment, videos by Unraveled Press show Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and a large presence of other federal agents outside the immigration detention facility in Broadview, a western suburb about 12 miles out from Chicago. The videos show the details of patches on some of the agents’ uniforms: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and ATF, which is the acronym for Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Throughout September, The TRiiBE has been collaborating with Unraveled Press and local alt-weekly the Chicago Reader to publish confirmed sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agents in the Chicago area. Together, we also covered a demonstration outside the Broadview facility on Sept. 19. During that protest, federal agents threw chemical irritants and shot pepper balls at demonstrators, elected officials, political hopefuls and members of the media.

It is unclear why Held was detained by federal agents.

An Unraveled Press investigation published on Sept. 13 disproved the initial narrative given by federal immigration agents after they shot and killed unarmed father Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, a suburb outside of Chicago.

Last week, a video posted to social media showed a federal agent snatching Held’s reporter credentials and shooting chemical weapons at him while he reported on a protest outside the Broadview facility.

While covering a protest on Friday outside the Broadview facility, Unraveled Press co-founder Raven Geary was shot in the face by a chemical weapon.

A collection of 10 Chicago newsrooms, including The TRiiBE and the Chicago Reader, issued the following statement:

“Federal agents detained Chicago journalist Steve Held, of Unraveled Press, on Saturday, September 27 outside of the Broadview Detention Facility while reporting on the ongoing protests. We urge for his immediate release,” the statement reads.

Seth Stern, director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation, also issued the following statement:

“Journalists are constitutionally entitled to cover protests and their aftermath, including after dispersal orders. ICE’s well-documented very recent history of abuses of journalists and demonstrators alike shows exactly why it’s so important that law enforcement can’t operate outside the view of the press,” the statement reads. “Steve Held, the journalist arrested tonight and taken to a so far undisclosed location, was part of the reporting team that exposed the falsity of ICE’s official narrative on the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas González. His work speaks for itself. Officials need to immediately release Held and let journalists do their jobs. We don’t have secret police in this country.”

Demonstrators have protested outside of the Broadview facility on Fridays for weeks. This past week, federal agents erected a gate that fences-off public access to the boarded-up detention building and its adjacent sallyport. Broadview officials said the fence was unlawful and demanded its removal.

At Friday’s protest, federal agents fired more non-lethal bullets and chemical irritants at demonstrators. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson had a clear message for Russell Hott, director of the ICE Chicago field office: “It has to stop.”

On Facebook, Thompson wrote, “What we are experiencing here in Broadview feels like a war on our small community. The challenges we face are heavy, and the burden on our residents, first responders, and families is real.”

Separately, around 7:20 p.m. tonight, Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement in which he said the State of Illinois is closely monitoring the federal deployments in Broadview.

“Whether it be in Broadview here in Illinois or in Portland, Oregon, the Trump Administration is intentionally creating chaos to threaten sending military troops to American cities and suburbs,” Pritzker said. “The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal.”

Regarding tonight’s protest, award-winning civil rights law firm Loevy & Loevy shared a statement on Bluesky about what their team witnessed in Broadview.

“Several of us went to Broadview tonight to scope out the situation for ourselves. What we witnessed was a completely peaceful — even uneventful — protest/gathering, until the exact moment ICE unleashed a totally unprovoked and unwarranted tear-gas attack,” the statement reads. “It would seriously be hard to describe how much the crowd was NOT doing anything to warrant being attacked — not impeding anyone, not being violent, really not doing much of anything. At one point ICE just suddenly decided it was time to open the gates and unleash HELL.”",https://media.thetriibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/27215914/IMG_1619.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 04:56:56.718422

Washington is moving from tut-tutting to testing. The state’s high court approved a time-limited pilot so entities can apply to deliver legal services under non-traditional models. Think regulated programs for firms, nonprofits and legal techs that want to use different ownership structures and more automation.

The point is not to make lawyers obsolete. The point is to see whether innovation can shrink the justice gap without torching consumer protections.

If this sounds familiar it is because Utah already ran the experiment with a regulatory sandbox that licenses entities and tracks outcomes. The Utah office lists the authorized entities and publishes risk data with the enthusiasm of a lab report, which is refreshing in a profession that usually files its homework under tradition.

Arizona went further and killed the old Rule 5.4 barrier. It built a permanent Alternative Business Structures program so non-lawyers can co-own legal providers with court approval. That has already attracted large players, including a green light for KPMG’s ABS application and an AI-augmented shop launched by Eudia Counsel. Whatever your feelings about accountants in suits, the data points are piling up.

Washington’s own legal culture has history with controlled liberalisation. The Limited License Legal Technician program gave trained non-lawyers authority for discrete work. It never became the juggernaut reformers hoped for, but it taught the courts how to regulate new categories and measure harm.

The new entity pilot is the next step, now framed by a Supreme Court order that asks the only question that matters. Do alternative models actually help people who cannot afford conventional counsel.

The national backdrop is blunt. Stanford tracked five years of outcomes in Arizona and Utah and found ownership reform spurs new structures and measurable consumer benefit, with lawyers still central to delivery. Harvard’s access-to-justice research team keeps repeating the unfashionable truth. If you want different outcomes, try different rules and measure them properly. Welcome to the part where law finally pretends to be an evidence-based profession. See the Stanford analysis on entity reform and Harvard’s deep dive on sandboxes.

So what will this Washington pilot actually change?

Expect local firms and startups to apply for narrow approvals to use software for intake, triage and document work, then wrap lawyers around the riskier parts. Early interest reportedly includes traditional firms and newer AI-first tools. Big consumer brands may sit it out and keep scaling in Arizona where the regulatory cement has set. The state bar still has to finalise mechanics, but the direction is clear. Washington is joining the handful of jurisdictions willing to try something other than wishful thinking. Reuters

Why it matters for law firms. The cost of routine work has been subsidising the rest of the pyramid for years. Arizona’s ABS approvals and Utah’s sandbox show competitors who do not bill by the sacred six minutes can capture that work at scale. Firms that ignore this will discover that clients read research too. Start with IAALS’ overview on alternative business structures. Then ask your leadership whether you want to run tests inside your shop or watch someone else do it.

If you are still muttering about the purity of the profession, take it up with the court that authorised the pilot.

A village spokesperson said ICE officers told the Broadview Police Department on Saturday that federal authorities would launch an “enforcement action throughout all of Broadview” and again deploy chemical agents. David Ormsby said the ICE comments are seen as retaliation for Broadview leaders urging the Trump administration not to “make war” on the community.

“ICE is seeking to intimidate the Village of Broadview because we dared exercise our 1st Amendment constitutional rights calling for an end to their war on Broadview. We will not be intimidated,” Ormsby said in a news release.

In an emailed response to NewsNation, ICE denied its officers made threats. “This is made up. Our law enforcement enforces the rule of law. Period,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

NewsNation correspondent Mills Hayes was at the ICE facility Saturday evening as officers made arrests and deployed tear gas and other non-lethal methods meant to repel crowds. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino, whose department is handling security, was on hand.

A protester who identified herself as Amanda Starr of Wisconsin said she returned to the ICE detention center in Broadview, even after being struck by a rubber bullet on Friday.

“If they’re treating protesters like that, out in the open, how are they treating people in that building?” she said.

The suburban ICE facility has been the backdrop for tense encounters between federal authorities and protesters who oppose the Trump administration’s mass deportations of undocumented individuals. The White House launched “Operation Midway Blitz” earlier this month in Chicago, a sanctuary city at odds with Trump policies. Demonstrators are trying to impede operations at the Broadview facility.

Despite the clashes, ICE officials said 40 migrants were arrested as part of the operation Saturday.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, blamed the Trump administration for setting the stage for trouble.

“Donald Trump is using federal agents to stoke fear and violate constitutional rights — all with the aims of expanding his control and sending military troops to our cities. It’s unlawful and un-American. We must all stand up and speak out against fanning the flames of violence,” he said.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/09/gas.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-28 04:57:20.202098

A short drive from Main Street, two rectangular holes form a checkerboard pattern in a grassy lawn connecting a Catholic church with a nearby schoolyard. Six Grinnell College researchers spent the summer here digging, scraping and screening the soil, most of whom have never been to Wyoming before.

The Iowa-based researchers are looking for artifacts from when a mob burned down what was once the Rock Springs Chinatown.

In 1885, labor tensions boiled over in the Union Pacific Railroad's coal mines, stemming from an argument over who had the best work opportunities. The mob, many of them European migrants, blamed the Chinese.

""And it was right here where we're standing,"" said Professor Laura Ng, from four feet deep in the trenches of the dig site, where she's guiding students mapping diagrams of burnt down building foundations.

After burning several blocks once made up of homes and shops, the mob killed 28 Chinese people and injured another 14, in what is one of the deadliest incidents of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history.

""[Because of this], there's going to be a layer that is very distinctive in the archaeological record,"" said Ng.

In what she refers to as the ""burn layer,"" Ng's team has found artifacts, ranging from pottery sherds, animal bones, an ornamental door handle and a wooden beam from an old building.

The town dates back to the 1860s, when Union Pacific's nearby coal deposits lured thousands of immigrant laborers to the mines and railyards as the company neared the completion of the transcontinental railroad.

As a result, Rock Springs has long proudly called itself the ""Home of 56 nationalities."" It's had an International Day celebration for more than a hundred years.

Rock Springs turns a corner

But now, the town is digging up this part of its migrant history and finding new ways to shed light on a dark moment in its past.

A new statue was dedicated this fall to mark the 140th anniversary commemoration already memorializing the 55 other nationalities whose labor in the coal mines also built the town.

Until recently, Rock Springs' main monument was a small plaque fixed to a boulder to recognize the 28 killed in the massacre. But it sits on a grassy median, turned away from the road that passes by the site of the old Chinatown, making it easy to miss.

Over Labor Day weekend, the town unveiled a much more prominent monument to commemorate the 140th anniversary.

""[The] bronze statue 'Requiem,' standing more than seven feet tall, depicts a Chinese miner amidst the ruins of Chinatown, holding the remnants of a ceremonial dragon flag,"" Rock Springs Mayor Max Mickelson read during the statue dedication. He was joined by his town council, which for the most part, supported the statue.

The town's growing acknowledgement of its past comes at an odd time for a county that voted 76% for the president in 2024, which since being reelected has tried to erase negative depictions of the country's past.

Local students, who now learn about the massacre at school, helped host the more than 200 attendees at the statue ceremony while the county's two history museums helped fundraise for the statue.

A memorial like this one is long overdue, according to the mayor.

At the same time, he acknowledges the irony of honoring the town's migrant history while Sweetwater County, home to Rock Springs, cracks down and renews contracts with ICE, the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Wyoming's state highway patrol and National Guard followed suit earlier this summer.

""As someone who is a descendant of immigrants that came to this country from Europe, I find it very frustrating that as a country we have decided to take an anti-immigrant stance,"" Mickelson said.

Like 76% of the county he lives in, Mickelson voted for President Trump in 2024. But he said the crackdown wasn't what he voted for.

""We have real problem areas where those resources would be better put than tracking down somebody who is here working, putting up stucco,"" Mickelson said.

He'd rather see resources directed toward the drug and human tracking that have recently plagued his town.

As a self-dubbed ""Old School Republican"" and a critic of the president's immigration policies, Mickelson said it's an awkward time to be a member of the party.

The mayor has several friends who migrated to Rock Springs as teenagers and have since received citizenship. Immigrant labor is still important to his town, which now relies on mining the mineral trona, used in baking soda, trona mining rather than coal, with just under 20% of residents Hispanic or Latino, according to the Census Bureau.

""We don't love America any more than those people. They worked really hard to get here,"" Mickelson said.

Descendants of the massacre join the commemoration

This summer, Ricky and Grace Leo returned to their hometown of Rock Springs to join the archaeology dig.

Despite growing up there, it wasn't until 2019 that the couple learned about the massacre — and that they have ties to it.

""We didn't know that we were related to the people that died in the massacre,"" Grace said.

The massacre wasn't something the couple learned about when they attended the local high school.

A chance run in with Rock Springs archaeologist Dudley Gardner at a history conference, considered one of the experts on the massacre and western Chinatowns, turned into the Leos later becoming one of the hosts of this fall's commemoration.

At the Labor Day ceremony honoring those who died in the massacre, traditional lion dancers performed and visitors from across the country recited the names of those killed with traditional blessings. The Leo family organized lectures, ceremonial blessing rituals and cooking demonstrations ahead of the unveiling of the statue.

Ng has also made the effort to reach out to the descendants of the massacre and the survivors. At least five made it to the ceremony, the majority of whom had never heard about the massacre until recently.

Robert Lew, who lives in California, was one of them.

He knew his father grew up orphaned in Rock Springs. But only learned at 75 years old, after talking with the archaeologists, that his ancestors also made a life in the Wyoming town much earlier.

""In terms of [learning about] my great-grandfather and 1885 in the massacre, that was only two weeks ago, three weeks ago,"" Lew said. His daughter Beth Lew-Williams is an esteemed scholar of Chinese-American history.

While here, Lew talked with a young man from Rock Springs, who said he was glad to see his community become more familiar with the massacre.

""It's just amazing, very inspirational,"" Lew said, ""And made me feel really good about our country.""

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in an ongoing Washington state case that the president’s executive order violated the Constitution.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to uphold President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, the long-held principle that children born on American soil are automatically citizens.

Trump issued the order on his first day in office, but it has been blocked by the courts ever since.

In a pair of petitions, government lawyers argued that the Constitution’s promise of citizenship was conferred on “freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.”

The common understanding of the 14th Amendment for more than a century, upheld by the Supreme Court, has guaranteed citizenship to children born in the United States. But D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, argued that such a view was “mistaken,” according to the filings, which were reviewed by The New York Times but have not yet appeared in the court’s public case-tracking system.

If the justices were to take the case, the court could hear arguments on the matter during its upcoming term, which is set to begin in early October. Decisions are typically announced by late June or early July.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The administration’s request set up a key test for the Supreme Court, which has repeatedly allowed central pieces of Trump’s agenda to proceed on a temporary emergency basis, even as their legality is tested by the courts. If the justices accept the birthright citizenship cases, they would offer a final verdict as to whether Trump’s order was constitutional, a case that could define what it means to be an American.

“If and when the court takes up birthright citizenship, the president will be going against the U.S. Constitution, a 127-year-old Supreme Court precedent and an act of Congress, and he will lose,” said Cecillia Wang, the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the groups challenging the executive order.

The Trump administration appeals stem from lower court litigation over an executive order signed by Trump when he returned to office in January. The order, which would end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants without permanent legal status and temporary foreign residents, faced immediate legal challenges.

Trump Order Collides With 14th Amendment Understanding

Trump’s order appeared to collide with the common understanding of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship for all and reversed a now-notorious court decision that had deprived Black people born in the United States of that right. The amendment states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are Americans.

After a number of federal judges issued temporary pauses on the policy as the court cases made their way through the system, the Trump administration asked the justices to unfreeze the policy, arguing that lower court judges had exceeded their power by issuing the nationwide blocks.

The justices, in a rare move, heard oral arguments in May on the narrow question of whether lower court judges had exceeded their authority. In late June, in a 6-3 decision that split along ideological lines, the justices sided with the Trump administration, cutting off one mechanism for lower-court judges to block executive branch policies.

More legal challenges swiftly followed in response to the Supreme Court ruling, including a nationwide class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in New Hampshire on behalf of a proposed class of people, including babies subject to the executive order and their parents.

In July, Judge Joseph N. Laplante of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire agreed to allow the lawsuit to proceed, freezing the policy for the babies and their parents. He announced that his decision applied nationwide.

That same month, in a splintered decision, a panel of judges on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in an ongoing Washington state case that the president’s executive order violated the Constitution.

In that opinion, the judges concluded that the order “contradicts the plain language of the 14th Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

In his new filings, Sauer argued that the lower-court decisions had invalidated policies necessary to secure the border and conferred citizenship on hundreds of thousands of “unqualified people.”

She told NPR Garcia-Hernandez had a great sense of humor, always making people laugh.","DALLAS – Stephany Gauffeny rubs her pregnant belly as she sits on a brown leather chair inside a law office. She's tired and worried.

Gauffeny can go into labor any time now. But instead of preparing for this moment – the birth of her fifth child – she's anguished about her husband Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez.

He's on life support after being critically injured on Wednesday in the shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas. He was being detained there after being arrested on Aug. 8 for driving under the influence. He is in the U.S. without legal status.

""It hurts to think like, what if he never even gets to meet him,"" Gauffeny told NPR on Saturday, referring to her unborn child, a son.

That is very possible.

Gauffeny said that the medical personnel at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas told her on Friday evening Garcia-Hernandez might not survive the night. As of Saturday afternoon, machines were keeping him alive.

One of the things that shocked her the most when she saw Garcia-Hernandez in the hospital was how he looked.

""When I first arrived at the hospital, he was shackled, even though he couldn't move,"" Gauffeny said. He's still unconscious, but because he remains in ICE custody, agents are controlling access to his room.

All of this is making it harder for her to visit her husband, and for his brothers to see him, too.

In addition to Garcia-Hernandez, Venezuelan detainee Jose Andres Bordones-Molina was also injured in the shooting. A third was killed, and the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office identified him as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman Fuentes, from El Salvador.

In a statement to NPR, ICE confirmed the identities of all three victims on Saturday. The agency said that all three were ""criminal illegal aliens.""

The shooter was identified by ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons as Joshua Jahn, a 29-year-old who died of self-inflicted wounds. According to law enforcement officials, the man sought to ""terrorize"" ICE agents. However, none of the victims were law enforcement officers. Instead, all of the victims were detainees, according to the government.

'He's a great dad'

Gauffeny said the government's long delay identifying the victims is what made her want to tell the world more about who her husband is.

""I want his name to be known,"" Gauffeny said. ""I want people to know who he really was. He wasn't just an immigrant or a detainee, or a criminal."" She said that she hoped this incident prompted more security to be put in at ICE immigration facilities to protect those inside.

Garcia-Hernandez, 31, is originally from Mexico, and has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager. He doesn't have legal status, his wife said, but based on the fact that she was a U.S. citizen, they were trying to get him permanent residency.

She told NPR Garcia-Hernandez had a great sense of humor, always making people laugh. He was always helping people – from those in need in the streets, to his family members and friends. He'd give people rides, help fix their cars, help them with household tasks like hanging TVs.

And he always worried about his family and took care of her. Even while in detention, he would ask her whether anyone was helping her cut the grass at their new home.

She said he worked as a house painter before he was detained, and would often surprise her by coming home from work with her favorite snacks, including elotes.

They met when they were 15 years old, and started dating when they were around 19. They've been married for a decade.

And he loved being a dad, she said. Together they were raising four kids, ages 3, 8, 12, and 14.

""He spoiled them a lot … and they miss him,"" Gauffeny said.

Gauffeny has not told the kids what happened to Garcia-Hernandez. She's hoping for her husband to get better, although she acknowledges that is nearly impossible.

The kids are noticing her absence – she spends most of her days at the hospital. She's allowed to visit her husband for a few hours in the morning and the evening.

And she's also worried about how she'll provide for her kids since Garcia-Hernandez was the main source of income. The family is now relying on a GoFundMe campaign to pay for groceries and bills.

In a statement Saturday, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed the action is being taken after “weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities” and attacks against law enforcement.
Tina Kotek wrote on social media Saturday her office had not been notified why the troops were being deployed.
An ICE facility about 2 miles south of downtown Portland has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer.
Trump forecast action in Portland on Thursday, repeating the claim to reporters that protesters are being paid “a lot of money” to generate chaos.","President Donald Trump said Saturday he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, a city he described as “war ravaged,” to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities he claimed are “under siege” by Antifa and “other domestic terrorists.”

“At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists. I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” Trump wrote in a social media post.

The White House did not provide additional comment when reached by CNN for clarification on what the president meant by “full force” and which troops would be sent to the city. In a statement Saturday, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed the action is being taken after “weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities” and attacks against law enforcement.

“We will not allow Antifa domestic terrorists to deter us in our mission to make America safe, and those who try will be held accountable,” McLaughlin said.

It’s the latest example of Trump’s willingness to use the military in extraordinary ways as part of his push to reduce crime in American cities. He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and to Washington, DC, last month. He has also threatened to send troops to several other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Chicago.

Shortly after the president’s post, McLaughlin said on Fox News the Trump administration is investigating the “highly organized” nature of protests in certain American cities, claiming that some are being paid and funded. There is no evidence of McLaughlin’s claims.

“Whether it be in Portland, whether it be in Chicago or otherwise, we will bring the resources we need to make sure that Americans are safe,” she added.

State and local leaders, including US Sen. Jeff Merkley, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, US Rep. Maxine Dexter and City Council members, urged the community to stay peaceful at a news conference on Friday night, according to CNN affiliate KPTV, after the city saw an increase in activity by federal agents.

“Here is what I do know – the president has sent agents here to create chaos and riots here in Portland, to induce a reaction. To induce protests. To induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look as he was describing it as,” Merkley said. “Our job is to say, ‘We are not going to take the bait.’”

Wilson in a statement Saturday said there is no need to send troops, adding the president “will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it.”

“Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,” the mayor wrote.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek wrote on social media Saturday her office had not been notified why the troops were being deployed.

“My office is reaching out to the White House and Homeland Security for more information. We have been provided no information on the reason or purpose of any military mission,” Kotek wrote. “There is no national security threat in Portland. Our communities are safe and calm.”

She posted on X later Saturday that she had conversations with Trump and Noem, during which she relayed that Portland and Oregon can “manage our own local public safety needs.”

Trump’s announcement comes after a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas by a gunman who investigators believe intended to target ICE personnel and property. He killed one detainee and seriously injured two others.

An ICE facility about 2 miles south of downtown Portland has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer. Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but some have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days over the summer.

Trump forecast action in Portland on Thursday, repeating the claim to reporters that protesters are being paid “a lot of money” to generate chaos.

“We’re going to get out there, and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that. They’re professional agitators and anarchists,” Trump said.

Trump earlier this month designated Antifa – the loose factions of black-clad leftists or anarchists who show up at protests opposing the police or government – as a “major terrorist organization.” The White House has emphasized incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the country to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.

Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officials were deployed to downtown Portland in 2020, during Trump’s first term, due to protests after the murder of George Floyd.

“I’m going to look at it now, because I didn’t know that was still going on. This has been going on for years,” Trump said earlier this month.

The administration is asking the justices to hear the New Hampshire dispute even before a Boston-based federal appeals court has ruled in the case.

The Justice Department filed two appeals of lower court rulings that blocked Trump's executive order, which the Republican president signed on his first day back in office in January as a key part of his hardline approach toward immigration.

""The lower court's decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security. Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people,"" the Justice Department wrote in the appeals.

The department asked the Supreme Court to take up and resolve the case in its new term, which begins on Oct. 6.

Trump's executive order directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the United States who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also called a ""green card"" holder.

His action drew a series of lawsuits arguing, among other things, that the order violates a right enshrined in the Constitution's 14th Amendment that provides that anyone born in the United States is a citizen.

After multiple lower courts halted the order as unconstitutional, the administration took the disputes to the Supreme Court in an effort to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called ""universal"" injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

That action led the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to issue a landmark ruling in June blunting the power of judges. But that ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

Two challenges to Trump's order are at issue in Friday's appeals. One was filed by the state of Washington and three other states, and the other by a group of individuals who sued in federal court in New Hampshire.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states, while U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump's order to be blocked nationally.

""This executive order is illegal, full stop, and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that. We will continue to ensure that no baby's citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order,"" Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the New Hampshire plaintiffs, told Reuters on Friday.

The administration is asking the justices to hear the New Hampshire dispute even before a Boston-based federal appeals court has ruled in the case.

'A powerful incentive'

The 14th Amendment's citizenship clause states that all ""persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the United States.

The administration contends that the 14th Amendment, long understood to confer citizenship to virtually anyone born in the United States, does not extend to immigrants who are in the country illegally or even to immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

In Friday's filings, the Justice Department said that a policy of universal birthright citizenship ""operates as a powerful incentive for illegal migration"" and has ""spawned an industry of modern 'birth tourism,' by which foreigners travel to the United States solely for the purpose of giving birth here.""

Since Trump returned to office, his administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to intervene on an emergency basis to implement his policies even as their legality is tested in court, after judges blocked them.

The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in nearly every case it has been asked to review, including several related to Trump's efforts to restrict migration and accelerate deportations.

The latest decision favoring Trump came on Friday, when the court allowed him to withhold about $4 billion in foreign aid authorized by Congress for the current fiscal year.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3111/311153/31115368.JPG?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-09-28 00:57:12.258729

It appeared that Border Patrol has taken over operations at the west suburban ICE facility, and they were quick to detain several protesters throughout the evening while firing off pepper bullets to disperse the crowds.

Demonstrators have been protesting against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement blitz happening across the Chicago area.

The developments came after the village said in a statement that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents told officials in Broadview they would launch enforcement throughout the west suburb on Saturday.

The village says ICE agents told Broadview police that there will be a ""s*** show"" in the area and that federal officers will deploy chemicals again.

In a statement, Broadview said this is all in retaliation to the village calling on ICE to ""stop making war on our community.""

""Let's be clear. ICE is seeking to intimidate the Village of Broadview because we dared exercise our 1st Amendment constitutional rights calling for an end to their war on Broadview. We will not be intimidated. We are Broadview strong,"" the village said in a statement, in part.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement, saying, ""This is made up. Our law enforcement enforces the rule of law. Period.""

The continued protests Saturday at the Broadview ICE facility came after Friday night's standoff between demonstrators and federal agents.

Some local organizations held a press conference in the afternoon, continuing to speak out against the operations going on there. The Revolutionary Black Panther Party is one of the organizations that spoke.

There have been contentious moments the last couple of days, including the use of pepper bullets and other crowd controlling measures from DHS agents. Many of the protesters there Saturday have been the same people showing up to the facility every day, and they say that those tactics from ICE will not deter them from continuing to protest.

Throughout the day agents chased down some protesters and detained them while also coming out to take any kind of shields or umbrellas from the crowd. Protesters believe the use of force has gone too far.

""We oppose this kind of authoritarianism that is invading our city and suburbs,"" community activist Andy Thayer said. ""It's not helping anyone.""

After several escalations between protesters and federal agents over the last few weeks in Broadview, Attorney General Bondi says there will be no tolerance moving forward.

""More than 200 violent rioters were at a Chicago ICE facility chanting 'Arrest ICE. Shoot ICE,'"" Bondi said in a video posted to X. ""At least one had a gun. We've seen this before. We saw it in Portland and the LA riots. These are not peaceful protests. These are coordinated attacks by radical extremists, and they end now.""

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino also arrived to the Broadview facility Friday. He did not answer questions from reporters as he led operations on the ground.

Crowd-controlling measures like pepper bullets were deployed several times in an attempt to push protesters back.

Local immigration lawyer Louise Carhart was apart of the crowd. She says the federal agencies do not belong there.

""All of these agencies are funded by tax payer dollars and they're being deputized for things they are not authorized to do,"" Carhart said. ""That's a misuse of public funds, and I think protesters have every right to be out here.""

Also on the scene Saturday were a few opposition protesters, who say they stand with ICE and believe this is what Illinois needs right now.

Anti-ICE protesters in Chicago also gathered Saturday in the Loop, sending a similar message to the Trump administration. They rallied at Federal Plaza and marched a bit through downtown, with chants and signs standing up against ICE operations.

Officers used chemical agents multiple times in an effort to disperse the crowds on Friday in Broadview, and federal authorities said of the people arrested had a gun.

Elias Cepeda, a volunteer with Pilsen Defense and Access, is seen in this video posted to Instagram right before his arrest. The 41-year-old has joined other protesters at the facility for weeks.

His mother says her son is a legal Concealed-Carry License holder and is demanding his release while other demonstrators shared their account of his arrest.

DHS commented on Cepeda's arrest and the discovery of his firearm, writing in a post to X, in part, ""This is transpiring just a few days after the horrific terrorist attack on an ICE facility in Dallas.""

Demonstrators say the other man arrested on Friday is a military veteran.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson has urged Broadview residents to ""take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families in order to stay out of harm's way.""

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker released the following statement in response to the federal deployments in the village of Broadview:

""The State of Illinois is closely monitoring the federal deployments in the Village of Broadview. Public safety is always my top priority, and the Illinois State Police remain in close communication with the Broadview Police Department to monitor and maintain public safety.

""Whether it be in Broadview here in Illinois or in Portland, Oregon, the Trump Administration is intentionally creating chaos to threaten sending military troops to American cities and suburbs.

""Illinois will always defend Americans' right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard. We denounce any violence against the general public, members of the media, and law enforcement or first responders. Even when the Trump Administration does not follow the law, we will.

Chris Coleman, a City Council member, described him as a constant presence at Des Moines schools, businesses and government events.","Last week, school officials in Des Moines were celebrating improved marks on a state evaluation. The superintendent, Ian Roberts, who in two years on the job had already become a well-known figure in Iowa, said the report showed “that we have the foundation of an outstanding school district that will continue to grow and improve.”

Days later, the Des Moines Public Schools system was in disarray.

Dr. Roberts was in the custody of federal immigration officials, who asserted that he had been leading the school system while in the United States illegally. District officials were struggling to answer questions about their vetting process for hiring Dr. Roberts and straining to square the description of Dr. Roberts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials with the man they knew. On Saturday, School Board members voted 7 to 0 to place Dr. Roberts on paid administrative leave during a meeting that lasted less than three minutes.

“I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,” said Jackie Norris, the School Board chair, in a statement that she said she was reading on behalf of the Board. “The accusations ICE has made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.”

Ms. Norris, who is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, said Dr. Roberts had said he was a U.S. citizen on an Iowa application for a superintendent license. Board members declined to take questions from reporters.

The abrupt turn from optimism to chaos in the Des Moines school system started on Friday morning as word spread of a law enforcement search on the city’s south side. The police radio crackled with word that ICE agents were seeking a man in a gray suit and pink shirt who had fled officers near a trailer park. Hours later, ICE would say they had arrested Dr. Roberts, who was born in Guyana. ICE officials said Dr. Roberts had a deportation order, no authorization to work in the United States, and had faced weapon possession charges several years ago.

It would have been a shocking turn of events during any period. But the timing of Dr. Roberts’s detention, in the midst of President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, contributed to heightened suspicions and tensions, with some residents protesting the superintendent’s detention and some politicians describing it as proof of a lawless immigration system.

“He should have never been anywhere around Iowa kids in the first place!” Representative Ashley Hinson, an Iowa Republican, posted on social media. She said Dr. Roberts “should be deported immediately.”

Dr. Roberts remained in custody at an Iowa jail on Saturday. Alfredo Parrish, a lawyer representing Dr. Roberts, said in a brief phone interview that he was in agreement with the district’s decision to place the superintendent on leave with pay.

“We are still trying to get the facts accurate,” Mr. Parrish said.

Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said that “those who believe immigration laws are optional are dangerously wrong.”

In Des Moines, a left-leaning city in a state led by Republicans, residents expressed a mix of views, as well as confusion about the situation.

Some wondered whether their school district, Iowa’s largest with more than 30,000 students, had missed red flags when it hired Dr. Roberts. They also voiced concern about ICE’s accusations, including that Dr. Roberts had been in possession of a loaded gun and a knife when agents confronted him; some, too, said they had doubts about whether they could fully trust those claims. There were also fond memories of an upbeat, engaging administrator who, parents said, had built deep bonds in his short tenure.

“It’s just shocking and confusing and makes me grieve for what was and never will be again,” said Elizabeth Talbert, a parent, who recalled how students once cheered when Dr. Roberts made an appearance at a basketball game. “No matter how this turns out, this is scarring, and it’s going to be divisive.”

ICE officials said Dr. Roberts, who had once competed in track and field at the Olympics for Guyana, entered the United States in 1999 on a student visa and had received a deportation order from an immigration judge in May 2024.

Court documents corroborated some of ICE’s description. Pennsylvania records from 2021 and 2022 showed that Dr. Roberts pleaded guilty after being charged with having a loaded firearm inside a vehicle.

That incident, which took place during Dr. Roberts’s stint leading the Millcreek Township School District, became a local news story. Dr. Roberts said at the time that a state game warden had cited him while he was hunting in a wooded area. He said he was a licensed gun owner and had placed the weapon in his vehicle while speaking to the officer in an effort to make the warden feel safe.

Still unanswered was how, if ICE’s other assertions were proven, Dr. Roberts had managed to move from school system to school system over the years, often in leadership roles, without authorization to work in the country. He had built an increasingly notable profile nationally as a school administrator, book author and recipient of advanced degrees.

Under his leadership, the Des Moines school district advanced racial equity efforts that were criticized by some conservatives.

U.S. Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino posted a video to ""X"" showing multiple ICE detainments outside Home Depots and other areas in Chicago.

It comes as the village of Broadview also sent out a press release on Saturday.

The release reads in part, ""In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ""stop making war on our community,"" ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be ""a s*** show' in Broadview today.""

""I know personally I don't like all the violence,"" Bryan Brannon said.

Brannon has been outside protesting at the Broadview facility all week. That's where the village said the Broadview Fire Department was told ICE agents would launch enforcement all day.

They were told agents would deploy chemicals like tear gas and pepper spray against citizens, residents, and first responders.

""It's scary because they are already firing non-lethal rounds at us,"" Brannon said. ""I worry that at some point they are going to get scared and start using lethal rounds or something.""

Broadview said the profanity was used in a verbal comment between village police and ICE. CBS News Chicago reached out to Homeland Security to see if profanities were used toward Broadview officials.

The tense protest outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility located in the Chicago suburb of Broadview comes over two weeks into Operation Midway Blitz, the White House’s effort to ramp up deportations in the longtime sanctuary city. Trump has repeatedly said the crackdown is aimed at ""the worst of the worst"" criminals who are immigrants.

But the president’s crackdown, which has seen one immigrant fatally shot by a federal agent, has sparked nearly around-the-clock protest at the facility located about 12 miles west of the Willis Tower.

""It feels like chemical warfare,"" Rickey Hendon Jr. told USA TODAY through a gas mask after a barrage of pepper balls fired by immigration agents. The Chicago-area tech worker said he was protesting against inhumane conditions reported at the deportation processing center. ""This needs to be shut down.""

Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin called the protesters ""rioters"" and tied them to a Sept. 24 attack on an immigration facility in Dallas.

""Rioters are what they are,"" said McLaughlin, adding that a firearm was found on one protester outside Chicago. ""This is just two days after we saw that vicious, disgusting attack on our facility in Dallas… and the fact that there’s now a firearm or there was a firearm there in Chicago is very alarming.""

Protest organizers denied that anyone connected to the group brought a firearm.

Among officials and leaders protesting on Sept. 26 were Alderman Andre Vasquez, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh.

Here’s the latest on Trump’s blitz on Chicago-area immigrants.

Suburban facility serves as major hub

The small boarded-up and fenced-off building in Broadview serves as a processing center for detainees before they are transported out of Illinois. Data shared with USA TODAY by immigration enforcement researchers show that the site has become a major hub for detainees in recent months.

Department of Homeland Security officials said over 700 immigrants have been arrested since the launch of the blitz. Among them are ""gang members, murderers, child rapists, and drug traffickers,"" said Emily Covington, assistant director for immigration enforcement’s public affairs office.

""These arrests reflect our commitment to targeting the worst of the worst who pose significant threats to the community,"" Covington said.

According to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group that tracks immigration enforcement data, over 6,000 detainees have come through the facility during fiscal year 2025.

Immigration enforcement processing centers play growing role

Susan Long, co-founder of the Syracuse University research group, said immigration enforcement processing centers play a significant though not widely known role in immigration enforcement. They give immigration agents a place to register new detainees and hold them overnight if necessary.

The immigration facility in Dallas targeted in a shooting that left an immigrant dead and two detainees critically wounded was also an agency processing center.

Immigration agents have begun using the Chicago-area facility significantly more, data obtained by Long’s group via the Freedom of Information Act shows.

During fiscal year 2024 and preceding years, almost no one was staying at the facility overnight, Long said. By June of 2025, the number of people staying overnight had reached 30 per night. It’s unclear how many people have been staying at the facility overnight since the start of the blitz.

Attorneys slam facility conditions

Immigration enforcement processing centers are only supposed to hold people for 72 hours or less, according to Long. But Chicago-area immigration attorneys say clients at the site have reported being held there for as many as five days.

Detainees also report overcrowding at the facility, according to Erendira Rendon, a local immigration law advocate. Rendon said clients have reported as many as 200 people staying overnight at the facility. According to data obtained by Long’s group, the facility has capacity for 123 people.

""We have been seeing a lot of abuses inside,"" Rendon said at a news conference on Sept. 25. ""Everybody goes to sleep sitting down, there’s very little food and it’s difficult to get medication.""

Immigration agency officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on facility conditions.

Are immigration agents catching 'the worst of the worst'?

Among people recently arrested in Chicago by immigration agents, according to agency officials, are a man whose criminal history includes sexual abuse of a child, a man convicted of domestic violence and a man arrested for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.

Carlos Barrera Vega, ""a criminal illegal alien from Mexico"" according to agency spokesperson Covington, has a criminal history including sexual assault of a victim under the age of 13, residential burglary and battery.

Jose Alex Guarneros-Granados, also from Mexico, was convicted of multiple counts of domestic battery and strangulation and sentenced to nine years in prison, Covington said.

However, Chicagoans say federal agents are indiscriminately targeting people who look like they could be immigrants.

Jaime Perez, a Chicago South Sider, said that his fiancé Laura Murillo was taken by immigration agents in the early hours of Sept. 25 as she was selling tamales on the street. Perez said Murillo had been in the country for 20 years.

Perez said she called him as she was being detained: ""You’re hurting me, you’re hurting me,"" he heard her telling agents. Perez said he tried talking to an agent who took the phone.

""I want her, we’re engaged,"" Perez said he told the agent, ""and he just shut the phone.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/27/USAT/86377767007-thumbnail-image-6.jpg?crop=1477,832,x0,y77&width=1477&height=832&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-27 22:56:48.728731

On Sept. 26, the Justice Department appealed lower court rulings that blocked an executive order Trump signed on his first day back in office in January.

Trump's hardline approach toward immigration was a campaign pledge and has resulted in the arrest and deportation of thousands of people.

""The lower court's decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security. Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people,"" the Justice Department wrote in the appeals.

The Supreme Court's new term begins on October 6.

Following his inauguration, the president directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the United States without at least one parent who is an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

His action drew a series of lawsuits arguing among other things that the order violates a right enshrined in the Constitution's 14th Amendment that provides that anyone born in the United States is a citizen.

After multiple lower courts halted the order as unconstitutional, the administration took the disputes to the Supreme Court in an effort to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called ""universal"" injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

That action led the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to issue a landmark ruling in June blunting the power of judges. But that ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

Two challenges to Trump's order are at issue in the Sept. 26's appeals. One was filed by the state of Washington and three other states, and the other by a group of individuals who sued in federal court in New Hampshire.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states, while U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump's order to be blocked nationally.

""This executive order is illegal - full stop - and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that. We will continue to ensure that no baby's citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order,"" Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the New Hampshire plaintiffs, told Reuters on Friday.

The administration is asking the justices to hear the New Hampshire dispute even before a Boston-based federal appeals court has ruled in the case.

'A POWERFUL INCENTIVE'

The 14th Amendment's citizenship clause states that all ""persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War and granted citizenship and freedoms outlined in the Bill of Rights to formerly enslaved people.

The administration contends that the 14th Amendment, long understood to confer citizenship to virtually anyone born in the United States, does not extend to immigrants who are in the country illegally or even to immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

The U.S. Supreme Court's 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark is considered the historical standard that children born in the United States to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship. Wong Kim Ark, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant parents, was denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to China, despite being born within U.S. territory.

In a 6-2 decision, the court held that Wong Kim Ark was a U.S. citizen because of his birth in the United States, regardless of his parents' Chinese citizenship.

The Justice Department argues that the court's ruling in that case was narrower, applying to children whose parents had a ""permanent domicile and residence in the United States.""

The Justice Department's request came the same day Justice Clarence Thomas said the Supreme Court should take a more critical approach to settled precedent, saying decided cases are not ""the gospel"" and suggesting some may have been based on ""something somebody dreamt up and others went along with."" Thomas, one of the most conservative justices on the bench, made the comments during a rare public appearance Thursday evening at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C.

In Friday's filings, the Justice Department said that a policy of universal birthright citizenship ""operates as a powerful incentive for illegal migration"" and has ""spawned an industry of modern 'birth tourism,' by which foreigners travel to the United States solely for the purpose of giving birth here.""

Since Trump returned to office, his administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to intervene on an emergency basis to implement his policies even as their legality is tested in court, after judges blocked them.

The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in nearly every case it has been asked to review - including several related to Trump's efforts to restrict migration and accelerate deportations.

The latest decision favoring Trump came on Friday, when the court allowed him to withhold about $4 billion in foreign aid authorized by Congress for the current fiscal year.

Trump, in a Sept. 27 post on Truth Social, said he directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ""provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists."" He added he authorized the military to use ""Full Force, if necessary.""

Neither the White House nor the Pentagon would say whether Trump intended to deploy active-duty military troops or National Guard troops. In response to questions from USA TODAY, officials also would not say how many troops would be involved in the deployment.

The move follows weeks of protests outside ICE's field office in South Portland opposing Trump's mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Some of those protests have turned combative with law enforcement, resulting in tear gas being deployed by officials.

As of Sept. 8, the U.S. Attorney’s Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, according to a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity.

'We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon,' governor says

State and local leaders in Portland denounced Trump's military deployment at an outdoor news conference in the heart of downtown Portland hours after the president's announcement.

Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek said she made it ""abundantly clear"" with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in recent conversations that the city and state ""can manage our own local public safety needs.""

""There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city,"" Kotek said, calling Portland a ""far cry from the war-ravaged community"" that Trump has portrayed. ""We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon, stoking fear, creating conflict and, frankly, escalating a situation that is under control.""

The Trump administration has provided no timeline on the military's arrival in her state, the governor said.

Kotek threatened potential legal action against the Trump administration, saying she doesn't believe Trump has the legal authority to deploy federal troops to a state. She said she's coordinating with the state's attorney general to ""see if any response is necessary, and we will be prepared to respond if we have to.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said Portland does not need military intervention. ""The president will not find lawlessness or violence here,"" said Wilson, whose office is a nonpartisan position.

""If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries from a farmers market,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, this may be a show of force, but that's all it is. It's a big show.""

U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, shared a video on X of Portland's ICE detention facility with no activity around the building except for a couple of joggers.

""Taken just a few minutes ago outside the ICE facility in Portland that Trump claims is under siege. My message to Donald Trump is this: we don’t need you here. Stay the hell out of our city,"" Wyden said.

Pentagon not releasing details about deployment

As has happened in states across the country, federal agents and protesters have clashed regularly outside the ICE building in Portland, resulting in several arrests over the last few months. In a press conference on Sept. 26, local officials urged residents not to react to an increase in federal officers in the city.

The White House did not respond to a question from USA TODAY asking what Trump meant by authorizing the military's ""Full Force.""

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that ""we are not going to allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement.""

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the military is ready to mobilize at the president's direction, adding the Defense Department ""will provide information and updates as they become available.""

Democrats in Congress said they intend to fight Trump’s military deployment. “Portland is not ‘war ravaged.’ U.S. troops are not political playthings. And Trump is not a king,” Democratic Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Democrats will fight in Congress to stop him.""

The protests outside the ICE facility in Portland have occasionally been violent, but have largely been peaceful, beyond causing tension between residents and federal officials.

In a Sept. 26 news release, DHS pointed to arrests on two dates in June as examples of how people in Portland “have repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing center.”

One person was charged for shining a laser in the eyes of ICE agents, another for throwing a smoke grenade at ICE officers and a third for attempting to damage equipment at the facility and then striking and kicking officers while being arrested.

The news release also stated that ICE agents have been doxed and were subject to death threats.

Trump earlier deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, amid strong criticism from Democrats in those areas and legal challenges. Only in Memphis has Trump’s order been welcomed by the governor, Republican Bill Lee.

Earlier in September, Trump described living in Portland as “like living in hell” and said he was considering sending in federal troops. He has made similar threats in other Democrat-led cities, including Chicago and Baltimore.

Since the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump has blamed the “radical left” for the country’s problems with political violence. In a memo Thursday, Sept. 25, ordering a crackdown on alleged “organized political violence,” Trump wrote that “riots” in Portland and Los Angeles have resulted in a significant increase in attacks on ICE agents.

Trump indicated Thursday that an operation was underway.

In his post, Trump said the decision was made to protect the city and ICE facilities “under siege by ANTIFA, and other domestic terrorists.”

An increase in federal agents was already witnessed on Friday. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson held a press conference Friday night, acknowledging the buildup and pushing back on the controversial deployment, calling it a “big show.”

“I want to be clear about the situation we face. We now have a sudden influx of federal agents in our city. We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose,” Wilson said.

The move is not without precedent. The Trump Administration has deployed the National Guard and other active-duty troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. He has also threatened to deploy troops to several other cities like Chicago and Memphis, Tenn.

The President has also ramped up his rhetoric against Portland in recent weeks, saying that living in Portland is “like living in hell.”

The number of troops being deployed to the city and the overall objective is still unknown.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley warned the public that Trump would try to create chaos, . “Don’t take the bait,” he said.

“Our responsibility is to, yes, express our views. Yes, protest,” Merkley said. ""But best done at a distance from these federal troops, wherever they might be and whatever they are doing, because their goal is to create an engagement, an engagement that will lead to conflict.”

Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago but has yet to follow through. A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Trump’s crackdown on crime or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops' arrival. Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.

Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to requests for information, according to AP.

stated that the order to send troops to Portland ""came as a surprise to many in the Pentagon,"" and that many officials were not sure what the orders actually entailed.

The source said they expect the deployment to look similar to Los Angeles and Washington's National Guard missions, which were focused on ""supporting federal and local law enforcement,"" mainly through logistical support.

A history of protests in Portland

Portland has been at the in the past for protests-some of which -especially following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police in 2020.

The Trump administration sent hundreds of agents at the time, including U.S. Border Patrol officers, to protect federal property from vandalism.

Recent protests have been

Earlier this month, after it was used to detain people overnight or for more than 12 hours, which is a violation of its conditional land use approval.

KATU crews reported few protesters outside the ICE building on Saturday morning, all standing across the street.

The Trump administration claimed that this year, while a video surfaced late August showing a protester outside the building.

In response to a KATU inquiry to the White House regarding when troops would be deployed and what their tasks will be, a spokesperson responded with a timeline of different protests this year at the ICE facility, starting in early June.

Local officials respond

Portland officials have strongly opposed President Trump's proposal to deploy federal troops to the city, arguing that such a move is unnecessary and could escalate tensions.

At a press conference held on Saturday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek stated, ""There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city."" She emphasized that while the Oregon National Guard is prepared to protect residents, it is not needed in Portland.

Mayor Keith Wilson echoed this sentiment, asserting, ""The number of necessary troops is zero in Portland and any other American city.""

Both leaders criticized the use of outdated media coverage such as old protest clips circulating online to misrepresent the city and called for federal support in areas like education and infrastructure instead of military intervention.

They stressed the importance of peaceful protest and community support, urging residents to oppose the administration's policies constructively. Wilson concluded, ""We have a place at the table for everyone willing to lend us a hand and that should include the federal government.""

Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, representing Oregon's First Congressional District, joined the call against federal troop deployment, describing it as a ""gross abuse of power by the president.""

She noted, ""Nowhere did I see one single indication that we need military troops here."" Bonamici highlighted Portland as a thriving community, stating, ""It's a place where here today we see the sun shining, people out in the streets, shopping in our stores, going to our amazing restaurants.""

Portland's Chief of Police Bob Day reaffirmed the city's commitment to peace and safety, ""The men and women of the police bureau will continue to show up and to provide the highest level of service and safety to ensure peace for Portland, for all Portlanders.""

Day emphasized the city's track record of peaceful protests and the bureau's non-involvement in immigration enforcement.

Vanessa Sturgeon, representing the Portland Metro Chamber and the Downtown Portland Clean and Safe, expressed the business owner community's opposition to federal troop deployment.

Dallas ICE shooting victim names

The latest:

Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes are the latest to be identified as victims in the Wednesday shooting.

Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez was already known to be a victim injured in the shooting, and was also included in Saturday's release.

Where were the Dallas ICE victims from?

Bordones-Molina's country of origin is Mexico. His criminal history includes convictions for giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police, DHS said.

Guzman-Fuentes' country of origin is Venezuela. His criminal history includes theft of property and a traffic offense, according to the release.

Garcia-Hernandez's country of origin is Mexico. His criminal history includes previous arrests for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, DHS said.

Dallas ICE shooting victim conditions

What we know:

Garcia-Hernandez's brother spoke with a Dallas reporter on Thursday about the victim's condition.

The man said his brother was shot three or four times by Joshua Jahn, and is in ""very serious condition"" in the hospital. Garcia-Hernandez has had at least two surgeries so far.

What we don't know:

The condition of the other surviving victim has not been reported.

One of the three shooting victims died of his wounds, but the DHS release did not disclose which it was.

Dallas ICE facility shooting

The backstory:

The FBI is investigating Wednesday morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility as an act of targeted violence.

Officials said a sniper on the roof of a nearby building fired indiscriminately at the detention center, hitting three detainees who were arriving in a transport van. One of those detainees was killed, and two others were critically injured. No law enforcement officers were hurt.

Sources identified the shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who had ties to North Texas and Oklahoma. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as agents approached him.

While a motive for the shooting has not been released, bullets reportedly found at the scene had an anti-ICE message.

Who is Joshua Jahn?

Dig deeper:

Jahn had ties to North Texas and Oklahoma and federal investigators searched at least two homes connected to him.

He was linked to a home in Durant, Oklahoma, and a home in Fairview, which is in Collin County. Investigators were seen taking boxes out of one of the homes in Fairview.

Jahn does not appear to have a long criminal history. Court records show he hasn't been convicted of a violent crime, but was arrested in 2015 for marijuana possession in Collin County.

A spokesperson for Collin College in McKinney confirmed Jahn studied at the school at various times between 2013 and 2018.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/gettyimages-2236726579.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-27 22:56:54.930087

Portland, a Democratic-run city, is one of several so-called sanctuary cities. There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Mr Trump announced on social media on Saturday, local time, that he was directing the Department of Defense to ""provide all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland"".

It was necessary to protect ICE facilities, Mr Trump said, which he described as ""under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"".

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for details on Mr Trump's announcement, such as a timeline for the deployment or what troops would be involved.

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, a Democrat, said there was no need for troops in his city.

""Our nation has a long memory of acts of oppression, and the president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it,"" he said.

Early on Saturday, there was no sign of any federal presence in the city's downtown, where people jogged along the Willamette River, relaxed by a riverside fountain, or rode bikes on a sunny fall day.

""Where's the emergency?"" asked resident Allen Schmertzler, 72, who said he was ""disgusted"" by the president's decision.

Another resident, John McNeur, 74, called Mr Trump's statement ""ridiculous"". He pointed out that he was taking ""a leisurely stroll"" along the river on a peaceful, sunny day.

""This place is not a city that's out of control,"" he said. ""It's just a beautiful place.""

Mr Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago, but has yet to follow through.

A deployment in Memphis, Tennessee, is expected soon and will include only about 150 troops, far less than were sent to the District of Columbia for Mr Trump's crackdown on crime, or in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the troops' arrival. Mr Trump also sent Marines to Los Angeles.

Military ready to mobilise in 'calm' communities

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available.

""We stand ready to mobilise US military personnel in support of DHS operations in Portland at the President's direction,"" Mr Parnell said.

But Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said there was ""no national security threat"" in Portland.

""Our communities are safe and calm,"" Ms Kotek said.

A spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Bomar, said in an email that ""no official requests have been received at this time"" for Guard support. ""Any requests would need to be coordinated through the governor's office,"" he added.

Asked about the Portland decision on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents needed to be protected amid protests against immigration raids.

""We're not going to put up with it. This administration is not playing games,"" she said in an interview on Fox News.

There have been growing tensions in major US cities over Mr Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, days after a shooting targeting an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others seriously wounded.

Trump focuses on crime, 'antifa'

Since the September 10 assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Mr Trump has escalated his efforts to confront what he calls the ""radical left"", which he blames for the country's problems with political violence.

Mr Trump, in comments on Thursday in the Oval Office, suggested some kind of operation was in the works.

He said ""crazy people"" were trying to burn buildings in Portland.

""We're going to get out there and we're going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland,"" he said, describing them as ""professional agitators and anarchists"".

Mr Trump last week signed an executive order that declares the anti-fascist antifa movement a domestic ""terrorist organisation"" as part of a crackdown on what he claims is left-wing sponsored political violence.

According to US law enforcement, there has never been a terrorist incident in the United States connected to antifa.

Portland and protests

Mr Trump first sought to designate the movement as a domestic terror organisation during the nationwide George Floyd protests.

Portland, population 636,000, was also the site of long-running and sometimes violent racial justice protests following Mr Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police in 2020.

The Trump administration sent hundreds of agents, including from the US Border Patrol, for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

Recent protests have been far more muted and focused on the area around the ICE building, located outside the city's downtown, which was the heart of the 2020 protests. The building's main entrance and ground-floor windows have been boarded up and tagged with graffiti.

Earlier this month, the city said it would issue a land use violation notice to the city's ICE building because it had been used to detain people overnight or for more than 12 hours — violations of its conditional land use approval.

Early on Saturday, all was quiet outside that building, with no signs of protesters or law enforcement.

Some federal agents have been injured, and several protesters have been charged with assault. Some demonstrators also say they've been injured. When protesters erected a prop guillotine earlier this month, the DHS described it as ""unhinged behaviour"".

In the meantime, city groups and officials have sought to highlight the recovery of the downtown area since 2020.

This summer was reportedly the busiest for pedestrian traffic since before the coronavirus pandemic, and overall violent crime in Portland from January through June decreased by 17 per cent compared to the same period in 2024, a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found.

The downtown has seen a decrease in homeless encampments that defined the years immediately after the pandemic.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9a95cc57768e812ad7ddee14c4317d21?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-09-27 20:56:48.368589

Federal immigration officers have also come under scrutiny for their aggressive tactics in raids.","LOS ANGELES — A 79-year-old man in Southern California filed a claim against the federal government Thursday for $50 million in damages, saying federal agents violated his civil rights when they tackled him during a Sept. 9 immigration raid at a car wash business.

Rafie Ollah Shouhed, the owner of a car wash in Los Angeles, suffered several broken ribs and chest trauma, elbow injuries, and has symptoms of a traumatic brain injury, according to the claim. Shouhed is a naturalized U.S citizen from Iran.

Video surveillance footage from inside the car wash shows a federal officer running in through a hallway. The agent encounters Shouhed and knocks him to the ground before running past him. In footage from outside the car wash, Shouhed walks toward a federal officer who appears to be detaining one of his employees. Shouhed briefly grapples with a second officer, before a third officer runs in and tackles him to the ground.

The claim was filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection.

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson said authorities arrested five people from Guatemala and Mexico “who broke our nation’s immigration laws” from the car wash and that Shouhed “impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting and impeding a federal officer.”

Shouhed and his attorney V. James DeSimone denied the accusation at a press conference Thursday.

“What can I do for you? Can I help you?” Shouhed recalled saying to the officers.

He said he wanted to tell agents he had documents to show his employees were eligible to work. There is no audio on the surveillance footage.

“This is the way ICE is operating in our community,"" DeSimone said. ""They use physical force, they don't speak to the people in order to ascertain who is there legally in order to do their job. Instead, they immediately resort to force.”

After Shouhed was detained, he said he showed an officer at the detention center his ID. He was held for 12 hours and released without charges, the claim says.

The agency has six months to settle or deny the claim, after which Shouhed can file a lawsuit in federal court.

Several other U.S. citizens have also filed civil rights claims against the government for being wrongly detained during federal immigrant enforcement operations in Southern California. They include Andrea Velez, who was detained June 24 on her way to work in downtown Los Angeles. She was held for two days and faced a charge for obstructing a federal officer that was eventually dropped.

Federal immigration officers have also come under scrutiny for their aggressive tactics in raids.

Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50, which calls for redrawing of California congressional districts to give Democrats more voting power.

Early Saturday morning, protesters packed the sand from Santa Monica to Laguna Beach, with signs that read “Bring back democracy,” “America is not a dictatorship,” and “Take the power back, say yes to 50.”

Beachgoers stopped to stare, and as the crowd later moved along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach, car horns blared in support.

If passed, Proposition 50 would gerrymander the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats, an effort pushed by Newsom in response to a similar effort in Texas to create congressional districts that favor Republicans and help the GOP keep control of the House of Representatives.

Speakers addressed the crowds, speaking out against the threat to 1st Amendment rights, coming only days after late night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” was temporarily pulled off the air over the host’s comments on the slaying of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.

Gail Kauffman, a speaker at the event held in Seal Beach, expressed worries about the future of free speech under the Trump administration.

“Just the hate that he spews, the lies that he’s telling us, the restrictions that he’s putting in place, the money he’s making off of being our president, the corruption and the idiots that he has put in positions of leadership appall me, anger me, astonish me,” Kauffman said. “I never thought that I would live to see this.”

Organizations such as Democracy Action Network, Indivisible and 50501 were part of the effort to create a “human chain” to demonstrate solidarity against unfair congressional district gerrymandering.

Nathalie Wilson, an organizer for Indivisible CA 47, said the chain formed bonds between neighbors and fostered conversations around local politics.

“Today we were especially having a moment of unity at 11 [a.m.], when everybody became silent and linked arms and hands for a period to just reflect on the situation we’re in that we find ourselves in in this country. So that was really meaningful, and I really enjoyed the spirit of that,” Wilson said.

Mayor Keith Wilson said city officials were aware of an influx of federal officers at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building on the South Waterfront and made mention of armored vehicles. The federal officers did not come at any request from the city, he said, nor with any clear ""precedent or purpose."" He and other leaders called it an overreach and an attempt to sow chaos in the city.

""This federal mobilization is a distraction,"" Wilson said. ""This may be a show of force, but that's all it is — a big show.""

On Saturday morning, Trump wrote on social media that he was directing the Department of Defense to ""provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland,"" adding that he was ""also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

Around 7:30 p.m. Friday, a KGW photographer saw roughly 30 SUVs departing a U.S. Customs and Border Protection building off Northeast 82nd, heading off in different directions.

""We have no tolerance for anyone in Portland who uses this difficult moment to hurt others, or our home,"" Wilson said.

RELATED: Oregon lawmakers, advocates push back against Trump claims after ICE facility tour

The primary refrain of Friday's press briefing, put into words by U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, was ""don't take the bait.""

Merkley said that he did not know what agencies the federal agents were with, nor had they informed any Oregon leaders of their plans. He encouraged Portlanders, if they were to protest, to do so peacefully and at a distance from federal officers.

Portland City Councilor Eric Zimmerman said that he was on his way to speak at a Returning Veterans Project gala when he learned about the press conference, and he changed his plans because of how important he thought this was.

""I think it's important that we let Portlanders exercise their rights, but as a city councilor and as an elected official, I want to be very clear — I see no operational, I see no legal reason for any federal agents or increase in federal agents to be on the streets of Portland,"" Zimmerman said. ""I see no reason for an MRAP, something that I drove a long time ago in a country far, far away to be on the streets of any American city and certainly not in Portland.""

In addition to elected officials, business and faith leaders spoke to decry the federal surge and call for peace.

""Forty years from now when many of us are gone and some are really old, our offspring are going to wonder where we were,"" said Dr. J.W. Matt Hennessee, pastor at Vancouver Avenue First Baptist Church. ""They're going to wonder whether we used our voice, whether we used our opportunity to speak up.

""And what I'm hoping for and what I'm believing in, is that they will be able to say they did it right; they opened their mouth, and they took action and they worked together across every divide; they did the work that was necessary, and Portland and Oregon is better as a result.""

At various points throughout the press conference, a small group of protesters who've been showing up outside the South Waterfront ICE facility for months interjected with strong words for some of the speakers. When the protestors began shouting over the question-and-answer section, city officials abruptly ended the press conference.

""They're showing support now because they know we can no longer be ignored,"" said Dina, one of the protestors, ""because we made enough noise that it is making them look bad. That is why they're finally starting to show up.""

U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden released a statement via social media after the press conference, saying in part, ""There are credible reports that federal agents may be replaying the 2020 playbook and surging into Portland with the goal of provoking conflict and violence in my hometown. I am in close contact with state and local officials to monitor this activity. ... I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump’s attempt to incite violence.""

Within the past several weeks, President Donald Trump has had a lot to say about Portland, mentioning that being in the city is like ""living in hell,"" or that protestors ""burn the place down every night."" Before his announcement on social media Saturday morning, Trump had threatened to deploy the National Guard or more federal law enforcement.

In Saturday's announcement, Trump said sending troops to Portland was necessary to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, which he described as ""under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.""

RELATED: Trump vows to stop 'out of control and crazy' people in Portland, but he has other priorities first

Presumably, his comments have something to do with the ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue, which has been a frequent site of small protests and intermittent clashes with federal agents since his administration stepped up deportation efforts.

Based on his comments, it's clear that Trump associates Portland with antifa, recently named a ""domestic terrorist organization,"" which is a term used to describe a loosely associated movement of anti-fascist activists.

""These are professional agitators and anarchists,"" Trump said this week. ""We’re going to do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that.""

In a presidential memo sent Thursday to cabinet officials, titled ""Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,"" Trump referenced ""riots"" in Portland and Los Angeles as reflective of a ""more than 1,000 percent increase in attacks on (ICE) officers since January 21, 2025, compared to the same period last year.""

DES MOINES, Iowa — ICE Des Moines arrested Ian Andre Roberts, a criminal illegal alien from Guyana in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife. At the time of his arrest, Roberts was working as the Superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools despite being an illegal alien with a final order of removal and no work authorization.

During a targeted enforcement operation on Sept. 26, 2025, officers approached Roberts in his vehicle after identifying himself, but he sped away. Officers later discovered his vehicle abandoned near a wooded area. State Patrol assisted in locating the subject and he was taken into ICE custody.

Roberts has existing weapon possession charges from February 5, 2020. Roberts entered the United States in 1999 on a student visa and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May of 2024.

The investigation into how Roberts acquired the handgun is being turned over to the ATF. It is a violation of federal law for those in the U.S. without legal status to possess a firearm and ammunition.

“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” said ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson. “This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats. How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, has been transferred from the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia to Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told the court the transfer could make it more difficult to access him and provide counsel because the attorneys are based in Nashville, Tennessee, and New York City. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials told the attorneys that the move “will allow Mr. Abrego-Garcia’s legal team greater access to him,” the filing states, which Abrego Garcia’s attorneys argue is not necessarily true.

“Travel to Moshannon is far more difficult for the members of the defense team based in Nashville, and is not appreciably easier for the New York-based members of the defense team, compared to Farmville,” the filing states.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys did not immediately return a request for comment Saturday. The Philadelphia ICE field office referred requests for comment to the Department of Homeland Security.

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, confirmed Abrego Garcia’s transfer to Moshannon, and said he is a “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator.”

“We are not going to allow this criminal Salvadoran gang member to be loose on U.S. streets to terrorize American citizens,” she said.

The case has become a major point of contention regarding President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown since taking office earlier this year.

Abrego Garcia, 30, fled El Salvador around 2011 to escape from a gang that had extorted and terrorized his family, court documents state. After initially being denied an application for asylum, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported in 2019.

The Trump administration facilitated his return back to the United States in June after he was detained and mistakenly deported to an El Salvadoran prison. But upon his return, he was charged with human smuggling and they alleged that he was anMS-13 gang member, a claim Abrego Garcia denies. The administration now wants to deport him to the African nation of Eswatini.

The gang allegation relates to his detention in Maryland back in 2019, when Prince George’s County Police Department officers said he was seen wearing a “Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations,” court documents state. Officials claimed the paraphernalia was evidence that he was “in good standing with the MS-13.” He was not charged at the time.

The human smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. He was pulled over for speeding and, according to body camera footage, officers initially discussed among themselves whether he was a human trafficker because he was traveling with eight passengers who had no luggage. He was ultimately let go with just a warning about an expired driver’s license.

Regarding his transfer, his defense team is also concerned about the conditions at the Pennsylvania detention center. The facility is operated by private prison company The GEO Group, Inc. and holds up to 1,876 people. It was a former federal prison that was reopened in 2021 by the Biden administration as an ICE detention center.

In August, Chaofeng Ge, a 32-year-old Chinese citizen who was detained at the facility, was pronounced dead after he was found hanging by the neck and unresponsive in the shower by staff members.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys referenced the man’s hanging in their court filings and echoed activists’ concerns about the facility. Several people spoke of “inhumane, punitive and dangerous conditions” at the center in a 2024 report by Temple University law students and the immigrant rights organization Juntos.

“Conditions at Moshannon are also deeply concerning—a detainee died by hanging last month, there have been recent reports of assaults, inadequate medical care, and insufficient food, and the Department of Homeland Security abruptly terminated an internal investigation into allegations of excessive force and abuses by guards at the facility,” the filing states.

U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon was denied access to the facility earlier this month, and told WHYY News her constituents have complained about conditions there.

“There’s a lot of concerns that arise when you have the government incarcerating people and hiding what’s going on behind those walls — and that’s the purpose for doing oversight,” Scanlon said at the time.

Advocates have called on the Clearfield County Commissioners to end its contract with ICE, which allows the federal agency to lease the former federal prison.

Jasmine Rivera, executive director of the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition, a statewide immigrant rights organization, said Abrego Garcia’s transfer to the facility “is yet another example of exactly why we need to shut down Moshannon detention center.”

“This is a facility that has a track record of abuse since it opened in 2021,” she said. “Two people have died in this prison, and we’ve only ever heard from those being detained there that conditions have gotten even worse in 2025.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment over concerns about conditions at Moshannon.

In the aftermath of Ge’s death in August, the agency said in a statement that it is “committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure, and humane environments.”

According to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, then chief of the Tribhuvan International Airport Immigration Office, facilitated the departures without the mandatory “No Objection Certificate” (NOC). He held the position between October 2024 and May 2025.

Investigators say each Indian passenger paid between $1,000 and $2,000, money that allegedly travelled through middlemen and senior figures in the home ministry may have received a certain percentage of that. “The initial probe has focused on Bhattarai, but the second phase will expand to examine political connections and wider collusion,” a CIAA official said.

The racket came to light in May when CIAA officials raided the immigration office after months of surveillance. Bhattarai was briefly detained by the anti-graft body before being released on bail while investigations continued.

The findings paint a troubling picture. At least 200 members of the Sikh community are suspected to have entered third countries illegally, and Indian nationals even used fake NOCs to board flights to the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Why travellers chose Kathmandu rather than India’s 35 international airports remains a key question. Investigators say some were fugitives from Indian gold smuggling cases, including men blacklisted by the Indian embassy in Kathmandu. One such accused, Jageshwar Shah, reportedly flew out to Dubai just a day after being placed on the no-fly list.

Bhattarai is no stranger to controversy. He previously faced corruption charges over earthquake relief funds, yet was later promoted to joint secretary. His direct contact with travel agency operators, including repeated phone calls with officials from the Greenline Holidays, has deepened suspicion. CIAA has also traced suspicious money flows through associates’ bank accounts.

The scandal has embarrassed Nepal’s Home Ministry, which was informed twice by CIAA but allegedly showed no urgency until the anti-graft body launched its own sting operation. Former home minister Ramesh Lekhak and then home secretary Gokarna Mani Duwadi are now under scrutiny, with Bhattarai himself hinting at “higher-level involvement” during interrogation.

“This is not just about one official. It exposes a culture of organised collusion within the immigration system,” said a senior CIAA source.

The commission says it has completed the first phase of investigation and will soon file charges against Bhattarai and others. But victims’ rights activists warn the scandal has already damaged Nepal’s credibility in global aviation and migration governance.

MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her — and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day-by-day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives — safe from harm — through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, 2026, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And Sept. 10 was the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans — including Mariana and Antonio — who would have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives — or face losing everything.

“We have people (…) who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. — children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group. “Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained. It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country — people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana — who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country. “I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

Temporary Protected Status began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months — and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. Homeland Security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that jumped from $50 to $500 this year, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. (…) The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

The leaders of humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas, said a return to Haiti could be a death sentence for TPS recipients.

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” Noroña said. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July — titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” — in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories — the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the U.S. to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex — a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples — sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Cómo estás?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport — possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision. Several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right. We’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a recent rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks — some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property (…) let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation — but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied — assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

“Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained,” said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas:

‘We dream of a normal life’

Over the past four years, Mariana and Antonio built new lives in the U.S.

With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions — such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast — they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids.

“That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

Antonio also dreams of stability.

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” he said.

But for now, they have struggled to see any future beyond this month, when their TPS was set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program, with classes starting this month. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they say they will move to Spain.

“I love projections — I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. (…) I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance. Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K,” the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met — in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together.

“We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I,” Antonio summarized.

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited its last line — “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” — then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”",https://nondoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TPS_Terminated_01.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:56:43.462620

This appeal represents the administration’s most significant attempt to fundamentally alter how American citizenship is conferred under the 14th Amendment.

The executive order, issued on Jan. 20 and titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” would prevent the federal government from issuing citizenship documents to children born on American soil whose parents were either in the country unlawfully or present temporarily under legal status.

This policy directly challenges more than a century of legal precedent establishing that birth on American soil generally confers citizenship regardless of parental immigration status. The administration’s appeal argues that current interpretations of constitutional citizenship provisions have created destructive consequences for border security and immigration enforcement.

Legal strategy targets procedural barriers

The Supreme Court previously addressed birthright citizenship in June, though that decision focused primarily on the procedural question of lower court authority to block presidential policies. The 6-3 majority ruling limited but did not eliminate judicial power to halt such executive actions, creating space for continued legal challenges.

Following that decision, opponents of the citizenship policy filed new lawsuits using different legal strategies, including class-action approaches that have successfully maintained nationwide injunctions against implementation. These alternative legal challenges have kept Trump’s policy on hold despite the Supreme Court’s earlier procedural ruling.

The administration now seeks definitive resolution by asking the justices to review substantive constitutional questions rather than procedural limitations. This approach represents an escalation in the legal battle over one of the most fundamental aspects of American citizenship law.

Multiple court decisions block implementation

Federal courts in different jurisdictions have consistently rejected the administration’s constitutional arguments. A San Francisco-based federal appeals court upheld a Seattle judge’s nationwide injunction in a case brought by Democratic-led states, finding the citizenship policy violated established constitutional principles.

Similarly, a New Hampshire federal judge issued a separate nationwide block in a class-action lawsuit filed by civil liberties organizations. This ruling specifically protects babies who would be affected by the policy, creating additional legal barriers to implementation.

The administration filed appeals in both cases Friday, arguing that American citizenship represents a fundamental privilege that should only extend to those legally entitled under proper constitutional interpretation. The government contends that current citizenship practices undermine national sovereignty and border security objectives.

Historical precedent faces reinterpretation challenge

The administration’s constitutional argument centers on reinterpreting the landmark 1898 Supreme Court decision in US v. Wong Kim Ark, which established birthright citizenship for people born in the United States. That case involved the son of Chinese immigrants and created precedent that has guided citizenship law for over a century.

Trump’s legal team argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision has been misunderstood and that it only recognized citizenship for people born in the United States who enjoyed permanent residence status. The administration contends this historical limitation was central to the original analysis and should restrict current citizenship practices.

Lower courts have uniformly rejected these reinterpretation attempts. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the executive order contradicts both constitutional text and decades of established executive branch practice regarding citizenship determination.

Political and legal implications converge

The Supreme Court appeal represents a high-stakes constitutional battle with implications extending far beyond immigration policy. Success would fundamentally alter how American citizenship operates and could affect hundreds of thousands of people born on US soil annually.

The administration has expressed confidence that the conservative-majority Supreme Court will approve its constitutional interpretation. However, the justices’ willingness to hear the case remains uncertain, as four justices must vote to grant review before arguments can proceed.

Civil liberties organizations have vowed continued resistance to the citizenship policy regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision on hearing the case. Legal advocates argue the executive order violates fundamental constitutional principles that have defined American citizenship since Reconstruction.

Uncertain timeline creates continued limbo

The appeal process will likely extend the legal uncertainty surrounding birthright citizenship for months while the Supreme Court considers whether to grant review. If the justices accept the case, arguments would occur during the upcoming term with a decision expected by summer.

Until resolution, lower court injunctions remain in effect, preventing implementation of the citizenship restrictions while legal battles continue across multiple jurisdictions.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2429741167.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:56:46.527984

(KOIN) — After seeing increased signs of federal presence at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, multiple public officials held an emergency press conference.

The event took place at Westminster Presbyterian Church and featured Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, Senator Jeff Merkley, Rep. Maxine Dexter and others.

“We now have a sudden influx of federal agents in our city. We did not ask for them to come,” Wilson said. “If the federal government isn’t here to lend us a hand, take a hike…It’s just a big show.”

“The president has sent agents here to create chaos and riots in Portland,” Merkley added. “(Trump) wants to induce a violent exchange. Let’s not grant him that wish…Say no to an authoritarian president.”

Pastor J.W. Matt Hennesee, Pastor Mark Knutson, Portland Metro Chamber Chair Michael Liu, Portland City Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney, Multnomah County Board Chair Jessica Vega Pederson and Jessica Maravilla of the ACLU Oregon were also in attendance at the press conference, organized within an hour’s notice.

The press conference comes amid reports of more federal agents seen in Portland, including some reportedly driving through the streets of downtown.

“Trump wants us divided and distracted from his failure to govern,” Dexter said. “Anyone who uses this horrific show of force as an excuse to hurt people or damage our home does not have this community’s best interest at heart…We will not escalate.”

Earlier Friday, Oregon lawmakers also sounded the alarm for what they said is the alleged mistreatment of detainees at the Portland ICE facility in a separate press event attended by some of the same leaders.

Midway through the press conference, someone in the crowd could be heard saying, “They are going to escalate anyway. The protest has always been peaceful, but they tackled a pregnant woman…they have caused three miscarriages in the apartment building from the (ICE) facility from their poisonous gas.”

At the end of the presser, a couple of people in the crowd began yelling at officials.

“I have been emailing you for months. When are you going to step up?” one protester said.

KOIN 6 News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to ask whether they could confirm more federal agents had arrived in Portland. On Saturday morning, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin sent the statement below:

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are taking action to restore law and order following weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities, assaults on law enforcement, and the terrorist attack at our ICE facility in Dallas. We are not going to allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement.

It was a moment that rippled far beyond the crowded halls of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building in New York City. On a September morning, as routine proceedings unfolded at the Manhattan immigration court, an encounter between a federal immigration officer and an Ecuadorian woman changed the national conversation about law enforcement accountability in the Trump era.

Captured on cell phone videos that soon flooded social media, the incident showed the woman pleading in Spanish with the officer moments after her husband was arrested. The exchange turned physical: the officer pushed her into a wall, then forced her to the floor, as stunned onlookers recoiled in shock. The footage, grainy but unmistakable, quickly ignited outrage and calls for answers.

Trump Administration’s ICE Faces Rare Rebuke

In the hours following the incident, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that the officer involved was “being relieved of current duties.” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, stated, “The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE.” Her words, striking for their directness, signaled a rare public discipline from an agency more often criticized for aggressive tactics than for holding its own accountable.

Historically, the Trump administration’s approach to immigration enforcement has been unyielding. Aggressive operations, rapid deportations, and a high-profile rhetoric of “law and order” have defined the era. Yet, as Reuters and National Newswatch report, public rebukes and disciplinary actions against officers for excessive force have been exceptionally rare. This case, then, stands out—not only for its immediate consequences but for what it may signal about shifting boundaries of acceptable conduct.

Public Reaction and Policy Implications

Outside the courthouse, advocacy groups gathered, demanding greater transparency and accountability from ICE. “This is not an isolated incident,” said Nick Sansone, attorney for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, referencing the broader pattern of forceful tactics. “It speaks to a culture where vulnerable people feel unsafe even in spaces meant for justice.” The swift disciplinary action was welcomed by some, but many questioned whether it would lead to more systemic change or remain an exception.

For immigrant communities in New York—where fear of detention and deportation is a constant undertone—the incident was more than news. It was a visceral reminder of the risks faced daily. Several organizations, including Public Citizen Litigation Group, cited the case as evidence in ongoing lawsuits challenging ICE practices. The White House, meanwhile, dismissed allegations of systemic abuse as “dangerous smears,” insisting that enforcement operations target dangerous criminals and require “careful planning and execution.”

Broader Context: Immigration Enforcement Under Scrutiny

Discussions about ICE’s accountability are taking place against a backdrop of significant political tension. As the Supreme Court recently upheld the Trump administration’s freeze on $5 billion in foreign aid, critics argue that executive power is expanding at the expense of oversight. Congressional leaders have voiced concerns about the separation of powers and the humanitarian impact of such decisions, as reported by National Newswatch.

Within the law enforcement community, the disciplinary action has sparked debate. Some officers worry that increased scrutiny could hinder their ability to perform dangerous duties. Others, however, argue that clear standards and accountability are crucial for maintaining public trust. “Our job is hard enough without being vilified,” said one ICE agent who requested anonymity. “But there’s no excuse for crossing the line.”

Meanwhile, the incident in New York has become a touchstone for broader conversations about civil rights, policing, and the responsibilities of those in power. Legal experts note that disciplinary measures, though rare, can set precedent and lead to policy reviews. Advocacy groups continue to push for reforms, including mandatory body cameras, independent oversight boards, and better training in de-escalation techniques.

Human Stories and the Search for Justice

Lost in the political crossfire are the everyday lives affected by these policies. The Ecuadorian woman, whose name was not disclosed for privacy, described feeling “terrified and powerless” in the aftermath. Her husband remains in detention, and their future is uncertain. Community leaders have rallied to provide support, underscoring the human cost behind headlines and statistics.

For many, this case is a microcosm of the national struggle over immigration and identity. It raises uncomfortable questions: When does enforcement become abuse? Who watches the watchdogs? And how can justice be served when fear and mistrust run so deep?

As the news cycle moves on, the incident remains a stark reminder that accountability, while elusive, is not impossible. The decision to discipline the ICE officer may not rewrite history, but it carves out a small space for hope—hope that the system can, at least occasionally, correct itself.

The rare public discipline of an ICE officer in New York signals a subtle but meaningful shift in the expectations placed on federal law enforcement under the Trump administration. While one rebuke does not guarantee lasting change, it sets a precedent that could inform future policies and, perhaps, foster a culture of greater accountability. Ultimately, the incident is both a warning and an opportunity—a moment to reflect on how power is wielded, and what kind of justice the nation is willing to defend.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICE-agent-vs-Ecuadorian-woman.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 16:57:23.565509

But whatever his intentions, other deaths in immigration detention this year — from untreated illness, suicide and neglect — have been far more common and far less publicized.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old who had lived in California since childhood, died on Sunday, Sept. 21. Uribe, a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained during an August raid on the carwash where he had worked for 15 years, and transferred to ICE’s Adelanto detention center near Los Angeles. Shortly after, he became ill with coughing and fevers. Family told the Los Angeles Times that he was given little more than Tylenol as his condition deteriorated, before he died while awaiting surgery on an abscess. Ayala-Uribe’s brother said that Ismael “tried asking for help, but they wouldn’t really do anything.”

Physical conditions aren’t the only medical needs going unmet. El Pais reported this week that suicide attempts in U.S. detention centers are increasing, partly due to a lack of proper mental health treatment. Immigration lawyers and people currently in detention told The New York Times that ICE rarely meets its own standards of care, which require initial screenings on arrival, detailed assessments within two weeks, and access to emergency care. Experts say suicidal ideation is also a function of the miserable conditions in many immigration settings, which have also led to reports of detainees refusing meals in protest in California and Louisiana this week.

In many cases, detainees who express suicidal ideation are placed in solitary confinement or similar isolated settings, which are widely understood to worsen mental illness. That practice is part of a broader increase in the use of solitary confinement in detention that The Marshall Project and Univision reported on earlier this month.

In at least one case, the lack of care has also extended to an expectant mother. This week, The San Francisco Chronicle told the story of Angie Rodriguez, a 26-year-old San Jose, California, woman who discovered she was pregnant, and then miscarried while in ICE custody. Rodriguez said she received no meaningful prenatal care or dietary support, and was placed in medical isolation, which she compared to solitary confinement.

When she started to bleed, Rodriguez was “transported to the hospital in metal restraints around her wrists and ankles and connected by a waist chain,” despite ICE policy that says pregnant individuals should not be transported in restraints, according to the Chronicle. After the miscarriage, Rodriguez’s attorney filed for a temporary restraining order to secure her release. A federal judge granted it, concluding that she had been detained without cause and suffered irreparable harm.

Rodriguez is home now, but for others, a judge’s order is increasingly not enough to actually leave detention.

In early July, the Trump administration issued a new interpretation of key provisions of immigration law, asserting that most people who enter the country undocumented are ineligible for bond hearings in the lead-up to final removal proceedings. In cases where detainees have convinced immigration judges that this interpretation is wrong, the administration has used another maneuver: “automatic stay.”

Adopted in 2001, “automatic stay” allows the government to postpone release on bond for 90 days, and often to extend it even further. Historically, it has been considered a tool for “limited” use in specific circumstances — such as for a flight risk or someone who presented national security concerns. But the Trump administration has dramatically expanded the ways this stay is applied.

The unilateral nature of the move has deeply troubled many legal scholars and judges, Politico reported. “Automatic stay is a violent distortion of proper, legitimate process whereby the Government, as though by talisman, renders itself at once prosecutor and adjudicator,” a Maryland district judge wrote in a recent opinion.

Bond recipients aren’t the only detainees to receive a favorable ruling from a court, only to remain locked up. This week, Mother Jones reported on cases in which people are granted a “withholding of removal” by a judge — essentially a determination that a person’s home country is too dangerous for them — only for the government to keep them in detention in a bid to deport them elsewhere.

In both cases, lawyers and immigrant rights advocates have described the delays as tactics “to wear detainees down and get them to give up their fight to stay in the U.S.,” possibly to get them to attempt self-deportation, Mother Jones reported.

These aggressive tactics have pushed detention to record levels over the past few months. Nearly 60,000 people are in detention as of this week, a roughly 50% increase from before President Donald Trump took office.

That rise is not just a product of detaining more people once they are arrested; it’s also due to finding new ways to make arrests. One key method has been to seize people as they leave court. Most often, that has meant immigration court. Rodriguez, who had a miscarriage in detention, was first detained this way.

Increasingly, federal agents are making arrests at state courthouses as well. In California, state law bans immigration enforcement at courthouses, but ICE has done so anyway, often by waiting just outside the building. There is some debate over whether the language of the law prohibits this. In Oakland, ICE conducted at least one arrest inside the state courthouse last week, drawing fierce condemnation from public defenders.

Federal officials have defended the practice, saying they will arrest undocumented people wherever they can find them, and that courthouse arrests keep agents safe, since arrestees have already been screened by security to go inside.

As reported by CalMatters, critics, like the California Department of Justice, have countered that the chilling effects on court attendance “make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/_rRGDR0IplCgvH5d_kfZi_dGKdKo2ne9M4H-JWb-55I/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC94eHpmZDNncHJm/bGJrcWZsYWU3a3ph/ZmdnZHprL0FQMjUw/NDM2ODAzNTI2NzEu/anBn,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:45.056104

Miguel Angel García-Hernandez of Mexico, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador were shot in what the FBI has described as a “targeted attack” on Ice by the 29-year-old alleged shooter, Joshua Jahn, CNN reported.

While several outlets, including the New York Times and Univision, reported that Garcia-Hernandez was among the injured, the federal government has not publicly confirmed this. The New York Times said Bordones-Molina was the second injured detainee, while Guzman-Fuentes was fatally shot.

García-Hernandez, who grew up in Arlington and was originally from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, was shot three to four times during the attack, his brother, who asked not to be identified because he is in immigration proceedings and has not yet obtained legal status, told the news outlets about the father of four.

“He’s in very serious condition in the hospital. He’s very bad,” his brother told Univision. “He’s already had two operations.”

A video filmed from inside the building shows detainees running while handcuffed and their legs shackled, some falling to the ground amid the rush to evade the gunfire.

García-Hernandez, who is undocumented, is a house painter who has been living in the US for about 20 years, the New York Times reported, and his mother was deported about two months ago.

“What we want is for them to help my mother so she can come see [García-Hernandez] because she was also deported unjustly,” said García-Hernandez’s brother to Univision. García-Hernandez’s brother and partner are seeking legal advice on possible actions they can take after the incident. As García-Hernandez was the family’s main support, they have launched a GoFundMe campaign to help cover expenses, including those for a baby on the way.

Meanwhile, Bordones-Molina was also undocumented and had a prior legal record, including a traffic violation and a property-related offense, according to CNN.

Guzman-Fuentes, the third shooting victim, had been previously arrested “for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon”, a source told CNN.

Authorities said the shooter had not intended to harm detainees, according to notes he wrote. After the detainees were shot, Jahn, of Fairview, Texas, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“Notably, these loose notes included a game plan of the attack and target areas at the facility,” Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the northern district of Texas, said on Thursday. “He called the Ice employees ‘people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck.’”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e738283ee6cd622727bbc40f4fd546c7d07eda91/491_0_4380_3504/master/4380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e857df868e3ac07e24ece45becfec877",N,,2025-09-27 12:56:53.773881

Campbell said the Attorney General’s Office has worked with community organizations to develop a rapid response system and mobilize resources to support the immigrant community.
“The federal laws are stacked against us when it comes to immigration and immigration enforcement,” Campbell said.
“This attorney general has their back,” Campbell told Brookline.News.","Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and leaders of Greater Boston organizations fighting federal immigration crackdowns are calling on Brookline for collective action and solidarity.

They spoke Wednesday night at an event organized by Brookline for Racial Justice and Equity at United Parish. The event, “Brookline United For Immigrant Justice,” drew around 150 people and raised $7,555 for four frontline organizations — La Colaborativa, Fuerza, Lawyers for Civil Rights and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA.

“Support for immigrants has been something that has long been part of the culture in Brookline,” said BRJE Executive Director Raul Fernandez. “[This] was an opportunity for Brookline residents who do care about these issues to come together and support those kinds of frontline organizations.”

Campbell headlined the event in a keynote conversation led by Kimberley Richardson, chair of BRJE’s board of directors. Fernandez called Campbell a “champion” in the immigration space for tackling federal immigration enforcement through a legal lens.

“It’s really important to have someone like her grounding this effort, because it’s not just about what people feel,” Fernandez said. “It’s also about what the law really says.”

The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office has filed more than 30 lawsuits against the Trump administration, Campbell said. Its latest victory came Wednesday in a case that challenged the administration for withholding billions in emergency service funding to “strong-arm” states into compliance.

Campbell said the Attorney General’s Office has worked with community organizations to develop a rapid response system and mobilize resources to support the immigrant community.

“The federal laws are stacked against us when it comes to immigration and immigration enforcement,” Campbell said. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to fight like hell to protect our people [and] protect our immigrants.”

Campbell answered questions on state efforts to preserve public education funding, promote equitable access to affordable housing, and defend diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in schools and universities.

Following the keynote conversation was a panel consisting of leaders of organizations fighting immigration enforcement in Greater Boston and Massachusetts.

Fernandez said it was important to highlight frontline organizations to show Brookline residents how they can get involved and support their efforts.

“I always talk about Brookline as a community among communities,” he said. “Who our neighbors are doesn’t stop at the border of Brookline.”

Gladys Vega, president and CEO of La Colaborativa , a Greater Boston organization that supports Latino immigrants, said people need to see immigrants as human beings and not illegal criminals. She referenced the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision that cleared the way for racial profiling in immigration raids.

“We need to do more in our communities, especially communities of color, where now people have a license to racial profile, and they have a right to make you feel that you don’t belong,” Vega said.

Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights , said as angry as people may feel, there are also “lessons to be learned” from past opportunities to prevent federal encroachment that were “wasted.”

“When I look back, [I think] we have wasted entire presidential administrations, completely wasted, failed to leverage what can be leveraged, failed to mobilize with efficiency and purpose around issues that we care about,” he said. “And now we see what the federal government can actually do. It’s scary.”

Fuerza , a neighborhood watch in Waltham that is part of the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA , coordinates with LUCE to receive rapid verification of ICE activity in Waltham, so volunteers can respond and support families.

Fuerza’s founder, Jonathan Paz, told Brookline.News the most important element of his group’s work is being there for community members in “their moment of most need.”

“Part of what we’re doing is shifting the tone, shifting the energy, so people are becoming more proactive, rather than just reactive, in a time where we’re constantly under attack,” he said.

During the panel, Paz said Campbell and the Attorney General’s Office need to do more to prevent courthouses from being “ICE traps,” where ICE agents detain immigrants before they can through the legal process.

“We have a highly competent attorney general who needs to display some political courage here and prevent the further entrapments that are happening in our courts,” Paz told Brookline.News. “ICE is creating an environment where people have to self-criminalize to exist here. This is untenable.”

After the conversation, Campbell told Brookline.News she appreciates the frontline organizations for helping her office with its federal accountability work by providing on-the-ground accounts.

“If we file a lawsuit, for example, it’s based on what we’re hearing and seeing happening on the ground,” she said. “These organizations are giving us those stories.”

Campbell said she loves Brookline because it is both a community and municipality that looks out for its people and sees the humanity in them, regardless of their immigration status. She reiterated her support for her constituents in uncertain times.

“This attorney general has their back,” Campbell told Brookline.News. “We’ll fight with a sense of urgency, no fear and deep compassion and empathy for the people in Massachusetts, to protect them and also protect our economy.”

The appeal, shared with The Associated Press on Saturday, sets in motion a process at the high court that could lead to a definitive ruling from the justices by early summer on whether the citizenship restrictions are constitutional.

Lower-court judges have so far blocked them from taking effect anywhere. The Republican administration is not asking the court to let the restrictions take effect before it rules.

The Justice Department's petition has been shared with lawyers for parties challenging the order, but is not yet docketed at the Supreme Court.

Any decision on whether to take up the case probably is months away and arguments probably would not take place until the late winter or early spring.

""The lower court's decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,"" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. ""Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.""

Cody Wofsy, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents children who would be affected by Trump's restrictions, said the administration's plan is plainly unconstitutional.

""This executive order is illegal, full stop, and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that. We will continue to ensure that no baby's citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order,"" Wofsy said in an email.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term in the White House that would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution's 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges' use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump's order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Birthright_AP_25197797466121_NAT_0808,N,,2025-09-27 16:57:27.282115

Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, said the Trump administration is putting “targets on the backs of organizers” like her.
It is a domestic extremist organization” — a quote raising new concerns in light of Trump’s memo.
!” Comey’s indictment — on charges of lying to Congress — was reported shortly after the White House event where Trump signed the memo.
Trump declined to discuss Comey at the event, and was vague about who else might be targeted under the memo.","At a tense political moment in the wake of conservative lightning rod Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum focusing federal law enforcement on disrupting “domestic terrorism.”

The memo appeared to focus on political violence. But during a White House signing Thursday, the president and his top advisors repeatedly hinted at a much broader campaign of suppression against the American left, referencing as problematic both the simple printing of protest signs and the prominent racial justice movement Black Lives Matter.

“We’re looking at the funders of a lot of these groups. You know, when you see the signs and they’re all beautiful signs made professionally, these aren’t your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it. These are anarchists and agitators,” Trump said.

“Whether it be going back to the riots that started with Black Lives Matter and all the way through to the antifa riots, the attacks on ICE officers, the doxxing campaigns and now the political assassinations — these are not lone, isolated events,” said Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. “This is part of an organized campaign of radical left terrorism.”

Neither Trump nor Miller nor the other top administration officials flanking them — including Vice President JD Vance, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel — offered any evidence of such a widespread left-wing terror campaign, or many details about how the memo would be put into action.

Law enforcement officials have said Kirk’s alleged shooter appears to have acted alone, and data on domestic extremism more broadly — including some recently scrubbed from the Justice Department’s website — suggest right-wing extremists represent the larger threat.

Many on the right cheered Trump’s memo — just as many on the left cheered calls by Democrats for a clampdown on right-wing extremism during the Biden administration, particularly in light of the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. In that incident, more than 1,500 were criminally charged, many convicted of assaulting police officers and some for sedition, before Trump pardoned them or commuted their sentences.

Many critics of the administration slammed the memo as a “chilling” threat that called to mind some of the most notorious periods of political suppression in the nation’s history — a claim the White House dismissed as wildly off base and steeped in liberal hypocrisy.

That includes the Red Scare and the often less acknowledged Lavender Scare of the Cold War and beyond, they said, when Sen. Joseph McCarthy and other federal officials cast a pall over the nation, its social justice movements and its arts scene by promising to purge from government anyone who professed a belief in certain political ideas — such as communism — or was gay or lesbian or otherwise queer.

Douglas M. Charles, a history professor at Penn State Greater Allegheny and author of “Hoover’s War on Gays: Exposing the FBI’s ‘Sex Deviates’ Program,” said Trump’s memo strongly paralleled past government efforts at political repression — including in its claim that “extremism on migration, race and gender” and “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity” are all causing violence in the country.

“What is this, McCarthyism redux?” Charles asked.

Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, said the Trump administration is putting “targets on the backs of organizers” like her.

Abdullah, speaking Friday from Washington, D.C., where she is attending the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual legislative conference, said Trump’s efforts to cast left-leaning advocacy groups as a threat to democracy was “the definition of gaslighting” because the president “and his entire regime are violent.”

“They are anti-Black. They are anti-people. They are anti-free speech,” Abdullah said. “What we are is indeed an organized body of people who want freedom for our people — and that is a demand for the kind of sustainable peace that only comes with justice.”

Others, including prominent California Democrats, framed Trump’s memo and other recent administration acts — including Thursday’s indictment of former FBI Director James Comey over the objections of career prosecutors — as a worrying blueprint for much wider vengeance on Trump’s behalf, which must be resisted.

“Trump is waging a crusade of retribution — abusing the federal government as a weapon of personal revenge,” Gov. Gavin Newsom posted to X. “Today it’s his enemies. Tomorrow it may be you. Speak out. Use your voice.”

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta noted that the memo listed various incidents of violence against Republicans while “deliberately ignoring” violence against Democrats, and said that while it is unclear what may come of the order, “the chilling effect is real and cannot be ignored.”

Bonta also sent Bondi a letter Friday expressing his “grave concern” with the Comey indictment and asking her to “reassert the long-standing independence of the U.S. Department of Justice from political interference by declining to continue these politically-motivated investigations and prosecutions.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration is twisting Kirk’s tragic killing “into a pretext to weaponize the federal government against opponents Trump says he ‘hates.’”

“In recent days, they’ve branded entire groups — including the Democratic Party itself — as threats, directed [the Justice Department] to go after his perceived enemies, and coerced companies to stifle any criticism of the Administration or its allies. This is pure personal grievance and retribution,” Padilla said. “If this abuse of power is normalized, no dissenting voice will be safe.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said it was “the highest form of hypocrisy for Democrats to falsely claim accountability is ‘political retribution’ when Joe Biden is the one who spent years weaponizing his entire Administration against President Trump and millions of patriotic Americans.”

Jackson accused the Biden administration of censoring average Americans for their posts about COVID-19 on social media and of prosecuting “peaceful pro-life protestors,” among other things, and said the Trump administration “will continue to deliver the truth to the American people, restore integrity to our justice system, and take action to stop radical left-wing violence that is plaguing American communities.”

A month ago, Miller said, “The Democrat Party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization” — a quote raising new concerns in light of Trump’s memo.

On Sept. 16, Bondi said on X that “the radical left” has for too long normalized threats and cheered on political violence, and that she would be ending that by somehow prosecuting them for “hate speech.”

Constitutional scholars — and some prominent conservative pundits — ridiculed Bondi’s claims as contrary to the 1st Amendment.

On Sept. 18, independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported that unnamed national security officials had told him that the FBI was considering treating transgender suspects as a “subset” of a new threat category known as “Nihilistic Violent Extremists” — a concept LGBTQ+ organizations scrambled to denounce as a threat to everyone’s civil liberties.

“Everyone should be repulsed by the attempts to use the power of the federal government against their neighbors, their friends, and our families,” Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson said Wednesday. “It creates a dangerous precedent that could one day be used against other Americans, progressive or conservative or anywhere in between.”

In recent days, Trump has unabashedly attacked his critics — including late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was briefly suspended. On Sept. 20, he demanded on his Truth Social platform that Bondi move to prosecute several of his most prominent political opponents, including Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” wrote Trump, the only felon to ever occupy the White House. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Comey’s indictment — on charges of lying to Congress — was reported shortly after the White House event where Trump signed the memo. Trump declined to discuss Comey at the event, and was vague about who else might be targeted under the memo. But he did say he had heard “a lot of different names,” including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and George Soros, two prominent Democratic donors.

“If they are funding these things, they’re gonna have some problems,” Trump said, without providing any evidence of wrongdoing by either man.

The Open Society Foundations, which have disbursed billions from Soros’ fortune to an array of progressive groups globally, said in response that they “unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism” and that their activities “are peaceful and lawful.” Accusations suggesting otherwise were “politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with,” the group said.

John Day, president-elect of the American College of Trial Lawyers, said his organization has not taken a position on Trump’s memo, but had grave concerns about the process by which Comey was indicted — namely, after Trump called for such legal action publicly.

“That, quite frankly, is very disturbing and concerning to us,” Day said. “This is not the way the legal system was designed to work, and it’s not the way it has worked for 250 years, and we are just very concerned that this happened at all,” Day said. “We’re praying that it is an outlier, as opposed to a predictor of what’s to come.”

James Kirchick, author of “Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington,” which covers the Lavender Scare and its effects on the LGBTQ+ community in detail, said the “strongest similarity” he sees between then and now is the administration “taking the actions of an individual or a small number of people” — such as Kirk’s shooter — “and extrapolating that onto an entire class of people.”

Kirchick said language on the left labeling the president a dictator isn’t helpful in such a political moment, but that he has found some of the administration’s language more alarming — especially, in light of the new memo, Miller’s suggestion that the Democratic Party is an extremist organization.

“Does that mean the Democratic Party is going to be subject to FBI raids and extremist surveillance?” he asked.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1e70d50/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3956x2077+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2Fee%2F8110a21f4131883c474370fa4b33%2Ftrump-11198.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:37.446899

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday extended an earlier order that allows the Trump administration to continue blocking nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign funds.

The U.S. Department of Justice had reached out to the high court for an emergency appeal after a district court judge ruled the administration’s decision to hold the aid was likely illegal, adding that Congress would need to approve the withholding of funds.

""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,"" District Judge Amir Ali said at the time.

Friday's ruling was 6 to 3, with the three liberal justices dissenting.

TRUMP CANCELS $4.9B FOREIGN AID, PUSHES DC DEATH PENALTY, TOUTS KIM TIES

President Donald Trump last month sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining he was using a pocket rescission, which allows a president to submit a request to Congress to hold approved funds near the end of the fiscal year.

Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and, in this situation, the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it not to spend the money.

It was the first use of a pocket rescission in 50 years.

Friday’s ruling extends a temporary block put on the lower court ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts on Sept. 9.

The conservative justices in the majority Friday said that Trump’s authority on foreign policy weighed in the decision but cautioned that it wasn’t a final ruling on the matter.

WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO CANCEL $4.9B FOREIGN AID WITH 'POCKET RESCISSION' BLASTED AS ILLEGAL

Reductions in foreign aid have become a hallmark of the Trump administration's America First agenda.

In her dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said, ""The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time.""

The Justice Department filed two appeals of lower court rulings that blocked Mr Trump’s executive order, which the Republican President signed on his

first day back in office

in January, as a key part of his hardline approach toward immigration.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security.

“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people,” the Justice Department wrote in the appeals.

The department asked the Supreme Court to take up and resolve the case in its new term, which begins on Oct 6.

Mr Trump’s executive order directed federal agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of children born in the US who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, also called a green card holder.

His action drew a series of lawsuits arguing, among other things, that the order violates a right enshrined in the Constitution’s 14th Amendment that provides that

anyone born in the US is a citizen

.

After multiple lower courts halted the order as unconstitutional, the administration took the disputes to the Supreme Court in an effort to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called “universal” injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

That action led the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to issue a landmark ruling in June

blunting the power of judges

.

But that ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

Two challenges to Mr Trump’s order are at issue in the appeals on Sept 26.

One was filed by the state of Washington and three other states, and the other by a group of individuals who sued in federal court in New Hampshire.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states, while US District Judge Joseph Laplante in Concord, New Hampshire, let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class,

allowing Mr Trump’s order to be blocked nationally

.

“This executive order is illegal – full stop – and no amount of manoeuvring from the administration is going to change that.

“We will continue to ensure that no baby’s citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order,” Mr Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the New Hampshire plaintiffs, told Reuters on Sept 26.

The administration is asking the justices to hear the New Hampshire dispute even before a Boston-based federal appeals court has ruled in the case.

‘A powerful incentive’

The 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause states that all “persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside”.

The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861 to 1865 that ended slavery in the US.

The administration contends that the 14th Amendment, long understood to confer citizenship to virtually anyone born in the country, does not extend to immigrants who are in the country illegally or even to immigrants whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

In its filings on Sept 26, the Justice Department said that a policy of universal birthright citizenship “operates as a powerful incentive for illegal migration” and has “spawned an industry of modern ‘birth tourism’, by which foreigners travel to the United States solely for the purpose of giving birth here”.

Since Mr Trump returned to office, his administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to intervene on an emergency basis to implement his policies even as their legality is tested in court, after judges blocked them.

The Supreme Court has sided with the administration in nearly every case it has been asked to review – including several related to Mr Trump’s efforts to restrict migration and accelerate deportations.

The latest decision favouring Mr Trump came on Sept 26, when the court allowed him to withhold about US$4 billion (S$5.2 billion) in foreign aid authorised by Congress for the current fiscal year.

The altercation, which was captured on videos that spread quickly on social media, unfolded after the woman’s husband was arrested at an immigration court in New York City.

Footage shows the woman approach the immigration officer following her husband’s arrest, pleading with the officer in Spanish and at one point saying “You don’t care about anything,” before he pushes her into a wall and then onto the floor of a crowded hallway.

“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, which oversees immigration enforcement. “Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” she added.

Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president, said Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small”.
In 2023, he became the first person of color to be named to the position of superintendent in Iowa’s largest school district.
Phil Roeder, a spokesperson for the school district, said he was supposed to meet Roberts at a school event Friday morning, but Roberts sent a text saying he could not make it.","The superintendent of Iowa’s largest school district was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents on Friday, prompting shock among fellow educators.

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines public schools (DMPS), was apprehended on Friday morning, according to the district’s board chair. Roberts appears to be held at the Pottawattamie county jail, about two hours west of Des Moines, according to the Ice online detainee database. The database lists Roberts’s country of birth as Guyana.

In a statement to the Guardian, DHS said that Roberts was arrested because he had “a final order of removal and no work authorization”.

“During a targeted enforcement operation on Sept 26, 2025, officers approached Roberts in his vehicle after identifying himself, but he sped away. Officers later discovered his vehicle abandoned near a wooded area. State Patrol assisted in locating the subject and he was taken into ICE custody,” the agency shared in a statement. “Roberts has existing weapon possession charges from February 5, 2020. Roberts entered the United States in 1999 on a student visa and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May of 2024.”

The 54-year-old began his term as superintendent of Des Moines schools in July 2023, overseeing a school district that serves more than 30,000 students and nearly 5,000 employees.

Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president, said Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small”.

Norris said a state board had granted Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in 2023 and that the district has been unable to verify Ice’s claims about his immigration status.

In a joint statement, the presidents of unions representing teachers and other school employees in Iowa said that Roberts had been a “tremendous advocate for students, families, staff, and the community” and expressed shock at his arrest.

“His leadership and compassion for all students, regardless of background, identity, or family origin, are a beacon of light in one of the state’s most diverse school districts,” said Joshua Brown, the Iowa State Education Association president, and Anne Cross, the Des Moines Education Association president, in a joint statement. “It is a dark and unsettling time in our country. This incident has created tremendous fear for DMPS students, families, and staff.”

Matt Smith, a Des Moines schools official who was appointed Friday to serve as interim superintendent, said members of the community felt “sad, outraged and helpless” after learning of Roberts’s detention.

In media interviews and biographies, Roberts has said he was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by Guyanese immigrant parents. A 2023 statement from the district announcing Roberts’s appointment said he was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn”. In 2023, he became the first person of color to be named to the position of superintendent in Iowa’s largest school district. He is a former Olympic athlete who competed as a middle-distance runner for Guyana in the 2000 Sydney games.

Court records in Pennsylvania show that Roberts pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a minor infraction for unlawfully possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle, and was fined. The case stemmed from a citation in Erie county issued the prior month by a Pennsylvania game commission officer, who stopped Roberts as he was finishing a day of deer hunting on state lands.

Roberts said at the time he was a longtime licensed hunter and gun owner, and that he had left his hunting rifle on the seat of his vehicle in plain view to ensure the officer did not feel threatened during their interaction. He said that he was shocked when the officer cited him for doing so, but that he pleaded guilty to avoid any distraction. He questioned whether his dark skin may have played a role in the case.

“I may not appear to be the ‘type of man’ who would enjoy deer season in Pennsylvania, in fact, I am and have been hunting for more than 20 years,” Roberts wrote in a social media post then.

Earlier this year, after Donald Trump’s administration removed restrictions on Ice officers searching schools, churches and other sensitive locations, Roberts and the leaders of other regional school districts issued guidelines for parents and families enrolled in public schools.

In a letter to parents, Roberts said that schools would comply with warrants from immigration officers, and that agents seeking information about students would be directed to administrators.

“Everyday Des Moines Public Schools does everything we can within our legal and moral authority to support students, which is always our top priority,” he said.

Phil Roeder, a spokesperson for the school district, said he was supposed to meet Roberts at a school event Friday morning, but Roberts sent a text saying he could not make it. Roeder said he got a video call from Roberts soon after and watched officials detain him.

Roeder told the Associated Press that the district has seen “nothing that would suggest that he’s not a citizen”.

The district said Friday afternoon that a third party had been hired to conduct a comprehensive background check on Roberts and that Roberts completed an I-9 form, which requires workers to present documents showing that they are authorized to work. District officials also stated they had no knowledge of an order of removal issued in 2024.

The district also named an interim superintendent.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c8cecf6de62182f25336c88c104574397648237/150_0_1133_906/master/1133.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d18274097f8236ad1fff0b900126e177",N,,2025-09-27 07:56:20.096076

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court's conservative majority granted the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court's intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump's action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali's ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts' order.

The court has previously cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants, fire thousands of federal employees, oust transgender members of the military and remove the heads of independent government agencies.

The legal victories, while not final rulings, all have come through emergency appeals, used sparingly under previous presidencies, to fast-track cases to the Supreme Court, where decisions are often handed down with no explanation.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s a rarely used maneuver when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice essentially flips the script. Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and in this situation the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it to not spend the money.

The majority wrote in an unsigned order that Trump’s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case.

But that was cold comfort to the dissenters. “The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as people lose access to food supplies and development programs.

The high court's decision “further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order,"" said Nick Sansone, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who represented the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition in the case. “It will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.”

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year next Tuesday.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

After Trump issued his rescission notice, the plaintiffs returned to Ali’s court and the judge issued the order that’s now being challenged.

Draft report delivers verdict on human rights convention

David Maddox

Friday 26 September 2025 17:31 EDT

Kemi Badenoch is expected to announce the Conservative Party's support for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

This follows a review by former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, whose draft conclusions recommend leaving the ECHR.

Lord Wolfson's report argues the ECHR has gone “well beyond” its original intent, imposing unpredictable “constraints” on government and domestic courts, particularly regarding immigration.

The announcement, anticipated at the Tory conference next week, aims to align the party with Nigel Farage's stance on the ECHR amid challenges with illegal migration.

While Lord Wolfson claims human rights would not be harmed, Labour's attorney general Lord Hermer warned that leaving would place the UK alongside Russia and Belarus.

The school district and DHS presented starkly divergent portraits of Roberts.
Roberts oversaw over 30,000 students in the Des Moines public school system, according to the district’s website, and had previously worked at public schools across the country.
Roberts was named Des Moines Public Schools superintendent in 2023, according to the district’s website.
“There are many questions, many doubts.” The Des Moines School Board has scheduled a special closed-session meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrest and Roberts’ status with the district.","The superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools — Iowa’s largest school district – was detained Friday morning by immigration agents, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said the educator was in the country illegally and had existing weapon possession charges.

Superintendent Ian Roberts – an educator with decades of experience who previously competed as an Olympic athlete for Guyana – was arrested as part of a “targeted enforcement operation” and fled after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached him, according to statements from DHS and the Iowa Department of Public Safety.

DHS said he was “in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife” at the time of his arrest. It’s a violation of federal law to own a firearm and ammunition if an individual doesn’t have legal status in the US.

CNN is working to identify Roberts’ attorney.

The school district and DHS presented starkly divergent portraits of Roberts. DHS described him as a “criminal alien” and suggested he was a public safety threat. But at a news conference after his arrest, board president of Des Moines Public Schools Jackie Norris said the superintendent was “an integral part of our school community” who “has shown up in ways big and small” for students and staff.

The arrest spurred a protest outside the federal courthouse in Des Moines. “Education, not deportation / Free Dr. Roberts,” read one sign carried by a demonstrator, according to footage from CNN affiliate KCCI.

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in the state in July 2023, according to Norris.

“There is new information that has been made public that we did not know, and we have not been able to verify,” Norris said.

Roberts oversaw over 30,000 students in the Des Moines public school system, according to the district’s website, and had previously worked at public schools across the country.

Another administrator, Matt Smith, has taken the role of interim superintendent in the meantime, according to a message posted on social media by the district earlier.

“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” the statement read.

Roberts’ arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on immigration, which has seen raids on workplaces and arrests of community pillars including a firefighter, a journalist and a pastor.

Superintendent was given final order of removal in 2024, DHS says

Roberts entered the US on a student visa in 1999 and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, according to the DHS statement. He had existing weapon charges from 2020, the agency added.

Des Moines Public Schools said it was unaware of the order of removal but Roberts did inform the school board of a firearms offense related to a hunting rifle during his hiring process. The district said in a statement Roberts “provided sufficient context and explanation of the situation to move forward in the hiring process.”

Public records show Roberts pleaded guilty to a weapon charge in Pennsylvania in 2022. CNN has been unable to verify whether Roberts has a separate charge from 2020.

The district also said Roberts submitted an employment eligibility verification form and an I-9 as part of the hiring process.

“The district has not been formally notified by ICE about this matter, nor have we been able to talk with Dr. Roberts since his detention,” district spokesperson Phil Roeder said.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement Robertson’s arrest should be a “wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats.”

ICE’s online detainee locator system shows Roberts was born in Guyana and is being held at a county jail in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Roberts was named Des Moines Public Schools superintendent in 2023, according to the district’s website. He was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY,” the website reads.

Before becoming an educator, the superintendent was an Olympic athlete and competed in track and field at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

Roberts’ long educational career has included positions in New York City; Baltimore; Washington, DC; St. Louis; Oakland, California; and Erie, Pennsylvania, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Among the crowd protesting Roberts’ arrest Friday was district teacher Mary Pat LaMair, who said she was excited to see the display of support.

“I just think it’s really important that we take care of one another, and we seem to be at a spot where that’s not what’s happening,” LaMair told CNN affiliate KCCI. She added, “It’s important for people to know that the general public, I think, is not okay with what’s happening.”

The Directors Council — a nonprofit group serving Des Moines’ Black community — identified Roberts as a board member and offered him their “full support” in a post on Facebook.

Roberts “has been a trusted partner, a dedicated advocate for equity, and an unwavering supporter of families and youth in Polk County,” reads the post. “His contributions to both The Directors Council and the wider community are immeasurable, and we stand with him during this uncertain moment.”

In a video statement posted on their Facebook page, organizers from the Iowa Movement for Migrant Justice said news of the superintendent’s detention was shocking and scary for immigrant communities.

“We know in advance that our families right now are afraid that if they go to pick up their kids, if they send them to school, if immigrant agents are going to go take their kids out of school,” Elizabeth Balcarcel said in the video statement. “There are many questions, many doubts.”

The Des Moines School Board has scheduled a special closed-session meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrest and Roberts’ status with the district.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/usatsi-20678534.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-27 07:56:24.462282

It was not immediately clear whether the detainees were then sent to other locations or transferred back to the Dallas processing facility.","DALLAS — A senior official at the Department of Homeland Security identified the three immigrant detainees who were victims in the shooting Wednesday at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.

The senior DHS official familiar with the case told NBC News the three were Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez of Mexico, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes. DHS did not say what country Guzman-Fuentes was from.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which of the men was killed, the extent of the injuries of the other two, and details about criminal allegations made against the men by the agency.

The men were wounded on Wednesday when a gunman who targeted ICE agents and employees opened fire on the agency’s field office in Dallas, federal officials said. No ICE agents were injured in the attack, but one detainee was fatally shot and two others were injured.

NBC News has not yet been able to independently verify the criminal allegations against the men, and the official at the agency did not immediately respond to request for comment for additional details. NBC News has not yet been able to reach the families of the men and it was not clear if any of them had immigration attorneys.

Garcia-Hernandez was described by the senior official as an immigrant from Mexico living in the country illegally, whose criminal history included “convictions for giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police.”

A man who identified himself as Garcia-Hernandez’s sibling told a local Dallas Univision station that his 32-year-old brother was shot in the side, back, stomach and neck and remained in critical condition in a local hospital.

He said his brother had undergone two surgeries and that doctors “want to disconnect him because the machine is the only thing that keeps him alive.”

The brother, who was identified as Fernando, said Garcia had been living in the U.S. for 20 years and was a painter.

NBC News had reached out to Garcia’s relatives through a family associate but they have not responded to a request for an interview.

Bordones-Molina was described as an immigrant man from Venezuela living in the country illegally. The DHS official said his “criminal history includes theft of property and a traffic offense.”

Guzman-Fuentes’ nationality was not disclosed by the authorities. The DHS official said Guzman-Fuentes’ “criminal history includes previous arrests for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.”

Since the shooting took place on Wednesday morning, little information has been publicly released about the victims.

The shooting has left some members of the city’s immigrant community anxious and uncertain, especially as questions remained about the victims.

“The government should do its job and make sure that it fully investigates this and that it’s transparent with the victims, the families of the victims, and with the community,” said Rochelle Garza, an attorney and the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who called for more transparency and information about the victims.

The uncertainty is creating more stress for people who have been dealing with increased immigration enforcement operations, Garza said. Families whose loved ones have been recently detained by ICE could be concerned that their loved ones were at the Dallas facility during the shooting.

An ICE official told NBC News on Thursday morning that there were between eight and 10 detainees in the van when the gunman opened fire.

An ICE spokesperson said a consulate was working to locate next of kin for at least one victim. Each of the three victims are from different countries, the spokesperson said. The agency is required to publish a notice about the death of any detainee in custody within 48 hours of the death and of the next of kin being notified, according to a 2025 agency directive.

ICE is also required to notify next of kin, the appropriate consulate, relevant DHS and ICE stakeholders and Congress about each detainee death.

Guillermo Hernandez, an immigration attorney based in Texas, said attorneys have had issues with tracking down the whereabouts of their clients, an issue that the shooting brought into focus.

“To advocate for your client, you have to know where they are,” he said. “Unfortunately, we’ve seen that there’s not necessarily the best transparency when it comes to detainees, when it comes to immigrants being transferred. They move immigrants around detention centers from one day to the next.”

“We should be able to know and figure out at what point in the immigration process they were. Did they have attorneys? Did they have a case pending?” he added.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on concerns from attorneys and relatives on being informed of the whereabouts of the detainees who were moved from the Dallas facility following the shooting.

Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that one of the injured is a Mexican national who was receiving medical treatment at a hospital, but has not identified Garcia Hernandez and has not responded to a request for comment on his identity or his medical condition. The ministry said Thursday morning they had spoken to the wife of the Mexican national who was injured in the shooting.

Roberto Velasco Álvarez, the chief officer for North America at Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in Spanish on social media that he “conveyed our support during this difficult moment” and reiterated Mexico’s solidarity with the victim’s family.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told NBC News on Wednesday that the agency is “charged with their protection, their custody,” referring to the detainees. “Nothing like that should happen.”

Authorities have said agents with both ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pulled some detainees out of the line of fire during the shooting in Dallas.

“The shooter was just shooting at random vehicles inside,” Lyons said. “They were still hit inside the vehicle. You know, there were some brave men and women on the ground that went into those vans pulling those detainees out while they were under fire.”

Questions remain about what comes next for the detainees who were in the van during the shooting.

Marcos Charles, ICE’s field office director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, said at a news conference Thursday that those people “will be going through due process” and their immigration proceedings. He did not provide additional details about their status.

“We encourage the families to get copies of the police incident report and to also contact their consulates,” he said.

All of the detainees at the targeted site were temporarily moved from the Dallas Processing Facility to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, according to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. It was not immediately clear whether the detainees were then sent to other locations or transferred back to the Dallas processing facility.

According to the indictment, the three women followed an ICE agent from the federal building on 300 North Los Angeles Street in downtown L.A. to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park.

Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza and Sandra Carmona Samane face charges of disclosing the personal information of a federal agent and conspiracy, according to an indictment unsealed late Friday.

Brown, who is from Colorado and goes by the nickname “AK,” has been described as one of the founders of “ice_out_ofla” an Instagram page with more than 28,000 followers that plays a role in organizing demonstrations against immigration enforcement, according to the social media page and an email reviewed by The Times.

According to the indictment, the three women followed an ICE agent from the federal building on 300 North Los Angeles Street in downtown L.A. to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park.

They live-streamed the entire event, according to the indictment. Once they arrived at the agent’s home, prosecutors allege the women got out and shouted “la migra lives here,” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know,” according to the indictment.

“Our brave federal agents put their lives on the line every day to keep our nation safe,” Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time.”

An attorney for Samane, 25, of Los Angeles, said she intends to plead not guilty at an arraignment next month and declined further comment.

The Federal Public Defender’s Office, which is representing Brown, 38, of Aurora, Colo., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Court records did not list an attorney for Raygoza, 37, of Riverside.

Footage published to the ice_out_ofla Instagram page seemed to capture Brown’s arrest earlier this week. The video shows a man in green fatigues and body armor saying he has a warrant for her arrest, while reaching through what appears to be the shattered driver’s side window of her car. Brown asks what the warrant is for while the man can be seen holding a collapsible baton. Then the video cuts out.

Posts on the Instagram page describe Brown as a “political prisoner.”

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles did not immediately respond to questions about whether the women specifically shouted out the agent’s address online or what the defendants specifically did to “incite the commission of a crime of violence against a federal agent,” as the indictment alleges.

Federal law enforcement leaders have repeatedly expressed concern about the “doxing” of agents with ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol as residents of Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities continue to protest the Trump administration’s sprawling deportation efforts.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to prosecute people for publishing agents’ personal information last month in response to fliers in Portland that called for people to collect intel on ICE.

But the indictment returned Friday appeared to be the first prosecution related to such tactics.

The shooting was the third violent attack or threat on ICE facilities in the past four months, Nancy Larson, acting US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said Thursday.

At issue in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition is $4 billion in foreign aid allocated by Congress that the Trump administration determined was wasteful, including funding for international public health such as HIV prevention programs, which have been credited with saving millions of lives.

The high court's right-wing majority found that ""the asserted harms to the executive’s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm"" to aid recipients, while cautioning that ""this order should not be read as a final determination on the merits.""

The Trump administration sought not only validation of its claimed ability to claw back spending previously approved by Congress—which under the Constitution generally holds power of the purse—but also of ""pocket recission,"" a highly contentious budgetary maneuver to cancel previously approved federal expenditures by exploiting legal ambiguity in the Impoundment Control Act (ICA).

Democrats and many legal experts contend that pocket recissions are illegal, and Democratic lawmakers warned even before Trump's White House return that he would try to use the tactic in order to refuse to disburse funds allocated by Congress for social programs.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court dealt a temporary blow to Trump's evisceration of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in a ruling that left intact a lower court's decision ordering the resumption of approximately $2 billion in foreign aid frozen by the administration.

The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.
The bill would also give Congress the ability to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval.","Here’s a look at some prominent cases:

CoreCivic v. New Jersey

In 2021, New Jersey passed a law that prevents state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention. CoreCivic, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

CoreCivic argued that New Jersey’s law shouldn’t apply to it because the company is effectively serving as an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Constitution blocks state laws from regulating the federal government or its agencies.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch decided partly in favor of CoreCivic. Although New Jersey could prevent state and local entities from entering into contracts with ICE, he ruled, it could not prevent CoreCivic or another private entity from doing so. Calling the law a “dagger aimed at the heart of the federal government’s immigration enforcement mission and operations,” Kirsch reasoned that allowing the full law to stand could encourage neighboring states to pass similar laws. That, he wrote, “would result in nothing short of chaos.”

A federal appeals court upheld Kirsch’s decision in July.

Newark v. GEO

In late February, GEO announced ICE had awarded it a 15-year contract, worth roughly $1 billion, to reopen Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility in Newark, New Jersey. Delaney opened May 1 after months of what city officials called “irresponsible construction practices.”

In an April complaint, the city alleged Delaney Hall put detained people and staff in danger because GEO wouldn’t allow city inspectors to review the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. Newark also alleged that GEO failed to file for a certificate of continued occupancy — a form required whenever there is a change in tenant or ownership of a property. The city asked for a court order to stop Delaney’s operation while the case proceeds.

GEO called the lawsuit politically motivated and adopted a similar argument to the one CoreCivic made, saying Newark couldn’t use local codes to interfere with the federal government’s business: detaining immigrants.

Newark didn’t get the injunction it sought, so Delaney Hall remains open as the case proceeds.

City of Leavenworth v. CoreCivic

CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas under a new contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 immigrants. The company had used the building from 1992 through 2021, primarily to hold people awaiting trial on federal charges.

The city argues the company must obtain a special use permit to operate the facility as a detention center. When the city passed a 2012 zoning law that would have required such a permit, CoreCivic was exempt because the facility already operated as a prison. But because the facility has now been idle for several years, the city maintains CoreCivic must now apply for the permit.

CoreCivic insists it doesn’t need the permit because it never abandoned the building. As it did in New Jersey, it also argues that local ordinances can’t interfere with the company when it’s doing work for the federal government.

The city’s argument won over a local judge, who issued a temporary order barring the reopening. CoreCivic has asked the judge to reconsider while the battle plays out.

Friends of the Everglades v. Noem

In late May, two environmental advocacy groups sued several federal and Florida agencies over a sprawling new immigration detention center in the Everglades. Commonly called “Alligator Alcatraz” — a term coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — the facility was constructed in a matter of days on an airfield in the heart of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Yet Congress has steadily ceded its constitutional role in trade policy to the executive branch over the course of many decades. What was once the responsibility of the People’s Branch has increasingly become the domain of presidents who wield tariffs and trade agreements as instruments of foreign and domestic policy. This imbalance was not created overnight. But the result is a dangerous concentration of power that runs contrary to our constitutional order.

Historically, Congress played the central role in setting tariffs and trade policy. That began to shift in the 20th century when lawmakers began delegating increased negotiating authority to the executive branch. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Trade Act of 1974 established the Trade Promotion Authority — a statute that allowed for the President to work in tandem with Congress to approve trade agreements. Nonetheless, each of the aforementioned laws gave presidents greater leeway to cut deals or impose restrictions in the name of national security or economic stability. While these moves were intended to provide flexibility, they also blurred constitutional lines.

In recent years, presidents from both parties have increasingly exploited these powers in unilateral and unpredictable ways. Trade wars have been launched without debate, presidents have imposed sweeping tariffs against allies and adversaries alike, and major international agreements have been entered into or abandoned without legislative approval. This is not how our system of checks and balances was meant to function.

The danger is twofold. First, unchecked executive power on trade undermines democratic accountability. When a president can, with the stroke of a pen, raise costs for American farmers, manufacturers, and families, the people’s representatives are sidelined. Second, it erodes the very principle of separated powers that our republic depends on.

Congress has a constitutional duty and responsibility to reassert itself—and the American people agree. In a recent poll released by Issue One, 56 percent of American voters surveyed nationwide do not believe that the president should be able to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval.

Restoring balance does not mean returning to the tariff protectionist era of the 19th century. It does mean setting clear parameters around when and how the executive may act, requiring congressional approval for significant tariff actions, and reclaiming oversight of trade agreements that have significant repercussions for our economy.

Several bipartisan proposals in recent years have sought to rein in presidential tariff authority and restore Congress's proper role. The Trade Review Act of 2025, introduced earlier this year by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would reestablish limits on the president’s ability to impose unilateral tariffs without the approval of Congress. It would require the president to notify Congress of any new tariffs within 48 hours, and Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariffs within 60 days; otherwise, all new tariffs would expire. The bill would also give Congress the ability to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval. This proposal should be taken up with urgency.

As James Madison warned, the accumulation of power in any single branch is “the very definition of tyranny.” Allowing the executive to dominate trade policy erodes the balance Madison and his colleagues carefully constructed. Reasserting Congress’s authority would not only protect our economy from the whims of individual leaders, it would reaffirm the basic principle that in a republic, no single branch governs alone.

Congress must reclaim its rightful place in trade policy – not as a matter of partisanship, but as a matter of constitutional principle. Our prosperity, our democratic accountability, and our checks and balances depend on it.

He mistakenly crossed the Ambassador Suspension Bridge, which rises about 118 meters above the Detroit River and connects the U.S. city with Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

On February 27, while in detention, Ricardo was issued a deportation order and he expected he would be going back to Venezuela.

On March 15, he told a friend in Chicago that he was among a number of detainees housed in Texas who expected to be repatriated to Venezuela. That evening, the Trump administration flew three planes carrying Venezuelan migrants from the Texas facility to El Salvador, where they have been ever since, locked up in a maximum-security prison and denied contact with the outside world.

But days later, Ricardo was not on a list of 238 people who were deported to El Salvador published by the media. His family and friends also couldn’t see him photos and videos released by the authorities of shackled men with shaved heads entering CECOT torture prison.

“He has simply disappeared,” said Javier, a friend in Chicago, the last person with whom Mr. Prada had contact. The friend spoke about Mr. Prada on condition that he be identified only by his middle name, out of fear that he too could be targeted by the immigration authorities.

Juan Pappier, deputy director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch (HRW), an organization investigating these deportations and recording other cases of deportees whose names do not appear on any list, tells EL PAÍS that these deportations not only violate due process, but also amount to “forced disappearances.”

“From the perspective of international law, this is a crime — a serious human rights violation,” he says.

According to Pappier, it is inconceivable that the government has not yet issued an official list of deportees, beyond the one leaked to the press. He also highlights that it was only when Bukele proposed an exchange of detainees for political prisoners with Nicolás Maduro that it was revealed that 252 Venezuelans had actually been deported to El Salvador.

“Families should not have to rely on the work of journalists to discover the whereabouts of their loved ones,” says Pappier. “The state has an obligation to disclose the whereabouts of these people. This is extremely cruel and causes immense suffering for the families.”

“Ricardo’s story by itself is incredibly tragic — and we don’t know how many Ricardos there are,” said Ben Levey, a staff attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center who tried to locate Mr. Prada. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials ultimately confirmed to him that he had been deported but did not divulge his destination.

Superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools Ian Andre Roberts was arrested on Friday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on a fugitive warrant. He also faces a firearms offence.

Officials say that he is a citizen of Guyana, and that his permit to work in the US expired in 2020. School district officials say they have not been told the circumstances of his arrest, and have called him an integral part of the school community.

It comes amid a wider US crackdown on immigration, as President Donald Trump seeks to deport all illegal migrants.

It is unclear whether Mr Roberts has hired an attorney to speak on his behalf.

Records show that he is being jailed at an immigration detention centre near the city of Des Moines.

In a statement, ICE said that he was found ""in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife"".

The agency said that he initially fled from police in a vehicle that had been provided to him by the school district. Officers later found his abandoned vehicle and located him with the help of Iowa State Patrol.

According to ICE, he has an existing weapons charge from February 2020, and had originally entered the US on a student visa in 1999. A federal judge ordered him to be deported in 2024.

The investigation into the handgun found by officers is being turned over to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ICE said, noting that is illegal for undocumented immigrants in the US to possess firearms.

Before leading the district of around 30,000 students in Iowa, he had previously worked as an educator in four other states, and earned college degrees and credits from universities including Georgetown and Harvard.

He also competed for Guyana in track and field at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. He also participated in World Championships in Japan and Spain, according to NBC News.

A biography on the school district's website says that ""he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY"". It adds that he ""enjoys hunting"".

School Board Chair Jackie Norris said in a news conference on Friday that the board is still trying to determine the facts of his case.

""We do not have all the facts. There is much we do not know,"" she said, according to The Des Moines Register newspaper.

""However, what we do know is Dr Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined two years ago.""

Local ICE Director Sam Olson said in a statement that the arrest ""should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats"".

In a pair of petitions, government lawyers argued that the Constitution’s promise of citizenship was conferred on “freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.”

The common understanding of the 14th Amendment for more than a century, upheld by the Supreme Court, has guaranteed citizenship to children born in the United States. But D.

If the justices were to take the case, the court could hear arguments on the matter during its upcoming term, which is set to begin in early October. Decisions are typically announced by late June or early July.

The administration’s request set up a key test for the Supreme Court, which has repeatedly allowed central pieces of Mr. Trump’s agenda to proceed on a temporary emergency basis, even as their legality is tested by the courts. If the justices accept the birthright citizenship cases, they would offer a final verdict as to whether Mr. Trump’s order was constitutional, a case that could define what it means to be an American.

Most of the detained workers are Mexican nationals and are being held at Dodge County Detention Center, Maldonado said.
Dairy, manufacturing industries rely on immigrant labor Statewide, and especially in Manitowoc County, undocumented immigrants make up much of the dairy industry workforce.
That's in part because there is no year-round agricultural visa available in the U.S. Manitowoc County has the most mega-dairies, or concentrated animal feeding operations, of any county in the state.
One Manitowoc County farmer, Michael Slattery, said that when one worker is detained, ""news spreads very quickly.""","People have been calling Jennifer Maldonado's phone ever since the morning of Sept. 25, when word began spreading that federal immigration authorities were picking up dairy farm workers in a Walmart parking lot in Manitowoc.

The news that 21 people without legal status were detained by the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has shaken people in Manitowoc County, a community of about 80,000 people in eastern Wisconsin. Much of the county's agricultural and manufacturing sector relies on Latino immigrants.

Maldonado, who leads a local immigrant advocacy group called Crusaders for Justicia, said people are asking her: ""Is it safe? Are they still here? Can we take our kids to school? What happens if we get taken?""

""There's just this mad rush of trying to protect their families,"" she said. ""It's frightening for the whole community.""

Many of the facts of the operation are still unclear.

The FBI has said nine of the 21 people are suspected of sexual assault and human trafficking of children. However, the agency has provided no evidence for the statement. The FBI has declined to answer questions about what prompted the operation and what charges, if any, the arrested individuals are facing.

ICE has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Journal Sentinel.

The Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office also declined to answer whether deputies assisted in the operation. Sheriff Daniel Hartwig was unavailable for comment.

As community leaders and clergy in Manitowoc try to piece together answers, they're also reflecting on the impact on the broader community and the feeling that hardworking people were swept up with suspected criminals.

""I don't believe this is going to be a one-and-done type thing,"" said Maldonado. ""I do believe that we are just seeing the cusp of the problems that are about to ensue.""

Pastors, community leaders piece together information

With little being said through official channels, community leaders are gathering information piece by piece.

Maldonado spoke to a representative at the sheriff's office who told her that deputies helped the FBI serve warrants for specific individuals in residential areas, where they made some arrests. The sheriff's office was not involved in the arrests in the Walmart parking lot with ICE, the representative told her.

Maldonado does not know why ICE apparently detained people there. It's well-known that people gather there to carpool to nearby farms, she said.

Most of the detained workers are Mexican nationals and are being held at Dodge County Detention Center, Maldonado said.

Based on conversations with local law enforcement, Deacon Mark LeGreve of St. Francis of Assisi Parish said he had the impression that the operation was going after a few high-value targets, and others may have been picked up because they were easily accessible.

Two members of the Catholic parish were detained in the operation, LeGreve said. He said they agreed to be deported to Honduras.

As people reached out to church staff asking how they could find their detained family members, LeGreve noted ""an intensified fear"" in the Latino community. Some are questioning whether to go to church, seek health care or go to work.

""It strikes home,"" he said.

The Rev. Matthew Sauer is the pastor of the Manitowoc Cooperative Ministry, serving both Peace United Church of Christ and First Presbyterian Church. He was concerned that people were apparently detained on their way to work.

Sauer said he wanted authorities to distinguish between suspected criminals and others just trying to make a living.

""Violent offenders need to be prosecuted, and hardworking families don't deserve to be scapegoated,"" he said.

""This isn't being weak on crime,"" he added. ""It's about capturing what appear to be innocent families and disrupting their lives just because they happen to be in a particular place at a particular time.""

Dairy, manufacturing industries rely on immigrant labor

Statewide, and especially in Manitowoc County, undocumented immigrants make up much of the dairy industry workforce. That's in part because there is no year-round agricultural visa available in the U.S.

Manitowoc County has the most mega-dairies, or concentrated animal feeding operations, of any county in the state. These farms are massive operations with at least 700 cows each, making them especially reliant on undocumented immigrant labor, much more than family farms.

Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, echoed how much uncertainty there is for farmers and workers after an immigration operation.

""We’re putting hardworking people in a bad spot,"" he said.

Manitowoc's Latino community is well-established and integrated into the broader population, said Sachin Shivaram, chief executive officer of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc. People may come for farm work then go on to other work, contributing to the growth of the area, he said.

""Those people stay here, and then they get jobs and build families,"" said Shivaram, who has been a vocal advocate for immigrants in the workforce.

One Manitowoc County farmer, Michael Slattery, said that when one worker is detained, ""news spreads very quickly."" Other employees stop showing up for work, and it's hard to find anyone to replace them. Cows aren't milked, pens aren't cleaned and calves go unfed, he said.

According to Slattery, a man who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and was trying to legalize his status is among those who were detained Sept. 25.

Slattery spoke to the man's wife, who is a U.S. citizen. Together, they have five U.S. citizen children.

Slattery said the man was walking out to his truck before 6 a.m. to head to work when he was picked up by ICE agents who were in the neighborhood executing a warrant on a nearby house. The agents arrested four people in the house. According to Slattery, the agents did not know who the man was, but took him too.

His wife walked out to find his lunch still resting on the hood of his truck, he said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/PSHE/86216443007-091725-man-manitowoc-two-rivers-scenes-gck-04.JPG?crop=4367,2457,x0,y291&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-27 01:57:06.852964

The Supreme Court on Friday extended an order that allows President Donald Trump ’s administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court’s conservative majority granted the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court’s intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

Tennessee governor says more federal agents to join fight against crime in Memphis next week

The city has been bracing for an influx of National Guard troops since Trump announced his intention to deploy them. On Friday residents finally learned more about the plan, and it looks to be very different from deployments in Los Angeles and Washington.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the troops will be part of a surge of resources to fight crime that includes 13 federal agencies and state troopers. The National Guard troops will be from the state, and they will be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service to support local law enforcement in the majority Black city.

The Republican governor said the troops will not make arrests and will not be armed unless local law enforcement officials request it. Lee has previously said he doesn’t think there will be more than 150 guard members, but he later said the number was still in the planning stages.

ICE arrests leader of Iowa’s largest school district, says he was living and working in US illegally

Federal immigration agents targeted the well-liked Des Moines Public School Superintendent Ian Roberts in a traffic stop Friday and arrested him after he fled into the woods, leaving educators and community members stunned.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Roberts was in the country illegally and had no work authorization. Roberts, who is from Guyana in South America, was considered an ICE fugitive because he was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024, the agency said.

It was unclear if Roberts had an attorney to represent him.

FBI firings come amid broader purge

The FBI’s dismissal of agents who took a knee during a demonstration following the 2020 killing of Floyd comes amid a broader personnel purge at the bureau under Director Kash Patel.

Five agents and top-level executives were known to have been summarily fired last month in a wave of ousters that current and former officials say has contributed to declining morale.

One helped oversee investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Another served as acting director in the early days of the Trump administration and resisted Justice Department demands to supply the names of agents who investigated Jan. 6. A third was incorrectly rumored on social media to have participated in the investigation into Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

A lawsuit filed last week by three of the fired agents alleged that Patel understood the firings were “likely illegal” but had to carry them out because he was ordered to do so by the White House.

Patel has denied taking orders from the White House on whom to fire and has said anyone who has been fired failed to meet bureau standards.

Judge rules ‘MyPillow Guy’ Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic on voting machines

The federal judge in Minnesota found that Lindell falsely claimed that Smartmatic’s voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, identifying 51 instances in which he made false claims.

However the question of whether Lindell acted with “actual malice” will not be resolved until later — Smartmatic needs to prove that to collect damages.

Attorney Erik Connolly said Smartmatic will be seeking “nine-figure damages” from Lindell and MyPillow for “spreading lies” and “Smartmatic did not and could not have rigged the 2020 election.”

FBI fires agents photographed kneeling during 2020 racial justice protest, AP sources say

The agents were photographed at a protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, three people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The bureau reassigned the agents last spring but has since fired them, said the people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel matters with The Associated Press.

The number of employees dismissed was not immediately clear, but two people said it was roughly 20.

An FBI spokesman declined to comment.

79-year-old US citizen injured in Los Angeles immigration raid files $50 million claim

The man’s claim seeks $50 million in damages and says federal agents violated his civil rights when they tackled him during the Sept. 9 raid at a car wash.

Car wash owner Rafie Ollah Shouhed suffered several broken ribs, chest trauma and elbow injuries and has symptoms of a traumatic brain injury, according to the claim. Shouhed is a naturalized U.S citizen from Iran.

The claim was filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that authorities arrested five people from Guatemala and Mexico “who broke our nation’s immigration laws” and alleged that Shouhed “impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting and impeding a federal officer.”

Shouhed and his attorney V. James DeSimone denied that accusation.

States sue administration over threats to pull sexual education funding

The complaint filed Friday by 16 states and the District of Columbia alleges that threats by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pull funding over curricula mentioning diverse gender identities violate federal law and Congress’ spending power.

“Through threatening letters and coercive terms and conditions, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is attempting to force Plaintiff States to rewrite sexual health curricula to erase entire categories of students,” the complaint says.

HHS wants to prohibit the inclusion of what it describes as “gender ideology” in lessons funded by the Personal Responsibility Education Program and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program.

The lawsuit comes after HHS warned states in August that they had 60 days to change lessons or lose grants. California was warned previously, and its $12 million grant was withdrawn Aug. 21.

HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Transportation Department tightens noncitizen truck driver rules after fatal crash in Florida

The new rules announced Friday make getting commercial driver’s licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible.

States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner than that.

A nationwide commercial driver’s license audit began after officials say a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses.

A conviction may be beside the point for the DOJ as it pursues case against Comey

For a Justice Department facing intense White House pressure to investigate perceived presidential enemies, indicting former FBI Director James Comey was the easy part.

Building a case that can sway a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is a significantly tougher task, but like in other cases of investigations of Trump’s critics, that increasingly seems to be almost beside the point.

As the administration aims to comply with Trump’s ordered prosecutions, officials have signaled that making life uncomfortable for targets of retribution — including through reputational harm, legal fees and lingering uncertainty — is a desired goal in its own right, separate and apart from the ability to secure a guilty verdict.

It’s a sharp break for a department that for decades, under bipartisan leadership, has been hesitant to bring cases unless it believes it can win, securing convictions in the overwhelming majority of prosecutions it initiates.

Analyst sees Kimmel’s return as unsurprising

After Nexstar Media Group joined Sinclair Broadcast Group in bringing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” back to its local TV stations Friday, Matthew Dolgin, senior equity analyst at research firm Morningstar, said he wasn’t surprised.

“The relationship with Disney is far too important for these firms to risk,” Dolgin said.

And setting aside legal rights from either side, Dolgin added, “Disney would’ve been free to take its affiliate agreements elsewhere in 2026 if these relationships were too difficult. That scenario would be devastating to Nexstar and Sinclair.”

The companies suspended the program over the comedian’s comments related to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

But now Kimmel will once again air on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates in 28 cities, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show.

Trump’s transportation department pulls trail and bike grants it deems ‘hostile’ to cars

The department has been pulling back grants already announced for recreational trails and bicycle lanes, telling local officials that their projects fail to promote road capacity or are “hostile to motor vehicles.”

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration’s emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration’s focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump’s transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it’s practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms.

Plaintiff critical of Supreme Court ruling on foreign aid funding

Friday’s high court decision extended an order that allows Trump’s administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.

Nick Sansone, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who represented the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition in the case, said the ruling “further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order.”

“It will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.”

Trump moves toward deal to give US an equity stake in company developing Nevada lithium mine

The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries.

General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of the Trump administration intervening directly in private companies.

“We support the project moving forward,’′ said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

Nexstar and Sinclair bring Jimmy Kimmel’s show back to its local TV stations

Nexstar Media Group joined Sinclair Broadcast Group in bringing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” back to its local TV stations on Friday, restoring the late-night talk show to the full slate of ABC affiliates across the U.S.

The companies suspended the program over the comedian’s comments related the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The move means “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return to local TV on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates in 28 cities, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show.

Trump says he’s ordering the declassification and release of Amelia Earhart records

Trump made the announcement on his social media site shortly after he returned to the White House from attending the Ryder Cup golf tournament in New York.

He said Earhart’s story is such an “interesting story” and that “many people” have asked him about it and whether he’d consider declassifying and making public everything the government knows about her, including her final flight.

Earhart’s plane vanished in 1937 during her attempt to fly around the world.

“Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions,” Trump wrote. “I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her.”

Supreme Court keeps in place Trump foreign aid funding freeze

The Supreme Court on Friday extended an order that allows President Donald Trump’s administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.

The court acted on the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court’s intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali’s ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts’ order.

Trump returns to White House

The helicopter landed at 4:18 p.m.

Wearing a blue suit and white golf shoes, Trump walked into the Oval Office with his granddaughter, Kai Trump, who is a competitive golfer at the collegiate level.

He didn’t stop to answer any questions from reporters and had nothing else on his public schedule for the rest of the day.

In rare rebuke, federal officials discipline ICE officer for shoving woman in New York

A federal immigration officer who shoved an Ecuadorian woman to the floor at a Manhattan court is “being relieved of current duties,” the Department of Homeland Security said Friday in a rare rebuke of one of its officers.

The altercation, which was captured on videos that spread quickly on social media, unfolded after the woman’s husband was arrested at an immigration court in New York City.

Footage shows the woman approach the immigration officer following her husband’s arrest, pleading with the officer in Spanish and at one point saying “You don’t care about anything,” before he pushes her into a wall and then onto the floor of a crowded hallway.

“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, which oversees immigration enforcement.

It is extremely rare for the Trump administration’s DHS to discipline immigration officers for aggressive tactics across the U.S.",https://accesswdun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap-img-68d6a19464904-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 13:57:36.274495

So far, federal judges – include those in D.C. and Chicago – have filed temporary restraining orders and injunctions that temporarily bar the Trump administration from deporting the children while the lawsuits play out in court.

“They're four Guatemalan teenagers, none of which want to go home, all of which have options here to apply for permission to stay.

The children, all minors – many of whom are believed to have crossed the border illegally and are now in U.S. custody of the Health and Human Services Department – have expressed concern and do not want to return, their attorneys said in court filings reviewed by NBC 5 Investigates.

The ongoing legal fight began right here in Chicago over Labor Day weekend and has since expanded to a total of three federal lawsuits – all of which seek to stop the Trump administration from deporting children whose attorneys say don’t want to be returned to their native countries and – in some cases - fear harm if they are.

So far, federal judges – include those in D.C. and Chicago – have filed temporary restraining orders and injunctions that temporarily bar the Trump administration from deporting the children while the lawsuits play out in court.

A status hearing in the Chicago case is set for Oct. 7.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Northern District of Illinois did not respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.

Laura Smith, an immigration attorney with the Children’s Legal Center here in Chicago, represents four Guatemalan teens who are in the custody of the federal government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement – the federal agency tasked with providing care and custody of unaccompanied minors who encountered immigration.

“They're four Guatemalan teenagers, none of which want to go home, all of which have options here to apply for permission to stay. And so we filed the litigation to allow them to stay and pursue that, pursue that relief,” Smith said.

Just four weeks ago – Smith described to NBC 5 Investigates the last-minute legal filings aimed at stopping their deportations and the conversations she had with some of the teens when news broke that they might be returned to their native countries.

Asked to characterize their responses, she said: “Terror, absolutely. Terror not fully understanding why me, why in the middle of the night… just terror.”

Television news footage from south Texas showed the unaccompanied children who entered the U.S. illegally getting off the aircraft in Texas that the Trump administration said it was planning to use to deport them back to Guatemala.

Angie Salazar, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said in a D.C. court filing that the request to have the children returned came from the Guatemalan government and that it was “Our understanding based on that meeting is that Guatemalan officials believed their citizen nationals should be placed with their families rather than in prolonged U.S. government custody.”

In issuing his ruling, a federal judge in D.C. wrote that the government’s explanation “crumbled like a house of cards,” adding that there was “no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

With the injunctions in place – it essentially acts as pause button on deportations while the cases play out in court.

In a letter sent last week to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee, attorneys representing whistleblowers within the Office of Refugee Resettlement challenged the acting director’s statements “that 327 children identified for return to Guatemala had been screened” and “would not be subject to child abuse and neglect, including human trafficking, torture and other forms of violence, upon return to Guatemala.”

The whistleblowers believe “at least 30 and possibly more children… have indicators of being a victim of child abuse, including death threats, gang violence, human trafficking and/or have expressed fear of return,” the letter states.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/investigatse.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-26 22:57:05.054522

ICE detention in sensitive locations

Current status: ICE agents can now conduct enforcement operations in churches, schools, and hospitals. In response, California passed a package of new “sanctuary laws” on Sept. 20 aimed at limiting the crackdown in places that were previously considered off-limits. How effective these laws will be at deterring federal operations remains uncertain. | Latest update: Sept. 23, 2025

More information

California law forbids ICE from making civil arrests inside courthouses, but agents have continued to bypass the statute. Civil Code § 43.54, intended to protect immigrants from harassment or apprehension while seeking justice, does not bind federal officers. In San Francisco and across the state, courthouse arrests have increased, along with raids in car washes, hospitals, schools, and churches.

In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a package of “sanctuary laws” on Sept. 20 aimed at limiting Trump’s immigration crackdown in sensitive locations:

Senate Bill 98: Requires immigration enforcement officers to present a judicial warrant or court order to enter a school facility; schools must notify communities of enforcement actions.

Senate Bill 805: Requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves and maintain visible identification.

Assembly Bill 49: Bars school facilities from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.

Senate Bill 627: Prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty.

Senate Bill 81: Prohibits immigration enforcement officials from entering restricted areas of healthcare facilities without a warrant or court order.

The laws are a direct response to Trump administration policy changes. On Jan. 21, Trump rescinded guidelines that discouraged enforcement in sensitive locations, giving ICE broad discretion to operate in and around schools, churches, and hospitals.Lawsuits have followed. On Feb. 24, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking ICE from entering places of worship or targeting immigrants nearby without a warrant. But on April 11, another judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing ICE to resume enforcement operations in houses of worship — a major blow to religious groups seeking to protect immigrant congregants.

Bond hearings revoked for some undocumented immigrants

Current status: Civil rights organizations and immigration law firms have filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the widespread denial of bond hearings to undocumented immigrants detained by federal authorities. Under a policy issued in July, immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization are no longer eligible to request release on bond from an immigration judge while fighting deportation. | Latest update: Sept. 23, 2025

More information

On Sept. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, along with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, and the law firms Foley Hoag and Araujo & Fisher, filed a federal court complaint challenging the policy.

Under the new rules, immigrants must remain detained for the duration of their removal proceedings — a process that can take months or even years. Immigration judges no longer have the discretion to grant release; only ICE officers may authorize parole in limited cases.

Advocates say the policy will impact millions of immigrants, including longtime residents with no criminal history. They argue it violates due process and makes it harder for people to access legal representation or remain connected with family.

The policy marks a major departure from previous Justice Department rules, which allowed detained immigrants to seek bond if they could prove at least two years of U.S. residence.

The change comes alongside a new $45 billion funding law that doubles ICE’s detention capacity to 100,000 people per day. Since then, immigrants in at least a dozen states have reportedly been denied bond hearings.

According to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, 58,766 people were held in ICE detention as of Sept. 7, 2025 — down from 61,226 on Aug. 24, though still among the highest levels in recent years.

Limits to ICE operations in California: Face coverings, roving patrols

Current status: California has banned federal agents, including ICE officers, from using masks during enforcement actions, in what Gov. Gavin Newsom called an effort to curb federal overreach. The Department of Homeland Security already said it will not comply, as did ICE. Meanwhile, ICE agents in Los Angeles can resume indiscriminate stops based on race, language, employment, or location, following a Supreme Court decision. | Latest update: Sept. 22, 2025

More information

After a wave of immigration raids across Los Angeles this June — which sparked protests, fear in immigrant neighborhoods and a federal lawsuit — a federal judge blocked indiscriminate arrests in parts of Southern California on July 11. The decision, however, was bypassed by a Supreme Court ruling on Sept. 8, allowing agents to indiscriminately target people in Los Angeles based on race, language, employment, or location. The decision allows agents to resume immigration arrests and raids in the region.

The case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by three immigrants arrested at a Pasadena bus stop and two U.S. citizens detained alongside them — one of whom reportedly showed agents valid identification but was still held.

Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a similar suit after the Border Patrol ran a three-day sweep in Kern County in mid-January, arresting 78 people. Officials claimed they were targeting individuals with criminal or immigration violations, but a CalMatters investigation found only one of those detained had a criminal record. A federal court later issued an injunction on April 29 banning warrantless stops in California’s Eastern District, which spans from Redding to Bakersfield.

In response to these raids and what he called federal overreach, Gov. Newsom signed a bill on Sept. 20 banning local and federal officials from wearing non-medical masks during operations unless they are undercover. How the state will enforce the law remains unclear. Over the past year, federal officials have defended the practice, saying ICE agents hide their identities to protect themselves from harassment.

Nonimmigrant work visas: H1-Bs, TN

Current status: Trump has added a $100,000 annual fee to the H1-B visa application process for new applicants who have not yet filed petitions. Since July, eligibility for TN visas has also been narrowed. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

The H1-B visa is widely used by high-skilled foreign workers, especially those in the tech industry. Federal officials say the new fee will reduce the number of H1-B applicants and push companies to only hire the “best of the best.” However, Trump’s proclamation, which sidestepped Congress, is expected to face legal challenges.

This isn’t the first time that the Trump Administration has implemented policies to limit the number of professionals who can legally live and work in the United States, citing concerns of fraud and over workplaces issuing work visas in a way that doesn’t “put American workers first.”

On July 5, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also narrowed down the eligibility criteria for the TN-Visa, available to Mexicans and Canadians with certain bachelor’s degrees. The visa allows many Mexicans to legally work in the U.S. for three years with unlimited renewals in specific fields.

Under the new guidelines, healthcare workers who interact with patients, mechanics, software engineers or electricians no longer qualify. USCIS also hardened its eligibility criteria, not allowing TN visa holders to work for non-U.S. companies or as independent contractors. Their degree must also now directly match their current profession.

Sharing government-collected data with immigration officials

Current status: On Sept. 19, a district judge barred the federal government from collecting personal data from people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in several states, including California. In August, a similar order prevented the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing Medicaid data with immigration officials. Other federal agencies, however — including the IRS and HUD — have continued sharing information. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

The data-sharing stems from one of Trump’s executive orders directing federal agencies to cooperate with immigration authorities. Among them was HHS, which complied by giving the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data on millions of Medicaid enrollees, despite objections from Medicaid officials who warned it could violate patient privacy. The dataset included information from Medi-Cal beneficiaries in California, where state funds cover immigrants’ full-scope coverage.

In response, 20 states filed a lawsuit that led to the injunction. California separately sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop it from sharing data of people who receive SNAP benefits.

Meanwhile, the IRS started sharing taxpayer information with immigration authorities in mid-August, following an April 8 agreement with the Trump Administration. The move broke with decades of IRS policy prioritizing taxpayer confidentiality, including for undocumented filers. The decision sparked high-profile resignations, including acting IRS Service Commissioner Melanie Krause.

Immigrant rights groups and tax experts warn the deal could deter millions of undocumented workers from filing taxes, risking their income, tax refunds and legal safety. In 2023 alone, undocumented immigrants paid $66 billion in federal taxes, according to Yale Budget Lab.

Similarly, in late March, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) started sharing data with DHS on undocumented immigrants who receive housing assistance through family members with legal status.

In parts of California, some law enforcement agencies have also illegally shared license plate data with immigration authorities, including Oakland and San Francisco.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans, Haitians, Hondurans and Nicaraguans

Current status: On Sept. 8, TPS protections for Hondurans and Nicaraguans expired. By contrast, days earlier, San Francisco’s U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke TPS protections for Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

Chen’s ruling allows more than 600,000 Venezuelans — whose temporary protections expired earlier this year or were set to expire Sept. 10 — to continue living and working in the U.S. It also preserves protections for approximately 500,000 Haitians. In August, a U.S. District Court judge in New York had also previously delayed the decision for Haitian TPS holders until February 2026.

Some nationalities, however, have lost designations following unsuccessful legal battles. After weeks of legal back-and-forth, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a California judge’s ruling that had postponed the end of TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans until November, allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate protections in early September.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to immigrants from 17 countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters or other emergencies. Designations last 18 months and can be extended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Earlier this year, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem reversed Biden-era actions and ended existing protections for Venezuelans, putting more than one million TPS holders at risk, including 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections were due to expire in April.

After a federal judge in San Francisco paused the termination while a lawsuit challenging the order was pending, the Trump administration argued before the Supreme Court that the ruling interfered with executive authority over immigration. Officials also claimed that ending TPS would not lead to immediate deportation, and that affected individuals could pursue other legal options to stay in the U.S.

On May 19, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to end deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. Justices said individual immigrants can still appeal if the government tries to cancel their work permits or deport them. The case continued to be litigated.

The Trump Administration previously failed to end TPS for Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras in 2017 and 2018.

Mass deportations in San Francisco and beyond

Current status: So far, no mass raids have been reported in San Francisco. Most local enforcement has targeted specific individuals, according to Mission Action, a nonprofit that coordinates the city’s Rapid Response Network. Federal officials, however, have threatened sending increased enforcement to a number of cities, including S.F. | Latest update: Sept. 17, 2025

More information

Oakland’s local rapid response hotline reported that on Sept. 17, ICE agents in unmarked vehicles stopped two immigrants at a red light, asked about their immigration status and then detained them after identifying themselves as ICE.

Earlier in the month, the Trump administration launched a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago after weeks of threats to send federal agents to the city. In August, Trump threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago and other Democratic-led cities, including San Francisco, and promised to increase immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities.

Trump previously sent the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and still has active troops in Washington D.C., citing concerns of lawless behavior. In both cities, the deployments coincided with heightened immigration enforcement.

On Sept. 2, however, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to California, ruling that the president’s June order sending troops to Los Angeles was illegal.

Meanwhile, a July spending bill authorizing nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement is expected to accelerate deportations. The expanded budget funds 20,000 additional officers and doubles detention capacity.

ICE operations in San Francisco immigration court

Current status: A coalition of immigrant rights organizations has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging courthouse arrests of asylum seekers and detention conditions at ICE’s San Francisco Field Office. Two weeks earlier, the administration fired another one of SF’s immigration judges – the seventh to be removed since January– in what attorneys say is an effort to target judges with high asylum grant rates. | Latest update: Sept. 18, 2025

More information

Since May, immigration agencies have increased pressure on asylum seekers by attempting to dismiss their cases, arresting them outside their court appointments and detaining them at ICE check-ins. In San Francisco, most of the uptick in enforcement has taken place at immigration courthouses.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has increasingly petitioned judges to dismiss asylum cases in immigration court. Even when judges refuse, enforcement agents have arrested asylum seekers outside appointments and sent them to detention centers. Some have also been detained during check-ins.

Increasingly in San Francisco, asylum seekers without active deportation orders have won release after lawyers filed habeas corpus petitions, arguing these arrests violate due process. If successful, the newly filed class-action lawsuit could affect all immigrants under ICE’s San Francisco jurisdiction, including those currently detained or at risk of being held at 630 Sansome.

The arrests are not the only way the Trump administration is targeting asylum seekers. According to NPR, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has begun dismissing the cases of some asylum seekers who never received a credible-fear interview at the border. Those affected must restart the process, which attorneys warn could land them in detention.

Meanwhile, attorneys and former staff say the administration appears to be targeting judges more likely to grant asylum or with backgrounds in immigrant rights advocacy. On Sept. 9, the Trump administration dismissed San Francisco’s top immigration judge, Loi McCleskey. The week before, Judge Shira Levine — who had one of the highest asylum-granting rates in San Francisco — was also dismissed, along with two other judges. In total, Trump has removed about one-third of San Francisco’s 21 immigration judges.

Judge Chloe Dillion, who was fired after nearly 25 years of federal service, said she was “shell-shocked” by the wave of firings.

Immigrant advocates and attorneys say the firings are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to sow fear and destabilize immigration courts. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Changes to the naturalization process

Current status: The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it will implement a revised version of the naturalization civics test as part of broader reforms tightening requirements for the naturalization process. | Latest update: Sept. 17, 2025

More information

Already implemented reforms include increased vetting, stricter reviews of disability, prioritizing examples of “good moral character” (as opposed to the absence of bad behavior) and the resumption of neighborhood investigations.

USCIS said other initiatives will be announced in the coming months

A seventh San Francisco courthouse firing since January by Trump

Current status: On Tuesday, Sept. 9, the Trump administration dismissed San Francisco’s top immigration judge, Loi McCleskey, marking the seventh local judge removed since January. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.| Latest update: Sept. 9, 2025

More information

Attorneys and former staff say the administration appears to be targeting judges more likely to grant asylum or with backgrounds in immigrant rights advocacy. Last week, Judge Shira Levine, who had one of the highest asylum-granting rates in San Francisco, was also dismissed, along with two other judges in the city. In total, Trump has removed about one-third of the 21 immigration judges who had been serving in San Francisco.

Some of the ousted judges are speaking out. Judge Chloe Dillion, who was fired after nearly 25 years of federal service, said she was “shell-shocked” by the wave of firings.

As the court’s supervising judge, McCleskey oversaw an office that granted asylum at a higher rate than the national average (50%). Her own approval rate stood at 72%, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Immigrant advocates and attorneys say the firings are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to sow fear and destabilize immigration courts.

ICE granted authority to make indiscriminate stops in L.A.

Current status: On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 to bypass a federal judge’s restraining order that had barred ICE agents from indiscriminately targeting people in Los Angeles based on race, language, employment, or location. The decision allows agents to resume immigration arrests and raids in the region. | Latest update: Sept. 8, 2025

More information

The conservative majority’s ruling marks a significant victory for the Trump administration, advancing Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest mass deportation” in U.S. history. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket. We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low-wage job.”

Following the ruling, the administration announced it began conducting immigration arrests in Chicago on Monday morning, heightening fears about the scale of upcoming ICE raids. The Department of Homeland Security has dubbed the operation “Operation Midway Blitz,” targeting immigrant communities across Chicago. Hundreds of DHS officials are reportedly staging operations from a naval base on the city’s outskirts.

Sanctuary cities across the U.S., including San Francisco, are closely monitoring developments in Chicago as they brace for sweeping ICE activity in their own regions.

Use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants

Current status: Trump cannot invoke the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to quickly deport Venezuelan immigrants because of alleged gang ties, a federal appeals court has ruled. The decision blocked such deportations in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and the case now heads to the Supreme Court, which could set a nationwide precedent. | Latest update: Sept. 3, 2025

More information

In one of its most controversial actions to date, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to target individuals allegedly linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, rapidly deporting 238 Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador without due process.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the order the same day, and a federal judge temporarily blocked further deportations. The pause was upheld by an appeals court on March 28, but on April 7, the Supreme Court overturned it in a 5-4 decision, ruling the lawsuit had been filed in the wrong venue (Washington, D.C., instead of Texas). In a partial win for due process, however, the justices also ruled that detained immigrants must receive timely notice and an opportunity to challenge their deportation through habeas corpus proceedings.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to determine how much time migrants are given to challenge their deportations and whether the act’s use was legal in the first place.

Since then, additional rulings have limited enforcement:

April 18: The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 to block the removal of a group of Venezuelan migrants detained in North Texas. That same day, the Trump administration said it would proceed under other immigration laws to deport them.

April 28: A district court judge ruled Trump’s use of the act “unlawful” and barred deportations of Venezuelans in South Texas under the policy. Judges in other cities, like Los Angeles and El Paso, have also issued similar rulings over the past few weeks.

June 4: Judge James Boasberg ruled that the March deportations of 140 Venezuelan men to El Salvador were illegal. In his ruling, he allowed the deportees to challenge their removal, although he did not directly order the Trump administration to bring them back.

More than a month later, the 252 men sent to El Salvador were released to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange. Several have since shared stories of human rights violations that they say happened while inside CECOT.",https://eltecolote.org/content/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05012025-MAYDAY-ET-PU-15-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 22:57:10.512853

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.
Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown.
In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.
The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed.","Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russell Vought has moved with more executive authority over spending, which is typically left to Congress. The administration took steps to cancel foreign aid and asserted power to withhold billions of domestic spending.

“I would expect this shutdown to look different than any other shutdown,” said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy. He said he expects that the Trump team’s actions would be guided by what they believe achieves the most for them politically.

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier wrote, Trump and Vought “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programs, and employees can be sidelined, decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns.”

Beyond the Antideficiency Act, which says the government cannot spend money or incur debts without Congress’ authority, the shutdown process has historically been guided by traditions, not laws.

In recent past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of employees were furloughed, but the shutdowns did not result in mass permanent layoffs or significant reorganizations. Under federal law, federal workers also receive back pay for their time on furlough.

Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown. What can Trump do on his own?

OMB told agencies to ‘consider’ layoff notices

The Trump administration has already reduced the workforce by about 200,000, a number that could grow to 300,000 by the end of the year, Stier wrote. The administration gutted some agencies and programs including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America.

OMB provided an email, first published by Politico, that it sent to agency heads that said agencies should consider sending “reduction in force” notices to employees whose programs are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” or lack mandatory funding or another source of funding, such as the tax and spending legislation H.R. 1, which became law in July.

Rachel Greszler, a workforce expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the administration hasn’t mandated layoffs, but directed agencies to “consider” issuing such notices “as a way to let federal employees know which of their jobs could be on the line if Congress reduces their agency’s funding.”

WATCH: White House threatens mass federal firings if Congress fails to avoid a shutdown

This signals to Democrats that health care funding demands could backfire, she said, potentially causing further reductions in the size of the federal government.

Several questions remain, including how many employees could face layoffs and when. The memo says once fiscal year 2026 appropriations are enacted, agencies should revise their plans to reduce staff.

“I believe this memo indicates OMB will pursue a dual path of shutdown-related furloughs and a separate process of mass layoffs,” Sewell said. Whether the layoffs happen before or after funding is restored “is an open question,” Sewell said. “This certainly indicates the administration wants to cut these agencies and programs at any opportunity either now or in the future.”

Experts offered mixed opinions about whether layoffs would hold up in court. Any such process must follow the rules, such as a 60-day written notice.

“A shutdown provides no new legal authority to engage in widespread firings,” said Sam Berger, who works for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and who worked at OMB during the Biden and Obama administrations.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from New York, said the memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted such firings would be reversed.

Social Security checks and other mandatory spending will continue

Mandatory spending — ongoing spending that does not require periodic extensions from Congress — generally continues during a shutdown. This means Americans would still receive Social Security checks and be able to use Medicare and Medicaid.

In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.

Even continued services can be disrupted. During the 2018-19 shutdown, holiday travelers faced delays as many unpaid TSA staff and air traffic controllers didn’t come to work.

Administrations have a lot of leeway to define “essential” workers. During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration closed national parks. In 2018, the Trump administration kept many national parks open with limited services using previously paid park entrance fees to cover personnel costs; the Government Accountability Office concluded that this violated federal law.

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed. Trump campaigned on a promise to abolish the Education Department, and his administration has shrunk the Environmental Protection Agency.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-26T201908Z_1986867315_RC2WZGAR30D3_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1024x684.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 21:56:29.961140

Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente urged an end to the criminalization of immigrants and the use of trade war tactics during his address Thursday to the UN General Assembly.

De la Fuente reflected on diplomatic tensions Mexico has faced in the last year under Donald Trump’s presidency, highlighting the aggressive targeting and criminalization of immigrants, as well as repeated threats of tariffs on Mexican exports.

“We particularly reject the criminalization of people who, for whatever reason, have been forced to leave their homes and migrate --whether to seek refuge or to escape conditions of injustice or poverty. For us, migrants are people with rights,” said De la Fuente.

Trump has made anti-immigration policy the hallmark of his presidency, leaving Mexico as a witness to the dehumanizing treatment and arbitrary detention of Mexican nationals living in the US.

“Let there be no doubt: Mexico will not tire in ensuring the protection and support of Mexican nationals living abroad. They deserve all our attention and assistance,” De la Fuente added.

Alongside the US crackdown on irregular immigration, Trump has repeatedly used tariff threats to pressure Mexico, his country’s closest trading partner, to demand compliance with his immigration and security priorities.

While Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has successfully resisted the imposition of US tariffs, the American President has continued to pressure his Mexican counterpart through commercial threats.

“Mexico will always advocate for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and, for that reason, rejects sanctions and trade blockades that only harm the well-being of the people,” said De la Fuente.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/09/26/thumbs_b_c_906d7995ee23cf89254384c44679d6bd.jpg?v=081918,N,,2025-09-26 20:56:24.628271

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court’s conservative majority granted the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court’s intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali’s ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts’ order.

The court has previously cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants, fire thousands of federal employees, oust transgender members of the military and remove the heads of independent government agencies.

The legal victories, while not final rulings, all have come through emergency appeals, used sparingly under previous presidencies, to fast-track cases to the Supreme Court, where decisions are often handed down with no explanation.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s a rarely used maneuver when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and in this situation the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it to not spend the money.

The majority wrote in an unsigned order that Trump’s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case.

But that was cold comfort to the dissenters. “The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but [because of their impending expiration] for all time,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as people lose access to food supplies and development programs.

The high court’s decision “further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order,” said Nick Sansone, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who represented the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition in the case. “It will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.”

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year Tuesday.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

The Supreme Court implicitly allowed those other types of nationwide blocks to continue.
The administration has long expressed confidence that the high court would approve Trump’s policy.
At issue are two of several lower-court rulings that have held up implementation of Trump’s policy since the high court’s more procedural ruling this summer.
“The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order’s proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional.","The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to review the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, pushing the issue before the justices for the second time this year.

Despite more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment confers citizenship on people born in the United States, the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in an appeal that notion was “mistaken” and that the view became “pervasive, with destructive consequences.”

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”

CNN reviewed a copy of the appeal, which has not yet been docketed at the high court.

While the Supreme Court handed down an important decision in June that dealt with birthright citizenship, that case was technically focused on a more procedural question of how much power lower courts had to stop a policy implemented by a president. A 6-3 majority of the court essentially limited – but did not completely rule out – the power of courts to block those policies.

That decision sent states and individuals who were challenging Trump’s birthright order scrambling to file new cases to shut down the birthright policy through other means, including class-action lawsuits. The Supreme Court implicitly allowed those other types of nationwide blocks to continue.

A series of new rulings have continued to keep Trump’s policy on hold, and the ad ministration is now asking the justices to take up those cases to settle the issue once and for all.

The administration has long expressed confidence that the high court would approve Trump’s policy. But it’s not entirely clear whether four justices will ultimately vote in favor of hearing the cases, as is required.

At issue are two of several lower-court rulings that have held up implementation of Trump’s policy since the high court’s more procedural ruling this summer. In July, a San Francisco-based federal appeals court upheld a Seattle judge’s ruling that blocked Trump’s policy nationwide in a case brought by a group of Democratic-led states.

A separate decision issued earlier that month by a judge in New Hampshire barred enforcement of Trump’s order against any babies who would be impacted by the policy in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.

The administration filed its appeal in both of those cases on Friday.

“The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship – the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders – is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it,” the administration wrote in those appeals.

The administration has in recent weeks appealed the ruling from New Hampshire to a Boston-based federal appeals court, but the intermediate court has not yet had a chance to weigh in on the matter.

“This executive order is illegal, full stop, and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that,” said Cody Wofsy, an ACLU attorney who argued the New Hampshire case. “We will continue to ensure that no baby’s citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order.”

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Signed by Trump on January 20, the executive order, titled “PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,” said that the federal government will not “issue documents recognizing United States citizenship” to any children born on American soil to parents who were in the country unlawfully or were in the states lawfully but temporarily.

Three decades after the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, the Supreme Court ruled in US v. Wong Kim Ark that people born in the United States – in that case, the son of Chinese immigrants – are entitled to US citizenship, with a few narrow exceptions. But the administration argued in its appeal that the precedent has long been misunderstood.

The Wong Kim Ark decision recognized citizenship for people born in the United States who enjoyed “permanent domicil and residence” in the country, US Solicitor General Sauer argued.

“That limit,” Sauer wrote, “was central to the analysis.”

But those arguments have had no purchase in lower courts thus far.

The 9th Circuit said in a 2-1 ruling in July that Trump’s order contradicts the citizenship clause of the Constitution, Wong Kim Ark and decades of executive branch practice.

“The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order’s proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional. We fully agree,” appeals court Judge Ronald Gould wrote for the majority.

A Portland mother detained with her family after visiting the U.S.–Canada border.","PORTLAND, Ore. — U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter of Oregon’s 3rd District said the recent detention of a Portland mother and her four U.S.-born children illustrates the “cruelty” of the Trump administration's immigration system.

Speaking on KGW’s “Straight Talk,” Dexter recounted driving to Ferndale, Washington, to locate the family after they were held for 12 days in a Customs and Border Protection facility. She said the woman, a longtime resident and business owner, has had multiple release requests denied, leaving her children traumatized as they start a new school year apart from their parents.

Dexter said her office is also aiding another Portland-area man who was allegedly injured during a violent immigration arrest and faces deportation. She criticized the Trump administration’s approach, saying promised crackdowns on criminals have instead resulted in “family separation” and violations of constitutional due process. The congresswoman urged bipartisan immigration reform to create clearer legal pathways and fair enforcement.

The Democrat also addressed the looming federal government shutdown, blaming Republican leaders for failing to negotiate a bipartisan funding plan. She warned that GOP proposals would strip health insurance from up to 20 million Americans by cutting Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid funding, a move she vowed to oppose.

A former critical care doctor, Dexter further condemned what she called reckless political rhetoric around vaccines and pregnancy-related medications, pointing to research that shows no link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. She joined other members of the Democratic Doctors Caucus in calling for the removal of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she described as unfit for office.

In the following excerpt, KGW's Stephanie Domurat dives into the Trump administrations immigration policy with Rep. Maxine Dexter as she talks through immigration arrests impacting Oregon communities.

Stephanie Domurat: Before we get started, a quick note to viewers: We’re taping this interview on Thursday, September 25, so things could change by the time you see it. I want to start first with immigration. Recently, you highlighted the case of Jackie Merlos — we've done some reporting on this. A Portland mother detained with her family after visiting the U.S.–Canada border. You visited the Northwest ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) Processing Center and later spoke very emotionally about the case on Capitol Hill. Why did you step in, and what’s the latest you can share?

Rep. Maxine Dexter: Jackie and her kids, along with her mother, went to the Canadian border to visit her sister, something they’d done before. They were hugging and then they were detained and disappeared. We didn’t know where they were. Her community was looking for them for over 12 days before we were alerted. So, we didn't know where she was; my chief and I just got in the car, and we drove north and found them Ferndale, Washington in a CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) facility.

Domurat: Why did you feel compelled to get so involved, and why was it so emotional for you?

Dexter: I think that it's the reality and cruelty and lack of consistency with what Americans were told about immigration practices and reform that Donald Trump was trying to bring to us. They are not the worst of the worst. These were not criminals. This is a mother and her four U.S.-citizen children. She’s lived here more than 20 years, runs a business, employs community members, pays taxes, and has never broken the laws and goes to church. Yet she was detained and kept in a windowless cell with her four citizen-children for 12 days, disappeared. Nobody knew where she was, and she had no idea if her family was looking for her. The egregiousness of it, the cruelty of it, and she's one of my constituents. I'd be what I hope someone would do for me, for you or others if something so egregious was done against us.

The reality is this is still an ongoing issue. We just found out this [Friday] morning that her release request has still been denied. Her children are starting a new year of school in another person's house that they knew but certainly are not their parents. They are feeling guilty and traumatized about the separation that they are undergoing; they feel accountable for their father being detained also. The trauma on this family is emblematic of trauma happening across our country. As a representative of Congress, it's against our Constitution, and it's against our American values.

Domurat: Have you heard from other families in your district experiencing similar situations?

Dexter: Yes. We have another family that we are working with that we were just alerted to last night [Thursday]. Rafael was taken, reportedly, violently — (leaving behind a) broken glass window — pulled out of his car on his way to work. He'd just had elbow surgery, and he's very concerned that his elbow has been injured. Now, we’re told he’s being deported to Mexico, rather than having the injury our agents, exacerbated, if not caused, being addressed. We were just at the Portland ICE facility this (Friday) morning asking questions with the senators, and Congresswoman Bonamici just asking questions about practices and the fear and intimidation that our community is feeling is very real and trying to understand how our local agents are planning on address our concerns.

Domurat: For people who support tougher immigration enforcement, what policy path do you see to balance due process with enforcement?

Dexter: There is no question that we need immigration reform in this country. We need people who are legally in this country and able to work and following our laws, without question. Donald Trump's promise to be getting rid of criminals and drug trafficking that is not these families that we are tearing apart. I absolutely believe that a balanced, bipartisan immigration reform policy needs to be passed. In fact, there was one about to be passed, and Donald Trump and Republican Party decided not to move that forward before the election. We have made choices that have landed us in this position now, where cruelty and family separation are the norm rather than actually limiting people's ability to commit crimes and be in this country illegally. We need easy pathways for people to get in here legitimately and also we need to enforce our laws — and these are not laws being enforced. We are breaking the constitutional guarantees of due process.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/ef6bb31b-88a5-4ab0-9f5c-d2ec988e09b1/20250926T215626/ef6bb31b-88a5-4ab0-9f5c-d2ec988e09b1_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 19:56:49.961103

Ian Andre Roberts, a Guyana national and superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested in an operation on Friday, ICE announced in a news release.

Roberts has helmed the district since July 2023, according to its website. It described him as a ""career educator"" with over two decades of experience as a teacher, school administrator and executive leader. He also previously served as superintendent in two different districts in Pennsylvania and Missouri.

Roberts worked as superintendent in Iowa despite not having legal status and despite having a “final order of removal and no work authorization,” the ICE news release said.

He had entered the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa, and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, ICE said.

Roberts had existing weapon possession charges from Feb. 5, 2020, according to the release.

Agents approached Roberts on Friday in his vehicle after he identified himself, but he drove off, ICE said. The vehicle was later found near a wooded area, and Iowa State Patrol then assisted in the search for him Friday morning, and he was ultimately taken into custody, the release said.

The Iowa Department of Public Safety said it assisted ICE finding a person, identified as Roberts, who fled from a traffic stop.

At the time of his arrest he was found in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife, ICE said.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will handle the investigation into how Roberts acquired a handgun, ICE said, noting it’s against federal law for people in the United States without legal status to possess a firearm and ammunition.

“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” Sam Olson, director of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office, said in a statement. “How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”

It’s not immediately clear whether Roberts has retained an attorney.

Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris confirmed that Roberts was detained by ICE agents Friday morning. At a news conference, she asked for the community to practice “radical empathy.”

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in the state in July 2023, Norris said.

She said that while the district does not have all the facts, she affirmed Roberts has been “an integral part of our school community” since he joined. She also noted that he's held educational leadership positions in districts across the country for 20 years.

""We stand firm with our community, many of whom are feeling sad, outraged and helpless. We understand as we too are devastated by the news of his detainment,"" interim Superintendent Matt Smith said at the news conference.

Roberts' biography on the district's website stated that he was chosen as superintendent following ""an extensive nationwide search based on a leadership profile developed with input from the school board, teachers, families and others in the school community.""

It said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent most of his ""formative years"" in Brooklyn, New York.

""Dr. Roberts is married, and enjoys hunting, reading, and spending time with family and friends,"" the biography said.

He got his bachelor's from Coppin State University, master's degrees from St. John’s University and Georgetown University, and received his doctorate in urban educational leadership from Trident University. He also has several education certificates, including one from Harvard University, the biography said.

Separately, he was also an Olympian, competing in track and field at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, and in the World Championships in Maebashi, Japan and Seville, Spain, according to the website.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250926-Ian-Andre-Roberts-Des-Moines-Public-Schools-Superintendent-se-541p-7369ee.jpg",N,,2025-09-26 19:57:09.228143

Des Moines Public Schools Board President Jackie Norris said in a message to the district community that Roberts, the district’s superintendent of more than two years, was detained by ICE Friday morning. Norris said in the message the board has “no confirmed information as to why Dr. Roberts is being detained or the next potential steps.”

Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will “immediately” take on the role of interim superintendent “until further notice,” the message stated, and he has the board’s confidence in his leadership. Smith formerly served in the role during the 2022-2023 school year, according to the message, after which Roberts was hired.

“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” Norris said. “The appointment of Mr. Smith as Interim Superintendent ensures that our District continues to operate at the highest level.”

Norris stated in the message the board will provide updated information once they receive and have confirmed it.

“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE. Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Hill.

Video shared on social media showed the confrontation at an immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Thursday, with a woman directly addressing an ICE officer after a man was separated and hauled away by masked officers. The woman and a girl can be seen clinging to the man before he was detained by federal officer.

Afterward, the woman confronted the ICE officer, telling him in Spanish, “You guys don’t care about anything.”

“Adios, adios,” the officer says in response as the woman appeared to put a hand on his chest.

The ICE officer is then seen shoving the woman, pushing her down a hallway and onto the ground. The officer then stands up and tells the woman to leave as the girl is crying. Others proceeded to ask officers to remove the woman from the building.

It is not clear from the video if there was other physical contact between the officer and the woman prior to her being shoved.

The altercation has sparked outcry from New York City officials and some congressional Democrats.

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who himself was detained by ICE agents earlier this year, said he was at 26 Federal Plaza when the incident took place. He said the ICE officer “violently threw this bereft woman to the ground in front of her kids.”

“She had not touched him. She did not pose any threat,” wrote Lander, a vocal critic of ICE. “She had to be taken to the hospital.”

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), whose district includes the courthouse, identified the woman as Monica. He said she “fled” to his office with her two children for “safety after she was assaulted by this @ICEgov agent in an egregious act of excessive force.”

“This is unacceptable conduct from this ICE agent. @Sec_Noem must take appropriate disciplinary action and implement measures to prevent this from happening again,” Goldman said in a Thursday post on social platform X, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Goldman on Friday welcomed news of the officer being put on leave.

“The Secretary must take action to prevent something like this from happening again by DHS, here in NYC or anywhere in America,” he wrote.

The woman said she and her family came to the U.S. from Ecuador in 2024.

“Over [in Ecuador], they beat us there too. I didn’t think I’d come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me,” she told reporters after the incident, ProPublica reported.

Garcia-Hernandez is on life support after he was shot three to four times – including in the neck – his brother, Fernando Gutiérrez, said in an interview with KUVN. Garcia-Hernandez was in the US illegally and previously convicted for “giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police,” the source said.

Doctors are not giving the family hope of recovery, according to his brother. Garcia-Hernandez, who is originally from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, has lived in the United States for two decades, where he worked as a painter, Gutiérrez said. He added that he doesn’t know the circumstances of his brother’s detention by ICE, but said he was there to be deported.

The source also said Bordones-Molina was in the US illegally and had a criminal history that includes a traffic offense and property theft.

The third shooting victim, Guzman-Fuentes, was previously arrested “for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,” the source told CNN.

Authorities have said one detainee was killed and two were injured during Wednesday’s attack, in which a gunman fired at the ICE facility from a nearby roof. The source did not identify the deceased victim.

The victims were shot while they were in a van at the facility’s fortified sally port, a controlled entry point commonly found in prisons and on military bases, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News the three victims were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility, she said.

The shooter has been identified by investigators as Joshua Jahn, 29.

Investigators believe the gunman – who died from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene – harbored “hatred for the federal government” and intended to target ICE personnel and property – even though all three victims were detainees , officials said.

“The tragic irony for his evil plot here is that it was a detainee who was killed and two other detainees that were injured,” Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a news conference on Thursday.

The other detainees who witnessed the shooting were unharmed and will continue immigration proceedings, officials said on Thursday.

Garcia-Hernandez’s mother was deported two months ago and is asking to be able to return to the US to see her son, Gutiérrez said.

Garcia-Hernandez is married with children – including one on the way – and “is the sole provider for his family,” according to a verified GoFundMe campaign.

Over 40 percent of the arrests made during Trump's 30-day federal takeover of D.C. were immigration related, according to the Associated Press.
Now, a lawsuit is challenging these arrests, saying that many of them violated federal law.
Without making an individualized determination as to whether he posed a flight risk, federal officers ""pulled N.S.
""They're not even doing the bare minimum as far as asking individual questions about a person's immigration status,"" CASA Legal Director Ama Frimpong, told The Washington Post.","In August, President Donald Trump instituted a federal takeover of the D.C. police department after declaring a ""crime emergency"" in the city. Thousands of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members were deployed, resulting in a surge of not only criminal arrests but also civil immigration arrests. Over 40 percent of the arrests made during Trump's 30-day federal takeover of D.C. were immigration related, according to the Associated Press. Now, a lawsuit is challenging these arrests, saying that many of them violated federal law.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by four plaintiffs and CASA, a national immigration rights organization, alleges that federal immigration officers did not follow proper procedures when making arrests during Trump's D.C. crackdown. Although immigration agents are allowed to make an immigration arrest without a warrant, the officer must have ""reason to believe"" that the individual is in the U.S. in violation of any immigration law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. This ""reason to believe"" standard is considered equivalent to probable cause in immigration cases.

Four of the five named plaintiffs in the case were arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released on immigration charges during Trump's federal takeover. In each instance, federal officers failed to either inquire about the plaintiff's legal status or assess whether they were a flight risk, or both, before making an arrest.

One plaintiff, Jose Escobar Molina, was approached and immediately handcuffed by plainclothed unidentified federal agents outside of his apartment building on the morning of August 21, despite having a valid Temporary Protected Status for El Salvador since 2001 and living in D.C. for 25 years. The officers did not have a warrant and never asked for Escobar Molina's name, identification, immigration status, or about his ties to the community—ties that are often used to assess whether someone is a flight risk.

According to the lawsuit, when he told the officers that he had legal immigration status, they replied, ""No you don't. You are illegal."" After being put into a vehicle, he pressed the issue again and told the officers he had ""papers."" To which the driver responded by yelling, ""Shut up, bitch! You're illegal.""

After spending the night in immigration detention, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervisor realized that Escobar Molina did, in fact, have legal status, and he was finally released.

Another plaintiff, named only as ""N.S."" in the suit, spent nearly four weeks in immigration detention before being released, despite having a pending asylum application after fleeing Venezuela. Federal agents arrested N.S. in a Home Depot parking lot without asking any questions about where he lived, for how long, or anything else about his ties to the community. Without making an individualized determination as to whether he posed a flight risk, federal officers ""pulled N.S. out of the driver's seat, threw him against the car, handcuffed him, and provided him a clear bag in which to place his belongings, before placing him in the back of a van,"" according to the complaint.

Both men, along with the other plaintiffs arrested without a warrant, now live in fear of being arrested and detained again as immigration arrests continue in the nation's capital.

In a post on X, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserted that the lawsuit's allegations are ""disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE,"" and defended DHS law enforcement's use of ""reasonable suspicion"" to make arrests, rather than conducting ""indiscriminate stops.""

But the issue at the heart of the complaint is not whether the officers had the ""reasonable suspicion"" to make the stops—stops that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote could be made by considering factors like race, ethnicity, and speaking Spanish—but whether officers had probable cause to make the warrantless arrests that followed.

Wittes and Bower explore the viability of different cases she could pursue against Comey and James, the fast-ticking clock that accompanies certain charges, and the backwardness of pursuing a case this way at all.

Stevie Glaberson argued that the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) fast-growing DNA collection program—which does not consistently require agents to get a warrant or file charges—violates the Fourth Amendment. Glaberson further held that asking for consent during DNA collections is insufficient to make the program constitutional, because the coercive power of DHS over detainees renders free consent impossible.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress had asked for a meeting with ICE Chicago Field Office Director Russell Hott. They were seeking to learn more about ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement operations known as Operation Midway Blitz in the Chicago area.

The congressional delegation first asked ICE for an oversight visit to the agency’s Broadview facility that houses many people detained in the Chicago area. ICE declined that request, according to a statement from the delegation, but instead agreed to hold a separate meeting with the members of Congress on Friday.

Friday’s meeting was rescheduled to an unspecified day in October, the delegation said.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE has previously denied Illinois’ members of Congress access to the Broadview facility. ICE established a new policy requiring members of Congress to provide seven days’ notice before visiting a facility after some members unsuccessfully tried to visit the facility in June.

Violet skirmishes once again broke out between protesters and Homeland Security agents at the Broadview facility in Chicago’s near west suburbs Friday. Agents shot pepper balls and tear gas at protesters, including many who tried to block DHS vehicles from entering or exiting the facility.

Earlier this month, federal agents briefly detained two U.S. citizens during a raid of an Elgin home while another agent shot and killed a man in Franklin Park. Body camera footage released this week cast doubt on DHS’ narrative about the shooting.

Mounting questions

State leaders say they still have many unanswered questions about the boarded-up Broadview facility.

“Oversight of this facility is desperately needed as legal service providers and our constituents have raised concerns about the poor conditions at Broadview,” the delegation said in a statement. “These reports allege unsanitary bathroom facilities; spreading illness; continued overcrowding; detainees sleeping on the floor or in chairs; a lack of access to food, water or hygiene products; restricted communications to family members and attorneys; and an inability to access medication.”

With Friday’s meeting canceled, the delegation sent a letter to Hott, the field office director, with a list of questions about ICE’s Chicago-area operations. They’d sent a similar one to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday. Friday’s letter also included several questions about the Broadview facility, including how detainees get medical services and access attorneys.

The letter also seeks answers about where else ICE is detaining people arrested in the Chicago area. The delegation wrote constituents have reported people being detained in Lombard, hotels near O’Hare and prisons in Indiana.

Gov. JB Pritzker released his own questions through the media for a second straight week, seeking broad information about DHS’ plans for Operation Midway Blitz.

“Illinois taxpayers deserve to know why the federal government is spending their hard-earned money to promulgate a state-sponsored fear campaign against our people instead of supporting public safety efforts,” Pritzker said in a statement.

Several elected officials are demanding a criminal investigation and say it is not enough that the officer was fired, they say his actions in that video may well be criminal.

The violent confrontation happened in the hallway of 26 Federal Plaza where some politicians argue ICE has inhumanely detained thousands of immigrant New Yorkers in deplorable conditions.

In the video, federal agents are first seen struggling to arrest an Ecuadoran man as his traumatized family pleads for them to stop. Once the man is in custody, and dragged away, his wife confronts one of the officers who grabs her and shoves her into a wall.

On Friday afternoon, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani condemned the agent's actions.

""After taunting her with the response of 'adios, adios,' suddenly that agent threw her to the ground,"" Mamdani said. ""The kids began to cry, traumatized by the sight of their mother being assaulted in a government building. And when she was released, she said, 'In Ecuador, they beat us there too. I didn't think I'd come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me.'""

Homeland Security officials called the agent's actions ""unacceptable"" and said he has been ""relieved of current duties"" as the case is investigated.

Brooklyn Congressman Dan Goldman says that's not good enough.

""This conduct is unacceptable and we need to make a deterrent effect by seriously investigating it for criminal wrongdoing,"" Goldman said.

Mayor Eric Adams met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday and then released a statement through his deputy press secretary.

""Like so many, we have seen the upsetting images,"" she said, ""and we are pleased to hear this incident is being investigated. Our entire city is less safe when immigrants are afraid to use basic services and attend court hearings.""

The incident has become a flashpoint in the race for City Hall.

Andrew Cuomo's campaign released a statement saying, ""Unlike Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo has not just forcefully condemned the misuse of ICE for years, but took action, signing the executive orders restricting New York's cooperation with them on non criminal matters, successfully guarded NY's drivers license database from them and has continuously called out their abuses on the campaign trail. But if fraudster Mamdani is in a talkative mood, he should answer direct questions about his campaign promise to decriminalize prostitution, his refusal to apologize for calling the NYPD racist as promised and his vow to 'seize the means of production,' i.e. abolishing private property.""

Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa told reporters that otherwise law-abiding migrants should not be deported.

The facility, located in the small Chicago suburb of Broadview, faces allegations of inhumane practices and operating as a de facto detention center.

Roughly 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, and the demonstration remained peaceful until about 7:30 a.m. local time, when agents attempted to drive down a road that was blocked by the group, according to NewsNation’s local affiliate WGN-TV.

Agents responded by firing pepper balls, prompting many protesters to retreat. No injuries have been reported. Additional pepper balls were fired at demonstrators gathering at another entrance, the same location where several protesters had gathered earlier this week.

The confrontation appeared to end when agents retreated behind a gate, though protesters remained outside chanting, some in face masks, in what appeared to be a continued standoff.

Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol’s commander-at-large and former El Centro Sector chief, is on the frontline of agents protecting the facility. He is in charge of more than 200 federal immigration officers whom the Trump administration has tasked with making Chicago safer.

‘There’s no accountability’: Protester

Protesters have repeatedly clashed with authorities at the center during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement in Illinois, which has led to the arrests of more than 400 people since its early September inception.

Demonstrators told NewsNation on Friday that they don’t want a repeat of last week’s protest when officers used tear gas and pepper balls on those gathered outside the brick building’s gates.

An ICE spokesperson told NewsNation that demonstrators slashed the tires of federal vehicles and blocked paths before the use of chemical agents.

Protester Daniel Shouse told WGN that a car carrying three federal immigration officers drove over a curb to hit him on Wednesday.

“There’s no accountability. The officers came up to me at the hospital and asked if I’d be able to point the person out in a lineup,” Shouse said. ” How can I do that when they all wear masks? They have no name tags. They have nothing.”

The truck reportedly continued driving toward the ICE facility’s parking lot, witnesses told Broadview police.

Illinois officials have backed so-called “sanctuary city” policies in and around Chicago, preventing local authorities from assisting in federal immigration enforcement.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed two executive orders aimed at protecting the rights of city residents who protest, and Gov. JB Pritzker has criticized the administration’s “terrible plans” for the state.

The details of this threat — called a “pocket rescission” — may sound technical, but the ramifications are significant.
Under ordinary circumstances, after a president submits a request, Congress has 45 days to approve it.
If Congress does nothing, the rescission request expires and the funds get spent.
While very rare, this is not the first time an administration has made a rescission request late in the fiscal year.","Another needless government shutdown may soon be upon us. Politically, these events have proved fleeting. But this funding deadline carries a long-term threat to the separation of powers, and Republicans would be wise to take it seriously.

The Trump administration is making a frontal challenge to Congress’s power of the purse, and Congress seems either unwilling or unable to do anything about it. This reflects a broader, troubling trend. Our legislative branch has become subordinate to the executive through years of passivity. Congress must stand up to this exigent threat or risk losing more of its power.

The details of this threat — called a “pocket rescission” — may sound technical, but the ramifications are significant. This is about who controls government spending and whether a president can single-handedly cancel money appropriated by law.

The issue at hand is the White House’s effort to reverse nearly $5 billion included in this year’s foreign aid budget. Late last month, President Trump submitted what’s called a rescissions request under the Impoundment Control Act. Passed in response to the Nixon presidency, this 1974 law exists to ensure presidents do not ignore the will of Congress by failing to spend appropriated funds.

The law also formalized a procedure for presidents to propose canceling funds. Under ordinary circumstances, after a president submits a request, Congress has 45 days to approve it. If Congress does nothing, the rescission request expires and the funds get spent. This is because spending laws aren’t just suggestions: Congress must agree to cancel the spending.

But in this case, the White House submitted its rescissions request near the close of the fiscal year, essentially running out the clock. Agencies can hold onto those funds while a request is being considered, but are barred from spending money after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

So by the time the 45-day window is up, the White House can claim this foreign aid money is no longer available to spend — even if Congress did not approve the White House’s request.

It’s a clever gambit, designed to help presidents game the system and undermine the appropriations process. But there are ways to stop it.

In the past, the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog agency, has called this maneuver illegal. The courts are reviewing its legitimacy; on Friday, the Supreme Court allowed the cut to go forward, but the decision was not a final determination on the merits. Congress still should act on this now.

The administration is testing Congress’s mettle. It made a shrewd political decision to request a relatively small package of cuts to foreign aid, a section of our budget often cited by voters as expendable. The administration appears to be making a bet — perhaps a good one — that Democratic leaders would not be willing to fight a government shutdown over such a small budget line, and that Republicans will continue to value party loyalty and their own desire to cut foreign aid over protecting their own constitutional powers.

That would be grievously shortsighted. Even if Republicans in Congress believe in cutting this spending, they must consider what they would be giving up. Passive acceptance of pocket rescissions today could lead to a future progressive president refusing to spend appropriated dollars on, say, immigration enforcement or military procurement.

Some proponents of a pocket rescission approach might claim that it is necessary after so many years of Congress failing to cut spending fat. But this is not how you balance a budget. Rescissions apply only to discretionary spending, not our entitlement programs, and agencies cannot withhold all their funding until the end of the fiscal year. What Congress would be doing by accepting this pocket rescission is giving away its authority.

More than these budget savings, what the administration appears to be seeking is to establish a precedent. It presumably wants to make this process seem legitimate, so that Mr. Trump can come back in future years to take out larger sections of the budget without approval from Congress.

The power of the purse is perhaps Congress’s most important tool to hold the executive in check. For decades, Congress has used the threat — or act — of withholding funds to compel administrations to comply with congressional policy priorities or oversight requests.

Unfortunately, Republicans have already begun ceding congressional power on other fronts — a trend that seems likely to continue. Since the start of the president’s second term, the administration has tried to eat away at Congress’s authorizing and appropriating roles. The administration even tried to shield from public view how it was spending appropriated dollars, a violation of federal transparency laws. This year, we have seen with tariffs what can happen when a seemingly narrow authority is granted to a president.

This is the moment for members of Congress to stand up and defend their institution. Whether before or after a government shutdown, Congress will ultimately send the president a bill that funds the government. It can and should include language either approving or rejecting this rescission of foreign aid and putting into law that a rescissions request cannot be made at the end of a fiscal year.

While very rare, this is not the first time an administration has made a rescission request late in the fiscal year. But during the Ford and Carter administrations, Congress acted on those requests, and at least one Ford administration official made clear it was not the intent to run out the clock.

By contrast, this looks like a power grab. And as Congress knows well, once power is ceded to the executive, it is almost impossible to wrest it back.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/28/opinion/28buck/26buck-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:56:28.188015

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump referred questions to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.
Ms. Beckwith has appealed her termination, arguing she could not be fired without cause and without due process.","For 15 years, Michele Beckwith oversaw some of the toughest federal prosecutions in California. She went after transnational terrorists, sex traffickers and the Aryan brotherhood.

She became the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento this year when her boss, a Biden appointee, stepped down in January.

But her career crumbled in July, she said, after she issued a warning to Gregory Bovino, the California face of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The dismissal of Ms. Beckwith appears to be another example of how Mr. Trump has fired top federal prosecutors who did not help carry out his political agenda.

Her ouster came weeks before Mr. Trump fired a U.S. attorney in Virginia who determined there was insufficient evidence to indict James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, both political targets of the president. The Virginia prosecutor was replaced by a Trump loyalist who convinced a federal grand jury on Thursday to indict Mr. Comey on two counts.

Documents reviewed by The New York Times show that the July 15 firing of Ms. Beckwith occurred less than six hours after she told Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief in charge of the Southern California raids, that a court order prevented him from arresting people without probable cause in a vast expanse that stretches from the Oregon border to Bakersfield. She was removed not only from her post as acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of California, but from the office altogether.

“It’s unjust,” she said of the firings across the federal government this year, in an interview. “We have to stand up and insist the laws be followed.”

“Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city,” Mr. Bovino said in a video he shared on social media, with a holstered gun at his hip and canisters secured to his vest as he stood in front of the State Capitol.

“Whether it’s here in Sacramento or nationwide,” he continued, “we’re here, and we’re not going anywhere.”

The end of Ms. Beckwith’s federal career was precipitated by a phone call from Mr. Bovino on July 14. He told her that he was bringing his officers to Sacramento, about 600 miles north of the Mexico border, and wanted to know whom to notify in her office if they were assaulted, she recalled.

Ms. Beckwith said she reminded him that the Border Patrol was under a federal court order prohibiting it from stopping people indiscriminately in her district. It was clear, she said, that he knew about the order but did not seem to think it would stop his raid.

At 10:57 the next morning, she emailed Mr. Bovino to reiterate she expected “compliance with court orders and the Constitution.”

Hours later, her work cellphone went dark. Then her computer did, too. She checked her personal email account.

At 4:31 p.m., she received an email from Saurabh Sharma, special assistant to Mr. Trump.

“Michele,” it stated, “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as First Assistant United States Attorney and employment with the Department of Justice is terminated, effective immediately.”

Ms. Beckwith was promptly marched out of the office.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump referred questions to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.

A Department of Homeland Security official, who was part of the Sacramento operation and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that federal officials were offended by Ms. Beckwith’s suggestion that immigration agents were going to violate the rights of migrants.

What’s more, the official said, Mr. Bovino felt Ms. Beckwith was refusing to provide his team the legal support it needed to safely conduct the operations.

In a statement, Mr. Bovino said, “The former Acting US Attorney’s email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.”

Ms. Beckwith’s impasse with Mr. Bovino was rooted in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union after his border agents conducted the unannounced raids in Bakersfield, where they arrested day laborers outside a Home Depot and farmworkers in orchards in January.

A federal judge in April ruled that the Border Patrol could detain people only if they had a reasonable suspicion that they were violating federal immigration law.

“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer Thurston said. She granted an injunction stopping the Border Patrol from detaining people without probable cause while the case proceeds.

But that order did not apply to Southern California, where federal officials intensified their crackdown in June, leading to protests and Mr. Trump’s deployment of the National Guard against the wishes of California leaders. A Los Angeles judge in July also placed restrictions on immigration raids in Southern California, but the Supreme Court overruled her decision this month.

There are 93 U.S. attorneys overseeing federal prosecutions in districts throughout the country. It is common for them, as appointees, to resign after a new president is elected.

It is not common, however, for presidents to demand that prosecutors carry out certain acts as a condition of employment, said Nina Mendelson, a professor of law at the University of Michigan with expertise in administrative law. U.S. attorneys are supposed to be able to operate freely from political pressure.

“We still have a norm of prosecutorial independence and even-handedness and integrity at the federal level,” she said. “Political pressure to prosecute enemies or shield friends would not typically be considered cause for removal.”

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Eric Grant, who defended the Trump administration against major environmental lawsuits during the president’s first term, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California. Mr. Grant replaced Ms. Sanchez, who is now second in command in the office, the position that Ms. Beckwith once had.

Ms. Mendelson said the firing of longtime civil servants without cause, as in the case of Ms. Beckwith, is rare. Ms. Beckwith said that while the president had the right to remove her as acting U.S. attorney, he should have allowed her to return to prosecutorial work in the Eastern District.

Ms. Beckwith has appealed her termination, arguing she could not be fired without cause and without due process. She is seeking that her removal be expunged from her record, as well as back pay with interest and attorneys’ fees.

Ms. Beckwith said she was motivated by justice, not politics.

She was raised in Ohio by a father who worked in a fiberglass factory and a mother who stayed home to take care of her and her sister. They did not talk about politics.

She and her husband, also a lawyer, moved to California in 2004 for work and eventually decided to raise their family in Davis, a college town west of Sacramento, where she is a member of the school P.T.A. Though she is a registered Democrat, she pointed out that she has served Republican and Democratic presidents alike.

“I’m an American who cares about her country,” she said. “I’m a public servant. That is my calling.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/26/multimedia/26nat-doj-firing-mcjl/26nat-doj-firing-mcjl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:56:50.918301

There have been growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts as federal agents are tasked with making more arrests. Over the last five months, ICE has increased its footprint inside immigration courthouses, which are operated by the Justice Department. The agents' presence and arrests in courthouses, particularly in New York, have resulted in conflicting mandates and instances of explosive anger, as NPR previously reported.

In August, as NPR and a court observer — an immigrant advocate — entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. The agent, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: ""stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?"" before turning and yelling the same thing at the court observer.

""It's not f****** about you!"" she retorted.

As they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.

""Don't f****** touch me,"" the court observer yelled. ""Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!""

At that time, the justices rejected the president’s request that nearly $2 billion in blocked foreign aid payments remain frozen in a 5-4 decision.","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to allow the Trump administration keep frozen billions of dollars in foreign aid that is set to expire next week, the latest turn in a lengthy legal saga over the congressionally appropriated funds.

The emergency intervention came at the administration’s urging to lift a lower court’s ruling ordering it to spend $4 billion in funds approved for aid programs by Sept. 30, its expiration date.

The unsigned order indefinitely extends the pause on U.S. District Judge Amir Ali’s injunction that was put in place earlier this month by Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the nation’s capital by default, as the high court considered the appeal.

The court gave a brief explanation of its reasoning, saying that the government “at this early stage” made sufficient showing that the lawsuit is precluded under the Impoundment Control Act and that the plaintiffs can’t force the government to pay up.

The court also said that the asserted harm to Trump’s foreign policy powers appeared to outweigh potential harm faced by the respondents.

“This order should not be read as a final determination on the merits,” the order read. “The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.”

Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson that the application raises “novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer had argued that letting Ali’s injunction stand would force the administration to obligate the money at “breakneck speed,” even as Trump has proposed cancelling the aid to Congress.

The president’s proposal is known as a “pocket rescission,” a rare and legally murky bid to avoid spending appropriated money by asking Congress to cut the budget late into the fiscal year. It means the 45-day window lawmakers have to act on the request could be cut short by the budget year’s end, leaving the funds to expire. If lawmakers reject the request, the funds must be released.

Kagan wrote that the “stakes are high,” pinning down the central issue as the allocation of the power of the purse between the president and Congress. She criticized the majority for granting any emergency relief with the weighty issues at play.

However, the administration’s outrage amounts to “the price of living under a Constitution that gives Congress the power to make spending decisions through the enactment of appropriations laws,” she argued.

“If those laws require obligation of the money, and if Congress has not by rescission or other action relieved the Executive of that duty, then the Executive must comply,” the justice wrote. “It cannot be heard to complain, as it does here, that the laws clash with the President’s differing view of ‘American values’ and ‘American interests.’

“That inconsistency, in other words, is not a cognizable harm, to be weighed in the equitable balance,” she continued. “It is merely a frustration any President must bear.”

Roberts’s temporary order only paused Ali’s injunction as it pertained to the funds subject to Trump’s Aug. 28 rescission proposal to Congress.

Global health and aid groups challenging Trump’s efforts to freeze the funds rejected the notion it would interfere with Congress’s decisionmaking to make the government pay up.

“Any emergency is of the government’s own making, as it has been under an obligation to spend the appropriated funds for specified purposes since at least March 2024,” the plaintiffs’ response to the government’s emergency application read.

Trump paused about $30 billion in foreign aid in one of his first acts back in the White House, prompting the groups to swiftly file suit.

About $10.5 billion of the total $30 billion is set to expire Sept. 30, but the government planned to obligate $6.5 billion of those funds by the deadline, Sauer said. That left the roughly $4 billion in play.

“The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,” Sauer wrote in the government’s request for a stay.

It’s the latest chapter in the convoluted legal battle over Trump’s efforts to slash foreign aid.

Though the plaintiffs only sued in February, the case reached the Supreme Court for the first time in March. At that time, the justices rejected the president’s request that nearly $2 billion in blocked foreign aid payments remain frozen in a 5-4 decision.

Last month, a panel of U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit judges found the challengers did not have standing to bring their lawsuit, striking down Ali’s ruling ordering the administration to spend billions in aid work.

That ruling was later amended, which left a pathway for the plaintiffs to ask for a preliminary injunction on different legal grounds. After that, Ali granted a new preliminary injunction, the subject of this appeal.

The Trump administration’s appeal of that ruling yielded a 2-1 decision from the appeals court in the plaintiffs’ favor, prompting the emergency application to the justices. Roberts issued his administrative stay earlier this month.
