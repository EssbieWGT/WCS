The verdict was met with cheers, tears and cries of jubilation as the presiding judge announced the words that would end a seven-year legal ordeal for the humanitarians. All 24 had engaged in rescue work on the Aegean island at the height of the refugee crisis.

“It took 2,897 days for the obvious to be delivered by the justice system,” said Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer who represented six of the defendants. “Today, the three-member felony court of appeal of the North Aegean delivered a courageous judgment.”

The European parliament had described the prosecutions as “the largest case of the criminalisation of solidarity in Europe” and proceedings had been closely watched internationally.

Rights groups had spoken of a test-case moment for the treatment of humanitarians across the continent when tolerance for aid work has waned as migrant policies have hardened. Greece – a frontier state – has for years been accused of forcibly expelling migrants from its land and sea borders, with pushbacks especially prevalent in the Aegean. The centre-right government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has called the policies “strict but fair” although it has denied the expulsions.

Ahead of Thursday’s court proceedings – resuming six weeks after the criminal trial began in Mytilene – Human Rights Watch called the case a “perverse misrepresentation of life-saving humanitarian work”. It had urged Greek authorities to drop the “baseless” charges.

“The acquittals are a vindication for the defendants but are also bittersweet,” said Eva Cosse, a senior researcher in the group’s Europe and Central Asia division. “These abusive prosecutions have virtually shut down lifesaving work even as people continue to drown in the Aegean. The Greek authorities should stop criminalising solidarity, end pushbacks and prioritise saving lives.”

The defendants included Sara Mardini, the Syrian refugee immortalised in the Netflix movie The Swimmers, and Sean Binder, a German-born Irishman who, like Mardini, spent 100 days behind bars after his arraignment in 2018. At the time of their arrests they ranged in age, with most of the aid workers in their 20s and 30s but some in their early 70s.

Bonded by the same idealistic desire to help at a time when the then-bankrupt country was struggling to cope with an influx of Syrians fleeing civil war, all had volunteered with the search-and-rescue organisation, ERCI. Now dissolved, the aid group had been based in Lesbos, among the islands closest to the shores of Turkey that had fast become a magnet for refugees.

Greek police claimed the aid workers had facilitated the illegal entry of migrants by monitoring maritime radio signals and using encrypted messaging apps to gain advance notification of the location of smugglers’ boats heading from the Turkish coast.

Among the lesser charges the defendants had also faced was espionage. In January 2023, a court threw out that accusation, citing insufficient proof, with supporters hailing the dismissal as indicative of the volunteers’ innocence. Rights groups had described the charge as “farcical”.

Earlier, while giving evidence before the court, defendants had argued that what they had been involved in was legitimate human rights work of helping people on the move, and often at risk of drowning, as they endeavoured to reach safety.

Reacting to the judgment, Binder said: “The court reached the only decision it could today based on the limited legal basis of the charges and the flimsy evidence the prosecutor presented.”

Binder described the gruelling effects of lives put on hold by the prolonged criminal proceedings. First detained at the age of 24, the trainee barrister is now 31.

“It is a huge relief that I will not spend the next 20 years in a prison cell, but at the same time it is troubling that this should ever have been a possibility,” he said.

“Today it was made clear, as it should always have been, that providing life-saving humanitarian assistance is an obligation, not a crime. That using WhatsApp is normal, not evidence of criminality. That buying laundry machines for a refugee camp does not make someone a money launderer. This acquittal must set a precedent.”

Amnesty International, which had sent delegations to Lesbos to monitor the trial, said it hoped Thursday’s decision would send a “strong signal” to Greece and other European countries that “defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507947fc12dd88f9c9dd7fd8d63f48c7789f7d1c/313_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e96ad2a67037261a9f694a0e4d007ad",N,,2026-01-15 22:57:39.700868

During a call with reporters on Thursday, several group leaders said the Department of Homeland Security is violating human rights with raids by U.S, Customs and Enforcement agents, and immigrant detentions that they say are not properly documented.

“The government overreach and abuse of power we have seen from the Trump administration is unlawful, unacceptable and un-American, and we would note that the overreach and abusive power are harming not only our communities but also our country as a whole,” UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguia said.

“What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable,” Murguia said.

UnidosUS and 73 other human rights and faith-based organizations on Thursday sent a letter to House and Senate leaders urging lawmakers to rein in abuses and restore accountability to federal immigration enforcement actions.

In the letter, they accuse the federal government of not maintaining comprehensive records on immigrant detentions and they urge lawmakers to ask “urgent questions about when and how federal officers use force.”

“A lack of public accountability and even disinformation spread by public officials about recent events appears intended to indicate that longstanding and well-established legal and constitutional rights are irrelevant in the context of immigration enforcement activities,” they wrote.

They also cite recent immigrant deaths.

The Mexican consulate in Atlanta on Thursday reported the death of a Mexican national in ICE custody near Atlanta, bringing the toll of detained deaths to five in just the first 15 days of 2026, according to immigration data tracker Austin Kocher of Syracuse University. There were a record-setting 30 deaths in ICE custody in 2025, Kocher says.

And the Washington Post reported Thursday that the El Paso County Medical Examiner is likely to classify the death of Cuban-born Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, at ICE’s “Camp East Montana” tent camp detention center in El Paso as a homicide. A detainee says he witnessed Campos being choked to death by guards, according to the Post.

Mark Morial, of the National Urban League, says this is a “state of emergency” and the country “is, quote, creeping toward totalitarianism.”

“The enforcement actions of this administration and the fact that they’re not about immigration or public safety. Millions of people in this country including U.S. citizens are being deprived of the freedom to go about their daily lives due to an unnecessary and excessive show of force,” Murguia said.

National civil rights organizations are calling on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations to include:

Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

“Public Safety depends on trust and cooperation between people and institutions overreach breaks that partnership and makes every community less safe,” said Juan Proano, CEO of LULAC.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, along with its California chapter (CAIR-CA), today condemned the political grandstanding and scapegoating of Afghan nationals and the false and defamatory allegations made against CAIR during a recent Congressional joint subcommittee hearing, calling it part of a broader attack on American Muslims and Muslim-serving organizations, particularly those who support Palestinian human rights.

On Wednesday, Jan. 14, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a joint subcommittee hearing to address former President Joe Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program.

The hearing included a testimony from Julie Marzouk, a fringe anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim extremist. Marzouk was a founding member of the Intelligent Advocacy Network (IAN), an apparent front group for the Israeli lobby whose primary purpose appears to be smearing critics of the Israeli government.

The organization has posted various conspiracy theories about CAIR and other critics of the Israeli government. The New York Post had to correct an article after it cited a false claim made by the IAN that CAIR-CA had raised tens of thousands of dollars for student vandals on college campuses.

Marzouk was invited by members of the subcommittee who have previously espoused Islamophobic rhetoric, including Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), whose anti-Muslim behavior CAIR has previously condemned, and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), who has participated in the harmful targeting of Texas’ Muslim population.

During the hearing, Senators Hawley and Cornyn and Marzouk repeated baseless allegations and blatant falsehoods recycled from anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim groups in an attempt to discredit CAIR, including factually inaccurate claims of misused and untraced federal funding. All three speakers demonstrated a concerning lack of understanding of grant processes and the U.S. immigration process, even going so far as to claim that CAIR’s immigration attorneys are responsible for vetting immigrants—a process that is performed by federal government officials. Their discordant arguments also referenced Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s politically motivated campaign against the Muslim-led EPIC City Project and Gov. Abbott’s and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ recent defamatory and unconstitutional designations of CAIR as a terrorist organization as “evidence.”

Prior to the hearing, CAIR sent a letter to the subcommittee chairs outlining its California chapter’s immigration work and countering the unsubstantiated allegations against the organization. Earlier this week, CAIR also sent a letter signed by more than 40 organizations in support of CAIR-CA and its service to immigrant communities.

In a statement, CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell, Esq., said:

“The legacy of Senator Joseph McCarthy is alive and well in the Senate. Several senators used this committee hearing to spread debunked conspiracy theories and fan the flames of hate against immigrants, refugees, and Americans critical of U.S. foreign policy, especially American Muslims.

“Calling in an anti-Muslim bigot and acolyte of the Israeli government to serve as a witness is bad enough. Letting such an individual spew hate without any pushback is unacceptable.

“We stand in solidarity with the Afghan American community and the Afghan refugee committee, and we applaud CAIR California for the work it has done to serve the people of California, including new Californians establishing a better life for their families.”

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“The Joint Subcommittee Hearing was a disgraceful display of political grandstanding meant to demonize vulnerable Afghan immigrants and smear the organizations that serve them. Rather than meaningfully addressing policy or community safety, the hearing was used to disparage CAIR and our long-standing work serving immigrant and refugee communities—particularly the Afghan community—by echoing demonstrably false claims pushed by anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups.

“These unfounded allegations are part of a larger defamation campaign targeting American Muslims by fringe anti-Muslim groups and individuals, such as Julie Marzouk, who intentionally misrepresent public documents and information to create a false narrative. These individuals have been recycling the same tired and refutable claims about CAIR and CAIR-CA and attempted to weaponize the hearing in a flailing effort to fulfill their anti-Muslim and xenophobic political agenda.

“It’s clear that our work threatens Israel-first politicians and activists who would rather Muslims remain silent and invisible in American society. CAIR-CA is proud of our partnership with the State of California in providing critical services to thousands of immigrant families, and we will not be intimidated by these transparent, politically motivated attacks.”

“In 2020, the United States and Vietnam signed a Memorandum of Understanding (‘2020 MOU’), pursuant to which Vietnam has begun to accept removals of pre-1995 arrivals. … In September 2025, following a routine email check-in, Tran was instructed to report to ICE’s Boston Field Office. … He reported as instructed, and an ‘officer informed [him] that ICE [was] now able to deport individuals to … Vietnam.’ … The officers asked whether Tran had a passport or other travel document. … Tran did not have a travel document, but he was willing to begin paperwork to request one. … Tran completed a self-declaration form right then and ICE detained him shortly thereafter. … Tran remains in ICE detention and ICE intends to detain him until he can be removed to Vietnam. …

“… When Tran was redetained, there had not been any ongoing effort to remove him. Tran was detained solely on the basis that other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed, and because the government expected that, after completing the process of requesting and receiving travel documents, it would similarly be able to remove Tran. In other words, there was no individualized determination of his circumstances. …

“ICE’s analysis under §241.13(i) must be ‘individualized.’ … The only reasons that ICE had for redetaining Tran on September 11 were that (1) other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed and (2) Tran had completed a self-declaration form. As noted, these two facts alone are not sufficient, in light of the factors enumerated in §241.13(f), to establish that Tran was reasonably likely to be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. …

“The Court next considers whether this action is moot or requires a different outcome in light of the further steps taken by Respondents during the three months that Tran has been detained — namely, completing his application for travel documents and presenting it to the Vietnamese government. The Court concludes that it is not. Though the government has taken further steps, the record does not yet suggest that Tran’s removal is significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, particularly given the number of pre-1995 arrivals who are not promptly removed following the submission of a request for travel documents. The Court thus concludes that Tran’s present detention exceeds Respondents’ regulatory authority. …

Following the federal funding deal passed in mid-November 2025, Congress faces another January 30th deadline to pass the remaining appropriations bills to fully fund the government for fiscal year (FY) 2026; this includes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill.

Recent atrocities committed against both immigrants and citizens under the Trump administration have shone a light on abuses of power by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP). However, these abuses are hardly new. Since ICE and CBP were established in 2003, the agencies have terrorized immigrant communities, conducted unconstitutional border checkpoints, torn apart families, denied immigrants their due process rights, and subjected detained immigrants to physical, sexual, and mental abuse. The killing of Renee Good in Minnesota was the 9th ICE shooting since September 2025.

ICE also received an influx of billions in additional funding from the so-called “One Big Beautiful” bill. The bill placed no guardrails or conditional oversight on the use of this money, essentially creating a $75 billion slush fund for ICE to continue their violent attacks on communities across the country.

Call on your representatives to block any DHS appropriations bill or Continuing Resolution (CR) that maintains funding for ICE. This lawless and violent agency must be defunded and dissolved for good.

The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

During a televised speech Wednesday evening, Gov. Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what's happening in the state ""defies belief.""

""Let's be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,"" he said. ""Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.""

Walz added that ""accountability"" will be coming through the courts.

Military lawyers may join the surge

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.

CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in Minneapolis.

Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military ""is proud to support"" the Justice Department.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.

It's the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place. The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.

Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there's concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.

""There are not many JAGs but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,"" he said.

An official says the agent who killed Good was injured Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.

The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross' medical condition. The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.

There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss. Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.

She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.

Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defense claim that has been deeply criticized by Minnesota officials.

Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.

'An agent of peace'

Good's family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd's family in a $27 million settlement with Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.

The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.

""They do not want her used as a political pawn,"" the firm said, referring to Good and her family, ""but rather as an agent of peace for all.""

Students march against ICE

Waving signs reading ""Love Melts ICE"" and ""DE-ICE MN,"" hundreds of teenagers left school in St. Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.

The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week. President Rebecca Cunningham noted that ""violence and protests have come to our doorstep."" The campus sits next to the main Somali neighborhood in Minneapolis.

They think so,John Domen,,,,,https://wtop.com/maryland/2026/01/can-democratic-lawmakers-curb-federal-immigration-efforts-in-maryland-they-think-so/,"While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.
One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.
“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said.

“They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.","While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.

One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.

“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”

With a super majority in both chambers, a version of the bill is expected to pass over the objections of Republicans like Frederick County State Sen. William Folden.

“I don’t think that as a state, we’re allowed to tell the federal government — we can’t tell them what their policies are going to be,” Folden said. “Let’s be very transparent on this. If we didn’t have… activists going out and doxing these agents and their families and putting their addresses out on social media and endangering them — their well being — as well as their family. You wouldn’t have this problem.”

Folden, who spent decades with Maryland State Police, calls the bill an “irrational response” from Democrats who want to distract voters from issues of affordability, especially as it pertains to energy bills around the state.

Ferguson said under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the state has the power to pass bills like this.

“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said. “How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution.”

Folden expressed skepticism about that.

“I don’t know that that’s accurate,” he said. “They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.

Folden compared the high number of deportations under former President Barack Obama’s administration to ICE’s operations in the U.S. under President Donald Trump.

“We didn’t see this,” he said. “We didn’t see these people out there doxing federal agents.”

Ferguson did admit the issue would likely end up in the courts.

Another issue likely to be decided in a courtroom is the participation of local enforcement agencies with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which allows local officers to help ICE identify and remove noncitizens arrested for another crime. Efforts to keep local agencies from participating in that program stalled out last year.

Ferguson and House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk say that won’t happen this time.

“Immigrants deserve to live with dignity and respect,” Peña-Melnyk said. “How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect? The abuses? People losing their lives? Racial profiling? Civil rights violation?

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat,” she added. “What’s right is right, what’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God, that I believe in, loves everyone.”

Ferguson described ICE as a “paramilitary force” that was “offensive to humankind” during his comments Wednesday.

“Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity,” Ferguson said. “So until there is a major shift, until there is a major restructuring of how that organization functions, Maryland should not be partnering and furthering an organization that does not follow Maryland values.”

But Folden touted the system and said scrapping it will only lead to more chaos.

“The process we have in place is very uniform,” Folden said. “It’s justified, as they’re already under arrest for another offense, and it’s not invasive into our communities, as far as boots on the ground going in and being disruptive. It’s only when they have another contact with law enforcement for an arrestable offense.”

He said the elimination of the program in Maryland would likely lead to the sort of efforts and encounters happening in Minnesota.

Folden also isn’t sure the state has the power to tell elected sheriffs, whose jobs exist under the state constitution, when they can and can’t engage with federal agencies. If the bill is passed into law, it’ll be a judge who makes that determination.

“They’re already lining up. They’ve already got counsel,” said Folden, about some sheriffs’ offices. “They’re lining up because everyone can see the writing on the wall. It’s about virtue signaling. It’s not about anything else except hiding their own mismanagement of funding and taxpayer dollars.”

I see a White House that is panicking and that is losing. [HONKING, SCREAMING] I think that this aggression represents political weakness. It’s an attempt to shut people up, because what they’re saying and what they’re doing is actually impeding your ability to accomplish your goals. When you actually look closely at what’s happening in Minnesota, what you see are hordes of agents, a dozen people, 20 people, trying to execute a single arrest. And that is because an organized network of observers is working to prevent escalation and prevent violence. ICE can’t do anything without being followed, and that reduces the odds that they act in dangerous and aggressive ways. Minnesotans, in other words, are standing up for their communities and pushing back against ICE and the Customs and Border Protection in a real way that is preventing them from doing their worst. But if you zoom out from Minnesota and look at the national political picture, what you see is an embattled agency. ICE has never been more unpopular than it is right now. First, majorities of Americans in a recent YouGov poll, 53 percent, said that they did not think that the shooting of Renee Nicole Good was justified. 42 percent of Americans said that they would support the elimination of ICE as an agency. Abolish ICE has very quickly gone from what some may have considered the fringes of American politics to the mainstream. And short of ending the agency, there is majority support for slashing its funding, for putting restrictions on agents, for requiring them to remove their masks and show identification. [SHOUTING] The public, broadly, is just tired of what they’re seeing and want something to be done about it. And I think the administration knows that. I think the administration knows, I think the president knows they made a mistake in the initial aftermath of Good’s killing when they condemned her as a domestic terrorist. “This was an act of domestic terrorism.” And then we see things like the Department of Justice going to investigate Good and her wife and lawyers at the D.O.J. resigning in response. And so to save face, the administration has unleashed ICE on the people of Minnesota. It’s doing the only thing it seems to know how to do, which is to escalate with its aggression, under the idea that you can just shut people up if you kick them hard enough. But what we’re clearly seeing is that this approach doesn’t cause people to retreat. It causes them to dig in, to double down, to show more resolve in the face of what is plainly tyranny. ICE is not going to be able to suppress the people of Minnesota, and the administration isn’t going to win the political battle over this.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/arts/op-jamelle-ice-minnesota-thumb/op-jamelle-ice-minnesota-thumb-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:15.167799

But ultimately, the deployments ended because of esoteric case law and round-the-clock legal preparation and wrangling, according to the Democratic attorneys general from those states.

Earlier this month, President Trump pulled hundreds of National Guard troops from California, Oregon and Illinois after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration in the Illinois case.

It was a major win for the Democratic states that had been fighting against the deployments, after troops had been federalized against the wishes of those states' governors. It required nearly constant coordination and communication between states as they worked to understand and define the archaic and rarely used legal mechanism that the Trump administration used to justify the deployments.

""We were in uncharted territories. This had never happened before,"" remembers California Attorney General Rob Bonta. ""And California was on the front lines from day one.""

In June of last year, in a bold and unprecedented move, Trump seized control of California's National Guard — against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes — and deployed more than 4,000 troops, along with the Marines, to the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protect federal immigration officers and facilities as protests broke out against them.

It was the first of what would become a pattern in the following months, as Trump deployed the National Guard to several Democratic-led cities around the country, claiming that the deployments were necessary because of violence and rampant crime — a claim that data contradicted and several local and federal judges called into question.

NPR reached out to the White House for comment on this story. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that ""if Democratic leaders had spent half as much time addressing crime, their communities would be much safer,"" reiterating that Trump is committed to safety and security.

Even before Trump's re-election, several Democratic attorneys general had been prepping for the likelihood that he would deploy the military to U.S. cities if he won a second term. It's something that he and some of his closest advisors had talked openly about on the campaign trail as an option to assist with immigration enforcement efforts.

""We had done a lot of homework for this exact issue,"" says Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.

Once Trump deployed Guard troops to Los Angeles, the legal mechanism the administration would likely use became clearer. Deployments to California – and eventually Oregon and Illinois – were all done citing a 19th century law called 10 U.S.C. 12406, which had very little precedent around it.

The law hinges on vague terms that can be open for interpretation, like ""rebellion"" and ""invasion.""

""Since this law has been used so rarely in our history, we had very little sense of what any of these terms meant, because none of them are defined by the statute,"" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

That meant that the court battles against these deployments could help define the law.

""Case law and litigation becomes a really important mechanism by which we kind of give these terms meaning,"" Mirasola says.

Bonta in California says that's one reason he and his team felt so much pressure to get their legal response right.

""Our case was first. So if we stumbled, or if there was bad precedent set, or if there was a broad, expansive view of Trump's authority and that allowed him to do what he did in L.A. and then repeat it or escalate it into more cities, there was a lot at stake,"" Bonta says.

Meanwhile, other Democratic states were watching California, hoping to learn from their legal fight.

""We were definitely in touch (with Bonta's office) right when it happened, not knowing when the hammer would drop for us,"" remembers Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Bonta encouraged his team to share as much as they could with other states.

""I basically said, 'Tell them everything,'"" he said.

California reached out to other states, other states reached out to each other.

Over the course of several months, Trump threatened deployments to Baltimore and Oakland, Calif. He deployed troops to Washington, D.C. — a unique situation where the president controls the National Guard. And then, later in August and into September, Chicago and Portland, Ore. became the clear focus.

""We were on high alert,"" remembers Rayfield, of Oregon, who says he told his team that the goal was to block the deployment before troops could be on the streets of Portland, which is different from what happened in Los Angeles. ""It was a unique approach. And frankly, I don't think that was universal among all attorneys that that was the right approach, but that was the approach we were going to take in Oregon.""

The office in California went full force, sharing as much legal insight with Oregon and Illinois as possible.

The coordination came in handy in the first weekend of October, when all three states found themselves involved in lawsuits surrounding the deployments.

Rayfield remembers the attorneys and staff in his office working to file a lawsuit against the deployment in Portland within 12 hours. And it worked — by Saturday, a federal judge had issued a temporary restraining order.

""We're thinking, 'Shoot, we got a win.' And then we were able to have a little bit of a sigh of relief. But only for a few hours,"" Rayfield said.

The next morning, on Sunday, Trump said he was deploying California's National Guard — which were still federalized and under his control — to Oregon.

Bonta remembers he was out celebrating his mother's 88th birthday when he started getting calls and texts. He eventually stepped away and got on the phone with Rayfield, while both of their staffs were in near-constant communication. That evening, the same federal judge issued a second temporary restraining order, blocking any other states' National Guard from the streets of Portland as well.

At almost the exact same time, Raoul in Illinois was facing a similar situation. Trump had federalized the Illinois National Guard to deploy troops to Chicago. When that deployment hit legal roadblocks, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered to send troops from his state.

Raoul and his staff were also working round the clock, calling their counterparts in Oregon and California for guidance and insight.

""Fortunately, we've gotten to a point where we've got each other on speed dial,"" Raoul says. ""There's no inappropriate time to call one another, and communication had to happen that weekend, or you know, whenever.""

A few days later, a federal judge in Illinois also issued a temporary restraining order, blocking troops from the streets of Chicago.

Raoul says it was an emotional time for him and his staff; the situation and its implications felt so heavy.

""I remember, I went down and did a press availability afterwards, and I started cracking a little bit, you know, my voice. And I was like, I'm okay if some tears come down my eye, because this is some real serious s—,"" he says.

In every case, the Trump administration appealed any ruling not in their favor. In Illinois that appeal went all the way to the Supreme Court. In all three states, troops remained at the ready for months as the Trump administration waited.

And then, in the final weeks of 2025, there were two major wins for those three states.

Right before Christmas, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, upholding the block on troops in Chicago. That ruling only applied to Illinois, but it was a decision that helped define the law, making it harder for the administration to use that same legal pathway in the future. And on New Year's Eve, Trump announced he would pull troops out of all three states, for now.

But there are still other legal mechanisms the administration could use to deploy the military in U.S. cities, including invoking the Insurrection Act, which Trump has frequently mentioned – including as recently as Thursday, in response to protests in Minneapolis against a surge of federal immigration activity.

That's one reason the democratic attorneys general say they're still busy preparing.

""This is kind of a round that we've won. We're grateful for that. But now we're ready for round two,"" says Bonta.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2F63%2F4c5c5239442e8c142e72c6464000%2Fgettyimages-2219708941-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:37.178730

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero says large-scale ICE operations in other cities are ""spreading fear and chaos in cities across our country."" There's been no federal announcements from federal officials about Tucson-specific operations, but earlier this month, advocates in Phoenix warned of a spike in federal immigration enforcement efforts there.

""The actions that we’ve seen ICE take are hurting innocent people and not making us any safer,"" Romero said Tuesday in a news release. ""The City of Tucson will prioritize community safety and protect the legal and constitutional rights of every Tucsonan regardless of status.""

Romero directed city staff to create an informational website for the public to know their rights. It can be found at: http://tucne.ws/1tqm.

The page includes information on local legal services for immigration, what to do if immigration authorities come to your workplace, family preparedness plans, rights available to those who are arrested or detained and rights for those in the midst of immigration raids.

Similarly, Pima County Attorney Laura Conover asked that Tucsonans avoid ""recklessness"" during interactions with federal immigration agents.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness. And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water,"" Conover said Monday in a statement.

""We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive,"" she said.

Throughout last year, several ICE actions in Tucson have been documented.

In February, three federal agents visited longtime Tucson restaurant La Indita to verify the legal status of its employees, which the owner called an attempt at “intimidation.” In May, an undocumented migrant who has lived in Tucson for over 15 years was arrested by immigration agents outside St. Joseph’s Hospital after his wife said hospital staff extensively questioned a relative whom he was accompanying about his legal status.

In June, an undocumented man from Honduras narrowly avoided being picked up by immigration agents who posed as utility workers.

Plain-clothes immigration agents arrested Tucson physical therapist Vone Phrommany in August due to a non-violent crime he committed 35 years prior, as a teenager. Phrommany was deported to Laos, the country he fled his family at age 6 in the 1970s, after spending three months in immigration detention.

Fear of federal raids in Tucson reached its height in early December, when agents with Homeland Security Investigations arrested 46 people at multiple Taco Giro restaurants in connection to a years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations. Days later, HSI special agents served a search warrant on a Tucson trucking business on West Miracle Mile.

Conover, in her statement, asked residents to ""stay cool, calm, and collected so that you do not rush to judgement and mistake criminal investigations with warrants signed by judges with an 'ICE sweep' that has yet to occur here,"" seemingly referencing the HSI investigation.

But fears of an amped-up federal presence in cities across the nation have hit a fever pitch in the past week, following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer last week.

City and county agencies ""have developed a protocol and response if the National Guard is activated by the president without being requested by the City or the State,"" this week's release said.

""Evidence from activations in other U.S. cities indicates that federalized troops may have been encouraged to engage in security, traffic, and crowd control activities in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" the city says. ""If deployed to Tucson, the City would observe and document such troop activities. The City is prepared to file legal challenges to any improper troop deployment or activity with authorization from Mayor and Council.""

""The Tucson Police Department does not participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws but will respond for the safety of Tucson residents and to keep the peace if protests or demonstrations develop,"" the city says. ""However, federal officials do conduct operations in our city related to drugs, violent crime, human trafficking and other critical issues, and TPD may be involved in these operations.""

The city says that, in the event of a federal deployment to Tucson, a ""Joint Information Center"" or JIC will be established so that communications from the city to residents ""is unified and clear."" If such a deployment happens, the city says it will make ""accurate and timely information"" on the city's website (https://www.tucsonaz.gov), on its social media accounts, including X and Facebook, as well as news conferences live-streamed to the city's YouTube page when needed.

U.S. suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries

In one of the most sweeping immigration actions of his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of State to pause issuance of all new immigrant visas to applicants from 75 countries beginning 21 January 2026. According to a State Department cable reviewed by Reuters, consular officers world-wide have been instructed to deny any immigrant visa that has not yet been printed, even if it was previously approved. The administration says the affected countries—spanning Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe—have high rates of welfare usage among recent immigrants and therefore pose an unacceptable ""public-charge"" risk. (reuters.com)

Trump officials emphasize that the pause does not extend to non-immigrant categories such as B-1/B-2 visitors, H-1B professionals, F-1 students, or J-1 exchange visitors; however, business-travel groups note that the same countries often struggle with long appointment backlogs for those categories, raising concerns about ripple effects on corporate travel. The State Department says it will conduct a “top-to-bottom review” during the pause and may reinstate processing for countries that agree to improved data-sharing on applicants’ tax compliance and proof of financial self-sufficiency.

Immigration attorneys warn that the order could bar roughly 315,000 family- and employment-based immigrants over the next 12 months, disrupting U.S. hiring plans and family-reunification pipelines. Employers that rely on multinational transfer programs worry that the new scrutiny on dependents’ ability to remain off public benefits could lengthen consular reviews and raise the risk of refusals. Several U.S. universities with pipeline programs in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Brazil have already convened emergency webinars to advise affected students who planned to adjust status after graduation.

Amid this uncertainty, specialized visa-service platforms such as VisaHQ can help companies and families audit pending cases, receive real-time policy alerts, and map out alternative filing strategies. Its U.S. portal (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers country-specific checklists and live support that can identify non-immigrant options or adjustment-of-status pathways while the 75-nation freeze remains in effect.

Human-rights advocates point out that the administration’s own data show immigrants use most means-tested benefits at lower per-capita rates than native-born Americans. They predict a rise in green-card applications filed inside the United States—where the public-charge test is administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rather than consular officers—in order to sidestep the freeze. USCIS, however, is already facing historic case-backlogs and fee-funding shortfalls.

For global-mobility managers, the immediate priority is to identify employees or dependents whose immigrant-visa appointments fall on or after 21 January, communicate the risk of cancellation, and, where feasible, convert filings to adjustment-of-status inside the United States. Companies with diversity-hire targets that include talent from the listed countries may need to update workforce-planning models and explore alternative work-visa strategies.

VisaHQ's expert visas and immigration team helps individuals and companies navigate global travel, work, and residency requirements. We handle document preparation, application filings, government agencies coordination, every aspect necessary to ensure fast, compliant, and stress-free approvals.

Children hurt in north Minneapolis protest

What they're saying:

The father, Shawn Jackson, told a FOX 9 reporter at the scene his children were hurt when a flash bang detonated nearby. He says the blasts were strong enough to set off his vehicle's air bags.

""Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car […] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,"" Shawn said, holding up his child’s car seat. ""My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.""

His wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.

Three of children, including the baby, were then taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. All of the children are between 6 months old and 11 years old.

Destiny says they have never gone out to protest, but this incident has given her the drive to do so.

""My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened,"" Destiny said. ""We were just trying to go home.""

The backstory:

Protesters began gathering at the scene of the shooting just minutes after it happened.

A video spread on social media is believed to show the immediate, chaotic aftermath of the shooting, with the man calling 911 to say he was shot in the leg.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.
That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said.
A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.","Tennessee will be the first state to pilot the White House’s immigration agenda, which focuses on increasing verification for legal residents and requiring local law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Republican leadership in the Statehouse partnered with U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and the Justice Department to craft the legislation.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, announced Thursday that the package would require local law enforcement in the state to partner with ICE under the 287(g) program, among other policies.

“Nashville is saying, ‘We’re not working with ICE. … We can’t be a sanctuary city, but we can house them here.’ So, they’re using their ability not to have to work with the federal government … (to) turn a blind eye,” Sexton said.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.

“We’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail,” Sexton said.

Some policies, like making it a crime to live in Tennessee without legal status, would not change much of life for the state’s immigrant communities, said Lisa Sherman Luna with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.

“States have no business in making laws around immigration. That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said. “Immigrant families already face so many barriers in a place like Tennessee. Over the last few decades, so many laws have been passed that make life harder.”

A bill to end the right to a K-12 education for students, regardless of legal status, will be back this year, but lawmakers said they are still waiting on a green light from the federal government.

A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given the potential loss, House leadership paused consideration of the bill after it passed the Senate last year and wrote to the U.S. Department of Education for guidance.

“That’s the biggest question remaining,” said Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixon, who sponsored the bill. “We’re still waiting on the Department of Education at the federal level to send us some guidance from them on what that looks like on funding.”

Requiring schools to verify immigration status will add a host of costs and bureaucratic red tape, Sherman Luna said.

“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business.","Hours before Woodbury city leaders would publicly shut down rumors surrounding a warehouse on Hudson Road, members of Indivisible gathered at Central Park to press for stronger, written opposition to any future Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in the city.

Indivisible, a national grassroots network with more than 1,000 local groups advocating for progressive government, hosted a press conference in the Central Park auditorium ahead of Wednesday night’s City Council meeting.

Before the press conference, Woodbury News Net spoke with Martha Winslow, who leads the St. Croix Valley district of Indivisible and has lived in St. Mary’s Point for 20 years. The organization’s mission, according to Winslow, is to “push back against the current authoritarian regime” and “propose what they want in the future” by “building a forward democracy.”

Winslow has been involved with Indivisible since 2016 and first connected with the group through political organizing while volunteering as a door knocker for a DFL House candidate. She has been retired for nearly seven years.

“This mission is not about a specific building, it’s about providing credible reporting and getting out in front of the federal government by actively addressing the issue to the City Council and asking them to issue more than a Facebook post,” Winslow said.

Winslow added that the group is seeking formal action in the form of official letters and, ultimately, a resolution preventing a detention center from being established in Woodbury. She said such a resolution was unlikely to be adopted Wednesday night but could come within the next month.

Asked how Indivisible’s message differed from recent city statements opposing a detention facility, Winslow said she believed the city’s language may have signaled to residents that attendance at Wednesday’s meeting was unnecessary. She said showing up in large numbers was intended to shift the tone of city officials’ public messaging beyond reassurance.

The press conference opened with Sen. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, a DFL Party member representing Senate District 47, who spoke broadly about the national political climate.

“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I gotta be honest, I don’t recognize today’s world. We are experiencing events that should never happen,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

She closed her remarks by urging calm among Woodbury residents, saying, “Please remember to stay peaceful. Don’t give these bullies what they want. Be kind and look out for one another and know your rights.”

Washington County District 5 Commissioner Michelle Clasen followed, explaining that she had contacted the Washington Post reporter who published the Dec. 24 article listing Woodbury among potential ICE detention sites.

“I received word that this information that they had was more concerning, and as I listened to him speak about it, I realized that there was something that I had heard from the City Council in the past, and that was, we can’t do anything if a building or if a developer wants to come in and build,” Clasen said.

Clasen said she then reviewed Woodbury’s city code and concluded that converting a warehouse into a detention facility would require public hearings and other zoning approvals that would typically go through the city government to get approved. After sharing those findings on Facebook, she said she was told by both a city and county official to remove the post because it was giving “False hope.”

Asked by Woodbury News Net when she first heard the Hudson Road rumor, Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she initially saw it on Reddit days before the Washington Post article was published. Clasen quickly added that the Post reporter did not know the specific location. Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she was not aware of any other rumored sites but added they would “Keep an eye out.”

“I do worry that if it doesn’t work here, they’ll just move on somewhere else, and that is a concern for me too. This doesn’t belong anywhere in any community in Minnesota,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

Residents Fill City Hall

A child psychiatric practitioner, a high schooler, a father of three, a military mom, a resident who has lived in Woodbury for 30 years, a resident who has lived here for one, a Woodbury Planning Commission member, a social worker, a paramedic fire fighter. All walks of life, and nineteen more, approached the City Council on Wednesday night to address their concerns about ICE in the community they call home.

Woodbury’s public forum began at 7:55 p.m. and stretched to 9:04 p.m., exceeding its originally scheduled one-hour limit. Each speaker was given three minutes. All council members were physically present except Kim Wilson, who attended virtually.

The council chamber filled quickly, with residents lining hallways to watch on mounted televisions. An overflow room downstairs met capacity with more gathered outside.

Mayor Anne Burt opened the meeting by reiterating the statement she released earlier in the week confirming that the 11435 Hudson Road location would not be used as a federal detention facility. She adjusted ground rules for the unusually large crowd and spoke about the people, businesses and city staff who make up today’s Woodbury, along with the parks and trails that define the city.

Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Rep. Ethan Cha, also a DFL Party member representing House District 47B, were the first to address the council. Hemmingsen-Jaeger shared accounts she said she has heard from Woodbury residents about ICE activity and fear in the community.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business. It’s bad for our neighbors, and we want them out of Woodbury,” she said.

Cha then shared his family’s history, explaining that his father served the CIA during the war in Laos and that he arrived in the United States as a refugee before becoming a naturalized citizen in the 1990s.

“I’ve served this seat for the last three years, and I will tell you something, that the impact of the ICE presence and activities that has happened in Minnesota since ICE have been here, is an infringement on the American dream,” Cha said.

“We cannot afford to have ICE in our community, and we as a community of Woodbury, are not for sale,” he added.

Cha described fear among immigrant families that they would be deported, including his mother who now avoids grocery stores and public spaces. He said the community is looking to leadership at every level and that the mental health impact is already significant.

Woodbury resident John Phillips was the first non-government speaker to address the council, identifying himself as “Strongly opposed to an ICE facility.”

“The city’s response to this threat to date has been, frankly, inadequate,” Phillips said. “ICE didn’t choose Woodbury just because we’re next to a freeway and we have a big warehouse. They chose us because they see us as weak.”

Another resident, Ryan Ecklund, who has lived in Woodbury for 10 years, described encountering ICE vehicles earlier in the week and choosing to record them, which he said was constitutionally protected. He said he was later boxed in by ICE vehicles, detained and taken to the Whipple Federal Building before being released that evening after asserting his U.S. citizenship.

“By the end of that evening, there were eight other US citizens in the one cell that I was in, again, all of them US citizens unlawfully detained. What I see happening in our community is anxiety and fear, and I think everyone here shares that sentiment,” Ecklund said.

Rocio Foncea, a Woodbury resident since 2017 who immigrated to the United States in 2007, told the council ICE activity reminded her of life under dictatorship.

“I, as well as all the immigrants, work hard. We believe in humanity and the values of this country. This is why we are here,” Foncea said.

After 29 people spoke, council members responded. Council member Jennifer Santini said “I am unsure how to navigate out of the current status quo, because we are working outside legal norms” and encouraged residents to continue speaking up.

“Mr. Eklund is the one that said it about knowing your rights, and that is something I really want you all to be armed with,” Santini said. “I do believe that change is driven by people, so I urge you to continue raising these voices.”

Council member Steve Morris followed, asking residents to look around the room.

“The community is supporting you. The community is supporting each other. And this gives me hope,” Morris said.

“We may not have the power or authority to do everything that you want, but we are here, and we will tell you the truth,” he added.

Council member Donna Stafford said she was “overwhelmed” by the turnout and “almost brought to tears.” She encouraged residents to keep speaking through “kind community gatherings.”

“I grieve with everything going on in this country right now, it’s a very, very difficult time, but we’ve been through them before, and we in our little bubble of Woodbury, we’re going to make it happen because we are good, loving, caring people,” Stafford said.

Wilson spoke last, noting she is often the “odd man out.” She said she agreed “to some aspect” of her colleagues’ viewpoints and emphasized her long-standing support of public safety at every level of government.

“I have been a long supporter of public safety, not only at the local level, but at the county level, state level, and this will also go to the federal level,” Wilson said.

As she continued, her remarks were met with loud boos.

The population of the chamber was cut in half two minutes later.

Wilson closed by saying the city would remain transparent in its actions and that the federal government is above Woodbury.",https://woodburynewsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CityCouncil011426-e1768468940282.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 18:58:49.168371

Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28) has joined more than 70 of her House Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem. Over the past year, Secretary Noem has executed Donald Trump’s violent immigration enforcement agenda that has torn families apart, undermined due process, and violated the most basic constitutional and human rights of people across the country. Last week, one of Secretary Noem’s ICE agents shot 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in the face multiple times, killing her as she attempted to leave the scene.

“Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, ICE has descended into a lawless, violent force with zero accountability. Since day one, Secretary Noem’s ICE agents have terrorized our communities by driving around in unmarked vehicles, covering their faces, refusing to show ID, and recklessly detaining innocent people without due process. The cruelty we are witnessing is not normal, it is not justified, and it is not acceptable in a democracy,” said Rep. Chu. “In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot an American citizen in the face three times as she attempted to leave the scene. In California, ICE agents shot an innocent protestor with a non-lethal weapon, cracked his skull, and dragged him while he was bleeding, leaving him permanently blind in one eye. Secretary Noem is responsible for this violence. She must be held accountable for obstructing Congress, violating the public trust, and using her official position for personal gain. That is why I proudly join my Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Secretary Noem, and I call for her immediate resignation.”

Despite the Trump administration’s cruel and harmful immigration policies, Rep. Chu has continued to use every tool at her disposal to fight back, demand accountability, and advocate for her constituents and immigrant communities in Southern California and across the country.

Last month, Rep. Chu intervened and successfully secured the release of Masuma Khan, who was detained during a routine immigration check despite nearly 30 years in the U.S. and no criminal record. In October, Rep. Chu helped prevent the deportation of Barbara Gomes Marques May, a Brazilian national with no criminal record, after a judge ruled in her favor. In September, Rep. Chu also successfully advocated for the release of Rami Othmane, a Pasadena resident from Tunisia suffering from a brain tumor.

Beyond individual cases, Rep. Chu has introduced and led major legislative and oversight efforts to hold ICE accountable and strengthen protections for immigrant communities, including:

H.R. 4667, Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025

This legislation would increase transparency and accountability by requiring immigration enforcement officers to clearly display visible identification during public enforcement actions, prohibiting non-medical face coverings, and requiring accountability when officers violate the law.

Demanding Oversight and Protections at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center

Following the deaths of Ismael Ayala-Uribe and Gabriel Garcia-Aviles at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, both of whom died after being denied timely and adequate medical care, Reps. Chu and Dave Min (CA-47) led 43 Members of Congress in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE demanding accountability for ICE’s failure to meet basic medical standards, citing the record-high number of deaths in ICE custody that have occurred since Trump took office.

Rep. Chu has conducted multiple oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, even as federal officials have repeatedly and unlawfully attempted to block her access. During visits where she was granted entry, she witnessed deeply disturbing conditions and clear evidence of inhumane and unacceptable treatment of detainees. She will continue to conduct oversight and demand transparency, accountability, and compliance with the law.

Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.

“No one in this country should have to live in fear of their own government, all Americans and immigrant communities deserve dignity, due process, and protection under the law, and I will continue to fight back against policies that terrorize families in Southern California and across this country while demanding accountability from Donald Trump and those who carry out his agenda,” said Rep.

25-00255-3JP (“AGS”), provide some clues about how the trial court will endeavor to implement the Supreme Court’s decision once it is handed down.
On January 14, 2026, the CIT denied the Government’s motion in AGS to adopt certain case management procedures.
The requested procedures largely reflected the CIT’s and parties’ experience in the mass China Section 301 tariff litigation, In Re Section 301 Cases, Ct. No.
The language in the AGS court’s order is highly relevant because with it, the CIT panel is signaling its intent to craft and implement structured case management procedures at a future date, after the SCOTUS decision.","We continue to watch closely for a pronouncement from the U.S. Supreme Court on the lawfulness of the fentanyl trafficking-related and global reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in the consolidated case of Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (“VOS Selections”). Meanwhile, recent interlocutory decisions by the Court of International Trade (CIT) in the consolidated case of AGS Co. Automotive Solutions v. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Ct. No. 25-00255-3JP (“AGS”), provide some clues about how the trial court will endeavor to implement the Supreme Court’s decision once it is handed down.

Filed in November 2025, after the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the VOS Selections case, AGS – and the many cases consolidated under that caption – involves claims by multiple U.S. importers similarly challenging the lawfulness of the IEEPA tariffs. Notably, AGS is pending before the same three-judge panel (Judges Katzmann, Reif, and Restani) that initially decided VOS Selections.

On January 14, 2026, the CIT denied the Government’s motion in AGS to adopt certain case management procedures. As the Government explained in its motion, ​“From October 2025 to the present, over 900 cases have been commenced challenging the IEEPA tariffs,” indicating that case management procedures such as automatic stays, a plaintiffs’ steering committee, a consolidated filing and service mechanism, and a universal stipulation on reliquidation would ease the burden of mass litigation. The requested procedures largely reflected the CIT’s and parties’ experience in the mass China Section 301 tariff litigation, In Re Section 301 Cases, Ct. No. 21-00052-3JP. The CIT panel in AGS declined to adopt the Government’s proposal, although it did so ​“without prejudice,” meaning that parties may file a similar request in the future should circumstances change.

In its paperless order denying the motion, the CIT made two critical statements:

The court confirmed ​“that the Government’s stipulation regarding reliquidation applies to all current and future similarly situated plaintiffs.” This refers to an earlier December 15, 2025, order in AGS in which the CIT denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief in the form of suspended liquidation of entries on which IEEPA tariffs had been assessed. The court concluded there is no irreparable harm to plaintiffs if the affected entries are allowed to liquidate because ​“where jurisdiction {under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)} has attached, this court has authority to order reliquidation, and the Plaintiffs cannot claim that they would be denied a refund of tariffs paid in the event that the challenged Executive Orders are ultimately deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court.” Importantly, the Government stipulated that it will not object to the court ordering reliquidation in the future if the IEEPA tariffs are found to be unlawful, and the CIT held the Government is judicially estopped from claiming otherwise after the Supreme Court decision issues.

Key Takeaway: Setting aside whether non-litigants (i.e., U.S. importers affected by the IEEPA tariffs that do not currently have cases pending before the CIT) will have to file lawsuits in the future to preserve refund rights, the CIT is reiterating that is has the legal authority, acknowledged by the Government, to order reliquidation of entries for purposes of issuing appropriate refunds.

Notably, the CIT’s reference to ​“future similarly situated plaintiffs” indicates that the court will hold the Government’s stipulation to apply to non-litigants that may be plaintiffs in the future – meaning that companies do not need to be current plaintiffs, already having filed a legal action invoking the court’s 1581(i) jurisdiction, to be eligible for an order of reliquidation if appropriate following the Supreme Court’s decision.

The court explained that it ​“will implement additional case management procedures as may be necessary following a final, unappealable decision in V.O.S.”

Key Takeaway: There has been wide speculation as to exactly what the mechanism will look like for affected importers to obtain refunds should the Supreme Court hold any aspect of the IEEPA tariffs to be unlawful. That could vary widely, from an administrative application process designed and driven by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to a court-ordered application process, to an automatic refund mechanism, to litigation by individual importers. The path forward will likely depend on the nuances of the outcome in VOS Selections and how the Government (including CBP), current litigants, and CIT approach a solution, and if it is one that is universally applicable.

The language in the AGS court’s order is highly relevant because with it, the CIT panel is signaling its intent to craft and implement structured case management procedures at a future date, after the SCOTUS decision. While there is still significant uncertainty as to exactly what that will look like, it is now reasonable to expect the court will offer guidance and rules to thoughtfully address and manage litigation to the extent it is necessary – it will not be a ​“free for all” if the court can avoid it.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15522_2552.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:24.974313

In the Chicago Headline Club case, Ellis issued an injunction that limited agents’ use of force.
He said Thursday that state and city attorneys had not met their burden to move the case.
But Vikas Didwania, an attorney for the state of Illinois, said the two lawsuits featured significant overlap, as they both arose after federal agents “lawlessly ramapaged” through streets of Chicago.
Ellis is expected to rule on their motion for voluntary dismissal at a Jan. 22 hearing.","A federal judge who implemented a sweeping injunction limiting federal immigration agents’ use of force will now oversee a new lawsuit brought this week by the city of Chicago and state of Illinois over the government’s allegedly illegal immigration enforcement tactics.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis on Thursday granted a motion from city and state attorneys who sought to reassign their case — which was slated to be heard by Judge Georgia Alexakis — to Ellis, given the case’s extensive similarities to another lawsuit in her courtroom brought by the Chicago Headline Club.

“Both of these cases involve many of the same issues of fact and law and they grow out of the same transaction or occurrence,” Ellis said at a hearing Thursday.

The new lawsuit includes broader claims than the Headline Club case, which largely centered on First Amendment violations by federal agents who deployed tear gas, pepper balls and other weapons against journalists and protesters during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement operation.

The sweeping 103-page lawsuit claims that Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — who have conducted numerous aggressive raids in and around Chicago since “Midway Blitz” began in September — have acted as “occupiers” rather than law enforcement.

But the two cases do include many of the same use-of-force incidents, and Ellis on Thursday noted that she’s already spent “countless hours” holding hearings and reviewing videos and transcripts covering the same issues.

In the Chicago Headline Club case, Ellis issued an injunction that limited agents’ use of force. But that injunction was put on hold by an appeals court, and attorneys representing the plaintiffs in that case have since moved to voluntarily withdraw their lawsuit.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is named as a defendant in both lawsuits, previously slammed that injunction as an “extreme act” and labeled Ellis as an “activist judge.”

That process is not yet finalized, but the case could be withdrawn as soon as next week.

Peter Goldstone, an attorney for the federal government, argued that the two lawsuits are premised on significantly different theories, causes of action and legal bases, adding also that the cases themselves are at “diametrically opposite phases” of their litigation life cycle.

He said Thursday that state and city attorneys had not met their burden to move the case.

But Vikas Didwania, an attorney for the state of Illinois, said the two lawsuits featured significant overlap, as they both arose after federal agents “lawlessly ramapaged” through streets of Chicago.

He said that because Ellis is already intimately familiar with these incidents from “Operation Midway Blitz,” it would be a matter of improving “judicial economy” by reassigning the case to her courtroom.

Ellis agreed, over objections from the government.

“In other words,” she said, “the court is already up to speed on many of the facts and issues that will arise in the state and city case.”

Attorneys for the Chicago Headline Club did not oppose the motion to reassign the case. Ellis is expected to rule on their motion for voluntary dismissal at a Jan. 22 hearing.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:29.343562

While this raises the possibility that the tariffs could ultimately be invalidated, a business’s right to a refund would not be automatic. Businesses affected by the tariffs may therefore wish to consider steps to preserve their ability to recover import duties paid if the tariffs are struck down.

The Supreme Court Case & Related Litigation

The Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, with the Justices expressing skepticism over the legality of the tariffs. Even if the Court ultimately strikes down the tariffs, businesses may not be entitled to an automatic refund for import duties already paid.

Multiple businesses have now filed follow-on lawsuits in the Court of International Trade to protect their rights in the event the Supreme Court invalidates the IEEPA tariffs. These lawsuits follow the existing challenge in V.O.S. Selections and related challenges involving tariffs imposed on goods from countries such as India and Brazil.

How Import Duties Are Finalized

When a business imports goods into the United States, the importer pays an estimated duty on entry based on its customs declaration. Customs and Border Protection reviews and finalizes the entry, notifying the importer of record whether additional duties are owed or whether the importer is entitled to a refund. This process, known as liquidation, must generally occur within one year, although Customs and Border Protection typically seeks to liquidate duties approximately 314 days after the date of entry.

Why Liquidation Matters

If an importer protests the amount paid, it must do so within 180 days, asking Customs and Border Protection to “reliquidate” the duties. However, there are some circumstances in which a business cannot protest an entry’s liquidation, such as when Customs and Border Protection acts in a purely ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion). The risk of liquidation is the basis for recent lawsuits filed in the Court of International Trade, as companies seek to enjoin the federal government from imposing and enforcing any tariffs under the IEEPA and to recover any duties paid on the allegedly unlawful tariffs.

In recent filings, the Government has indicated that it is willing to treat similarly situated plaintiffs in similar ways, but that approach may require a proper challenge filed in court to prevent liquidation or to obtain an order requiring reliquidation.

Important Considerations for Businesses

Businesses that have paid import duties on challenged tariffs should consult with a lawyer, as even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, refunds may not be automatic, and importers may lack the ability to recover duties on already-liquidated entries if no action is taken.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15560_510.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:34.137083

ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda.","Protests directed against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may appear, on the surface, to be a debate over immigration policy. In reality, however, they carry a far deeper political and international significance. These protests are not merely objections concerning the status of undocumented migrants. They constitute part of a broader struggle over the relationship between security and the state, human rights norms and America’s claim to global leadership. Rather than viewing these protests solely as reactions confined to U.S. domestic politics, they should also be read as symptoms reflecting the transformation of the global order.

As the second Trump administration approaches the end of its first year, it is evident that collective anxiety, fear and frustration regarding the increasingly authoritarian trajectory of Washington are intensifying.

Foundations of protests

At the core of the protests lies the question of how rights are defined. The primary dynamic here consists of allegations of human rights violations. Conditions in detention centers, the separation of children from their families and limited access to legal procedures create an explicit contradiction with the liberal norms that the U.S. itself claims to uphold. Yet criticism of ICE practices is directed not only at the severity of procedures but also at the linkage of rights to citizenship status. The exclusion of migrants from full legal processes produces a practice that effectively suspends the idea of the universality of rights.

The second fundamental dynamic is the politicization of identity. The concentration of ICE practices on specific ethnic and geographical groups transforms immigration policy from a technical security issue into a debate over social hierarchy. Inequalities based on race, ethnicity and class are reproduced through the immigration regime. Although the protesters’ reaction is directed at a specific institution, it is, in essence, a response to the state’s systematic coding of certain bodies as permanently ""suspect,” ""temporary” or ""undesirable.”

The third, and often overlooked, dimension concerns the global origins of inequality. Evaluating ICE protests solely as a crisis occurring within U.S. borders obscures the structural conditions that give rise to migration. A significant portion of migrants are on the move due to factors such as instability, economic deprivation and violence – factors that are often the product of global power relations, interventionist policies and unjust economic orders. The protests question a security-centered approach that focuses only on the final link of this chain. Viewed more deeply, it is not difficult to recognize that these protests also reflect a reaction to the U.S.’ globally interventionist and destabilizing policies. The emphasis on Venezuela and Iran by certain groups stems precisely from this perspective.

Democracy under stress

One of the most visible effects of this process is the questioning of the extent to which the expansion of state authority justified by security concerns aligns with social consent. Reactions to ICE practices are directed not only at deportation or detention itself but also at the political logic through which these practices are legitimized. The more dominant security discourse becomes in the public sphere, the stronger the perception that democratic oversight mechanisms are being weakened.

Another critical dimension for democracy is the renewed debate over freedom of expression. Anti-ICE demonstrations render visible both the boundaries of the right to protest and the state’s approach to this right. In some cases, harsh police interventions or the criminalization of protests undermine society’s sense of security while simultaneously forcing the system to reassert its legitimacy.

In this context, tensions between the federal structure and local governments acquire particular significance. ""Sanctuary city” practices have raised the question of whether immigration policy should be treated as a centralized security issue or as part of local social order. Officials in the states of Minnesota and Illinois filed two separate lawsuits in federal court against the federal government, arguing that the deployment of thousands of immigration officers in metropolitan areas violated states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states the right to protect the health, safety and welfare of their residents. This challenge, pursued both through protest and legal channels, also reveals the flexibility and multilayered nature of American federalism. The protests serve as a reminder that this multilayered structure constitutes not a site of conflict, but a space for negotiation.

ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda. Reports concerning detention centers, problems of access to judicial processes, and the lack of transparency raise serious questions regarding oversight of the executive branch. The protests remind both the legislative and judicial branches of their roles in this area, emphasizing that the separation of powers is not merely a constitutional principle but a living political practice. Moreover, the U.S. government’s failure to effectively oversee the actions of ICE agents and the arbitrariness of enforcement practices have led courts to abandon the presumption of accuracy traditionally granted to government-provided information.

Erosion of normative power

The most enduring impact of protests against ICE is observed not only in the domestic political balance of the U.S. but also in the erosion of its legitimacy at the global level. If the U.S. has long been able to exert influence beyond its military and economic capacity, this has largely stemmed from its ability to present its own values as universal norms. However, harsh practices surrounding the immigration regime and the protests they have triggered are increasingly calling this normative claim into question.

One of the fundamental pillars of U.S. foreign policy has been the relative consistency between principles defended domestically and behaviors demanded internationally. Human rights, the rule of law and individual freedoms occupy a central place in this discourse. Yet debates surrounding ICE practices reinforce the perception that the U.S. applies these principles conditionally, even within its own borders. As protests render this conditionality visible, the U.S. capacity to function as a global ""model” correspondingly weakens.

This weakening manifests not so much as a loss of power in the classical sense, but as an erosion of the ability to persuade. States are effective not only through coercive means but also to the extent that they can generate the consent of others. The international resonance of ICE protests demonstrates that U.S. criticism of other countries on migration and human rights issues is no longer perceived as convincing as it once was. Concerns are growing that regimes exhibiting authoritarian tendencies may exploit these contradictions in the U.S. to legitimize their own practices.

When the contribution of U.S. economic, political and at times military interventions to the structural conditions driving migration is recalled, harsh border policies are perceived not merely as security measures but as an evasion of responsibility. This perception quietly yet profoundly erodes the U.S. claim to regional leadership. To compensate for this erosion, Washington may feel compelled to demonstrate even greater power, potentially including the use of force.

For this reason, the ""erosion of normative power” should be treated not as a temporary image problem but as a strategic issue. ICE protests serve as a reminder to the U.S.: defending the values of the global order does not legitimize abandoning those values within one’s own borders. Otherwise, claims to leadership quietly but decisively slip away.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2026/01/15/thumbs/800x531/421938.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 19:58:01.228497

Court records indicate Jose Yugar-Cruz, 36, entered the United States in July 2024 after fleeing his home country of Bolivia. In court filings, Yugar-Cruz alleged that while living in Bolivia, he operated a small business and had “refused to facilitate the drug trade by police officials” who then detained him and tortured him.

In the court filings, Yugar-Cruz said he fled to Mexico, entered the United States on foot at the Arizona border, and then “sought out and surrendered” himself to federal immigration officials. He was then taken into custody and jailed, after which he applied for asylum based on the threat of persecution in Bolivia.

In December 2024, a federal immigration judge held a hearing on Yugar-Cruz’s asylum request. According to a lawsuit Yugar-Cruz filed four weeks ago against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the judge ruled in January 2025 that the U.S. government could not send Yugar-Cruz back to Bolivia due to the ongoing threat of torture.

The judge granted Yugar-Cruz “withholding-of-removal relief” — a form of protection for individuals who face persecution if returned to their home country. It prevents the U.S. government from deporting an individual to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.

In his lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz asserted the government never appealed the immigration judge’s ruling and so he “expected that he would soon be released from detention and allowed to start his life in the United States.”

In February 2025, however, Yugar-Cruz was still being held in the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center in Albert Lea, Minn. While there, the lawsuit claimed, he spoke to ICE officials who first indicated he’d be released in “15 days or so,” but later informed him they would continue to hold him while looking for some third-party country to which he could be deported.

The lawsuit alleged ICE officials proposed that Yugar-Cruz be deported to Argentina, Chile or Paraguay, all of which border Bolivia, but Yugar-Cruz objected, noting that Bolivians, including the police, can easily travel to those countries without a passport. Mexico was proposed as an alternative, but Yugar-Cruz expressed concern officials there would simply deport him to Bolivia.

Lawsuit cites Trump policy on deportations

On Dec. 3, 2025, Yugar-Cruz was transferred from the Albert Lea jail to the Muscatine County Jail in Iowa.

Nine days later, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney sued the Muscatine County jail administrator, as well as Noem and other Homeland Security officials, alleging they were violating federal law by continuing to detain Yugar-Cruz 11 months after the immigration judge had ruled in his favor.

As part of that lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney noted the Trump administration had adopted a practice of deporting people to third-party countries with no guarantee those individuals wouldn’t immediately be sent to their home country, where they faced persecution or torture.

A federal judge in the District of Columbia has ruled the practice amounts to a “widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”

In recent months, the administration has deported at least 20 individuals to Eswatini and other African nations where they’ve reportedly been jailed indefinitely at maximum-security prisons without charges and without access to legal counsel.

None of the individuals originated from those African countries. They had been convicted of crimes in the United States, but had served their sentences and were released before being detained by ICE and then deported over the objections of human rights organizations.

Yugar-Cruz has no criminal record, according to his attorney’s court filings. His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.

Recently, after the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged the federal government had been attempting, without success, to find a third-party country to accept Yugar-Cruz, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher ruled in Yugar-Cruz’s favor.

Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.

His release remains subject to “reasonable conditions of supervision” by ICE, according to Locher’s order.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gavel-scales-book-_-Witthaya-Prasongsin-Getty-RF-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:35.211200

The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.
The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents.
Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025.","The city of Bend drafted a new policy outlining its pushback to federal immigration officers should they attempt to make arrests or stage operations on city property.

The policy, set to be adopted by the city manager’s office in the coming days, condemns what the city calls “indiscriminate and increasingly violent, and likely unlawful” civil immigration enforcement tactics taking place in Oregon and across the country. It designates high-ranking city staff as the authority to tell federal agents to leave city property, and if that doesn’t work to call the police.

The policy essentially clarifies how Bend would comply with Oregon sanctuary laws in the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bend City Attorney Ian Leitheiser said during a Wednesday meeting of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission. State law prohibits local jurisdictions from participating in ICE operations, including “ investigating, detecting, apprehending, arresting, detaining or holding individuals.”

“We can’t stop an ICE agent from using a parking lot that’s available for the public to park their car, but we can stop them from using that parking lot for staging, operating, doing other things related to immigration enforcement,” Leitheiser said.

The city’s real estate director, Matt Stuart, is one of the staff who could be tasked with confronting ICE, along with the city manager or potentially a department head. Stuart said he would approach officers and “let them know what state law says, what our policy says, and if they don’t want to comply, we’ll be contacting our local law enforcement.”

Stuart says there are relatively few city properties where immigration enforcement is likely to occur, but those could include parking lots or lobbies at city hall or the public works campus.

The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.

The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents. Federal agents recently shot four people in three separate incidents in the span of a week: the killing of U.S. Citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, the shooting of two Venezuelan immigrants in Portland a day later and Wednesday’s shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis. The federal government has said officers were acting in self-defense.

The violence sparked protests across the country, including in Bend.

“With the way we are witnessing federal immigration officers terrorizing communities and not following the law, it’s important for us to be clear about what our policy is,” Kebler said in an interview on Thursday morning.

The number of people in immigration detention has hit record highs under President Donald Trump. Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025. Frank described reports of “forceful tactics” from other parts of the state, including break-ins and racial profiling, while mentioning the first shooting in Minneapolis.

“The reality is that while we don’t know when these operations will reach Central Oregon, all signs indicate that they will,” Frank said.

The nonprofit asked the city for funding and support to help people who are fearful of deportations and ICE activity in Central Oregon. Frank asked Bend to join other cities across Oregon in declaring a state of emergency over heightened immigration enforcement.

Kebler said the city council will discuss the topic at its next meeting, and either declare an emergency or draft some kind of support resolution.

Agatha Ventura, a staff member at Central Oregon Community College and chair of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission, said she’s encouraged by the city’s commitment to sanctuary law, but also hopes for more support in the case that ICE should detain someone illegally.

“I don’t think any of us are safe at this stage,” Ventura said. “I hope our leadership is also planning for when other measures have to be taken and how people will be supported, the practical ways people can be supported in worst case scenarios.”",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/cf9aa97bf9e104eaf2d7d761f0895fa2-copy.jpg?w=640,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:39.617168

President Donald Trump, on the first day of his second term, issued an executive order instructing federal agencies to recognize only a person's sex assigned at birth. It disregarded the concept of gender identity as a ""false claim,"" dismissing the self-identification of any individual who does not conform to the administration's definition of sex.

The administration now says states and other entities that don't comply with that executive order will be ineligible for billions of dollars in federal grant funding allocated through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for health education in public schools, medical research and workforce development programs that train medical professionals on topics including rural health, addiction treatment and senior health.

Illinois, for example, allows its residents to change the sex on their birth certificate by signing a statement affirming their gender designation or intersex condition.

In their lawsuit, the states called the latest Trump directive ""a novel and ambiguous funding condition.""

""Everyone deserves to live authentically, and I will continue to push back against the administration's repeated and cruel attempts to erase transgender Americans.""

Trump's order further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

In their lawsuit, the states alleged the administration's purpose was ""to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Title IX

HHS has long required states to certify compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the landmark civil rights law passed to prevent sex discrimination in federally funded education programs, including in sports.

The new condition, however, compels states to adhere not only to Title IX requirements, but also to the Trump order. States argued HHS does not have the authority to impose new requirements on congressionally allocated spending.

""Congress has funded these programs without any requirement to exclude entities that recognize transgender, nonbinary, intersex or gender diverse individuals,"" the states wrote.

The states argued that, due to the vagueness of the order, HHS's new condition would also potentially open them up to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act, a federal statute that makes it illegal to knowingly present a false or fraudulent claim when applying for federal funds. Even if they wanted to comply, states said, there are not clear guidelines to do so.

The order, states argued, is inconsistent with other official HHS policies. The website for HHS's own Office for Civil Rights as of Wednesday afternoon outlined past Supreme Court decisions which established precedent for the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

""OCR will interpret Section 1557's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and (2) discrimination on the basis of gender identity,"" the website states.

Compliance with the federal order would also put Illinois in violation of the state's Human Rights Act, which provides protections against gender-based discrimination in employment, housing and schools.

The states have asked the court to find the HHS policy unlawful and block its enforcement.

A pattern of threats

The administration has made a pattern of threatening to withhold funds to punish Democrat-led states like Illinois that do not fall in line with federal policies on issues from gender-affirming care to immigration protections.

Illinois joined a separate multi-state lawsuit in August seeking to block Trump's executive orders that prohibited gender-affirming care for young people, and another in December that threatened Medicaid and Medicare funding for hospitals providing the care.

It further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

The order's purpose, the states alleged, ""is to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Raoul has won other similar suits against the Trump administration, including over a Trump order which directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to withhold federal emergency funding from Illinois over the state's immigration laws. A judge ruled in September that it was unconstitutional for federal agencies to withhold disaster relief funding simply because a state's laws differ from federal ones.

This week, the state sued the feds alleging that their aggressive immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region is part of an ""organized bombardment"" of the state aimed at forcing capitulation on immigration policies.

The December lawsuit challenging the administration's regulations on Medicare and Medicaid put implementation of the policy on hold, at least until mid-April while the case is ongoing.

The administration has demonstrated, though, that it will not hesitate to pull funds.

Late Tuesday night, the administration cut an estimated $2 billion in funding nationwide for nonprofit groups that provide health services to people experiencing addiction, homelessness and mental health challenges.

A letter announcing the change said federal officials ""no longer believe the defunded programs align with the Trump administration's priorities,"" according to NPR.

“Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn’t like,” Crow said in a statement.
The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence.
The lawmakers had encountered an earlier round of federal interest in November, when FBI agents approached congressional security officials seeking interviews.
Four of the House members responded with a joint statement accusing Trump of deploying the bureau “as a tool to intimidate and harass” the lawmakers.","Three House Democrats confirmed on Wednesday they have been approached by federal prosecutors investigating their participation in a November video about military duty, widening the circle of legislators being targeted by the Trump administration.

Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania disclosed that the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, had requested interviews about the 90-second video in which they said troops don’t need to comply with illegal orders.

“Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn’t like,” Crow said in a statement. “Now he’s pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable. I won’t be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country.”

Goodlander framed the government’s response as alarming and instructive.

“No matter the threats, I am not backing down,” she said in a video posted on X. “It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the president, our commander in chief, to threaten violence against me, and to weaponize the Department of Justice.”

Goodlander added that she once served in the Department of Justice and she knew “that federal prosecutors have more control over the life and liberty of the American people than any other peacetime force”.

The announcements bring the number of lawmakers who have publicly confirmed contact with federal prosecutors to five, after the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin’s revelation on Tuesday that she was under investigation. The Pentagon secretary, Pete Hegseth, formally censured the Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a retired navy captain, in January and launched administrative proceedings that could result in rank reduction and pension cuts. Kelly has responded with litigation, arguing the Pentagon’s actions violate constitutional protections.

The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence. In it, they reminded service members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey illegal commands – a principle regularly taught in military training.

Trump said the message was “seditious” and floated the possibility of capital punishment, though he subsequently walked back the death penalty reference while insisting the lawmakers remained in serious jeopardy. Everyone in the video – which also included the Pennsylvania representative Chris Deluzio – have now been contacted by either the FBI or federal prosecutors regarding their message to service members.

“By sending the FBI and now DoJ after Rep Deluzio and the other members of Congress who stated the law in a recent video, it’s obvious that this administration is engaged in a harassment campaign against their political rivals,” Deluzio spokesperson Zoe Bluffstone said. “Congressman Deluzio won’t be intimidated and will keep doing the job he was elected to do.”

Houlahan suggested the investigation’s true motivation was stifling political speech. “The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn’t want anyone to hear,” she told NBC News in a statement.

The federal targeting represents an extraordinary use of prosecutorial power against sitting legislators for protected political speech. According to Crow’s office, Pirro’s office reached out last week seeking an interview about the video.

Government watchdog groups have condemned the investigations as authoritarian overreach. David Janovsky, acting director of the constitution project at the project on government oversight, described the prosecutions as an assault on constitutional principles. “A sitting president attempting to prosecute his political opponents just for saying something he disagrees with is a hallmark of authoritarianism,” he said in a statement.

But three times, ICE documented a suspect’s body, described as “hands/feet/body,” as a weapon.
Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable.
An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.","When Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last Wednesday morning in Minneapolis, the 37-year-old mother became one of at least 25 people killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shooting since 2015.

In the days after Ross fired at Good multiple times from the front and side of Good’s car, visual investigations from outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post have reconstructed the event, which unfolded in a matter of seconds, combing through a series of videos that emerged from various angles. These present apparent contradictions between the narrative presented by the White House and Department of Homeland Security, which claims Ross acted in self-defense, and what actually happened.

But similar contradictions haven’t previously led to criminal indictments in ICE agent shootings. In fact, there does not appear to have ever been a criminal indictment stemming from an ICE shooting at all.

I spent four years investigating ICE shootings that occurred from 2015 to 2021, over the course of three presidential administrations. I sued ICE for the logs of all of these shootings—a lawsuit that took two years to be settled—and cross-analyzed them with media reports, lawsuits, over 40 interviews with experts, shooting victims, families, and lawyers, and 20 other Freedom of Information Act requests for law enforcement investigation reports across the United States to piece together what happened and what patterns they revealed.

Not counting the Good shooting, ICE agent shootings have involved moving vehicles at least 19 times—which are connected to at least 10 deaths and six injuries. Task forces including ICE agents have shot at least three other US citizens. They have shot in public areas with bystanders 22 times. And in at least seven cases, the person shot by an ICE officer was not the target of the enforcement action.

The Same Defense

The self-defense claim ICE, its agents, or their lawyers have made after shootings has historically been proven impossible to refute. An agent using deadly force does so justifiably when it is “objectively reasonable and necessary,” ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez told me in an email in 2024.

“A law enforcement officer placing himself or herself in front of a motor vehicle to prevent a suspect's potential avenue of escape is a dangerous tactic and a potential violation of policy,” Mike German, a former federal law enforcement agent, tells WIRED. “But I don't think that would be likely to impact a prosecutor's evaluation of whether the officer has a reasonable fear at the time he pulled the trigger that he was in a life-threatening situation justifying deadly force.”

This reasonableness standard is what a city, state, or federal agency would assess when deciding whether to indict an agent for any criminal activity, and it’s evaluated from the perspective of a law enforcement official, not a layperson, German explains.

“Prosecutors and judges tend to be very deferential to law enforcement agents involved in shootings,” German says. “Typically, an agent's subjective belief that deadly force was necessary to protect themselves, or the safety of another person, from serious bodily harm is enough to avoid criminal charges, or conviction if charged.”

Sometimes suspects were seen to have guns, according to the ICE logs I obtained, particularly in the course of Homeland Security Investigations. But three times, ICE documented a suspect’s body, described as “hands/feet/body,” as a weapon.

And in at least a dozen cases, I uncovered evidence suggesting that the shooting victims were unarmed.

Federal agent-involved shooting investigations conducted by the Justice Department rarely result in criminal charges, and the results are rarely released publicly, German says. “The bottom line is that these shooting investigations very rarely find the agent in violation of law or policy.”

Besides self-defense, ICE agents, like all federal agents, are largely protected by qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects them from civil lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of the duty. In recent years, two Supreme Court cases involving an immigration agent shooting and physical injury, Mesa v. Hernandez (2020) and Egbert v. Boule (2022), further cemented any private citizen’s inability to sue federal agents for harm.

The All-Clear

Determining whether criminal charges are warranted is the responsibility of a state or local law enforcement agency—most often the state attorney general’s office—and/or from a federal agency investigating, like the FBI. Both federal and municipal bodies can prosecute separately, at the same time, according to their own policies, and do not have to defer to one another.

But on Thursday, just one day after Ross shot Good, Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) “reluctantly” withdrew from the joint investigation with the FBI after the US Attorney’s Office said the FBI would be the sole investigator and would no longer grant the BCA access to the case materials, scene evidence, or investigative interviews.

The US attorney general pushing the BCA out of the joint investigation, though, doesn’t prevent the Minnesota Attorney General or the Hennepin County Attorney’s office from conducting their own homicide investigation.

In a press conference on January 9, both offices asked residents and witnesses to submit evidence in the Hennepin County Attorney evidence submission portal. The county attorney, Mary Moriarty, said the office has received hundreds of calls and emails to open an independent investigation. Across its social pages, the county attorney’s office didn’t confirm that it would do that and instead said the office “stands ready” to assist the FBI.

Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable. “So carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take that phone out and record,” Walz said in Wednesday’s address. “Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans—not just to establish a record for posterity but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

The Hennepin County Attorney’s office didn’t respond to an email asking whether it plans to open an investigation.

Local agencies backing out has precedent. There have been shootings in the past that may have gone uninvestigated due to alleged confusion on jurisdiction between state and federal agencies.

In a February 2018 shooting in Dumfries, Virginia, an ICE agent who was a member of a US Marshals fugitive task force killed an unarmed man by shooting him in the back as he was fleeing arrest. The commonwealth’s attorney’s office began to investigate but stopped before it finished, saying it lacked jurisdiction over federal agents. But even though it didn’t weigh in on an indictment, the office wrote in an opinion that the federal agent enjoyed immunity from state prosecution.

Like in Minneapolis last week, the case was solely in the FBI’s hands, and the commonwealth’s attorney’s office confirmed that it gave the bureau its collected investigative material. But the FBI neither confirmed nor denied my query about whether that investigation took place.

An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.

In September 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee, a deportation agent shot at a man through the window of his truck twice as he pulled out of a grocery store parking lot at around 7 am local time. An ICE spokesperson told reporters the man behind the wheel drove toward the agents. But video footage obtained by a local TV station showed that the truck was parked when the ICE agents drove up and that the agent raised his hand—presumably with a gun—and chased the truck pulling away. The FBI was tasked with investigating the ICE’s agent’s allegation that the driver assaulted him. The driver, who surrendered to the FBI and was later arrested by ICE, was later released from custody.

The results of the inquiry by the FBI, the sole investigating agency in the case, were never made public.

“The problem is that these federal shooting investigations often take a long, long time and are rarely publicly reported when they conclude, so the passage of time dampens the public demand for accountability,” German, the former federal law enforcement agent says.

State and local law enforcement agencies have consistently cleared agents of wrongdoing after shootings even when they have hindered investigations, which happened three times across Arizona and California between 2015 and 2021.

In 2018 in Scottsdale, Arizona, an ICE investigator shot a man multiple times—the last bullet was fired after the man was already on the ground—and the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office found that he disregarded protocol by not remaining on the scene to give a statement. (He eventually gave one six days later.) That he fired his gun violated other protocols, and prosecutors found that his conduct could “justify further investigatory steps” but still cleared him.

In 2016 in Chula Vista, California, an ICE agent advised a colleague who killed a 22-year-old by shooting him four times within 10 seconds not to cooperate with the investigation, according to a transcript of the body-wire recording obtained by the victim’s family and published as part of a lawsuit. “Don’t worry about it,” he told him. “Remember … no statements. None of that shit.”

The lawyer who represented the family in a lawsuit that was dismissed said the agents were questioned, but the Chula Vista Police Department report did not include any details of the investigation. The agents’ lawyers did not respond to WIRED’s queries about the case.

Out of Sight

If an incident is potentially criminal, the DHS Inspector General’s Office might review it. But ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility will always investigate a shooting for policy violations, and, lacking authority to issue discipline, will make disciplinary recommendations if it deems them necessary, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Report looking into DHS use-of-force policies.

Any suggestion on disciplinary measures goes back to the agent’s supervisor, who can decide whether to administer it. And even when disciplinary action is applied, an ICE officer can appeal that decision. It can take years for discipline to actually be issued, if it ever is.

Gretta Goodwin, the author of the GAO report, found that ICE’s data collection lacked any path forward for review. In some use-of-force reviews, she said in an interview in 2023, ICE documented incidents but didn’t document whether they were in accordance with policy.

“They wrote it down, but as far as we know they did no follow up,” Goodwin said.

As for the outcome, Goodwin said she saw some disciplinary actions but didn’t learn the frequency of them.

“We did see that people were reprimanded, suspended,” she said. “I don’t know if anyone got fired.”

The GAO reviewed the DHS use-of-force practices in 2023 as part of a 2022 Executive Order on police reform for federal law enforcement bodies.

For more than a decade, ICE agents operated under an interim use-of-force policy from 2004, which the DHS Inspector General’s Office said was outdated and didn’t incorporate lessons learned since its establishment.

ICE confirmed that it had created a new use-of-firearms and use-of-force policy in 2023, which appear to be the most recent guidelines, following the executive order. But it refused to release it when I had requested it in 2024, telling me in an email that the policies had “not been published for public view.” ICE later published it with everything except the “purpose” redacted.

Like its use-of-force policies, the results of ICE’s internal investigations are not made public.

ICE did not respond to queries about whether the policy has since been updated, nor to release an unredacted version, nor to confirm the number of deaths by shootings.

Presidential Protection

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said Good was involved in an act of “domestic terrorism,” but J. Wells Dixon, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, calls the claim “baseless” and believes that this allegation doesn’t hold any weight in an investigation or prosecution.

“The Constitution applies to and constrains the application of all state and federal criminal statutes,” Dixon tells WIRED.

Dixon is of the opinion that “Secretary Noem obviously lied when she claimed Renee Good was a ‘domestic terrorist’ in order to denigrate her and suggest—falsely—that she somehow deserved to be murdered by a masked ICE agent.”

Plans to shield ICE agents are ongoing in the Trump administration. According to recent reporting by Zeteo, President Trump had instructed officials in his administration as early as last year to protect ICE agents, including 12,000 new recruits, accused of crimes.

During a White House press briefing on January 8, Vice President JD Vance said agents have “absolute immunity,” a new term with no legal background.","https://media.wired.com/photos/696120e39c539b8af2cca8f5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sec-ice-murderers-2254509191.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 17:58:14.247984

However, the tool allegedly mistakenly flagged applicants as qualified based on resume keywords such as “officer,” misidentifying titles like “compliance officer” or those expressing an aspiration to join ICE as equivalent to prior law enforcement experience.

As a result, officials said many applicants were routed into the shorter online training program without meeting the necessary background requirements. It remains unclear how many were improperly trained or deployed before the mistake was caught.

Parents Ask Supreme Court to Restore Ruling on Gender Disclosure (Mark Walsh, Education Week) — A group of California parents has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit blocked “a federal district court decision that said parents have a federal constitutional right to be informed by schools of any gender nonconformity and social transition by their children,” according to Education Week. The 9th Circuit panel said that the district court’s decision was “too ‘sweeping’ and ‘ambiguous’ and likely wrong on the merits,” and the panel “reinstated a mandate by the California Department of Education that restrains teachers and district staff members from informing parents about a child’s gender identity at school, unless the child consents.”

Louisiana Indicts Another Out-of-State Doctor Over Abortion Pills (Emily Cochrane and Pam Belluck, The New York Times)(Paywall) — As part of their broader push to limit abortion in the state, “Louisiana officials on Tuesday moved to extradite a California doctor the state indicted on a charge of providing abortion pills to a Louisiana resident,” according to The New York Times. Cases like these over abortion pill prescriptions are part of a new wave of legal battles over abortion that emerged after “the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the national right to abortion in 2022.” Legal experts expect that the court may soon need to address “whether states are required to honor one another’s abortion laws.”

‘When did I do that?’ Trump says about $2,000 tariff dividend checks (Mike Snider, USA Today) — During a recent interview with The New York Times, President Donald Trump appeared surprised to be asked about his previous comments on sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to American families, according to USA Today. Since July, Trump has repeatedly pitched sending such checks out by mid-2026, but he now says his administration would need more time than that. “I’ll be able to do $2,000 sometime. I would say toward the end of the year,” the president said. According to the interview transcript, Trump also said that he plans to impose new tariffs through “some other alternative” if the Supreme Court strikes down the current tariffs.

No, ICE Agents Do Not Have ‘Absolute Immunity’ From State Prosecution (Damon Root, Reason) — In a column for Reason, Damon Root responded to Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent claim that “the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis cannot be prosecuted for it by Minnesota officials” because, as a federal law enforcement officer engaged in federal action, he is protected by “absolute immunity.” According to Root, “the precedent is not actually so simple.” In a 1906 case called Drury v. Lewis, the court rejected “a Vance-like argument that called for shielding” officers “from any and all state prosecution,” holding that courts can review disputes “over lawful versus unlawful use of force.”

How the Supreme Court May Untangle the Tariff Knot (Dan McLaughlin, National Review)(Paywall) — In a column for the National Review, Dan McLaughlin offered some predictions about the court’s highly anticipated ruling in the tariffs case. He expects the justices to strike down the tariffs but believes “it’s very possible that the Court fractures along multiple lines in saying no.” He also think it’s “unlikely … that the Court will foreclose all future avenues for other Trump assertion of tariff powers, or that it will do much to address how unjustly paid tariffs can be recouped.”

A Closer Look: FBI v. Fazaga

Careful court watchers may recognize the case name FBI v. Fazaga. The justices heard a dispute by that name just over four years ago, which concerned the FBI and three Muslim men who lived and worshipped in Orange County, California.

The men had sued the FBI, alleging religious discrimination and other rights violations, after discovering that agents had paid an informant to gather information on them and their fellow worshippers as part of a counterterrorism operation. The federal government invoked its state-secrets privilege and moved to have the men’s religion claims dismissed, contending that allowing them to go forward would jeopardize national security.

When the Supreme Court got involved during the 2021-22 term, it was to address whether the state-secrets privilege can be trumped by a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that outlines a way for a district court to review sensitive surveillance information behind closed doors in order to assess the legality of electronic surveillance conducted under FISA without jeopardizing national security. The justices unanimously held that the provision does not displace the privilege and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit for further proceedings.

After four years, those further proceedings have resulted in an unworkable outcome for the federal government, according to U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who on Oct. 8 filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to reenter the dispute. While the 9th Circuit “determined that the government appropriately invoked the state-secrets privilege,” it went on to adopt “improper and wholly novel procedural requirements that essentially negate the privilege in myriad cases,” Sauer contended.

Specifically, Sauer stated that the 9th Circuit’s new ruling in FBI v. Fazaga requires district courts to review privileged information in order to evaluate the government’s claim to the state-secrets privilege. Such a requirement essentially recreates the situation the federal government previously fought to avoid, Sauer wrote, transplanting the review procedures outlined in FISA to the “state-secrets doctrine itself.”

“That decision,” Sauer continued, “threatens significant and recurring national-security harm.” He urged the justices to either grant the new petition for review and hear arguments on how courts should respond to invocation of the state-secrets privilege or vacate the 9th Circuit’s ruling and remand the case to the district court, where it may be dismissed for other reasons (namely, because the former FBI informant who provided the information about surveillance activities that fueled the Muslim men’s lawsuit has now recanted his story).

In response, the challengers have asked the court to leave the 9th Circuit’s ruling in place, contending, as they have at previous points in the case, that the government’s invocation of the state-secrets privilege is preventing them from making a case that they’re willing to make with the “ample” amount of “non-privileged information” that is now available about the challenged surveillance program. It is appropriate, the men added, for the district court to review the privileged information that the government is trying to protect in order to assess the government’s assertion that it cannot mount a defense without jeopardizing national security.

The court considered the petition in FBI v. Fazaga for the first time during the Jan. 9 conference. It is scheduled to be considered again at tomorrow’s conference.

Court finds police properly entered man’s home despite absence of a warrant

The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that police officers in Anaconda, Montana, did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they entered a man’s home without a warrant, rejecting the man’s contention that officers needed “probable cause” to enter. It was enough, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for a unanimous court, that officers believed the man needed emergency assistance.

Argument Analysis

Justices wrestle with what, exactly, New Jersey Transit is

The Supreme Court on Wednesday debated whether New Jersey’s public transit agency can be sued in state courts in New York and Pennsylvania. The New Jersey Transit Corporation argues that it is an “arm” of the state and, therefore, immune from lawsuits elsewhere, but after a little over an hour of arguments, it was not clear whether a majority of justices agreed.

I sometimes think of what would have happened if I had let that first phone call go to voicemail. The line was unstable and I could discern only half the words, but I knew immediately why she was calling. For weeks, I’d been receiving dozens of calls like hers.

In the summer of 2020, I was working as a paralegal in Austin, Texas, remotely filling out asylum applications for migrants who were trapped in a dangerous limbo. A landmark policy of the first Trump administration—euphemistically called the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP—was keeping tens of thousands of immigrants stateless and often homeless in Mexico’s border regions while their asylum cases were adjudicated in U.S. border courts. Over half lost the chance to pursue asylum because they never received notice of their court date, or they fell victim to “routine” kidnappings, assaults, or sexual violence by cartel members. All of them were desperate for legal aid.

As much as I tried to stop it, my number had been passed around the Mexican borderland all summer, and I was inundated with calls. By the time Irma, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker who’d recently been deported from the U.S. border to Mexico, first contacted me, I had a standard answer: We were at capacity. I could not help anyone. (Irma asked that her name be changed for this because she fears retaliation from the U.S. government).

But she didn’t give me the chance to turn her away. Within minutes, she told me that her son had died after Mexican immigration officials deported him to Colombia. He’d had a respiratory complication related to his diabetes, she explained, possibly triggered by coronavirus. She began to cry.

“Tell me,” she asked in Spanish, “how can I bring his ashes to me?”

I remember pausing. I knew I had to tell her I couldn’t help her—I was under direct orders not to accept clients. But somehow, I couldn’t do it. She seemed so sure, already, that I could help. Irma spoke to me like she already knew me and loved me, as though I had already been kind to her. She called me “mija”—my daughter. She seemed to hold no mistrust toward me and my halting Spanish, no shard of suspicion that I could use to create the usual distance around myself.

After that call, I convinced my supervisor to make a rare exception for Irma and provide her with limited assistance with her asylum case. For months, we talked almost every night as I helped her prepare for her scheduled asylum hearing at the U.S. border—a hearing that would be delayed over and over again as COVID-19 shut down courtrooms across the country. I never figured out how to bring her son’s ashes to her. They remained in Colombia—as did his widow and daughters, pinned between familiar horror and new violence.

But Irma kept waiting for her day in court. Over the next years, I became transfixed by her asymmetrical struggle against the U.S. immigration system. As she moved to the U.S., reunited with her family, gained legal status—got almost everything she’d wanted—and lost it again, I kept answering her calls.

More than five years later, when U.S. forces struck Caracas, Venezuela, and seized President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face narco-trafficking charges in federal court while continuing their unprecedented attack on asylum-seekers inside the United States, I’ve found myself increasingly unable to share her faith in American justice. As I watched the havoc caused by the vagaries of the U.S. immigration system, I kept returning to the same questions. Had I helped? Could anyone help? Was there enough justice left in the U.S. immigration system—enough order, enough impartiality—for help to be possible? Or had she just traded one set of dangers for another?

When Nicolás Maduro first assumed power in 2013, Irma was working as a campesina—a small-scale rural farmer—in Venezuela. She was happy then, she told me in our early conversations, marveling daily at the process of growing living things from the earth. At first, she was optimistic about Maduro, who had been a bus driver in Caracas and who she thought would serve the “humble.”

“Maduro, I knew him as a man who knew the people’s needs, because someone who drives a bus has passengers get on every day and hears their comments and knows what people suffer because of what’s happening,” she said a few weeks ago, when we discussed the (then) impending U.S. intervention into Venezuela.

Donald Trump, she believes, was born a tyrant. Maduro became one quickly after taking power—barely a year after he became president, Irma told me, she started seeing people picked off the streets by men with machine guns. These men belonged to groups known as colectivos—government-affiliated paramilitaries who repressed political protest and dissent in exchange for the opportunity to loot the dissenters.

The colectivos were part of the “very sophisticated repressive machine” that Maduro inherited from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, explained Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of Autocracy Rising: How Venezuela Transitioned to Authoritarianism. Chávez had led a “hybrid regime” that combined elements of both autocracy and democracy, Corrales said. Despite the corruption that pervaded his administration, Chávez presided over resource redistribution and significant reductions in poverty levels. His 2001 land reform program redistributed government-owned and private land to indigent residents willing to cultivate it.

Irma was one of Chávez’s direct beneficiaries; she received a parcel of arable land which she cultivated with her brother. She never viewed Chávez as a dictator, she told me—not because he defended democracy, but because he championed the downtrodden. Chávez “loved his people, protected us campesinos, protected the poor,” she explained. On Christmas, he gave his people hallacas, a traditional Venezuelan corn-dough holiday dish.

According to Corrales, when Maduro took power, he targeted the people who’d benefited directly from government programs, especially those who also displayed opposition to the government—even if their putative opposition consisted of speaking up to demand adequate water for their town or electricity for their local hospitals.

Irma herself was one of the recipients of government largesse who started speaking up. Local government officials were stealing from the farmers and selling the produce on the black market for personal profit. So Irma banded together with other recipients of farming plots to demand an end to the looting and assert the rights given to them by Chávez’s laws.

That’s when the colectivos came to her farm. She recalls watching them punch her brother and drag him off the farm in a black truck. After the truck drove off, Irma searched for him for hours with her brother’s wife and children, as the unbearable knowledge of where they would find him grew more solid.

“We went to the morgue and there he was,” Irma said.

A few weeks later, Irma said, the colectivos returned and destroyed her farm. They punched her, tied her up, and dragged her into the truck, and left her beaten on the side of the road with a warning to end her “radicalism.”

After her attempts to hide from the colectivos proved futile, Irma decided she had to start over somewhere new. She fled, becoming one of the nearly 8 million Venezuelans who left the country during Maduro’s reign.

Irma arrived at the U.S.–Mexico border midway through the first Trump administration. She waded across the cloudy Rio Grande and searched for an immigration officer she could ask for help. She knelt in front of the first officer she saw, told him she’d fled the colectivos, and pleaded for a chance to seek asylum.

The official put her in a crowded van and detained her for three days in a freezing border cell, which immigrants often refer to as a hielera, or icebox. After she was released, she was sent to Juárez, Mexico, under Migrant Protection Protocols—the Trump policy that kept people in limbo in Mexico’s dangerous border areas while their cases made their way through U.S. courts.

Her son died en route to join her in Mexico, leaving a widow and two young daughters in Colombia. She called me days after his death, while she was still living in a shelter in the largely cartel-controlled Mexican border town of Juárez. A few months later, she would end up on the streets, eventually sheltering inside the active construction site where she worked during the day. She told me then she had faced repeated sexual assaults from a local worker who threatened to toss her body in the river if she told anyone. “Imagine,” she told me then. “A grandmother, an old woman like me, alone.”

But she refused to give up on her only chance to seek refuge from the dictatorship that had killed her brother. She kept waiting, even when COVID-19 shut down the courts and her case was delayed indefinitely. I felt sickened by every piece of news I gave her—her court date canceled, the border closed, the pandemic spreading—but her faith in the system, and in me, seemed implacable. At some point, I realized that she was waiting out Donald Trump’s presidency. Time was the last thing left that could still help her.

When Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, she was triumphant. Biden promised to end MPP, the program keeping her trapped in Mexico, and restore the normal pathway to asylum. “I knew he was going to win against that arrogant child,” she said to me at the time.

Shortly after Biden took office, Irma was allowed to enter the country to pursue asylum. She reunited with her daughter and grandson in Houston, obtained Temporary Protected Status—a visa afforded to citizens of countries designated by the executive as especially dangerous—and got a job at a 7-Eleven. The joy she felt then “astonished” her, she told me when I drove to Houston to meet her and her family. She dreamed of saving money to open a food truck that would sell arepas throughout Texas.

“It was so beautiful,” she told me as I worked through the alarming amounts of food she’d cooked in honor of my visit. “I just didn’t expect it.”

But when Trump returned to office four years later, Irma was stripped of her status, her work permit, her mundane everyday freedoms. It would be the second time she would live through a government turning against her, and her second time in hiding. This time, however, she had nowhere to go.

After Trump retook office in 2025, his administration, guided by a slew of anti-immigrant executive orders, relentlessly stripped the statuses that had protected vulnerable noncitizens. They rolled back humanitarian and family reunification–based parole and stripped away Temporary Protected Status for residents of some of the world’s most destabilized countries, including South Sudan, Haiti, and Venezuela.

Irma was one of the hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who became newly undocumented under Trump’s policies. She told me that a co-worker outed her at work as having lost her status, and she was fired immediately. She moved away from the vibrant immigrant communities in Houston to live with her other daughter in the more homogenous and broadly affluent Austin, where there were fewer immigrants and therefore, she reasoned, fewer raids.

But even in Austin, she couldn’t risk going to church; she settled for watching sermons streamed live. She was consumed by the idea of Immigration and Customs Enforcement picking her up at home, or when she went to get her grandson from his special school (at 3, the child was still nonverbal, which Irma attributed to the fear his mother had experienced when she fled Venezuela, already eight months pregnant). Irma feared the indefinite detentions and inhumane treatment she’d heard about. “You don’t know what they’re going to do,” she said, “because they don’t want us here.”

Her fears are not overblown. Since this summer, clients at the nonprofit legal center I work at have been starved, denied their medicine, and kept in windowless cells where the lights never turn off, where there’s no room to lie down. Spurred by a $170 billion enforcement package that tripled ICE’s detention budget and by Trump’s Day 1 orders demanding “total and efficient” enforcement against all removable immigrants, ICE officers have stormed the streets with unprecedented intensity and violence.

In blitz raids across the country, ICE agents have picked up thousands of immigrants, many of whom had legal status in the United States and the vast majority of whom had no criminal record: Over the summer, ICE averaged over 1,000 arrests per day. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody. Its agents have become increasingly aggressive in their encounters with citizens and noncitizens alike—protesters, legal observers, and people they’re targeting at random. These killings appear not to trouble President Trump. After an ICE agent shot Renee Nicole Good in the face, killing her, Trump called the 37-year-old mother of three an “agitator,” adding that “we’re always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.”

These past few months, Irma says she’s been seeing something that she recognizes all too well: some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society grabbed off the street and thrown in vans. And she’s living in fear of being grabbed again herself. “I don’t know when they’ll take me away,” she told me recently.

Scholars have a name for this phenomenon. Targeting the most vulnerable, political scientists have argued, is a hallmark of democracy backsliding. Corrales calls the process “victim inversion.”

“An autocracy needs to create an in-group versus an out-group,” Corrales explained. “You start with the most vulnerable precisely because they’re the easiest to go after. … Once you get your group to think in terms of in-groups versus out-groups, and that the out-groups are harming agents, repression is uncontainable.”

In Venezuela, the “out-group” consisted of anyone perceived as opposing the regime, Corrales said. In the United States, “what Trump has done is to focus on noncitizens. You see victim inversion: They’re very vulnerable, and the first thing is to turn them into harming agents.”

Maduro and Trump are both part of a global trend toward polarization and extremism, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a history professor at Pomona College who studies both modern Venezuela and the U.S.–Mexico border region. But both of these instances of democratic backsliding are “historically grounded in the particular situation” of their respective countries, he emphasized.

According to Tinker Salas, Maduro’s dictatorship sprang from Hugo Chávez’s regime, an economic crisis, and the failures of Chávez’s “cultural, social, political project.” Meanwhile, Trump rose to power in the vacuum created by “the inability of the Democrats to put forth a proposal for real change,” and the hollowing out of their commitment to equality with their embrace of neoliberalism.

Trump has used the out-group of noncitizens—conjuring the specters of dangerous internal and external enemies—to justify his startling consolidation of executive power. “In 2016, he began with the wall, … the Salvadorans, and then Mara Salvatrucha,” Tinker Salas said. “Now in 2025, targeting Venezuelans and the so-called Credenciales”—“credentialed” gang members—“it becomes the same phraseology, the same notion. … You’re trying to make immigrants the enemy from within.”

Trump relied on the same specter of an enemy within in justifying his intervention in Venezuela this month, which was ostensibly motivated by “drugs, immigration, and oil.” While many Venezuelan émigrés celebrated the ouster of Maduro, the man whose corruption had been instrumental in driving them out of their country, Irma herself was somber. She didn’t trust Maduro, but she didn’t want Trump to intervene, either. “Here, he’s made us suffer enough; imagine what he’s going to do inside my country,” she texted me over WhatsApp.

Irma is not hopeful about the future of her home country in Trump’s hands. Instead, she spends much of her time praying for Trump and his administration, including ICE agents, entreating Jesus to “soften the heart of Trump and of the people that work for him.” Even while she prays for softness, she says, she doesn’t expect it—and she hopes people will stand up and fight for the people being snatched off the street. After all, she knows firsthand how quickly democracy and rule of law can dissolve.

“I’ve lived through it—death, eviction, persecution—because I stood up to the government and refused to accept injustice. In our own country, we protested against the government, and many innocent people died. … But we can’t allow one person to destroy what belongs to all of us.”",https://compote.slate.com/images/838aee09-52a4-4430-a0fa-cef1092e2d51.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:52.836625

The closed-door meeting brought together local officials to share information about recent ICE activity in their communities and to discuss possible next steps as ICE remains active across the metropolitan area and the state, Eden Prairie Mayor Ron Case said.

Representatives from Hennepin County, including Commissioner Debbie Goettel, and the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison were also in attendance.

Members of the media were not invited to the meeting, though Case spoke with Eden Prairie Local News afterward.

Case said mayors shared specific instances in which ICE agents allegedly followed residents without clear cause, including an incident in Brooklyn Park in which a Hispanic off-duty police officer was surrounded by agents while driving her personal vehicle. The officer told the agents she was a citizen and a police officer, but they did not allow her to leave until they eventually departed, Case said.

A representative from Richfield said there is growing concern about the impact ICE’s presence is having on students, with roughly one-third not attending school, Case said. Several restaurants in Richfield have also closed due to ICE activity in the city, raising concerns about lost wages and workers’ ability to pay their bills.

Officials from all cities in attendance, including Eden Prairie City Manager Rick Getschow and Police Chief Matt Sackett, encouraged U.S. citizens to call 911 if they encounter ICE and feel unsafe. While officers cannot intervene in or stop a federal arrest, they can respond, record interactions and help deescalate situations.

“Police departments across the area do not want to interfere with the job duties and the role of ICE, but the expectation is that ICE will follow the law as well,” Case said.

Eden Prairie has experienced several instances of ICE activity, but city officials are not notified in advance, Case said. Instead, the city typically learns of ICE’s presence after the fact, if someone calls 911.

Case reiterated the city’s previous statement that local police departments, including Eden Prairie’s, do not participate in federal immigration enforcement and enforce only state and local laws. Eden Prairie police cannot ask about a person’s immigration status or share that information with ICE, he said.

Case said he shared a few facts to illustrate the current situation in Minnesota during the meeting, including that there are about 100,000 undocumented immigrants in Minnesota, compared with about 2 million in Texas. Despite that difference, Texas has roughly 1,500 Border Patrol agents, while Minnesota has about 3,000 ICE agents and Border Patrol officers statewide, Case said.

“It begins to very much look like it’s not about immigration,” Case said.

Moving forward, Case said city officials plan to meet in Brooklyn Park early next week to coordinate outreach to Gov. Tim Walz, if possible. Mayors have also discussed writing letters to President Donald Trump and to Minnesota’s Republican members of Congress about what they view as the negative economic impacts of ICE’s expanded presence.

The group is also considering writing a letter to the editor of the Minnesota Star Tribune and contacting The New York Times in an effort to draw national attention to the impact ICE activity has had on suburban and smaller communities.

“People hear President Trump’s perspective, and they may hear Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey’s perspectives, but they’re not hearing the perspectives of 30 suburban mayors whose residents and communities are being negatively impacted,” Case said.

Case noted that Minnesota communities have coexisted with ICE and have been aware of the agency’s presence since its creation in 2003, but said the scale and visibility of ICE activity now is unprecedented.

“This is different today — this is much different,” Case said.

Case added that oftentimes agents wear masks, making it difficult to identify them.

Several police chiefs across the metro also discussed difficulties contacting ICE leadership, Case said, noting they were told there is no central command for ICE in Minnesota.

“There’s no one you can report that behavior of ICE agents to,” Case said. “That’s the problem.”",https://www.eplocalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mayors-Meeting-scaled-e1768434221777.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:18.721735

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning nearly fifty years of abortion rights precedent. The decision across all opinions cited six different scholar briefs—amicus curiae submissions signed by law professors and academic experts—more than any other decision in recent memory. The opinion’s deployment of academic authority was both extensive and strategic. When challenging Roe’s treatment of common law abortion prohibitions, Alito invoked a brief from scholars of jurisprudence James Stoner and John Finnis, asserting that “’a quick child’ meant simply a ‘live’ child” under early modern understanding—a historical claim that, if accepted, would dramatically expand the temporal scope of abortion’s criminal prohibition. The opinion relied even more heavily on professional historians’ submissions to reconstruct nineteenth-century legislative intent. In a revealing methodological move, Alito cited historians’ work to demonstrate that “at least 26 of 37” states had criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy by 1868—the year the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified—thereby establishing the historical tradition against which contemporary abortion rights claims must be measured.

This intensive marshaling of academic expertise in Dobbs exemplifies a broader transformation in Supreme Court practice. The Justices increasingly turn to scholar briefs not merely for doctrinal synthesis—a traditional function of academic amici—but for empirical claims, historical reconstruction, and comparative constitutional analysis that shapes the Court’s understanding of fundamental legal questions. These submissions occupy a distinctive rhetorical space. Unlike party briefs, which advance partisan positions within adversarial constraints, scholar briefs purport to offer disinterested expertise. As Paul Collins observes, they “allow professors to make their views known to judges and provide expert knowledge and commentary from (ostensibly) neutral legal experts.” This neutrality—whether genuine or performed—confers epistemic authority that practicing attorneys cannot easily replicate. A multisignatory historians’ brief carries intellectual weight beyond its legal argumentation precisely because it appears to represent scholarly consensus rather than litigation strategy.

Yet the expanding influence of scholar briefs raises troubling questions about the relationship between academic knowledge production and judicial reasoning. Do these submissions genuinely inform constitutional interpretation, or do they merely provide scholarly imprimatur for conclusions reached through other means? When Justice Alito cites historians to demonstrate that abortion was widely criminalized in 1868, is he incorporating new historical evidence into his analysis, or mining academic briefs for convenient citations that support an outcome predetermined by his constitutional philosophy? The very features that give scholar briefs their authority—their claim to expertise, their apparent distance from litigation incentives, their aggregation of credentialed signatories—may also enable a form of motivated reasoning dressed in academic garb. Kelly Lynch acknowledges this ambiguity, noting that while “it is likely that in many cases scholars can have at least some beneficial effect on the development of the law,” the causal mechanisms remain opaque. We know that Justices cite scholar briefs with increasing frequency; we know far less about whether these citations reflect persuasion or mere justification.

This article examines an original dataset of 103 scholar briefs and over 2,300 individual scholars that contributed to these briefs cited by the Supreme Court between the 2015 and 2024 Terms to map the landscape of academic influence in contemporary constitutional adjudication. The analysis reveals which doctrinal domains attract scholarly intervention, which institutions and methodologies dominate the cited literature, and which cases generate the most intensive academic engagement. These patterns illuminate not only what kinds of expertise the Court values, but also the structural features of legal academia—institutional prestige, disciplinary boundaries, professional networks—that determine whose scholarly voices reach the Justices. More fundamentally, this empirical account sets the stage for a critical assessment of scholar briefs’ actual influence. If academic amici cluster predictably around elite institutions, if their historical claims align suspiciously well with litigants’ constitutional theories, if cases decided on originalist grounds systematically cite originalist historians while living constitutionalist opinions cite different scholars entirely, we might reasonably suspect that scholar briefs function less as genuine knowledge inputs than as rhetorical resources in an ideological struggle over constitutional meaning.

Along with contextualizing these citations, this article tracks attributes of the scholars and institutions that contributed most to the justices’ citations.

Methodology notes: The search parameters included briefs mentioning scholar(s) or professor(s) so there may be briefs that fall into the same category but were titled differently and were missed. This also only covers information specified within the briefs so while most briefs share the institution where a professor work and other details, there is no standardized information template used across briefs.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LNEg!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3093fa1b-3ffa-4bd3-b33f-ffd0eecabc9c_1247x831.jpeg",N,,2026-01-15 14:58:57.264761

Whether Minnesota ultimately prosecutes Ross remains to be seen, and state officials’ decisions will depend on careful legal and evidentiary analysis.
Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him.
(I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.)","On Jan. 7, a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, identified by the media as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but despite an initial promise of collaboration, it subsequently informed state officials that it would not work with them. As a result, Hennepin County prosecutor Mary Moriarty and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have launched their own investigation.

State criminal investigations and prosecutions of federal officials are unusual. And criminal charges against law enforcement officials at any level present unique legal and factual challenges. But as illustrated by Minnesota’s successful prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, law enforcement officers can be held accountable for crimes they commit. And longstanding historical precedent establishes that states can bring charges against federal officials under certain circumstances.

Whether Minnesota ultimately prosecutes Ross remains to be seen, and state officials’ decisions will depend on careful legal and evidentiary analysis. Without predicting outcomes, however, it’s worth both clarifying the state of the law—especially in the face of false claims from the Trump administration—and identifying some of the key issues Minnesota prosecutors will have to consider.

First, let’s debunk claims that the state has no role to play here. The day before Moriarty and Ellison announced the state investigation, Vice-President J.D. Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him. And Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed that the state has “no jurisdiction,” which is why, she said, it was shut out of the investigation. More recently, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced that ICE agents “have immunity to fulfill their duties” and that “no one … can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.” In fact, Vance and Noem are completely wrong as a matter of law, and Miller’s claim holds water only insofar as ICE agents are in fact acting within their legal authority, which, as explained below, will be a central issue in any state prosecution.

The notion that Minnesota cannot investigate or prosecute a violation of its criminal laws within its borders is flatly inconsistent with our federalist system. As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, the states and the federal government each have a sovereign interest in enforcing their own criminal laws. Sometimes that means that both a state and the federal government prosecute the same person for the same conduct, as happened with Derek Chauvin. When that happens, because of those separate sovereign interests, double jeopardy does not apply. Here, double jeopardy is not the key question (although at some point in the future a different federal administration could presumably prosecute Ross regardless of what Minnesota does). Instead, “dual sovereignty” in the present context means that the state has a legitimate interest in enforcing its laws even against federal actors.

Such cases are unusual, but they are not unprecedented. As Bryna Godar has documented, states have been bringing prosecutions against federal officials since at least the nineteenth century, including for crimes involving the use of force by law enforcement officials. These cases have involved charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, and other violent crimes, often brought against tax collectors or federal agents enforcing Prohibition. More recently, the state of Idaho brought murder charges against an FBI agent who shot and killed an unarmed woman during a lengthy stand-off known colloquially as “Ruby Ridge.” In other words, there is no question that Minnesota has jurisdiction to investigate and charge Ross with a crime and there is no automatic or absolute immunity because he is a federal officer. The administration’s claims otherwise are false.

Nonetheless, in deciding whether and how to proceed, Minnesota officials will face some challenges, from the factual investigation; to determining what, if any, charges to bring; to evaluating the defenses that Ross, as a law enforcement officer, may have—and the related likelihood that he could successfully claim what is known as “Supremacy Clause immunity,” which (contra Vance) is not absolute, but which Ross would almost certainly attempt to invoke.

As a practical evidentiary matter, if the FBI or other federal investigators do not share their investigatory files with the state, state officials have cautioned that they might determine that they do not have a sufficient evidentiary record to make a charging decision. That’s not a foregone conclusion, of course, and even if they conclude that they cannot charge Ross now, that assessment could change if a future administration is willing to share information with the state. (Minnesota has no statute of limitations “for any crime resulting in the death of the victim.”) In any event, at this time, Moriarty and Ellison are asking the public to share video and other information, and state officials are evaluating the evidence they already have. They may well conclude that they have sufficient evidence to prosecute Ross for any of a number of crimes, including various forms of murder and manslaughter and the failure to provide aid to a shooting victim.

Each of those crimes has its own set of elements, and the Minnesota prosecutors will review the evidence to see if it meets those elements. Derek Chauvin’s prosecution for killing George Floyd is a useful example. Chauvin was convicted of unintentional second degree murder, third degree murder, and second degree manslaughter. The unintentional second degree murder charge, which is comparable to what some states call felony murder, required showing that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing a separate felony, in that case a form of assault.

Third degree murder in Minnesota, of which Chauvin was also convicted, requires a showing that the defendant, “without intent to effect the death of any person, causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life …” In Chauvin’s case, the prosecution established those elements in part through evidence that the use-of-force training Chauvin received included instruction to avoid putting pressure on an individual’s neck, as Chauvin did to Floyd. Similarly, the second degree manslaughter charge required the prosecution to show that Chauvin “create[d] an unreasonable risk, and consciously t[ook] chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another.”

Minnesota prosecutors will also evaluate any state law arguments Ross might have. For example, Minnesota’s state law authorizes peace officers to use deadly force under some circumstances. As relevant here, peace officers can do so under that law

only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that such force is necessary: (1) to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm, provided that the threat: (i) can be articulated with specificity; (ii) is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer; and (iii) must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay…

I would expect Minnesota prosecutors to evaluate the evidence carefully to see if Ross might be able to establish these factors, which I’ll address further below. (I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.) And regardless of what they conclude about prosecuting the shooting itself, they will likely separately evaluate whether Ross – and his fellow ICE officers – violated Minnesota law requiring both a person who shoots someone and any witnesses to immediately investigate and render appropriate assistance.

Should Minnesota charge him, Ross will undoubtedly claim a form of immunity generally referred to as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Contrary to Vance’s claim and Miller’s insinuation, however, Supremacy Clause immunity is not absolute. Rather, it balances the dual sovereignty already discussed with the additional principle that states cannot supersede federal laws. That balance means that Supremacy Clause immunity is available only to federal officials who are acting reasonably and lawfully in fulfilling their duties. More specifically, as Bryna Godar explained in November, it applies only if “[t]he federal official’s actions [were] … (a) authorized by federal law and (b) ‘necessary and proper’ in fulfilling the official’s federal duties.”

The inquiry into whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies in this case will thus likely include, for example, reviews of the federal government’s use-of-force policies to determine if Ross acted outside his authority and/or acted unreasonably. Those policies, for example, state that law enforcement officials (LEOs) “should … avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force”; they permit deadly force only “when the LEO has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the LEO or to another person”; they generally prohibit the use of deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject”; and they specifically discourage LEOs from firing at “the driver of a moving vehicle.” The policies also require federal LEOs to “obtain appropriate medical care” after any use of force. If Ross violated these provisions, his immunity claim will be weaker. Likewise, the court will likely look at whether Ross used deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, including whether his failure to warn Good before firing his gun was unconstitutional.

This immunity inquiry also overlaps with Minnesota’s state law authorizing peace officers to use deadly force, described above. Under all of these inquiries, questions of whether Ross acted reasonably under the circumstances will play a central role. In other words, both the state prosecutors’ charging decisions and the immunity determination will depend on questions of fact about the details of what actually happened, as well as on questions of law as to the implications of those facts. For example, did Ross believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury when he fired the first shot? If so, was that belief reasonable? Did Ross prepare to draw his gun before or after Good’s car started moving, and if not, why did he shift his cellphone from his right to his left hand? Did Good’s car touch him at any point? What about Ross’s belief as to whether he was in danger when he fired the second and third shots? On what basis did he, and his colleagues, fail to provide assistance to Good after she was shot and prevent a physician who was on the scene from helping? All of these questions go to both whether Ross has Supremacy Clause immunity and to whether he is likely to be convicted if charged and tried.

Finally, whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies will almost certainly be decided by a federal court, even though any criminal charges would first be filed in Minnesota state court. That is because federal officials are able to remove both criminal and civil cases from state court to federal court if those cases involve actions taken “under color of” their federal office. If charged, Ross would almost certainly choose to remove the case. Even in federal court, however, state criminal prosecutors would remain in charge of the prosecution, and any conviction would be a conviction under state law. And the president cannot pardon a state law crime.

In closing, Minnesota unquestionably has jurisdiction to investigate and to bring criminal charges against Ross. And Ross does not have absolute immunity, although he will certainly claim Supremacy Clause immunity if charged. We simply do not know at this point whether such a claim of immunity is likely to be successful.

Those looking for quick resolutions are likely to be disappointed. I expect that the Minnesota authorities will carefully and deliberately analyze the evidence they have access to, so it could take some time for them to decide whether to prosecute Ross. Moreover, if and when the state does bring charges, the immunity issues will be litigated first. As a result, it could take a very long time—even years—before there is a trial, much less a conviction.

Regardless of what happens in this particular case, federal immigration officers around the country should be on notice that they do not have complete impunity. They can be prosecuted and may be convicted. Lawless violence and unconstitutional actions may, sooner or later, end with a prison sentence.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/minnesota_state_capitol-_st-_paul-_minnesota-(1).jpg?sfvrsn=7d1dc82a_5,N,,2026-01-15 14:59:02.137222

Our civil rights, our dignity

-

Pennsylvanian has not been shielded from the Trump administration’s assault on civil liberties, epitomized by the cruel war against immigrants. Hispanic and Latine families across our commonwealth are enduring unparalleled threats while also confronting familiar obstacles that they’ve been navigating for generations.

Language barriers at the polls. Racial profiling by law enforcement. The lack of proper and equitable support in schools. These challenges are not new, but they are intensifying. Hispanic, Latine, and Black and brown immigrants are facing escalating attacks driven by disinformation campaigns designed to dehumanize entire communities and strip them of their constitutional rights.

These aren’t isolated challenges. They are daily reminders that dignity—basic human dignity—is still being negotiated in places where it should already be guaranteed.

At a time when immigrants’ rights are under attack, when fear too often replaces fairness, silence isn’t an option.

Millions of American family trees trace their roots to other lands. In Pennsylvania alone, one in six children has at least one immigrant parent. The truths and promises we hold to be self-evident in America would crumble if we ever stopped believing that immigrants aren’t worth protecting; we are them and they are us.

That’s why ACLU-PA launched “Dignity You Can’t Deny,” a campaign born to honor Hispanic Heritage Month but designed to live far beyond it. Our message is simple: celebrating Hispanic Heritage means defending civil rights.

Through this effort, we’ve elevated the conversations that matter most to Hispanic and Latine communities, such as the rights students have to an education, regardless of immigration status; how to vote without intimidation and what to do if polls do not have language resources; and how to stand firm in our humanity when policies or prejudice try to diminish it.

Because dignity isn’t a gift governments can give or take away, it’s an inherent right that belongs to every one of us.

Protecting dignity begins with understanding your rights, and helping others understand theirs. There are plenty of opportunities to help others exercise their rights. It’s also critical that we all participate in our democracy to ensure that the leaders we elect guard our rights, value our humanity and differences, and support policies that protect us so we can live freely and safely without discrimination.

Being active in our democracy starts at the ballot box — but that’s not where it ends. We can all speak out, protest, organize, and stay informed, strengthening our collective dignity so that everyone in our community is empowered to maintain their own.

As the ACLU of Pennsylvania, we are committed to educating and providing resources and opportunities for us all to join the fight to defend immigrants. Immigrants enrich our country and have the right to be here; our Constitution extends many of the protections we all cherish to all immigrants, regardless of status, recognizing that dignity should be based on personhood, not paperwork.

We’re supporting students and parents to know their rights.

We’re working in coalition to advocate for Welcoming policies in local counties and schools.

We’re urging Gov. Shapiro to end state collaboration with ICE.

We’re monitoring for and suing when there are civil liberty violations against Black and brown people being targeted, profiled, abducted, and inhumanely detained because of the Trump administration’s aggressive and unconstitutional deportation agenda.

We’re mobilizing to take action, together.

Most importantly, we’re working to flip the narrative, understanding that when dignity is honored as fundamental, our lives, families, and society become better for us all.

Questioning continued Wednesday at the confirmation hearing of ex-prosecutor Michael Drescher, who is seeking a position on the Vermont Supreme Court. It was his second day of testimony.

Drescher, who recently resigned from his position as the Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont, fielded dozens of pointed questions from members of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, who appeared deeply troubled by Drescher's high-profile litigation of two controversial immigration cases.

Öztürk was briefly held in Vermont before being flown to an immigration facility in Louisiana, where she remained in custody until her release in May. The government claimed that she is a supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas. Court documents cite an editorial published in the Tufts student newspaper where Öztürk and a co-author criticized Israel's military strikes in Gaza.

Drescher had taken over the case after Erez Reuveni, another federal attorney, was fired from the DOJ for his handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case. During the first part of his hearing on Tuesday, Drescher told lawmakers he took the lead in the Öztürk case to prevent that fate for one of his colleagues.

""I could not in good conscious subject anybody in the office to being in that position. So I concluded that if anyone was going to be fired, it was going to be me,"" he said.

Drescher repeatedly emphasized that the government was acting as a defendant in the proceedings, and explained that the role of district courts in habeas cases is an unsettled part of the law. He said the court's jurisdiction deserved to be questioned.

""The arguments that were made in that litigation were about the role of the federal court,"" Drescher said. ""All of the arguments I made in that regard were serious, ethical, responsible arguments.""

A memo authored by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio circulated following his detainment. Rubio called Mahdawi a foreign policy risk and accused him of antisemitism. Court documents cited pro-Palestinian protests Mahdawi had organized at Columbia University and a 2015 police report filed by a Windsor gun shop owner who claimed Mahdawi had bragged about killing Jewish people in the West Bank.

He was held at a prison in St. Albans until a federal judge in Burlington ordered his release in April.

Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Robert Norris (R-Franklin) asked Drescher whether he would make different choices if he could go back and do it all again.

""I don't think so,"" he said.

Both Öztürk and Mahdawi's cases are pending in an appeals court and fighting deportation in immigration court.

Drescher's nomination, and that of fellow former U.S. Attorney Christina Nolan, will be considered by the full Senate.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Ophart is now leading the office following Drescher's resignation. It's unclear if President Donald Trump will appoint him or another prosecutor to the permanent position.

His 36% approval rating on his handling of the economy is at its lowest point for both his first and second terms.
Trump had a 40% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll taken Dec. 11-15 among 1,035 registered voters (margin of error 3.9), unchanged from Trump’s October approval/disapproval rating.
The New York Times’s polling average found Trump had a 42% approval rating and 55% disapproval rating after several weeks of declining support.
Biden had a -9 net approval rating at this point in his term and Trump had a -15 net approval rating at this point in his first term, according to Economist/YouGov polling.","Trump’s 40% approval rating in the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research January survey is largely consistent with his numbers throughout the first year of his second term—and are similar to his ratings in his first term, when he entered the presidency with a 42% approval rating and left office with nearly the same number.

Americans’ views of Trump’s handling of immigration—one of his signature issues—have declined sharply throughout his first year in office, however, reaching 38% in January, down from 49% in March last year.

The poll overlapped with several high-profile shootings involving ICE officers, including the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, when an ICE agent shot multiple rounds through her car window at close range in an incident captured by bystanders’ video—prompting a heated partisan debate about whether she was aiming to hit the officer with her vehicle, with some on the right breaking with Trump and his allies in denouncing the shooting as an unjustified use of force.

Trump’s approval rating increased to 40% from 36% in December, while his disapproval rating decreased from 61% to 59% in the latest AP/NORC poll of 1,203 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 8-11 (margin of error 3.9).

Despite the improvement in Trump’s overall approval rating, the poll found a plurality of respondents (45%) want the U.S. to take a less active role in solving global issues, an increase from the 33% who said the same in December.

Trump’s approval rating was also at 40% in the latest Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday and his disapproval rating was 56%, a slight improvement from last week (the poll of 1,437 registered voters was conducted Jan. 9-12 and has a margin of error of 3.1).

Trump’s 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating is unchanged from last week’s Economist/YouGov survey of 1,551 U.S. adults taken Jan. 2-5 (margin of error 3.3).

Trump’s approval rating dipped one point, to 46%, in the latest Morning Consult survey, consistent with his average job performance rating throughout his second term, according to the poll of 2,201 registered U.S. voters taken Jan. 2-4 (margin of error 2).

Trump’s approval rating ticked up three points, to 42%, and his disapproval rating decreased three points, to 56%, in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,248 U.S. adults taken Jan. 4-5, after the U.S. captured Maduro and his wife in a stunning raid early Saturday.

Views of Trump’s job performance improved to their highest point since October, despite only one in three Americans approving of the military operation and 72% saying they’re worried the U.S. will become too involved in Venezuela, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of 3).

Trump ends the year with a 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating in the Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll following a downward trend since the start of his second term linked to his handling of the economy—as more than half of poll respondents, 51%, said they believe the economy is getting worse (the latest survey of 1,550 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 26-29 and has a 3.6-point margin of error).

Trump’s -17% net approval rating compares to a -14% net approval rating after the first year of his first term and a -10% net approval rating after Biden’s first year, according to Economist/YouGov polling.

Trump had a 41% approval rating and 50% disapproval rating in an Emerson College poll of 1,000 voters taken Dec. 14-15 (margin of error 3).

The numbers are nearly the same as they were in November, when Trump also had a 41% approval rating and a 49% disapproval rating, but are a sharp turn from his 49% approval/41% disapproval rating in the group’s January poll taken at the start of his term.

Trump’s overall job performance had a 38% approval rating in the latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll of 1,440 adults conducted Dec. 8-11 (margin of error 3.2), while 54% disapprove.

His 36% approval rating on his handling of the economy is at its lowest point for both his first and second terms.

Trump had a 40% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll taken Dec. 11-15 among 1,035 registered voters (margin of error 3.9), unchanged from Trump’s October approval/disapproval rating.

Trump’s approval rating decreased from 41% to 39% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared to the groups’ poll the previous week week, while his disapproval rating also increased from 57% to 59% (the poll of 1,016 respondents was taken Dec. 12-15 and has a three-point margin of error).

Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy slipped from 36% to 33% while the share of respondents who said they disapprove increased from 52% to 58%.

Trump’s 36% approval rating was unchanged from AP-NORC’s November poll in its survey of 1,146 adults conducted Dec. 4-8 (margin of error 4), but his rating on the economy dipped to 31%, a low point for both terms.

Trump’s approval rating ticked up to 41% from 38% in late November in Reuters/Ipsos’ poll, while his disapproval rating decreased from 60% to 57% (the poll of 4,434 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 3-8 and has a two-point margin of error).

The uptick coincided with an increase in his performance on the cost of living—from 26% last month to 31% this month among all respondents, driven by a 10-point gain among Republican voters.

Trump has sought to improve voters’ views on his handling of the economy, kicking off an “affordability tour” in Pennsylvania.

The New York Times’s polling average found Trump had a 42% approval rating and 55% disapproval rating after several weeks of declining support.

The data shows voters increasingly disapprove of his handling of the economy—net approval of his economic performance has fallen across surveys—with just 26% percent of respondents believing Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Trump has also seen faltering numbers from within his own party and one-time supporters: Only 75% of Republicans approved of his handling of the economy in November, down from 82% in July, according to Marquette University polling, and his approval rating among white, college-educated men has dropped to 40% from 47% in June, according to polling from Fox News.

The Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll of 1,628 U.S. adults taken Nov. 28-Dec. 1 found Trump had a 38% approval rating and 57% disapproval rating, the seventh straight week his net approval rating was -15 or lower (the survey has a margin of error of 3.2).

In Trump’s first term, his net approval rating never dipped to or below -15 for more than three consecutive weeks, YouGov noted.

The Facebook Live stream showed more than a half dozen law enforcement agents on the sidewalk beside the city's bus station on Union Street. Multiple sources confirmed to CBS 6 that the agents were working for ICE. The video was shared hundreds of times within an hour before being removed before noon.

""I literally got the call a few moments ago, 'Yo, ICE is in Petersburg, snatching people up,'"" Petersburg businessman Ajani Sekov said.

Sekov said he immediately ran from his Washington Street shop to Union Street when he heard about the operation. He planned to intervene if he felt anyone's rights were being violated.

""We're a small, tight-knit community and we're going to stand together. I promise you. We're standing together,"" Sekov said.

The citizenship status of the individuals witnesses said were taken away during the operation is not yet clear. Petersburg police had no advance notice about the operation.

ICE conducts operation in Petersburg, Virginia

One concerned citizen, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, drove to downtown Petersburg after seeing the video online.

""My first immediate feeling and thought was anger, it was like, doesn't make any sense,"" the person said. ""There's a few of us out here, at least just looking to get in between and keep them from harassing people who are, you know, American citizens. People don't deserve be harassed.""

Witnesses reported that the federal agents spent approximately 30 minutes on Union Street before leaving the area.

While ICE operations are not new in Virginia, sources indicated that some city leaders believed this was the first time ICE has made arrests in Petersburg in such a highly visible public location.

It's also one of the first operations since nationwide protests following the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the hands of an ICE officer.

Neither police nor city leaders agreed to speak on camera about the ICE operation.

In June 2025, Governor Glenn Youngkin addressed ICE arrests in Virginia stating: ""We have a statewide collaboration and partnership between state police and I and ICE and FBI and DEA working to make sure that violent criminals who are here illegally are arrested.""

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that starting Feb. 1 he will deny federal funding to any states that are home to local governments resisting his administration's immigration policies, expanding on previous threats to cut off resources to the so-called sanctuary cities themselves.

Such an action could have far-reaching impacts across the U.S., potentially even in places that aren't particularly friendly to noncitizens. Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off some funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were shut down by courts.

""Starting Feb. 1, we're not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,"" he said. ""So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.""

Back in Washington, Trump was asked by reporters what kind of funding would be affected on Feb 1: ""You'll see,"" he said. ""It'll be significant.""

There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Ex-Workers Collective,,,,,https://crimethinc.com/2026/01/15/north-minneapolis-chases-out-ice-a-firsthand-account-of-the-response-to-another-ice-shooting,"We offer here an account from the protests following the shooting in North Minneapolis, sent to us anonymously.
Somebody sent me a livestream of a crowd running away as ICE agents shot tear gas grenades and flashbangs at them.
Somebody was brandishing a tear gas canister that had been fired at them, showing it off to their friends.
They were smashing up two SUVs that I recognized immediately as ICE vehicles by their blacked-out windows and out-of-state plates.
I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were.","After Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot at least one person in north Minneapolis on the night of January 14, a crowd gathered and faced them down, confronting them and tearing down the yellow tape they put up around the area. Police reinforced the federal mercenaries, joining them in shooting a tremendous amount of tear gas and flash-bang grenades at demonstrators as well as at passing cars and houses in the residential district. Nonetheless, the officers lost control of the area and retreated, ceding the streets to those who had defied them.

In the process, ICE agents abandoned several vehicles in the area. Demonstrators opened up the vehicles and found identity cards, paperwork, license plates, operational plans, tactical gear, and other items. Footage of demonstrators looking through these materials was broadcast live on the internet.

This follows the atrocious murder, one week earlier, of Renee Good, perpetrated by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in the full light of day and captured on multiple videos. You can read an account of how demonstrators responded here.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump regime has sent more and more troops to the Twin Cities because they know that what happens there has implications for the whole country—and because they are losing. If the battle of Minneapolis in winter 2026 turns out the way that the battle of Portland turned out in summer 2020, it will bode ill for Trump’s ability to retain control by brute force.

It is important to note the role that local Minneapolis police played in assaulting demonstrators tonight, despite their nominally answering to a Democratic city government that has paid lip service to opposing ICE. Police across the country have played an essential role in enabling ICE to terrorize communities. Without the continuous assistance and support of local police departments, federal agencies would already have been outmaneuvered by protest movements. When Democrat politicians claim that they need to “maintain order,” they are attempting to position themselves as junior partners in the consolidation of fascism. It may be in their interests to “maintain order” as mercenaries kidnap and murder people, but it is not in ours.

We offer here an account from the protests following the shooting in North Minneapolis, sent to us anonymously.

I had two hours left at my work shift when my phone started blowing up. Several comrades didn’t know where I was and thought I might be out in the street.

“Where are you?”

“You OK????”

“Shots fired at 24th and Lyndale”

“They just shot another person”

Every rapid response group chat was talking about the same thing. All kinds of rumors were flying around. Did they shoot one person or two? Were the victims alive or dead? Somebody said ICE had shot a 12-year-old Venezuelan boy in the leg. Somebody else said the victim was hiding in his house for fear of arrest and desperately needed medical attention. I didn’t know what to believe.

It’s always like that when a new emergency is going down. In the course of the past 45 days of federal occupation, scrambling through a fog of war to find out what just happened has become a familiar sensation. Somebody sent me a livestream of a crowd running away as ICE agents shot tear gas grenades and flashbangs at them.

Time slowed to a crawl. I hurried to finish up the drudgery I was working on as fast as I could. When I felt like I could get away with it, I told my coworkers I had a family emergency and I had to leave early. I jumped in my car and ran every stop sign on the way to 24th and North Lyndale.

I ran into a crew of street medics two blocks north of the crowd. They told me about what they’d seen before I got there. ICE had snatched two kids suspected of throwing a firework at them—20 masked thugs charging up to grab the kids, only to release them half an hour later under intense pressure from the rest of the crowd. The medics warned me that they were going to get out before the cops started mass-arresting people. In their opinion, I was walking into a kettle. The air already stank of tear gas.

At 24th Street, I found a crowd of about a hundred people facing off against a skirmish line of Minneapolis Police Department pigs in riot gear. The feds had already left and handed over the situation to the local cops. Somebody was slowly beating a drum. To my right, kids stood up on an elevated front lawn, screaming “Fuck ICE!” and “Fuck 12!” down at MPD. Somebody was brandishing a tear gas canister that had been fired at them, showing it off to their friends. A TV news crew was there. They tried to talk to me. I pushed my way through the crowd to get away from the cameras. Beyond the skirmish line, a block south on Lyndale near 23rd, I heard the sound of shattering glass.

I doubled back and went around the block. I came out on the other side of the skirmish line. There was a crowd of young people on this side, too. They were smashing up two SUVs that I recognized immediately as ICE vehicles by their blacked-out windows and out-of-state plates. Guys were trading kicks at the glass. Somebody was proudly displaying a big Mexican flag. One young person jumped up on the hood and stomped her foot through the windshield. Somebody with a can of red spray-paint tagged “HANG KRISTI NOEM” on the side of the other car.

A few people pulled a locked gun safe out of the trunk of one of the cars. Somebody dumped a fingerprinting kit on the ground. Someone else was rifling through a folder of documents at a frantic pace, snapping pictures of each one with a cell phone. There was an ICE face mask in the driver-side door of the nearest SUV. Appropriately enough, there was an ice scraper on the floor of the vehicle.

Suddenly, I heard a loud bang behind me. The familiar acrid taste of tear gas filled my nostrils. I started running south with the rest of the crowd. When we got to the next intersection, however, I turned around and saw that the cops were pulling back, shooting projectiles at the crowd as they moved east on 24th. The crowd got its bearings and we turned around and ran back up to 24th. There were such huge clouds of tear gas to the east of us that I couldn’t see the cops anymore.

“This is one! This is ICE!” I heard somebody yelling excitedly. She was pointing at another silver SUV parked on 24th. I checked the plates against the database of ICE vehicles that activists keep, saw that she was correct, and instantly felt silly for doing clerical work in the middle of a riot. Someone started whacking one of the side windows with the ice scraper that had been in the previous vehicle, striking it as hard as possible. After a few swings, there was a satisfying crunch as the window gave in. People around me began kicking in these windows, too. Somebody got the driver’s side door open and threw a firecracker inside.

Some overzealous cameraman—I couldn’t tell if it was the same guy from before—muscled his way through the crowd to get a shot of the ICE vehicle receiving this treatment. “No video!” someone roared at him. “If you let him take pictures of this shit, somebody is going to jail!” A few people forcefully encouraged the cameraman to turn around and leave the area.

When the tear gas cleared, I saw that the cops were gone. It seemed too good to be true. I ran up a couple blocks to scout the perimeter. They were nowhere to be seen.

I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were. A festive block party mood had set in. People were setting off fireworks. Somebody was trying to pry open the gun case. Someone was dancing on top of a vehicle again while someone else blasted “I Don’t Fuck With You” by Big Sean. Young folks passed around a bottle of Hennessy. A lane of traffic had opened up. Some passing motorists raised their fists out the window and shouted “FUCK ICE!”

“I’m so proud of my city,” I found myself murmuring out loud. After seven weeks of atrocities at the hands of these fascists, people were finally fighting back. I thought about the liberals who were at home wringing their hands about how we were supposedly giving the feds an excuse for a crackdown (what the fuck did they think was already happening?) and posting on Facebook about the “language of the unheard.” The newfound comrades I was partying with around the looted vehicles seemed perfectly eloquent to me.

The George Floyd uprising of 2020 was never very far away. Its specter has haunted Minneapolis throughout everything that has happened for the last month and a half. Tonight, January 14, it finally assumed corporeal form again. People will remember tonight as the opening salvo of the people’s counterattack against a fascist invasion.

When history is written the way it ought to be written, it will not be our ferocity, but rather, the moderation and long patience of the Twin Cities that will make people shake their heads in wonder.",https://cdn.crimethinc.com/assets/articles/2026/01/15/1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:59:02.851258

Ward leader Jason Chavez spoke about seeing ICE questioning people based on how they looked, calling it racial profiling and noting that non-white Minnesotans have had to begin carrying passports with them to prove citizenship if stopped.

“What we are seeing in Minneapolis and this state should not be normalized,” he said.

Chavez asked Minnesotans to support their immigrant neighbors, providing mutual aid, supporting businesses and using whistles to alert people of ICE actions.

Community leaders said ICE officers were escalating the violence on the streets, not protesters, saying they were destabilizing communities and making the streets less safe.

They detailed incidents, including arrests of U.S. citizens, car accidents caused by ICE and ICE officers pushing people into traffic.

One woman described being mocked and taunted by ICE after being detained and reported that an ICE officer told her that protesters needed stop mocking them because “that’s why that lesbian b—- is dead.” She described hearing people screaming and begging in the detention center where she was held as ICE officers made small talk and joked with each other.

The woman said her friend, who was detained at the same time, was offered expedited processing for any undocumented family members if he gave up the names of undocumented people or protesters to ICE.

Minneapolis City Council President Elliot Payne said he was observing ICE operations, including one officer who was pointing his taser at people, when an officer pushed him off the sidewalk from behind.

“You have the right to observe these operations,” he said. “You have the right to keep your door shut, you have the right to demand a judicial warrant and if they do not have a judicial warrant, you do not have to open your door.”

Local leaders also announced a new, regular livestream update on the situation in Minnesota, with details to come later.

Trump comments on death of Renee Good

President Donald Trump called Renee Nicole Macklin Good‘s actions before her death “pretty tough,” seemingly backing his administration’s interpretation of the highly contested ICE shooting in Minnesota.

Good’s father, a Trump supporter, is heartbroken that the administration labeled his daughter a “domestic terrorist” within hours of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting her last week, according to CBS.

“I want to say to the father that I love all of our people,” Trump said in an interview published Tuesday.

Federal officials have consistently claimed Jonathan Ross was justified in shooting Macklin Good, who they say was attempting to run him over. But activists and lawmakers alike in Minnesota contend she was merely trying to leave the scene when she reversed her vehicle.

Trump acknowledged footage of her shooting death “can be viewed two ways, I guess,” but said there are “a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”

“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” he said. “But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.”

ICE officer who shot Renee Good had internal bleeding after: DHS

Ross suffered internal bleeding after the shooting, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation on Wednesday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has previously said Ross was hit by Macklin Good’s vehicle on Jan. 7, backing up the administration’s claims he shot her in “self-defense.”

“He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,” Noem said last week.

Minnesota ICE shooting: Protests continue, prosecutors resign

Trump’s comments come on the heels of heated protests in Minneapolis, where demonstrators are admonishing the use of force in Macklin Good’s case and calling for federal immigration agents to leave the city.

On Tuesday, federal immigration agents deployed at least four rounds of flashbangs on crowds outside an ICE facility. Protests outside the newly fenced-in Henry Whipple Federal Building also escalated throughout the day.

ICE officers were seen busting a woman’s car window, pulling her out and arresting her Tuesday after she tried to drive down the street where a protest had broken out in front of a home ICE was raiding.

The woman said she was autistic and was trying to get to a doctor’s appointment.

The Trump administration officials have stressed that anyone who tries to stop or obstruct ICE officers is committing a felony.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in a car eight days ago in Minneapolis, and the protests have spread to other cities. Trump's latest threat came a few hours after an immigration officer shot a Venezuelan man the government said was fleeing after agents tried to stop his vehicle in Minneapolis.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump wrote on social media.

Trump, a Republican, has for weeks derided the state's Democratic leaders and called the Somali community in the area ""garbage"" who should be ""thrown out"" of the country.

He has already sent nearly 3,000 federal officers into the Minneapolis area, who have carried guns through the city's icy streets, wearing military-style camouflage gear and masks that hide their faces.

They have been met frequently by loud, often angry protests by residents, some blowing whistles or banging tambourines.

The agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars, and have been shouted at for several episodes where they have stopped Black and Latino U.S. citizens and demanded identification.

'DISGUSTING AND INTOLERABLE'

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing Trump's immigration crackdown, said that just before Wednesday's shooting, two people attacked the federal officer with a broomstick and snow shovel as he wrestled with the Venezuelan man on the ground outside a home he had been running towards.

The officer ""fired defensive shots to defend his life,"" the DHS statement said. The DHS said the man had been allowed into the U.S. by the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2022 through the government's humanitarian parole program.

The Trump administration, which has sought to revoke Biden-era immigration and asylum programs, accused him of being in the country illegally.

Reuters was not able to verify the account given by DHS.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters at a late-night press conference that the FBI and Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were gathering evidence from the scene. The man's injuries were not life-threatening and he was recovering in hospital, O'Hara said.

Speaking alongside O'Hara, Mayor Jacob Frey called the ICE surge an invasion and said he had seen ""conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable.""

""We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,"" Frey said.

TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIVIDED OVER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

The Insurrection Act of 1807 is a law allowing the president to deploy the military or federalize soldiers in a state's National Guard to quell rebellion, an exception to laws that prohibit soldiers being used in civil or criminal law enforcement.

It has been used 30 times in U.S. history, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. The Supreme Court has ruled that the president alone can determine if the act's conditions have been met.

Trump has already taken the unusual step of federalizing National Guard soldiers to help with immigration law enforcement in Democrat-run cities over the objections of state governors, including in Los Angeles last year, which a judge ruled in December was unconstitutional.

Trump's aggressive moves in Minnesota have divided his supporters: 59% of Republicans favored a policy prioritizing arrests by immigration officers even if people get hurt, while 39% said officers should focus on reducing harm to people even if it means fewer arrests, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Thursday.

If Trump sends soldiers to Minnesota, he would almost certainly face legal challenges by the state. The Minnesota attorney general's office has already sued the Trump administration this week, saying the ICE surge was violating Minnesotans' rights, and on Wednesday asked U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez to issue a temporary order restraining it.

Brian Carter, a lawyer for Minnesota, told the judge that Trump's agents were engaged in a ""pattern of unlawful, violent conduct,"" including racial profiling and forced entry into residents' homes without warrants.

""They are foisting this crisis onto us,"" Carter said.

In a social media post on Thursday morning, Trump said incorrectly that the judge had ""declined to block"" the ICE surge.

In the hearing, Judge Menendez ordered the Trump administration to respond by Monday to Minnesota's complaints, saying she would rule after that, calling the issues raised by Minnesota's lawsuit ""enormously important.""

""They deal with the very fundamental relationships between the government and the state and municipalities,"" she said.

More than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence.
It was perhaps naive, she says, to believe that tech leaders were ever really kinder, gentler capitalists, even if they positioned their companies as socially progressive.
“It’s important to remember that many of these tech leaders are people who are thinking about things from a business point of view,” O’Mara says.
But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines.","Since Donald Trump returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.

But after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.

More than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.

“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”

Nikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.

Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.

Shortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.

He then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.

In response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.

Even venture capitalist Jason Calacanis, who cohosts the popular All In podcast with White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks, suggested that “masked unidentified federal agents asking people for their ‘papers’ are breaking the 4th amendment.”

Thorat, Dean, Levie, and Calacanis did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The tech sector’s response to sociopolitical crises over the past several years have been a mixed bag. During the nationwide protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder six years ago, many large tech companies issued statements against systemic racism and police brutality and pledged to diversify their workforces. Some of those commitments were criticized as being hollow, and “DEI” soon became a political flashpoint rather than a shared corporate goal. But now, in the wake of Good’s death and other reports of alleged violence by ICE agents, big tech companies and their CEOs are choosing to stay silent, a testament to how the political landscape in the US has rapidly changed.

There’s a long history in the US of business leaders avoiding taking a stand on political issues, says Margaret O’Mara, a historian who studies the history of politics and Silicon Valley. It was perhaps naive, she says, to believe that tech leaders were ever really kinder, gentler capitalists, even if they positioned their companies as socially progressive. “It’s important to remember that many of these tech leaders are people who are thinking about things from a business point of view,” O’Mara says.

But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines. “The reason why American tech has been so successful is because the political climate has been calm enough for people to build great companies,” O’Mara says. Some leaders may want to believe that ICE arrests and the icy streets of Minnesota are far enough away from their own boardrooms not to have any impact, but that belief might not hold much longer.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6965992c482e29ae79e365d8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Backlash-Against-ICE-Policing-Tactics-Business-2242486803.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 13:58:47.543549

In September, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered him deported to Syria or Algeria based on a separate rationale the Trump administration tacked on after Khalil’s arrest in Manhattan: failing to disclose certain information on his green card application.

Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., is appealing the deportation order through the Board of Immigration Appeals. Khalil’s lawyers have said that any appeal of the BIA decision, which would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, is unlikely to be successful, since the appeals court “almost never” grants stays of removal to noncitizens.

Separately, a federal district court last year ordered Khalil to be released from detention after he had been held for more than three months in Louisiana. It’s not clear what the 3rd Circuit’s ruling means for his release.

Further complicating the situation is a separate decision expected Thursday from U.S. District Judge William Young. The Boston-based Reagan appointee ruled in September that the administration had violated the free speech rights of campus activists when Young targeted pro-Palestinian international students with arrest and deportation. Now, he’s slated to decide what the remedy for those violations should be.

Young’s case centered on the arrests and attempted deportations of five activists, including Khalil. So Young’s decision could influence the administration’s next steps.

The 3rd Circuit panel consisted of Judge Thomas Hardiman, appointed by then-President George W. Bush; Judge Stephanos Bibas, appointed by President Donald Trump; and Judge Arianna Freeman, appointed by then- President Joe Biden. Freeman wrote a partial dissent, disagreeing that the matter should proceed through immigration court.

Khalil’s lawyers noted that Thursday’s decision doesn’t go into effect immediately, adding that “the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Mr. Khalil until the order takes formal effect.”

Esha Bhandari, a member of Khalil’s legal team, said the decision “does not weigh in on the core First Amendment questions in this case and we are heartened by a strong dissent.” She added that “we have several options available for next steps, including being able to seek review en banc from the Third Circuit. The status quo remains in place while we continue the legal fight.”

Khalil himself acknowledged that “the door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line,” but added: “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether the administration intends to re-detain Khalil.

“The immigration laws enacted by Congress ordinarily require an alien to challenge his deportation in a [petition for review of a final order of removal]—unless he raises questions that a court of appeals could not meaningfully review in that context. That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” Thursday’s decision said.

What we know

The Department of Homeland Security said a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis this evening after the man allegedly fled a targeted traffic stop and then attacked the officer.

The new shooting comes a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. More than 2,000 federal agents have been deployed to the city.

Good’s family thanked the public for their support, remembering Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

The Department of Homeland Security has called the operation in Minnesota its biggest to date, with more than 2,400 people having been arrested since it began Nov. 29.

Federal agents have used tear gas and pepper spray in confrontations with residents and protesters as pushback continues to grow in the days following Good's death.

Six people with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over concerns about the direction of the investigation into Good’s death, according to a source familiar with the resignations.

Officials in Minnesota sued the federal government Monday to halt the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to the state.

In video, family frantically pleads for help as they describe man shot by ICE in Minneapolis

In a live video posted to Facebook tonight, members of a family pleaded for help as they described a man who they said was shot in the leg by ICE agents.

The video, recorded from inside a home, showed several people frantically talking in Spanish to what appeared to be 911 dispatchers, one of whom seemed to be translating for the other. The video did not show anyone who appeared wounded.

“Please, help us. We have children,” a man says after several people tell the dispatcher that the person in question had been shot in the leg.

The Department of Homeland Security said tonight that a federal officer had shot a Venezuelan man in the leg after what the agency said was an “ambush.” It was not immediately clear whether the shooting described in the video was the same one referenced by federal and city officials.

NBC News has geolocated the video to the same neighborhood in North Minneapolis, where officials said the shooting occurred. The video was posted around the time of the shooting.

The person who posted the video did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The person filming the video at various points opens the curtains of a window. Red and blue flashing lights from a vehicle can been seen outside.

“They were chasing my husband for about half an hour,” a woman in the video can be heard telling dispatchers. “They were trying to crash into him and he got to the house, and since we closed the door on them, they shot him.”

The woman tells the dispatchers that ICE agents are outside the property, trying to get in.

“Tell them they shot the door,” another woman’s voice can be heard saying. “Son, come. Son, come.”

At least two young children can be seen in the video.

Mayor says ICE is 'creating chaos' but warns against 'taking the bait'

Immigration agents who have flooded the Minneapolis area are ""creating chaos,"" Mayor Jacob Frey said tonight, while also urging peace and warning protesters against ""taking the bait.""

Frey has been critical of federal immigration authorities since the fatal shooting of Good, which sparked national outrage and competing narratives between federal and local officials about what happened.

“I’ve seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable. If it were your city, it would be unacceptable there, too,” he said tonight.

But, as protesters and immigration enforcement once again clashed on the icy streets of Minneapolis, he appealed for calm.

Frey praised peaceful demonstrators while forcefully discouraging violence. The violent protesters, he said, are not helping the cause of immigrants or the residents of the city.

""And for anyone that is taking the bait tonight: Stop. That is not helpful. Go home. We cannot counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos.”

‘This is not sustainable,’ Minneapolis mayor says

The situation in Minneapolis is not sustainable, the city’s mayor said tonight, following another shooting of a civilian by a federal immigration agent.

Mayor Jacob Frey was speaking to reporters as the city, already experiencing unrest following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, was roiled further by the shooting of a man after what federal officials called an “ambush.”

“This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in. And at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to protect order,” Frey said.

The city’s police force numbers about 600 officers, he said, dwarfed by what he said are about 3,000 immigration officers in the area. The local officers, he said, should be able to focus on police work and responding to day-to-day 911 calls.

He said tonight that residents have been asking local police officers to “fight ICE agents on the streets, to stand by their neighbors.”

“We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,” Frey said.

Police chief tells protesters to immediately disperse

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara called a protest that erupted in response to the shooting tonight unlawful and called on protesters to immediately disperse.

Protesters have thrown fireworks, rocks and ice at police, he said.

“It is well past the line, and people need to leave,” he said, adding: “This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further.”

Minneapolis police chief says federal agent shot man during a struggle

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a federal agent shot a man tonight during a struggle outside a home north of downtown Minneapolis.

After he was shot, the man retreated into the home and refused to come out, O’Hara said at a news conference.

Eventually federal agents entered the home and the man was taken to a hospital, O’Hara said. The chief described the injury as non life-threatning.

O’Hara said that a person may have assaulted the officer but that he wasn't sure who. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are processing evidence at the scene, he said.

Shooting occurred miles from where Renee Good was killed

The shooting by a federal agent tonight occurred in the 600 block of 24th Avenue North, the city said, roughly 12 miles north of where Good was killed last week.

Minneapolis officials ask for calm after shooting

Minneapolis officials asked for calm after a federal immigration officer shot a man during what federal authorities described as a violent confrontation.

The city said on X that the man was hospitalized with apparently non-life-threatening injuries.

“We understand there is anger,” the city said. “We ask the public to remain calm.”

In a separate post, the city asked federal immigration authorities to leave the city and the state immediately.

""We stand by our immigrant and refugee communities — know that you have our full support,"" the city said.

Trump calls ICE shooting of Renee Good 'sad to see on both sides'

Trump today softened his tone on last week's fatal shooting of Good , calling it ""unfortunate.""

""It's so sad to see on both sides,"" Trump said in an interview with Reuters.

A week earlier, hours after the shooting, Trump said on Truth Social that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.”

Asked today whether Ross did the right thing, Trump told Reuters: “I don’t get into right or wrong. I know that it was a tough situation to be in.”

“There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers,” he added.

Federal officer shoots man in leg after 'ambush' in Minneapolis, DHS says

A federal officer shot a Venezuelan man this evening in Minneapolis after what the Department of Homeland Security described as an “ambush,"" the agency said.

The officer had been conducting a targeted traffic stop at 6:50 p.m. local time when the man left in a vehicle, which crashed into a parked car, and then ran away, the department said in a statement.

As the officer pursued the man, who the department said was in the country illegally, he assaulted the officer, according to the statement.

During the struggle, two people came out of an apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, according to the statement.

The man got loose and also began attacking the officer with a shovel or a broomstick, the department said.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,” the department said, adding that the man officers had been chasing was shot in the leg.

All three men barricaded themselves in the apartment but were taken into custody, according to the statement.

Both the man who was shot and the officer were hospitalized, the department said. Additional details about the incident were not immediately available.

Tensions grow as crowd gathers after reported shooting in Minneapolis

An angry crowd gathered tonight in a residential area where law enforcement officers were present and temporarily blocking a street.

People blew whistles, yelled expletives and threw snowballs at masked officers, video captured by NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis showed.

At one point, the officers could be seen using ""flash bang"" devices and chemical irritants on the protesters, according to the KARE reporter on the scene, and moving a perimeter closer to multiple law enforcement vehicles that had their lights activated.

Minneapolis says it's aware of reports of shooting involving federal law enforcement

The city of Minneapolis said it was aware of reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.

The city said on X tonight that it was working to confirm additional details.

Gov. Walz tells people to record 'atrocities' against Minnesotans

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz encouraged people tonight to help create a record of the “atrocities” against Minnesotans by recording immigration agents.

“You have an absolute right to peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct these activities,” he said in a brief address. “Help us create a database of atrocities against Minnesotans, not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.""

Walz cited a social media post in which Trump told Minnesotans not to fear because “THE DAY OF RECONKING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” and he pleaded with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation.”

“You’ve done enough,” he said.

ICE officer who shot Renee Good suffered internal bleeding, official says

Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis last week, suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident, a Department of Homeland Security official said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the officer had been treated at the hospital and released.

6 prosecutors who resigned from state U.S. attorney’s office identified

The six prosecutors who resigned from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota were identified as Joe Thompson, Melinda Williams, Harry Jacobs, Tom Calhoun Lopez, Ruth Shnider and Tom Hollenhorst, a source familiar with the resignations told NBC News.

Hollenhorst announced last week that he would be retiring, according to the source.

Trump threatens funding for states over 'sanctuary' cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis

Trump said that he would cut off federal funding next month for any state that includes “sanctuary” cities, expanding his attacks on mostly Democratic-run cities after days of clashes in Minneapolis.

Trump’s vow, which he made on social media, repeated comments he first made in a speech in Detroit yesterday, when he said he would halt payments starting Feb. 1 to any state that had so-called sanctuary cities, which limit local authorities’ cooperation with federal immigration officers.

Any such effort would undoubtedly be challenged in court. A federal judge in August blocked a previous attempt to freeze funding for more than 30 sanctuary jurisdictions unless they cooperated with his immigration crackdown.

Trump’s declaration came amid escalating tensions in Minneapolis, a week after a U.S. immigration officer fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen, in her car.

Good family hires noted civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci

Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who said he's dedicated to ""fervently pursuing justice on behalf"" of Good.

“It is always challenging to pursue litigation against state and local law enforcement officers because of the many immunities they are afforded. But legal action against the federal government is even more complex,"" according to a statement by Romanucci, who also represented loved ones of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man murdered by police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020.

""This process will not deter us in any way from fervently pursuing justice on behalf of Renee Good,” he said.

Renee Good's family releases a statement

Good’s family thanked the public for their support today, remembering her as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

“The kind of unending care we’ve been given during this time is exactly the kind that she gave to everyone,” her parents and four siblings said in a statement released through their attorney.

“She was our best friend with a seemingly infinite capacity for love. Nae-Nae gave everything she had to take care of her friends and family, and indeed people she never met,” the statement read. “If there was any celebration for any one of us, Nae amplified it. If there was sorrow, she was with you for all of it. Nae found joy in others being comforted and was herself a fountain of comfort.”

Her family called her their “protector” and said “we feel her absence deeply as we struggle to compose this statement without her gentle guidance.”

“Knowing we can’t match her eloquence, we are remembering Nae in all the little things she’d be doing for us today. She is in the tight hug we offer each other as we lean on the counter,” the family said. “She’s in the goofy cackles we elicit in each other as we recall sweet memories, and she’s in the tears we leave on each others’ shirts. She is in the flow state that comes when your spirit is creating something passionate to share with others. Her voice is the one singing the song stuck in your head. More than anything, she is there when your heart breaks and fills for another person.”

“When we remember Nae, we remember her abundant heart, and we will move forward imitating that unending care,” they concluded.

Joe Rogan criticizes ICE tactics: ‘Are we really going to be the Gestapo?’

Joe Rogan compared ICE to “the Gestapo” in the latest episode of his popular podcast yesterday, openly breaking with Trump on his administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.

Rogan, one of the biggest podcasters in the world, endorsed Trump in the 2024 election just days after he held a three-hour interview with him on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” The show, which has consistently retained its No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts, has more than 20.6 million subscribers on YouTube.

But yesterday, Rogan, who has been increasingly critical of Trump’s mass deportation agenda in recent months, expressed concern over ICE’s activities in an episode featuring Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. He said that “most people” believe law enforcement should arrest criminals but that many of the same people also believe ICE is “operating illegally.”

No immediate court decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown in Minnesota

A judge made no immediate decision today on Minnesota’s request to suspend the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration officer fatally shot Good on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said at the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case “on the front burner” and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

“It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,” she said of the timetable, noting that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

Menendez is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by ICE officers and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and vows not to back down. The Defense Department is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist, CNN reported.

“What we see right now is discrimination taking place only on the basis of race: Are you Latino or are you Somali? And then it is indiscriminate thereafter,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told Fox News. “In other words, they are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets, and you don’t need to take my word for it at this point. This has been very well documented.”

The president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota said four tribal members were detained at a homeless camp in Minnesota last week. Three remained in custody late last night.

“Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty,” said tribe President Frank Star Comes Out, who demanded their release.

A week later, the memorial for Renee Nicole Good is still growing

It has been a week since an ICE officer fatally shot Good in Minneapolis, and the memorial to honor her at the scene of the slaying continues to grow.

Flowers, stuffed animals and protest signs continued to pile up and adorn the spot on Portland Avenue between East 33rd and 34th streets where Good was slain by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Minneapolis mayor speaks on ICE, investigation into Renee Good's death

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he doesn’t want to eliminate Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but believes ICE agents should target states that have larger numbers of undocumented immigrants.

“This, however, is the largest immigration enforcement action on record in the United States,” he said in a Wednesday Fox News interview on “Fox & Friends.”

“Why is the largest scale immigration enforcement action taking place where we don’t even have that many undocumented immigrants? Why would it not take place in Texas or Florida or Utah where you do actually have those large numbers of undocumented immigrants,"" he said.

The Mayor continued: “That is where it would make more sense. But again, if the issue is murder or crime, the answer is we do work with the federal government. In fact, we are presently doing that. So the truth is it is not about murder or crime.”

Frey went on to say that there is “discrimination taking place only on the basis of race” in his city.

“Are you Latino or are you Somali? And it is indiscriminate thereafter. They are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets,” he said. “If this were about murder or rape or crime or fraud, then, look, we have worked together not just with the Biden administration, with the past Trump administration, with the Bush administration. We have worked with a number of administrations to successfully drive down crime. This is not about that.”

The Mayor, who called for ICE to “get the f— out” of Minneapolis following Renee Good’s death, said he wants there to be a “full and fair investigation” into what happened.

“I may have disagreements with some people that are part of your audience, but I hope that people can trust that I love my city,"" he said. ""We are experiencing an extraordinary comeback. Crime is down in virtually every category in virtually every neighborhood. Small businesses were opening. And this whole chaos that has taken place, yeah it is setting us back.”

DHS says officers were 'forced' to arrest man whose neck they kneeled on in Minneapolis

After a video posted to social media showed ICE officers kneeling on the neck of a man whom they were arresting in Minneapolis, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were ""forced"" to make the arrest after the man impeded law enforcement.

The video shows ICE officers yanking a man from his car and dragging him to the ground, while he is kicking his legs in an attempt to wrestle free. Three officers were attempting to handcuff the man, with one officer holding his arms around the man's neck while two others tried to pin him to the ground.

The officer around the man's neck then moves his hands to assist the other two officers in handcuffing the man, and replaces his hands with his knee on the man's head and neck.

DHS said the incident, which took place on Jan. 7, occurred after officers were responding to a distress call from colleagues at the scene who requested backup ""because they were being attacked by agitators."" The spokesperson said that amid the chaos, an officer who ""feared for his life"" fired his weapon in defense.

When officers arrived, ""hundreds of violent rioters swarmed them, assaulted them, and blocked their path,"" DHS said. It added that officers gave commands to the ""violent agitator who was obstructing law enforcement"" to move out of the way, but he refused and DHS said he ""clearly resisted arrest.""

DHS said officers were ""forced to arrest him for impeding law enforcement,"" and that officers used the ""minimum amount of force necessary to gain control of the violent agitator.""

The spokesperson pointed out that the social media video is slowed down at the point at which the office places his knee on the man's neck. DHS said it was actually ""a split second during a violent struggle.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe calls for release of members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota demanded the release of three tribal members who were allegedly taken into custody from a homeless encampment last week by ICE agents agents in Minnesota.

Those captured are ""tribal citizens"" and ""are not aliens,"" according to a tribe statement. The members being held are categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,"" the tribe said.

""This is not a misunderstanding or an enforcement discretion issue,"" tribal President Frank Star Comes Out said. ""This is a treaty violation. Treaties are not optional. Sovereignty is not conditional. Our citizens are not negotiable.""

Representatives for ICE, DHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs could not be immediately reached for comment today.

Stephen Miller claims Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor are guilty of terrorism

Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News last night that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both strident critics of the federal operation — were guilty of terrorism and of inciting violence.

""You can use the term insurgency, you can use the term insurrection, you can use the term domestic terrorism,"" Miller said, without outlining how either man has incited violence in the state.

Local prosecutor reiterates plan to collect evidence herself

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who along with city and state authorities was shut out of the FBI's investigation of Renee Good's death, said she still hopes to collect enough evidence herself to make her own decision on bringing criminal charges against ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Whether she manages to do that remains to be seen. Without cooperation from the FBI — which has Ross' gun, shell casings and Good's car — Moriarty said she will rely on an online portal she announced last week for the public to submit evidence, and whatever the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shares from the material it collected at the scene before it was booted from the case.

Moriarty, a former public defender who is in the last year of her four-year term as prosecutor and is not running for re-election, said in an interview that she has the legal authority to prosecute a federal officer. No matter where the evidence takes her, her goal is to add transparency to the case, she said. ""We want community members to feel as though there is documentation and perhaps accountability,” Moriarty said.

The federal investigation has already turned divisive, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying in a statement yesterday there was “currently no basis” for the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate Ross. Several prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation. At least some felt pressure to examine any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions told NBC News. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about cutting out state and local authorities.

Moriarty said she has also asked police in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs for evidence of other types of serious crimes allegedly committed by federal agents.

Federal prosecutors resign over concerns about probe into Minneapolis ICE shooting, source says

At least three prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a person familiar with the resignations told NBC News yesterday.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages from NBC News seeking comment.

The attorneys felt pressure from Justice Department leadership in both Minneapolis and Washington to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Immigration agents deploy tear gas, pepper spray in Minneapolis as confrontations grow

From high school students to elected officials, residents in Minnesota are pushing back against the growing deployment of federal immigration officers in their neighborhoods, leading to days of confrontations and protests.

Resident Neph Sudduth stopped to choke back tears as she witnessed immigration officers roaming around her neighborhood, just a few blocks from the site where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good last week, and clashing with protesters.

""They will hurt you for real! They will hurt you for real!"" she shouted at anti-ICE demonstrators, urging them to move away from the officers’ vehicles. Just then, an immigration officer rolled down his window, extended his arm and sprayed a protester point-blank in the face with a chemical agent.

Minnesota sues federal government to try to end deployment of immigration agents

Officials in Minnesota sued the federal government to halt the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to the state.

""We allege that the obvious targeting of Minnesota for our diversity, for our democracy, and our differences of opinion with the federal government is a violation of the Constitution and of federal law,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference.

Calling the deployment a federal ""invasion of the Twin Cities,"" he said: ""This has to stop.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 15, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12)and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) reintroduced the Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems (BIAS) Act, legislation to ensure that every federal agency that uses, funds, or oversees artificial intelligence (AI) has a dedicated Office of Civil Rights focused on combating AI-driven bias, discrimination, and related harms.

The bill would require federal agencies to establish or strengthen civil rights offices with staff trained in algorithmic accountability and civil rights enforcement, and to regularly report to Congress on how AI systems are impacting vulnerable communities. These reports would also include recommendations for legislative action to address emerging harms.

“I represent Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, a region that reflects both our industrial past and the technologies shaping our future. As a growing hub for innovation in Artificial Intelligence, we have a responsibility to make sure AI does not deepen the inequities Black, brown, low-income, and other vulnerable communities already face. AI carries the same biases humans do, and without oversight, those harms will be replicated if not amplified,” said Rep. Lee. ""The Eliminating BIAS Act puts real guardrails in place to demand transparency, accountability, and strong civil rights protections, especially in an age of rampant disinformation and misinformation. I’m proud to partner with Senator Markey to ensure innovation never comes at the cost of our civil rights or human dignity.”

“From housing to health care to public services, AI is increasingly being used to make consequential decisions, diagnoses, recommendations, and predictions that can significantly alter our lives,” said Senator Markey. “As the risks of bias and discrimination in AI systems become more apparent, the federal government must lead by example and protect marginalized communities that face the greatest consequences when AI goes wrong. My Eliminating BIAS Act will ensure that the government has the proper tools, resources, and personnel to protect these communities and mitigate AI’s dangerous effects, while providing Congress with critical information to address algorithmic harms.”

Algorithms are already discriminating against disadvantaged communities in a variety of contexts. For example, companies have used algorithms to exclude(link is external) users of certain gender identities from viewing job advertisements, block(link is external) advertisements for clothing made for people with disabilities, and charge higher interest rates for minorities. In addition, facial recognition technologies have the highest error rates among Black women(link is external). If left unchecked, biased algorithms will further exacerbate discrimination, inequality, and racism.

“Algorithmic systems affect nearly every part of daily life, making decisions about employment, housing, education, health, finance, and so much more. These systems have been shown to repeatedly create biased outcomes that disproportionately harm Black people and other communities of color. Yet, this administration has encouraged rapid adoption of algorithms without regard for civil rights. The Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems Act presents an alternative path where agencies are required to report the harms created by algorithmic systems and ways to mitigate them” said Jina John, Policy Counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

“Common Sense Media applauds Senator Markey for reintroducing the Eliminating BIAS Act,” said Amina Fazlullah, Head of Tech Policy Advocacy at Common Sense Media. “Without intentional choices to prioritize fairness, AI systems will not learn from past mistakes and will continue to replicate historic inequities, putting children, families, and marginalized communities at risk. This bill ensures federal agencies have the expertise, transparency, and oversight needed to identify and address discriminatory algorithms. As AI increasingly influences access to education, healthcare, employment, and housing, strong safeguards are essential to build public trust in how the government uses these technologies.”

“New America's Open Technology Institute is pleased to endorse Senator Markey's and Congresswoman Lee's Eliminating BIAS Act, which requires federal agencies to establish civil rights offices focused on bias, discrimination, and other harms that may arise from the use of algorithms. This proposed legislation centers rights and fairness in the federal government's development, use, and oversight of artificial intelligence tools. Empowering civil rights offices within federal agencies is critical to ensuring that our government uses artificial intelligence in ways that safeguard vulnerable communities and the health of our democracy.” said Prem Trivedi, Director, New America's Open Technology Institute.

“The National Urban League proudly supports the Eliminating BIAS Act—legislation that is long overdue. While AI holds great promise, far too often opaque algorithms reinforce systemic inequities that disproportionately harm Black, Brown, Indigenous, and immigrant communities. By requiring federal agencies to stand up civil rights offices staffed with technologists, mandating transparency to Congress, and establishing a cross agency working group, this bill puts accountability and equity at the heart of the government’s use of AI. Today, our government must lead by example—ensuring that technology uplifts every community,” said Marc H. Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.

The Eliminating BIAS Act is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Adam Schiff (D-Ca.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and in the House of Representatives by Reps.

The Eliminating BIAS Act is endorsed by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Common Sense Media, National Urban League, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Privacy Information Center, Free Press Action, Open Technology Institute, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, The Trevor Project, and Access Now.",https://summerlee.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 12:59:08.192603

U.S. Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing for 75 Countries

The U.S. government has announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries, effective January 21, 2026, as part of a broader immigration enforcement and vetting review. Under the directive, U.S. consular officers are instructed to pause or refuse immigrant visa issuance for affected nationals while the State Department reassesses screening standards and compliance with public charge and security-related requirements. Countries reportedly impacted include Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Yemen, and others.

The freeze applies specifically to immigrant visas processed abroad and does not impact nonimmigrant visa categories (such as B, F, H, or L visas) or adjustment of status applications filed within the United States. The measure is characterized as temporary, but no end date has been announced, creating uncertainty for applicants awaiting consular processing and for employers sponsoring employees for permanent residence from overseas.

Impact: The suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries may cause significant delays to green card timelines and consular case processing. Employers should identify affected cases, adjust mobility planning, and closely monitor State Department guidance as the pause continues.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin

The Department of State’s February 2026 Visa Bulletin reflects continued immigrant visa backlogs, with limited movement across most family- and employment-based categories. For employers, the bulletin underscores ongoing challenges in green card timing, particularly for employees chargeable to India and China, and reinforces the need for realistic workforce and retention planning.

In the employment-based categories, EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 for India and China remain unchanged, continuing long wait times with no forward movement. The most notable advancement appears in EB-3 for Rest of World, Mexico, and the Philippines, which moved forward modestly. Other employment-based categories showed little to no change. Family-sponsored categories also remained largely static, with limited movement primarily in select Mexico and Philippines preferences.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin – High-Level Movement Summary

Impact: Teams should monitor Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing closely. USCIS will accept employment-based adjustment filings using the Dates for Filing chart for February 2026, but slow movement and retrogression risk continue, underscoring the need for early sponsorship, careful tracking, and planning for extended nonimmigrant status reliance.

U.S. Visa Bond Requirements

The U.S. Department of State has updated its “Countries Subject to Visa Bonds” list, expanding the pilot program that requires certain visitors to post refundable visa bonds when applying for B-1/B-2 (business/tourist) visas. Under this Temporary Final Rule, consular officers may require applicants from designated countries to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, intended to increase compliance with visa terms and discourage overstays. The bond requirement is determined at the visa interview and is refunded if the traveler departs the U.S. before their authorized stay expires or if admission is denied.

As of January 8, 2026, the list includes 38 countries whose nationals may be subject to visa bond requirements. Many of the additions took effect on January 21, 2026, though some were already in force earlier. Nationals of these countries must post a bond only if directed by a consular officer and must also file DHS Form I-352 to secure the bond.

Impact: The expanded visa bond program may add significant cost and administrative requirements for certain B-1/B-2 travelers, including $5,000–$15,000 bonds, Form I-352 filing, and possible port-of-entry restrictions. Mobility teams should plan for added expense, update travel guidance, and proactively support affected travelers to avoid delays.

DHS Terminates Somalia’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The Department of Homeland Security has announced the termination of TPS for Somalia, with the designation set to expire on March 17, 2026. Somali nationals currently relying on TPS will lose protection from removal and work authorization unless they obtain another lawful immigration status before that date. TPS for Somalia had been in place since 1991 and was most recently extended through March 2026.

DHS stated that the termination follows a review of country conditions and a determination that Somalia no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS, though the decision has drawn criticism and may be subject to legal challenge.

Impact: Somali TPS holders will need to transition to another immigration status to maintain work authorization after March 17, 2026. Employers should identify affected employees, assess alternative status options, and plan for potential workforce impacts while monitoring for possible litigation or policy changes.

Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Immigration Policy

A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration immigration policy aimed at curtailing temporary legal status for thousands of migrants, ruling that the government’s action violated procedural and legal requirements. The decision stems from a lawsuit challenging the administration’s effort to end certain humanitarian parole or temporary status programs for migrants from multiple countries, which would have affected an estimated 10,000–12,000 individuals who were lawfully residing in the U.S. under family-based parole programs.

The judge’s order prevents the administration from moving forward with the policy pending further litigation, emphasizing that the government failed to provide the legally required notice and justification for terminating status for those individuals. This action represents a broader pattern of judicial checks on executive immigration actions, particularly those involving rollback of existing status programs without standard procedural safeguards.

Impact: The court’s ruling temporarily preserves lawful status and work authorization for affected individuals, avoiding immediate disruption for employers and employees. However, the administration may appeal, and ongoing litigation creates continued uncertainty, underscoring the need for close monitoring and contingency planning for impacted populations.

USCIS Premium Processing Fee Increase

USCIS has announced that premium processing fees will increase effective March 1, 2026, as part of a required biennial inflation adjustment under the USCIS Stabilization Act. The new fees will apply to Form I-907 requests postmarked on or after March 1, 2026, and filings submitted with outdated fees will be rejected. The increase does not affect eligibility, adjudication standards, or processing timelines.

Updated Premium Processing Fees (Effective March 1, 2026):

Impact: For in-house global mobility and immigration teams, the impact is primarily financial and operational. Premium processing is commonly used for time-sensitive cases such as H-1B and L-1 filings, OPT/STEM employment authorization, travel needs, and immigrant petition milestones, and the higher fees should be reflected in 2026 budgets and forecasts. Where possible, employers may consider filing before March 1, 2026 to use the current fee structure, and should update internal processes and coordinate with finance and external counsel to avoid filing errors.

DHS Removes One-Year R-1 Residency Requirement

Effective January 14, 2026, DHS issued an interim final rule eliminating the one-year foreign residency requirement for religious workers seeking to return to the U.S. in R-1 nonimmigrant status after reaching the five-year maximum stay. While R-1 workers must still depart the U.S. upon reaching the five-year limit, they are no longer required to remain abroad for a full year before reapplying for R-1 admission.

Washington, D.C. | The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) strongly condemns today’s State Department action freezing visa processing for nationals from 75 countries under an expanded and deeply troubling interpretation of the “public charge” doctrine.

Unlike prior travel bans that relied on overt nationality-based exclusions, this policy weaponizes economic status, health, age, disability, and other personal characteristics to justify widespread visa denials and indefinite processing freezes. Under the new guidance, consular officers are instructed to deny visas based on speculative assessments of whether an individual might rely on public benefits in the future—including considerations such as health conditions, English proficiency, age, weight, or a potential need for long-term medical care.

This approach represents a dangerous escalation. It replaces even the pretense of individualized adjudication with vague, discretionary standards that invite bias, discrimination, and arbitrary decision-making—while disproportionately impacting immigrants from the Global South, including Arab, African, Muslim, and other historically targeted communities.

By framing this mass freeze as a temporary “reassessment” of immigration procedures, the administration has effectively created an indefinite pause on family reunification, employment-based immigration, and lawful pathways to permanent residence for millions of people—without congressional authorization, clear timelines, or meaningful oversight.

ADC rejects the false premise underlying this policy: that immigrants are a burden rather than contributors and that denying entry based on income, health, or age makes the United States safer. These measures do nothing to enhance security. Instead, they institutionalize discrimination, separate families, and erode long-standing civil and human rights protections.

In light of these restrictive measures, we call on the State Department to immediately implement a robust, transparent, and functional waiver process—one that is accessible in practice, adjudicated promptly, and explicitly designed to keep families together. A waiver system that exists only on paper or that depends on unchecked consular discretion is unacceptable.

Family unity and due process are fundamental rights. ADC will continue to challenge discriminatory immigration policies and advocate for a system rooted in dignity, fairness, and equal protection under the law.

“President Trump has found yet another way not only to limit people seeking to come to the United States, but also to create misperceptions about the very real economic benefits that immigrant populations have long brought to the United States,” said Yumna Rizvi, CVT senior policy analyst.

In language from the White House, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that visa processing will be halted for immigrants from 75 unnamed countries, beginning January 21. He noted that this action is intended to stop “welfare and public benefits” from going to immigrants.

“The reality is that immigrants contribute enormously to the economic health of communities in ways that have been measured for years. In fact, immigrants paid a total of nearly $652 billion in taxes in 2023. This is in addition to the spending power they represent.

“In addition, the Trump administration has not issued its list of 75 countries, raising questions about the seriousness of this decision along with its imminent harmful impacts: this needlessly creates panic and alarm and puts thousands in limbo, including those fleeing from torture and persecution. The president uses cruel and deceptive claims like this to vilify immigrants and perpetuate harm,” Rizvi added.

The move, which will affect nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe, impacts only those seeking to immigrate to the U.S. and does not apply to student or tourism visas.

Nonetheless, it’s the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb immigration by pointing to potential use of U.S. safety net programs.

“The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,” the department posted on the social platform X.

“The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”

The list of 75 countries includes Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Brazil, Russia and Pakistan. The department said it will stop processing visas from these countries on Jan. 21.

“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” the department wrote in a follow-up post on X.

The pause, first reported by Fox News, comes amid the Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to restrict both legal and illegal immigration into the U.S., as well as its probes into social services fraud in Minnesota, which has focused on the Somali American community.

The State Department in November informed visa officers they could deny immigrant visas to those with certain medical conditions if they deem the applicant likely to rely on public benefits should they have medical issues.

That guidance instructed officers to consider both an applicant’s health and overall financial picture when determining whether to issue a visa.

Common conditions like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes were among those on the list.

Beyond limiting immigration, the State Department has also been revoking existing visas, announcing this week that it has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office a year ago.

WASHINGTON, DC — Today, a coalition of national civil rights, faith and Latino advocacy organizations led by UnidosUS held a virtual press conference demanding the U.S. Congress take immediate action to rein in heinous and excessive immigration enforcement practices that are eroding constitutional protections, undermining public safety and harming communities across the country. This press call followed a joint letter signed by 74 national, state and local organizations across the country also calling on the U.S. Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight role.

During the press conference held ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, national advocates cited growing concerns following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a mother and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis, as well as the numerous accounts of indiscriminate abuse and unwarranted deaths seen in other states couched under the guise of federal immigration enforcement operations.

“The abuse of power we have seen over the last year from this administration is unlawful, unacceptable, and un-American,” said UnidosUS president and CEO Janet Murguía. “What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable.”

In the joint letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the civil right leaders called on Congress to “enact clear, enforceable guardrails that protect constitutional rights, ensure transparency, and curb the abuse of power we see daily across the country.”

As the Trump administration approaches one year in office, the coalition emphasized that Congress has the authority and responsibility to reject unchecked funding for immigration enforcement, warning that last summer’s legislation provided the administration with unprecedented resources, including $170 billion and 10,000 additional ICE agents. This has fueled abuses of power and the weaponization of a broken immigration system, outcomes that could be repeated without meaningful guardrails and oversight.

Leaders also warned that the expansion of detention, surveillance and unaccountable enforcement, paired with inadequate training and oversight, has predictably resulted in fear, racial profiling, due process violations, wrongful detention of U.S. citizens, unsafe detention conditions and expanded surveillance practices that endanger civil liberties.

National civil rights organizations called on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in FY 2026 appropriations to rein in abuses of power and protect communities:

Congress Should Respond to Unlawful Use of the Military: Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Protect Communities from Misuse of Power: Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Restore Due Process: Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

The organizations stressed that these reforms should apply nationwide and are intended to protect the constitutional rights and safety of all communities while reinforcing Congress’s role in providing oversight of federal immigration enforcement.

The Republican counteroffer? What if we added money for body cameras?

The wide gulf between the two parties presents a major test for Democratic negotiators, who have struggled to determine where to draw the line on ICE funding. Progressives have demanded changes at the agency, after an agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota, seeking measures to bar agents from wearing masks and to require warrants for arrests.

But Democrats are also eager to enact a full-fledged appropriations bill ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Doing so would help them place financial restraints on President Donald Trump’s administration — while failing to pass a funding bill would give Trump and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought greater latitude to make spending decisions.

In short, Democrats are in a bind: Support money for ICE and own the tortured politics of funding that organization, or oppose ICE funding and give the administration the power to make all sorts of spending decisions.

Democrats — or, at least, some of them — would support ICE funding if that legislation came with significant restrictions. But instead of actually negotiating on those principles, Republicans are hoping the body cams could be a workaround, as both parties try to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.

According to Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev. — chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that controls Homeland Security funding — Republicans want to send Democrats a new offer soon on Homeland Security funding. He told MS NOW that the offer would include more money for body cameras for ICE agents.

Amodei conceded that Democrats have “legitimate concerns” about accountability at ICE, but he said major policy changes are “not under serious consideration.”

Meanwhile, Amodei seemed to think a funding boost for body cameras could give Democrats a chance to claim a small victory. “You can walk away and say, ‘Hey, we moved the needle on the dial,’” Amodei said.

Democrats, however, have been quick to reject the idea.

“ICE has enough money. We’re not giving them any more,” the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told MS NOW.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., agreed.

“I’m not a cheap date, so no,” McGovern told MS NOW. “Not for me. That doesn’t satisfy me.”

Amodei’s pitch falls far short of a demand by members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who took a formal position against any Homeland Security appropriations bill that doesn’t include “meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices,” the group said in a statement.

That could include stopping agents from wearing masks, requiring warrants for arrests, an end to the use of private detention facilities and requiring federal officials to share information with state law enforcement, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told reporters.

But Republicans aren’t interested in those proposals.

Hard-line conservatives in the House could support more money for body cameras, but there’s no appetite for restrictions on agents wearing masks, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told MS NOW.

“As soon as they stop doxing our ICE agents, I’d be willing to discuss that,” Harris said.

Other Democrats have shifted their focus from policy changes to stricter limits on the Trump administration’s ability to move money around unilaterally.

Recommended

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top Senate Democrat on the subcommittee that funds the Department of Homeland Security, said he’s seeking stricter constraints on the Trump administration’s ability to shift money from one program to another. He cited the involvement of Homeland Security Investigations in ICE raids and the diversion of funds to pay for the South Florida immigration detention center nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Murphy separately outlined policy changes he’s seeking at ICE, including a requirement for warrants, a ban on masks during enforcement operations and a requirement for Border Patrol officials to stay at the border. When it comes to appropriations talks, though, Murphy said he’s trying to stay realistic.

“I understand I’m not going to get all my complaints solved in the DHS appropriations bill,” Murphy told reporters. “So I’m not trying to write a perfect bill. I’m simply trying to make it as hard as possible for the money to be used for the purposes, for other purposes other than what Congress intends.”

Other negotiators aim to attach policy changes to the funding measure.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top House Democratic appropriator, told MS NOW that Democrats are “exploring policy riders, looking at the best way to proceed” in the funding negotiations.

DeLauro said the stance held by the Progressive Caucus isn’t a fringe demand. Democrats are united in pushing for changes at ICE as part of funding talks, she said.

“It’s not a wing of the party — this is a uniformity,” DeLauro told MS NOW. “Everyone is so upset about the terrors in their communities. This is widespread. So it’s not a particular caucus.”

Republicans view the whip count differently.

According to Amodei, Republicans were never counting on progressive Democrats to vote for a measure to fund the DHS. And the idea that progressives would support a DHS funding bill only got more farfetched after the shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota.

The Republican offer is meant to be an olive branch to Democrats who are less concerned about major policy changes and more focused on avoiding a full-year continuing resolution, which gives the Trump administration more flexibility to spend money as they wish.

“It sure as hell didn’t help put the bill to bed,” Amodei said of the ICE shooting’s effect on funding negotiations. “But we also realize there are some folks on the D side who were never going to vote for a DHS bill. And it’s like, OK, tell me how you win with a full-year CR.”

His warning came just hours after a federal officer shot a man in the leg after an attempted traffic stop in Minneapolis on Wednesday night. Protests against federal immigration operations exploded after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross earlier this month.

Trump floated using the Insurrection Act several times last year, including in October, citing the need for “safe cities” across the country.

Deploying the military for domestic law enforcement purposes usually requires congressional authorization, but invoking the 19th-century law would permit Trump to do so unilaterally. It also allows for the federalization of National Guard troops under certain circumstances. The law is rarely used. President George H.W. Bush was the last to invoke it, during the Los Angeles riots in 1992.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday, “Minnesota needs ICE to leave, not an escalation that brings additional federal troops beyond the 3,000 already here. The mayor’s priority is keeping local law enforcement focused on public safety, not diverted by federal overreach.”

On Wednesday evening, Walz, a Democrat, said that the presence of ICE officers was no longer “a matter of immigration enforcement.”

“Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government,” he said. “Let me say once again to Donald Trump and Kristi Noem — end this occupation. You’ve done enough.”

The Trump administration escalated immigration enforcement in Minneapolis last month after conservative influencers brought new attention to allegations of day care fraud involving Somali immigrants in the region. However, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families said investigators determined that child care facilities involved in the recent fraud allegations were operating normally.

Trump and his allies have seized on the allegations, publicly attacking both Minnesota Democrats and Somali immigrants. Last month, he accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., the first Somali American to serve in Congress, of being “one of the many scammers.” Omar has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it’s ending temporary protected status for Somalis, saying that those with TPS must leave the U.S. by March 17.

The president has also repeatedly lashed out at Walz, who was the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president.

“Moronic Tim Walz has allowed Minnesota to become overrun by Somali fraudsters who steal from American Taxpayers, and take advantage of our generosity,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. “Tim is completely incompetent, which is why he lost big time last year, and bowing out of Re-Election is the only good decision he has ever made.”

Walz announced earlier this month that he was ending his re-election bid for a third term, citing the focus on the fraud allegations, in order to fully focus on the work of being governor.

“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-trump-rs-e97865.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 11:58:26.496913

That holding came from U.S. Circuit Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, both of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, who said that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, his claims needed to be instead heard through an appeal of a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

""The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on—in a petition for review of a final order of removal,"" they wrote in an unsigned opinion.

Khalil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was arrested on March 8 by immigration agents in the lobby of his university residence in Manhattan.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, had called the protests antisemitic and vowed to deport foreign students who took part. Khalil became the first target of this policy.

Though Khalil was initially detained in New York, by the time his lawyer sued over his detention there, immigration officials had moved him to New Jersey, leading his case to be transferred to a judge there.

He walked out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center in June, after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to release him from custody.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, attributed the reversal to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. having “bowed to public pressure.”

“These are cuts he should not have issued in the first place,” she said in a statement. “He must be cautious when making decisions that will impact Americans’ health. Our policy must be thoughtful — not haphazard and chaotic. This episode has only created uncertainty and confusion for families and healthcare providers.”

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 85, is heading for the exits after nearly four decades in Congress. So is her longtime deputy, Rep. Steny Hoyer, 86, and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 83.

But of the two dozen members of the Silent Generation now serving in the 119th Congress, more than half (13) have decided to run again in 2026, according to an NBC News analysis.

In total, this Congress is the third-oldest in U.S. history, with an average age of 58.9 years at the start of this session one year ago. The median age in the U.S. is 39.1.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., today endorsed former union organizer Analilia Mejia ahead of a special election in New Jersey's 11th District, which has been vacant since former Rep. Mikie Sherrill's resignation following her win in the state's gubernatorial race in November.

""Analilia Mejia is a fighter for working people who has been on the frontlines of some of our most critical battles — from immigrant rights and universal healthcare to higher wages and real accountability for the powerful. I know she will bring that fight to Congress on day one and I am proud to support her run to represent NJ-11 in Congress,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.

Nearly a dozen Democrats are running to replace Sherrill in this Democratic-leaning seat, including former Rep. Tom Malinowski, Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, veteran Army paratrooper Zach Beecher and Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill.

Mejia has also secured endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., whom she worked for during his 2020 presidential campaign, and Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.

Malinowski touts an endorsement from Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., and Gill has been endorsed by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who will finish his term later this month.

Trump pushed ahead with his aim of “conquering” one European territory, Denmark’s top diplomat said after a high-stakes meeting in Washington on yesterday.

The president then sided with the man who invaded another, casting Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy rather than Russia’s Vladimir Putin as the obstacle to peace, in his latest reversal on the conflict already raging on the continent.

His comments drew new pushback from leaders in Europe, whose alarm over U.S. actions had for weeks been focused further north.

Iran signaled it would not move ahead with executing protesters and reopened its airspace today as Trump left it unclear whether he would take military action over the regime’s deadly crackdown.

The United States began evacuating key personnel from its largest military base in the Middle East yesterday as the prospect of an American strike loomed and activists said the death toll in Iran had passed 2,500. And the United Nations Security Council said it had scheduled an emergency meeting this afternoon at the request of the U.S.

But Trump told reporters that he had learned the Iranian regime had stopped killing protesters and halted plans for executions, either of which he had said could trigger a U.S. military response. And Iran’s judiciary said today that a man feared to be facing execution would not face the death penalty.

Trump posted on Truth Social early this morning that this was “good news. Hopefully, it will continue!”

The panel ruled the federal district court in New Jersey did not have jurisdiction over the matter because immigration challenges are handled differently under the law.
In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia instructed the lower court to dismiss Khalil’s habeas petition, a court filing that secured his release. The panel ruled the federal district court in New Jersey did not have jurisdiction over the matter because immigration challenges are handled differently under the law.

In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple—not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

The law bars Khalil “from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition,” the panel added.

“We are disappointed by and strongly disagree with the majority’s opinion, but take heart in the powerful dissenting opinion and will continue to fight against his unlawful persecution and detention through all available legal avenues,” said Khalil’s attorney, Baher Azmy, in a statement to CNN.

The decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia University, Khalil was arrested at his apartment on March 8, 2025. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his firstborn son.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to back up the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct.

The government has justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to US foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump’s administration then appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should ultimately fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court. They have also accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

Khalil has dismissed those allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

The appeals court decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system is weighing a previous order from an immigration judge that found Khalil could be deported. His attorneys have argued that the federal order should take precedence.

That judge has suggested that Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he would face mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap26015521561946.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-15 11:59:01.277115

Legislators are not the only ones to jump into the fray to oppose ICE agents in their states. Twenty-one democrat state attorney generals (AGs) sent a letter to Members of Congress urging them to pass legislation to prohibit immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity. In their letter they claimed that ICE agents wearing masks “have the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.” These AGs further contend that “the commonplace use of masks and the failure of ICE to identify themselves as law enforcement makes everyone less safe and weakens the integrity of our justice systems.”

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justifiably says that these legislative bans “stoke dangerous rhetoric against ICE agents.” In a January 8 statement released by DHS, the agency pointed out that ICE officers now face “a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.”

California was the first, and so far, the only state to pass legislation prohibiting masking. The legislature passed the No Secret Police Act, Senate Bill (SB) 627 which Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law on September 20.

On November 17, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit to block the implementation of California’s law which was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, but was paused to allow the court to hear arguments in the case on January 14. In its complaint, DOJ asserted that the law violates the Supremacy clause by attempting to regulate federal agencies and forcing them to adopt certain policies. The complaint also stated that the federal government will not comply with this unconstitutional law that “recklessly disregards officers’ safety and federal operational needs.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/ICE-agents-wearing-masks-in-camo-ICE-flickr.jpg.webp?itok=eLQy3LWD,N,,2026-01-15 11:00:11.664183

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/14/11142026Noem/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:58:50.169116

His administration has created chaos, trampled on our rights, and harmed so many of us. But the ACLU has been fighting back — and winning. Now, we're telling the story of the first year of our fight against the Trump administration’s second term, our lessons learned, and our path forward.

We were prepared for this fight from day one.

Before President Trump was elected, we examined his campaign promises — including those outlined in Project 2025 — and outlined a plan for how we would fight to protect the rights and liberties of all people. We spent months plotting out our litigation and advocacy strategy across the country, building a plan to ensure that cities and states would be a Firewall for Freedom — a shield defending against a federal government attacking civil rights and civil liberties.

Within hours of President Trump's inauguration, it was clear that he and his administration would, once again, test the Constitution and the willingness of our nation’s institutions and people to defend it. But we were ready. The ACLU mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing. In 2025, we took over 230 legal actions against the Trump administration, with remarkable success: 64% of our lawsuits have delayed, diluted, or defeated the Trump administration’s agenda.

But despite everything we’ve accomplished so far, we cannot underestimate the continued speed and ferocity of this assault on civil rights and civil liberties or the impact it will continue to have on us all. And as we enter 2026, the stakes feel as high as ever.

Unceasing attacks came from governments, including the most powerful, as well as from the private sector and non-state groups, pushing agendas in opposition to human rights. Many of these assaults are amped up by technology, with the methods and means becoming ever cheaper and ever more accessible to the masses.

An annual analysis from the Dublin-based international rights group Frontline Defenders paints a devastating picture of killings, arbitrary detention, surveillance, and harassment. CIVICUS, an organization that measures civic space (defined as “the respect in policy, law and practice for freedoms of association, expression and peaceful assembly and the extent to which states protect these fundamental rights”), documented declines in 15 countries and improvements in only three. The location and nature of the drops were diverse, taking place from mature democracies such as the United States, Germany, France, and Switzerland, to authoritarian regimes such as Burundi and Oman, and including countries in crisis and conflict such as Sudan and Israel. Some types of human rights were uniquely politicized and singled out in 2025, including women’s rights and environmental rights. Freedom House recorded the 19th straight year of declines in global freedom.

All this is compounded by an unprecedented slash-and-burn to international aid budgets for organizations and individuals working on human rights worldwide. The Human Rights Funders Network of almost 450 institutions across 70 countries estimates that by 2026, human rights funding globally will experience a $1.9 billion reduction compared to levels in 2023.

Taken together, this makes the world more dangerous than ever for human rights defenders and they have fewer resources at their disposal to combat the threats.

In 2026 and moving forward, two crucial questions arise for the defense of human rights globally. First, who will do the work of fighting to protect and advance human rights in the year ahead, and second, how can those in the international community still fiercely committed to human rights support them? These questions will be shadowed by another trend: impunity. Yet, at the same time, lessons and a few positive developments from 2025 can guide human rights defenders on how to seize opportunities in the coming year, beginning even this month at the United Nations.

The Earthquakes of 2025

Eviscerating Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance Assistance

In the United States, 2025 began with the newly inaugurated Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and canceling approximately 85 percent of its programming (from a budget of more than $35 billion in the fiscal year ending in September 2024). The gutting eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars of support for those working to protect human rights and expand freedom and democracy around the world. The State Department’s grantmaking efforts were similarly cut, with more than half of its awards canceled, including programs directly supporting human rights defenders such as one initiative providing emergency financial assistance to civil society organizations and a fund to promote human rights and democracy and respond to related crises.

Most other major donor countries followed suit, though not with the same sweep or to nearly the same degree. Canada said it would reduce foreign aid by $2.7 billion over the next four years, the Dutch announced structural spending cuts of € 2.4 billion on development aid starting in 2027, and the European Union announced a €2 billion reduction in its main mechanism for development aid for 2025-2027. Multilateral funders were not immune to the trend: the United Nations, for one, will see major budget and staffing cuts for human rights in 2026.

The U.S. retreat from foreign assistance rapidly impacted all development sectors, from health, to education, to humanitarian assistance, but no sector was targeted with such enmity as that of democracy, human rights, and governance. Advocates and implementers saw not only the dire resource clawbacks discussed above, but also found themselves tarred by a steady diet of derisive commentary from the very policymakers doing the cutting.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who, once championed human rights and democracy “activists” as a U.S. Senator, even serving on the board of the democracy-promoting International Republican Institute before the administration eliminated the congressional funding that supported it. He once told a crowd at the Brookings Institution “[f]oreign aid is a very cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and our economic interests.”

But as secretary of state, he abruptly reversed course, writing last April that the State Department unit overseeing civilian security, human rights, and democracy had “a bloated budget and unclear mandate,” and that its “Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor had become a platform for left-wing activists to wage vendettas against `anti-woke’ leaders in nations such as Poland, Hungary.” Other members of the administration were similarly sharp-tongued about the sector, with now-former USAID Administrator Pete Marocco conflating the promotion of “civic society” with “regime change” in official court documents and President Donald Trump himself referring to USAID’s leadership as “radical lunatics.”

The rhetoric mirrors similar language used by authoritarians across the globe who have long been opposed to foreign assistance for democracy, human rights, and governance work, and it has real-world consequences for those advocating for human rights and freedom. Leaders of multiple countries have seized on the words of the Trump administration to launch spurious investigations of human rights defenders and other civil society activists who had received U.S. funding.

Closing Civic Space and New Technology

Closing civic space is not a new threat to human rights defenders, but it is one that has reached a fevered pitch in the last few years. This has included both an increase in traditional attacks and a greater reliance on new tactics for suppression, especially in the digital sphere.

Nearly 45 percent of all civic space violations CIVICUS recorded for its annual analysis were related to the freedom of expression. The organization documented more than 900 violations of the right to peaceful assembly and more than 800 violations of freedom of association. The most frequent examples were detentions of protesters and journalists, followed by the detention of human rights defenders outside the context of a protest or journalism, merely for doing their work.

Authoritarian regimes also have become ever more adept at utilizing the digital space for repression. Tactics such as doxing, censorship, smearing, and online harassment are important tools in an authoritarian approach. They have been supplemented in recent years by less evident tactics such as shadow-banning, which the CIVICUS analysis defined as when “a platform restricts content visibility without notifying the user,” allowing the platform to maintain an appearance that it is neutral.

Women rights defenders face additional risks online, including technology-facilitated gender-based violence: In a global survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 38 percent of women reported personal experience with violence online, from hacking and stalking to image-based sexual abuse.

Attacks in the digital space often are also connected with or fuel physical attacks, “including killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and harassment,” as Frontline Defenders reported in its analysis. Tunisia is paradigmatic. Amnesty International reported that, beginning in 2024, a “wave of arrests followed a large-scale online campaign…which saw homophobic and transphobic hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against LGBTI activists and organizations spreading across hundreds of social media pages, including those espousing support for the Tunisian President Kais Said. Traditional media outlets also broadcast inflammatory messages by popular TV and radio hosts attacking LGBTI organizations, calling for their dissolution and for the arrests of LGBTI activists.”

What to Expect for Human Rights in 2026

The absence of meaningful and unified international pushback to human rights abuses by some of the world’s most powerful nations means the rights-based international system will continue to face unprecedented attacks, and the challenges that rights defenders face in the year ahead are likely to increase in number and intensity. Authoritarians worldwide have monitored the assault against human rights in the past year — from genocide in Gaza to the crackdowns on protesters in Tanzania to restrictions on freedom of association and expression in El Salvador and so many more instances — and they have learned that they are unlikely to be held accountable internationally in the near term.

Yet despite these challenges, a few developments in 2025 offer some reasons for optimism in the year ahead. Several large-scale, youth-led movements in 2025 held their governments accountable for rights violations, from the July Revolution in Bangladesh that ousted an abusive prime minister to the Gen Z protests in Kenya over economic conditions and government corruption, a protest moniker that spread to other countries as well.

Some governments passed rights-protecting laws, from Thailand’s legalization of same-sex marriage to Colombia’s laws preventing child marriage. Courts stood up for human rights and held perpetrators to account, from the International Criminal Court’s conviction of Sudan’s Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for war crimes and crimes against humanity to the U.S. conviction of The Gambia’s Michael Saang Correa for torture, to the symbolic judgment of the People’s Tribunal for Women of Afghanistan. These trends are likely to continue in 2026, despite the challenges, because courageous human rights defenders are using every avenue to fight for rights.

This year will also bring targeted opportunities to continue the fight for human rights. A preparatory committee for a proposed international crimes against humanity treaty begins work this month at the United Nations. Also at the U.N., this year’s Universal Periodic Reviews, a regular peer review of countries’ human rights records, will focus on some of the world’s worst rights offenders — including Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda — as well as countries with highly mixed records. These reviews provide an opportunity for the world to examine, publicly and critically, the rights records of all 193 countries and for victims and activists to share their stories and insights. While the United States has not submitted its self-evaluation due late last year, the process continued with the usual submissions from the U.N. and others.

Creative activists also are likely to use prominent events, such as the 2026 Olympic Games, to push for the expansion and recognition of human rights. They can take the opportunity of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebrations to highlight and internationalize the country’s founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the requirement that all governments “[derive] their just powers from the consent of the governed.”

Who Will Lead the Fight for Human Rights in 2026?

As many governments pull back and even attack human rights, the work of human rights defenders and organizations will become more critical than ever. Some of them have been leading the fight for decades, including leading international NGOs, national organizations, networks, and prominent individual leaders. Others have done critical human rights work but haven’t labeled themselves as rights defenders, such as organizations providing access to clean water, supporting girls’ education, or working to prevent violent conflict.

Many work at the community level, alongside neighbors and friends, with human rights defenders networks around the world, from the Mozambique Human Rights Defenders Network to Somos Defensores in Colombia. Some are in exile, fighting for rights in their home countries and for refugee and diaspora communities, like the brave Afghan women who organized a landmark People’s Tribunal in 2025 to expose rights violations against women. Others are professionals whose skills directly relate to human rights — lawyers, judges, journalists, and more. They include people like the brave journalists who continue to report on the context in Gaza, despite the incredible risks, and the Burmese lawyers who continue to document rights violations. Some are individual activists, using their platforms and skills to protect rights and call attention to attacks against them, like Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi who was recently detained alongside other rights defenders while attending a memorial service for a human rights lawyer. Some are informal coalitions, student and youth groups, or protest participants — social movements have been and will be an essential component of the fight for human rights. All of these actors play a critical role in the human rights ecosystem. All of them are human rights defenders.

Aid funding cuts have devastated civil society organizations and will continue to impact human rights advocates. A survey by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and International IDEA of 125 civil society organizations based in 42 countries found that 84 percent of respondents had lost funding due to U.S. and other countries’ aid cuts, with the same number expecting further cuts in 2026. UN Women reported that more than one in three women’s rights and civil society organizations have suspended or shut down programs to end violence against women and girls and more than 40 percent have scaled back or closed life-saving services. The philanthropic organization Humanity United found that 44 percent of peacebuilding organizations that it surveyed would run out of funds by the end of 2025.

These cuts will only be amplified as time goes on, as fewer young people can become human rights professionals while managing to put food on the table, as legal cases that take years to process aren’t filed for lack of funding, as human rights abuses aren’t documented, as the attacks from authoritarian regimes go unchecked. Shrinking development budgets will no longer provide similar levels of support to courts and anti-corruption bodies that human rights defenders have traditionally approached to pursue justice or for support hotlines where ordinary people can call in anonymously to report abuses at the hands of security forces. Such foreign assistance enabled vital avenues of accountability, but also signified solidarity, that at least some political decisionmakers both at home and abroad believed in human rights and supported those working to deepen and protect them.

But despite the myriad challenges, there will be human rights defenders who continue to fight the fight. For many, changes in funding or the withdrawal of political top-cover won’t stop them from finding avenues. One need only look at Iran’s protests today, where thousands of people are exercising and demanding their human rights amidst a brutal crackdown, internet blackout, and without international funding. Rights defenders have been doing a lot with a little for many years. Some — especially women, youth, Indigenous people, and disabled defenders — have often been excluded from human rights funding and support in the past. A new generation has seen the horrors of Gaza, El-Fasher, eastern Ukraine, or even around the corner from their home, in the news and online, and they have committed themselves to social justice and the prevention of atrocities.

Human rights has always been a universal endeavor which has required diverse supporters, advocates, and allies – this is true now more than ever.

How Can the International Community Support?

Even those governments and institutions that continue to lead in supporting human rights internationally will need to do more with less, as the above-outlined cuts exemplify, to support those on the front lines. This is the chance to shift “localization” – the practice of funding local civil society organizations directly and based on their priorities, rather than via large overhead-requiring NGOs funded by donor countries — from an ideal to a necessary strategy. A grant of $20,000 may not keep a major international organization online, but it can fund a community-based service provider. Donors can integrate a rights-based approach across portfolios instead of siloing the issue, integrating human rights goals and strategies into other foreign policy initiatives. For example, companies can integrate human rights efforts and measurements into their supply chains for products from batteries to chocolate, producing products they would already produce but in a way that advances human rights as well. Military operations can add human rights and gender considerations with little cost but potentially huge impact. This requires training, tools, and high-level political will to succeed. And they can continue to advocate for rights and use diplomatic pressure and support as key tools.

The elephant in the room is the United States. The Trump administration not only is backtracking on the traditional U.S. commitment and values of democracy and human rights internally and internationally but also has sought to hamper others in funding such initiatives. But there are still important steps that can be taken to protect human rights. Congress must do its job and provide oversight, holding the administration accountable to the laws that protect this important work. Members should speak out against injustices and rights violations, at home and abroad. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), for example, has played a key role in the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, calling out rights abuses in places like Turkey, and Rep. Tim Kennedy (D-NY) led a congressional letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the Trump administration to overturn its decision to terminate Temporary Protective Status for Burmese people. State governments have always played a key role in advancing rights, and this will become more critical than ever.

Foreign governments that have engaged on human rights issues but haven’t been the largest international donors or advocates will be particularly important. Some of them are stepping up already. Examples include Japan playing a leading role in advancing women’s issues, South Africa and Gambia taking cases to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel and Myanmar, respectively, of violating the Genocide Convention, and Ireland continuing its steadfast allyship with human rights defenders.

Now is the time for committed countries around the world to continue to demonstrate the global nature of this agenda, set out more than 75 years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reinvigorated by 18 international human rights treaties.

Philanthropy and the international private sector will be more essential than ever in 2026. Foundations cannot offset the huge funding gaps left by governments and multilateral donors — total U.S. philanthropic giving is about $6 billion per year, whereas U.S. overseas development assistance alone in 2023 accounted for $223 billion — but they can provide strategic investments that help protect rights and those defending them, amplify their voices, fund innovative new approaches, and help the ecosystem survive. Philanthropies around the world provided nearly $5 billion in human rights support globally in 2020 alone, and their funding is critical for many organizations.

Companies have their own role to play, one that includes but goes well beyond corporate social responsibility, from responsible tech and AI to eliminating forced labor from supply chains to hiring diverse employees. The private sector has a unique opportunity to ensure that human rights remain on the global agenda, because there is a strong business case in favor of human rights protections and alliances with those who truly understand the needs and wants of local populations. A great example is the effort by numerous auto and electronics companies to move away from cobalt batteries, both a recognition of the horrible rights violations facing individuals and communities around cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a recognition that this move is also better for business due to supply chain volatility.

Defending against challenges to human rights, democracy, and good governance in 2026 and beyond will require creativity and broad coalition-building across sectors that too often are siloed, such as health, peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and the field of democracy, human rights, and governance. Everyone who does not traditionally think of themselves as a human rights defender, from government officials to the private sector, will need to step up to support those on the frontlines of the fight to defend human rights.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2233982389.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:35.435549

Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
“She needs to be held accountable for her actions.” The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.
“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday.
“Families are forever torn apart.” “I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences.
“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”","Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Kelly outlined three impeachment articles against the secretary, accusing Noem of obstruction of Congress, “violation of public trust” and “self-dealing.”

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, L.A., New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham, and communities north to south to east to west,” Kelly said at the press conference. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions.”

The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.

Kelly explained the second article, which accuses Noem of violating public trust, by saying Noem “directed DHS agents to arrest people without warrants, use tear gas against citizens, and ignore due process.”

Kelly said Noem frequently says “she’s taking murderers and rapists off our streets, but none of the 614 people arrested during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago has been charged or convicted of murder or rape.”

On the third impeachment article, which accuses the secretary of self-dealing, Kelly said Noem “abused her power for personal benefit,” and “steered a federal contract to a new firm run by a friend.”

Kelly, who is running for the Senate in Illinois, announced her intention to file the impeachment articles last week, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.

“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday. “Families are forever torn apart.”

“I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences. I am watching you, members of Congress are watching you, the American people most importantly are watching you. And most of all, we are not liking what we’re seeing,” Kelly said.

While the effort is unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controled House, the congresswoman said that as of Wednesday morning the measure has the support of almost 70 members of Congress, and she expects more to sign on.

“We’re trying to build more sponsors of the legislation,” she said, when asked at the press conference if she expects to get a majority of House Democrats on board. “I mean, people joined on quickly when I put it out there, people contacted me almost immediately, and it’s been growing and growing as people find out about it.”

She said she has spoken to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) about the effort but would not say directly whether he supports it.

“You’ll have to answer to Jeffries, but I would not be standing here if I was told not to,” she said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last year became the first Cabinet official in recent history to be impeached by the House when Republicans secured a narrow 214-213 vote.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) brushed off the impeachment effort as “silly.”

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Hill.

“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/kellyrobin_011426gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:17.825063

Neither cities nor Mills have confirmed where they are hearing about the possible ICE activity.

Mills addressed the possibility of federal law enforcement operations in Maine in a video statement Wednesday evening.

She said her administration has tried unsuccessfully to confirm whether any operations are planned, but is coordinating with municipalities, including Portland and Lewiston, along with law enforcement, to prepare.

""I have directed the Maine State Police to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations,” Mills said. “If they come here, I want any federal agents – and the President of the United States – to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest. We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice.""

Mills urged anyone considering protesting to do so peacefully.

""For those of you who may consider protesting, I fully support your right to do so, and I urge you to do so peacefully – to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve,"" Mills said. ""Know this: Maine will not be intimidated, and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.""

""For reasons of operational security and officer safety, ICE does not comment on any ongoing, upcoming or potential operations,"" an ICE spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine.

RELATED: Maine’s Somali community reacts after Trump administration ends protected status program

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline, Portland Mayor Mark Dion, and King also released statements Wednesday about the possibility of ICE agents coming to Maine.

From Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline:

It’s my understanding that there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them in the street, visits their home, or visits their business. As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law.

I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents. Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe.

From Portland Mayor Mark Dion:

Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week. We are a welcoming city. There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents. In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.

The City Council and I stand, not apart, but with our lawfully admitted immigrant and refugee communities. I urge our residents to look out for one another. Know your rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops you on the street, visits your home, or arrives at your business or place of employment. As a reminder, Portland Police does not cooperate with ICE and they do not participate in enforcing federal immigration law. If you decide to protest or demonstrate, keep your efforts peaceful and consistent with the expectations for lawful behavior that we all share.

NEWS CENTER Maine is still working to independently confirm the mayors’ and the governor’s statements regarding potential federal operations in Maine.

From Sen. Angus King:

Like many in Maine, I have begun to hear rumors of imminent federal law enforcement activities coming to our state. Given the videos and headlines we have seen from operations conducted in other states – many of them reckless, heartless, and irreversibly destructive – I share the same worries many of you have.

Maine believes in law and order. We enjoy that order because our state and local law enforcement authorities place a priority on lawful and timely responses to clear criminal threats.

Abraham Lincoln once reminded Americans in the face of conflict to have faith that ‘right makes might, and in that faith let us do our duty as we understand that.’ In the days ahead, I want to encourage everyone to look out a little closer for one another and be mindful of the rights that our Constitution gives to every man, woman, and child in this nation. If you witness any lawlessness done cloaked in the cause of federal law enforcement, please alert your local leaders, state officials, and federal delegation.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week.
But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics.","When Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer last week in Minnesota, it brought attention to the robust effort to combat US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Twin Cities. Residents of Minneapolis and the surrounding areas are joining decentralized networks of activists who are committed to alerting their neighbors to ICE presence on their blocks.

Madison McVan, a reporter for the Minnesota Reformer, rode along with some of those activists to observe their tactics. The activists patrol their neighborhoods looking for ICE officers. When they find them, they alert their networks and tail the officers so their neighbors know where ICE is in the city. These patrols have led to tense standoffs with ICE officers and have drawn accusations of “domestic terrorism” from the Trump administration.

McVan spoke with Today, Explained co-host Noel King about what she experienced while riding along with activists and how these networks sprang up in the first place. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There’s much more in the full podcast. So listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You’ve been riding along with Minneapolis residents who are tailing ICE as a form of resistance. What’s that been like?

It’s been intense. The idea is that if residents follow ICE and record them, that they can possibly prevent arrest from taking place at all.

Key takeaways

Minnesotans are following ICE vehicles in the Twin Cities and alerting their neighbors that officers may be in the area.

Since Renee Good’s killing, the activists have shown more resolve and their numbers have increased.

ICE has responded by trying to intimidate the activists, driving to their homes and telling them they could be arrested for obstructing their operations.

And is it working?

The people I rode along with think it is working. They basically say if we follow ICE and we record them, they’re a lot less likely to get out of their cars and start asking people for their citizenship documentation and that kind of thing.

Tell me what you’ve experienced when you’ve been in the car with these people.

There’s usually one person driving and then a second person manning the phones. And so the passenger is following along with a group chat. They’re on a group call with other people in the neighborhood who are doing the same thing, so they can correspond about where they’re seeing ICE and notify each other when someone finds ICE and starts following the vehicle.

This kind of plays out [in] a pattern that I’ve seen over and over now, which is that the observers start following an ICE vehicle. The ICE vehicle identifies themselves as federal officers by checking to see if they’re being followed. They turn into a side street or they do an aggressive maneuver, or they start weaving through parking lots — seeming to make sure they’re being followed. And then at some point they stop the vehicle, the observers stop behind them, the ICE agents get out of the car, surround the vehicle, and tell the observers to stop following them — that they’re obstructing ICE operations and that they may be arrested if they continue following.

When I was riding along with a pair of observers, they were following an ICE vehicle, and that exact thing happened. ICE officers got out of their vehicles, they surrounded the car, and one officer told the driver, stop following us or we’ll arrest you. The observers decided to continue following the car, and the ICE vehicle drove straight to the address of one of the observers that was in the car. So it seemed like they were doing some kind of, looking up of the identity of the person who owned the vehicle and then driving to their home address.

The ICE vehicles stopped at the observer’s home and then kept going, and so the observers decided to continue following the vehicles. Two of the vehicles in the convoys split up and the observers decided to follow the third ICE car. As they were following that third ICE car, agents circled back to the observer’s house that they had just stopped in front of and went and banged on the door. The observer’s wife was home. She was terrified and she pretended she wasn’t home, and neighbors started coming out of their houses. Once they realized ICE was next door, [they started] blowing whistles, some people stopped and honked horns, and eventually the agents left.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week. Was this going on before that?

There was an immigration enforcement surge starting in December, so that was when patrols really started ramping up. But even before that, people were organized in rapid response networks and starting when Trump took over for his second term.

The idea behind the rapid response networks was that if we see an ICE action taking place, we can notify a bunch of people in the neighborhood, and the neighbors can respond to film ICE to inform people of their rights and to protest. But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics. It seems like now the ICE agents are traveling in smaller groups; they’re conducting arrests quickly. They’re really trying to get in and out before people have time to respond en masse and start protesting. That’s why the rapid response networks have shifted more towards a proactive approach, following ICE agents in hopes of preventing raids or arrests before they even happen.

The Trump administration has suggested that the people doing this are organized activists who have, I don’t know, possibly mendacious goals. Tell me about them, though. Who are these people? How did they get organized?

Well, I think this is where it’s relevant to mention that Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd less than a mile from where an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. So this neighborhood has been organized before. They’ve mobilized en masse against police brutality before. So I think that there’s already a culture — particularly in the south side of Minneapolis — of organization and protest.

“I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement.”

The people who are doing this come from all walks of life. We’re seeing churches get involved in this. We’re seeing parents organize with people whose children go to the same schools, so that they can be standing outside during dismissal or so that they can escort immigrant parents when they’re dropping off their children at school. It’s people who have a lot of time and identify as activists, and it’s also people who are commuting to work in the suburbs saying, “Let me take a different route today to see if I spot ICE, and I’ll let you know if I see anything.”

Do you know if Renee Good was one of these people?

We don’t know the details of her involvement in any of these networks. The people I talked to who lived in her neighborhood, who were involved in some of these rapid response groups, said they did not know her. But it’s important to note that it’s possible she could have been in the group and they wouldn’t have known, because everyone uses anonymous nicknames. It’s possible she was there using an anonymous nickname, but I haven’t seen any evidence of that yet.

After Renee Good was killed by the ICE agent, it has seemed like things in Minneapolis have become pretty chaotic. How have these people changed their tactics since she was killed? Are they doing anything differently?

I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement. I think a lot of people who are protesting ICE or who are going out on patrols are asking themselves what they’re willing to risk for this movement, knowing that someone was shot while protesting ICE.

You’re a journalist, so of course you’re sort of looking at all sides of this debate in Minneapolis. What do you make of the argument from ICE agents that this is threatening — that people following them in cars feels like a threat and that it shouldn’t be happening?

Well, I think that’s part of the point. I think the people on the ground here, many of them feel that this is an occupied city, and they want to show that they’re unhappy with that. They want to try to disrupt ICE operations within the bounds of the law to protect their immigrant neighbors. That’s how they see it. So I’m not surprised that ICE agents feel threatened by this. I think that’s part of the goal.

That’s very interesting, because as you know, the Trump administration has tried to paint Renee Good and others like her as a danger to the city itself. Kristi Noem called Renee Good a “domestic terrorist”. Vice President JD Vance has called this “classic terrorism.”

How do you make sense of statements like that based on what you’re seeing and the activists who are doing this kind of work?

I think it’s important to remember that at least the activists I’ve been with are committed to doing this within the bounds of the law. So it’s really this gray area between what’s considered obstruction in a legal sense and what is practically obstruction of ICE’s work. Honking horns and following them is not physically blocking them from making an arrest, but it certainly discourages them from doing so. That’s kind of where a lot of the action is happening.

And when it comes to Renee Good, it’s unclear what exactly her involvement may have been in any kind of organized movement to protest. But I think what her actions show is that the people of Minneapolis collectively — at least most of them, it feels like — have decided that when they see ICE, they’re taking action in whatever form feels right for them.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2254723729.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C11.748390650472%2C100%2C76.503218699056&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:12.076282

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.
“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.
In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement was racing to add 10,000 new officers to its force, an artificial intelligence error in how their applications were processed sent many new recruits into field offices without proper training, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the error.

The AI tool used by ICE was tasked with looking for potential applicants with law enforcement experience to be placed into the agency’s “LEO program” — short for law enforcement officer — for new recruits who are already law enforcement officers. It requires four weeks of online training.

Applicants without law enforcement backgrounds are required to take an eight-week in-person course at ICE’s academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, which includes courses in immigration law and handling a gun, as well as physical fitness tests.

“They were using AI to scan résumés and found out a bunch of the people who were LEOs weren’t LEOs,” one of the officials said.

The officials said the AI tool sent people with the word “officer” on their résumés to the shorter four-week online training — for example, a “compliance officer” or people who said they aspired to be ICE officers.

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.

Both law enforcement officials noted that ICE’s field offices provide more training beyond what is provided at the academy or in the online course before officers are sent out onto the street and that the officers singled out by the AI tool most likely received that training. The officials weren’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to a request for comment. The AI mistake was identified in mid-fall — over a month into the recruitment surge — and ICE immediately began taking steps to remedy the situation, including manual reviews of résumés of new hires, the officials said.

“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.

The AI tool was initially the mechanism used to categorize résumés, the officials said. The officials weren’t sure how many officers were improperly trained. It’s also not clear how many may have been sent out to begin immigration arrests.

As the immigration agency surges agents into American cities, their enforcement tactics are increasingly questioned by local law enforcement, community groups and lawmakers following the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Ross had more than 10 years of experience with ICE and wouldn’t have been subject to the AI screening for new recruits.

The error highlights the challenge of training such a large number of new recruits as ICE continues to ramp up operations to boost deportation numbers amid pressure from the White House. ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.

In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Minnesota has sued to try to remove DHS.

ICE had a mandate to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025 and offered new recruits $50,000 signing bonuses using the money Congress allocated under the One Big Beautiful Bill. One of the officials said that although ICE met the goal on paper, bringing back people who were misidentified for more training means it didn’t successfully add 10,000 ICE officers on the street in 2025.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-ice-officer-badge-vl-146p-97e565.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 12:59:39.809048

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation.
Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals.
The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body.
All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system.","The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has disclosed some further details on the new immigration and asylum appeal body. The plans are contained in a letter to the chair of the Justice Committee. Some further hints at the process behind the scenes separately emerged in live questions to Sarah Sackman, Minister of State for Courts and Legal Services.

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation. The judiciary were only informed 24 hours beforehand. Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals. Even now, the “details” that are emerging are very much outline principles.

The second point to make is that not only is the policy process is being led by the Home Office but the Ministry of Justice seems to have very little to do with these plans at all. Have a watch of Sarah Sackman’s brief evidence on this:

Sackman does not appear to be substantively engaged with the project. She speaks of her department “supporting” the Home Office with the project and the MOJ’s role being limited to “managing the transition”. It does not sound as if the new body would even sit within the Ministry of Justice. Will we be returning to the days prior to 1987 when the Home Office appointed adjudicators? How is that “independent” from the Home Office?

Mahmood’s letter suggests that the main purpose of the change is to widen the recruitment pool for appeal decision-makers. She implies there are too few people who meet current minimum recruitment standards who are willing to do the existing job of immigration judge. Essentially any barrister or solicitor with five years of experience is potentially eligible. That’s well over 200,000 people. And a person with equivalent experience in law is also eligible. Rather than seeking to improve pay, conditions or make more use of the ‘equivalent experience’ criterion, the government has decided to reduce the minimum qualifications required. We still do not know what the new minimum will be.

There will still be a right of appeal from the new body to the Upper Tribunal on an error of law, apparently. Some had wondered whether this would be so. Given the minimum qualifications for adjudicators will be widened from actual practicing lawyers to, by definition, non legally qualified individuals, it seems likely there will be more appeals to the Upper Tribunal than at present. That’s not a great way of speeding things up.

The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body. Given that the appeals legislation will need changing, this perhaps (I’m looking for silver linings here) raises the possibility of restoring the “not in accordance with the law, including immigration rules” ground of appeal in place of the “human rights only” grounds introduced in 2014. But I’m not holding my breath.

There is reference in the letter to legal advice being facilitated before a claim is heard by the new body. There’s no equivalent reference to legal representation being funded for appeals at the new body. That’s concerning.

There is some language around making appeals one stop shops, albeit without using those exact words (™Jack Straw 1998). Over the last 30 years we have repeatedly heard politicians claiming to want one appeal to rule them all. Their civil servants have then repeatedly introduced systems that require separate claims to be brought consecutively. Adding issues to an existing appeal is considered by the Home Office to be an ambush, basically.

What would all help with getting all relevant issues decided at a single appeal is making the process fair and quick. Around three months for an initial decision, say, and then three to six months for an appeal. Instead, we’re going to have a load of ill-considered institutional upheaval taking years.

There will be a fast track for claims from safe countries. This is not referred to as a detained fast track, but one imagines it might involve detention. Some other cases will be prioritised by the new “independent” body on public interest grounds. These grounds will presumably be decided by one of the parties to the appeal (the Home Office) but not the other. Late claims made prior to removal would appear to be one such category, according to Mahmood.

The letter does say that the system will preserve “safeguarding for vulnerable individuals, ensuring complex protection claims receive the time and scrutiny required”.

My main thought is that this seems like a colossal waste of time and energy. All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system. Improvements to initial decision-making and early access to legal advice would reduce the pressure on the tribunal system. Instead, the government is looking at very complex, costly and protracted procedural changes which may well end up having no impact on the existing tribunal backlog, because existing appeals continue in the existing system. It’s a classic Home Office response to a genuine problem. Instead of doing the admittedly hard work needed to resolve genuine problems, tear it all up to create more work — which is an opportunity cost for doing other more purposeful and impactful work — and still having to solve the same difficult problems anyway.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shabana_Mahmood_Official_Cabinet_Portrait_July_2024_cropped_2-450x600.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:39.356248

The judge acknowledged the parallels between the current case and Tincher v. Noem, which was filed in December.

Democrats and local residents have condemned the shooting as a murder and called for the agent's prosecution, while the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have defended the incident by arguing that it was a justified shooting.

Protests continued on Wednesday after the latest shooting, with demonstrators using horns and whistles and officers deploying tear gas and pepper balls.

There were at least a hundred people at the scene, where officers were dispersing pepper spray, throwing pepper balls and using flash bangs as rioters tossed items at the agents. Demonstrators were also calling on ICE to leave the city and holding signs with phrases such as ""f--- ICE.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a crowd was committing ""unlawful acts,"" including throwing fireworks at officers, and urged people to ""leave immediately.""

""This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,"" he said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged peaceful demonstrations in response to the shooting.

""I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants,"" Walz wrote on X.

Walz also made an address to Minnesotans where he again called on ICE to leave the state.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has repeatedly demanded that ICE leave, said the agency's presence is not establishing safety for community members.

""This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,"" he said at a news conference, adding that the deployment of roughly 3,000 ICE agents in Minneapolis and statewide was ""creating chaos.""

""It's certainly not creating safety when a huge percentage of the shootings that have taken place so far this year in Minneapolis have been by ICE,"" he said. ""So let's be very clear. I've seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable.""

The mayor also praised people protesting peacefully but warned that others were ""taking the bait.""

""We cannot counter Donald Trump's chaos with our own brand of chaos,"" he said.

""American citizens are getting picked up off the street by people in masks,"" the mayor added. ""That's not the way things should be conducted in any city in America.

Civil rights groups reported at least 20 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations from East Los Angeles to downtown, including one in Montebello captured on surveillance video.

Footage from Montebello shows an unmarked truck pulling up before ICE agents jump out and surround a home. Within seconds, one of them climbs a ladder onto the roof. Construction workers on the roof run and jump from one roof to another as they try to get away. No one was detained.

""They were just scared actually - just in fear for their lives. They didn't know what was happening,"" said Manny, the contractor who hired the workers.

Manny said he rushed to the job site when he heard what happened and found his crew nervous and scared.

""We just gathered and I prayed for all of them, and I prayed for their protection and that God would give us peace during this troubled time,"" he said.

Manny said this doesn't just affect the people ICE targets - it affects everyone trying to work and survive.

""Some people are scared to come back to work,"" he said. ""They're just a little (shaken up) and they just don't want to experience that again.""

Civil rights groups said Wednesday's operation in Montebello was one of many taking place throughout the region.

Videos from Little Tokyo in downtown L.A., Commerce and Pico Rivera showed agents confronting and detaining people in public areas.

""They're using brutal violence against an unarmed, civilian population to impose their political will,"" said Ron Gochez of Union del Barrio. ""Things are escalating and so for us, we know we have to continue our work, we have to continue organizing, we have to continue defending our community.""

Gochez pointed to a new California law requiring ICE agents not to wear face coverings, but he said it's not being enforced.

""They don't have to abide by state law or local ordinance, and so to pass these meaningless bills into law here in California when these are federal agents who don't have to listen to them, it's really a waste of our time,"" he said.

Meanwhile, in cities like Montebello, neighbors said they're thinking twice before leaving their homes.

“There are no exceptions to the absolute and universal prohibition of the arbitrary deprivation of life.” “International law does not allow States to kill on the basis of labels, perceptions of how someone appears, or allegations of wrongdoing,” Tidball-Binz said.
“Where there is no armed conflict and no basis in international law for the use of military force, States must rely on law enforcement measures consistent with international legal obligations, including human rights and maritime law requirements,” the expert said.
“States must ensure a legal and operational framework on the use of force consistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,”he said.
“States must never normalise a ‘shoot-to-kill’ approach which erodes the strict and absolute limits international law places on the use of lethal force.” The Special Rapporteur is available to engage with the Government of the United States about these concerns.","GENEVA – The excessive and unlawful use of lethal force by United States of America security forces both extraterritorially, including on the high seas and in Venezuela, and domestically, in law enforcement operations especially related to immigration enforcement, is gravely concerning, a UN expert said today.

“Public statements by State officials signalling a “shoot-to-kill” posture risk lowering the threshold for the use of lethal force,” said Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. “There are no exceptions to the absolute and universal prohibition of the arbitrary deprivation of life.”

“International law does not allow States to kill on the basis of labels, perceptions of how someone appears, or allegations of wrongdoing,” Tidball-Binz said. “Whether at sea, abroad, or at home, the use of lethal force must be strictly limited by the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and precaution, and may be used only as a last resort to protect life.”

Alarmed by lethal strikes against small vessels in international waters by the United States in the context of a so-called “war on narco-terrorism”, which have unlawfully killed scores of people since September, Tidball-Binz said he was particularly troubled at indications that some of the vessels could have been intercepted but were destroyed, including with double-tap strikes killing survivors.

“Where there is no armed conflict and no basis in international law for the use of military force, States must rely on law enforcement measures consistent with international legal obligations, including human rights and maritime law requirements,” the expert said. “The deliberate use of lethal force against persons who do not pose an imminent threat to life is unlawful and violates fundamental United States obligations under international law, and its own domestic laws.”

Expressing deep concern about the scores of deaths caused by the large-scale United States military action in Venezuela in early January, Tidball-Binz recalled that UN experts have underscored that the unprovoked use of armed force on the sovereign territory of another State is a breach of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. It may also constitute the international crime of aggression attributable to individual political and military leaders involved.

“Deaths resulting from such an act of aggression are arbitrary by definition,” the Special Rapporteur warned.

“Accountability for human rights violations cannot be pursued through unilateral military intervention in violation of the UN Charter,” he said. “Respect for the right to life is inseparable from respect for international law, including the prohibition on the use of force.”

He also expressed grave concern about the fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis on 7 January 2026 during an operation involving federal immigration enforcement officers, stressing that any death involving law enforcement must be subject to a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigation with those responsible held accountable. Tidball-Binz urged all relevant authorities to fully cooperate to ensure an effective inquiry.

“States must ensure a legal and operational framework on the use of force consistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,”he said.

“Where potentially unlawful deaths occur, investigations should comply with the Minnesota Protocol [LINK] and victims’ families must have access to truth, justice and reparation,” the expert said.

Tidball-Binz referred to his report to the General Assembly which addresses unlawful killings by law enforcement officials and sets out practical measures to prevent loss of life and overcome recurrent obstacles to accountability, including in high-risk operational contexts.

He called on the United States to urgently review relevant laws, policies, rules of engagement, operational directives and oversight mechanisms governing the use of lethal force domestically and extraterritorially; to clarify the legal bases and safeguards applicable to maritime and extraterritorial operations; and ensure credible, independent and transparent investigations into all allegations of unlawful killing.

“The right to life is non-derogable and non- negotiable,” he said. “States must never normalise a ‘shoot-to-kill’ approach which erodes the strict and absolute limits international law places on the use of lethal force.”

""It allows them to stop anybody, detain anybody, who they believe is in the country without current authorization,"" Ceisler said.

Ceisler emphasized that ending the partnership does not mean his office will obstruct federal enforcement.

""We are continuing to maintain an open dialogue with ICE and all our federal state and local law enforcement partners,"" he said. ""By any definition of a sanctuary county, we are not one.""

The White House issued a statement in response to Ceisler's announcement. The message read, in part, ""These types of actions won't stop ICE and the federal government from enforcing the law, they will only make it significantly more challenging to get dangerous criminal illegals off American streets, and put innocent Americans in harm's way.""

Ceisler's stance differs markedly from that of Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal, whose recent remarks threatening to arrest ICE agents operating in the city drew widespread attention. She reinforced her comments again on Wednesday.

""When you don't believe the facts and you can't come back with facts, you come back with insults,"" Bilal said. ""My mother said, 'Sticks and stones will break your bones, but names will never hurt you.' Bring it.""

Ceisler called Bilal's approach misguided.

DHS said agents were attempting to arrest a man from Venezuela who was in the U.S. illegally when he crashed his vehicle into a parked car during a “targeted traffic stop.”

The officer caught up to the man, who DHS said began assaulting the officer. Amid a “struggle on the ground” between the pair, two other people came out from a nearby apartment and began attacking the officer, DHS said.

“As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broomstick,” DHS said in a statement.

The officer then fired “defensive shots to defend his life,” hitting the victim in the leg. All three attackers fled into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside, according to DHS.

Witnesses told the Minnesota Star Tribune that officers broke down the apartment door to apprehend them.

All individuals involved were taken into custody, and both the officer and the man who was shot were hospitalized.

Minneapolis Mayor George Frey has continually urged protesters to remain calm amid “disgusting and intolerable” behavior from ICE.

“For those that have peacefully protested, I applaud you. For those that are taking the bait, you are not helping and you are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city,” Frey said.

In a statement about Wednesday’s shooting, DHS admonished the response from local officials, including Frey and Minnesota Gov. Walz.

Latest ICE shooting comes week after Renee Good’s death

The incident comes a week after the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good, a 37-year-old mother who was protesting against ICE in Minneapolis.

On Wednesday, a Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation that the officer, Jonathan Ross, suffered internal bleeding after that incident.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was hit by Good’s vehicle Jan. 7, backing up the administration’s claims he shot the 37-year-old motorist in “self-defense.” “He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him.

Colombia has implemented various initiatives to prevent statelessness among Venezuelan migrants, including granting protective status and allowing Venezuelan children to access citizenship in some cases.","In the borough of Arima, a small but bustling urban enclave with a country-town feel in north-central Trinidad, a cheerful two-story bungalow painted in turquoise and burgundy is emblazoned with a sign reading La Casita in cursive. Andreina Briceño Ventura-Brown founded it as a bilingual, community-based space for children in 2017. But in recent years, the rapid upswell of Venezuelans moving to the twin islands has shifted the community center’s focus to direct service for recent immigrants, especially women.

Since 2014, Venezuela has faced a deepening political and economic crisis that has forced about eight million people to flee the country. While Colombia hosts the largest number of Venezuelan migrants overall, Trinidad and Tobago, situated just off the coast, hosts the second-highest population of Venezuelan immigrants in the Caribbean. Historically, there has been a steady political, economic, and cultural exchange between the two nations. Venezuelans contributed to Trinidad’s cocoa industry and left a lasting cultural legacy, including the musical tradition of parang. And many Venezuelans travel to Trinidad to learn English. But recently, as conditions worsened in Venezuela, this movement shifted from short-term migration to one of survival. Since 2018, thousands have made the dangerous journey to Trinidad by boat, often arriving undocumented, vulnerable, and in search of safety.

The arrivals of Venezuelans to Trinidad has highlighted the fragility of the country’s immigration system, with many exposed to extreme xenophobia, exploitation, and marginalization due to their undocumented status.

While Trinidad is signatory to international treaties such as the 1951 and 1954 Refugee Conventions, as a dualist state, these agreements only take effect if domestic legislation is passed. In practice, this means there is no governing law requiring compliance, and the current Immigration Act of 1969 contains no provisions for refugees or asylum seekers. Attempts to address this gap have been limited. In 2014, the government, in partnership with the UNHCR, developed a policy to guide the treatment of migrants, but it is not legally binding and carries no enforcement power. A previous registration process allowed only a small number of migrants to formalize their status, leaving thousands in legal limbo. “Due to the deficiencies in our existing legislation and legal framework, that is one of the main reasons or the core reasons why there are so many challenges faced by the migrants,” explained Adaphia Trancoso-Ribeiro, former legal director of the Women’s Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), an organization that advocates for gender justice and human rights. Since the twin island lacks refugee legislation and a migration policy, many Venezuelans are left without legal avenues to reside or work. This increases their vulnerability and marginalization from Trindadian society.

While migrants face obstacles in other Latin American countries, some have more structured and supportive integration efforts. Colombia has implemented various initiatives to prevent statelessness among Venezuelan migrants, including granting protective status and allowing Venezuelan children to access citizenship in some cases. Historically, Ecuador also created opportunities for Venezuelans to regularize their status, with programs aimed at providing temporary residency to reduce vulnerability, though last year, President Daniel Noboa ended the agreement and an amnesty for Venezuelans in the country.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/La-casita-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:59:39.069665

It started with a gunshot in Minneapolis. Days later, a massive leak followed — one that has now thrust thousands of US immigration agents out of the shadows and into a fierce national debate.

Personal and work-related details of roughly 4,500 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol employees have allegedly been shared online after being leaked by a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whistleblower, according to multiple media reports.

The data reportedly includes names, work emails, phone numbers, job roles, and some résumé-style information, covering about 2,000 frontline agents, 150 supervisors, and thousands of support staff. Early reviews suggest that around 80% of those named are still employed by DHS, according to The Daily Beast.

The information was shared with ICE List, a website that describes itself as a journalistic accountability project documenting immigration enforcement activities.

Triggered by a deadly shooting

The alleged leak came shortly after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. Good was shot through the windshield of her car by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, an incident that sparked protests across the US and drew global attention.

Dominick Skinner, founder of ICE List, said the shooting pushed someone inside DHS to act. “It is a sign that people aren’t happy within the US government, clearly. The shooting was the last straw for many people,” Skinner told The Daily Beast.

Inside the ICE List project

The ICE List states that it does not publish home addresses or target family members. In an ethical statement on its website, the group argues that naming individuals is about accountability, not harassment.

The site claims it verifies identities using public tips, leaked documents, video analysis, and AI-assisted tools, with multiple confirmation steps before publishing any name. It also says individuals can request corrections or removal if they leave the agency.

Skinner told The Daily Beast that ICE List plans to publish “the majority” of the leaked names it can verify, while making exceptions for certain roles such as childcare workers and nurses within DHS.

DHS pushback and safety concerns

Federal officials have strongly condemned the alleged leak, warning it puts lives at risk.

In a statement to The Independent, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “The disgusting doxxing of our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.” She added, “Our law enforcement officers are on the frontlines arresting terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists.”

McLaughlin also warned that the release of such information could amount to “4,500 felonies,” citing rising threats and assaults against federal officers.

Lawmakers have previously tried to shut down similar efforts. Projects like ICEBlock have been taken offline in the past, and proposed legislation such as the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act aims to limit the public sharing of agent identities.

ICE List, however, is hosted in the Netherlands, where Skinner lives, placing it outside direct US jurisdiction.

The site states it will continue operating despite pressure, referring to its work as “documentation” rather than “intimidation.”",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-37.png,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:26.610324

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) – U.S. federal immigration officers arrested two people driving dump trucks to a construction site ‍of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms in Richland Parish, Louisiana, the local sheriff’s office said on Wednesday.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did not enter the Meta site at any time, the Richland Parish ‌Sheriff’s Office said, adding ICE agents ‌assisted the sheriff’s office with the traffic stops that led to the arrests.

Meta is building its largest-ever data center in Richland Parish. The company had ​no immediate comment on the detentions.

“During those stops, two drivers were arrested by ICE ‍due to their immigration ​status,” the sheriff’s office said in ​a statement, adding they were from Guatemala and Honduras.

Since ‍taking office a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards and ‍screening immigrants’ social media posts and past speeches.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump’s immigration and travel-related ‍policies, saying ‍they harm due process guarantees and ​free speech. Trump and his ​allies ⁠say the policies seek to improve ‌domestic security.

ICE’s actions have been subject to particular criticism by protesters, community leaders, Democrats and human rights advocates.

This is a brief snippet of the scene outside the Whipple Federal Building in Saint Paul Tuesday, where masked, armed agents repeatedly attacked protesters.

AMY GOODMAN: The Minnesota Star Tribune reports the number of federal agents now in the Twin Cities dwarfs the size of local police. The size of the federal force is expected to soon reach 3,000 officers. That’s bigger than the 10 largest metro police departments combined in the Twin Cities.

On Monday, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul sued the federal government. This is Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

ATTORNEY GENERAL KEITH ELLISON: Deployment of thousands of armed, masked DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop. DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area and in cities across the state of Minnesota.

AMY GOODMAN: To see our interview with Attorney General Ellison, go to democracynow.org.

There is also growing opposition from within the federal government to the Trump administration’s tactics in Minnesota. Six federal prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney’s Office have resigned over the Justice Department push to investigate the widow of Renee Good — that’s Becca Good. In Washington, D.C., five senior prosecutors in the criminal wing of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have resigned in protest over the DOJ’s decision not to investigate the ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Renee Good.

We’re joined now by Hwa Jeong Kim, vice president of the Saint Paul City Council, also member of the Immigrant Defense Network.

Thank you so much for being with us. First off, can you talk about the lawsuit that’s being heard in court? The significance of what Saint Paul and Minneapolis — called the Twin Cities, for our global audience — is demanding right now, the ICE force dwarfing the number of police in the Twin Cities?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I think what we’re seeing is that our constitutional observers and the firsthand accounts of our neighbors is working. We are providing evidence that shows just indiscriminate, unconstitutional violence coming from federal agents in the Twin Cities.

AMY GOODMAN: So, what exactly, Hwa Jeong Kim, is the Saint Paul City Council calling for now? We just heard that last clip of protests, when people are saying, “Take off your masks.” I mean, the issue of everything from the Minneapolis mayor saying, “Get the f— out of Minneapolis,” to ICE, to talking about what they’re allowed to do in the city. And what is your sense of the level of cooperation, or not, of the local police department, Minneapolis and Saint Paul being sanctuary cities?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I mean, we have a separation ordinance that’s been in place for many years, and the Saint Paul City Council is looking at strengthening that language, just like the Minneapolis Council passed in their city recently. We, unfortunately, had an incident on Rose Street, where residents and myself witnessed what we believe to be cooperation, where our Saint Paul police officers helped secure a scene and helped escort ICE agents out. So, there is always opportunities to strengthen our laws and use every lever that we can to continue to protect our residents.

And I think the lawsuit is very, very clear: We don’t want ICE in our neighborhoods. They are violent, they are creating chaos and terrorizing our immigrant neighbors, and they are not keeping anyone safe. And, in fact, they are bringing danger on our streets every single day.

AMY GOODMAN: Earlier this week, you wrote on Facebook, quote, “To my North Enders, we are seeing a continuous presence of federal agents in our neighborhood. We have had additional community observers present throughout our neighborhood. And vulnerable folks should be very careful. Our neighborhood eyes and protection is working. It is working. We had several of our neighbors kidnapped today. Take precautions.” Can you elaborate on why you’re using the word “kidnap” and what precautions people can take?

HWA JEONG KIM: They’re racially profiling neighbors and just taking them off the streets. We have accounts of folks walking down the sidewalk getting scooped up, neighbors getting pulled out of vehicles. And so, it is not about whether or not they have a warrant. That has never been the case. It’s always been about violent racial profiling in our streets.

And so, right now we’re encouraging our neighbors to be really careful. I myself am carrying around two forms of ID. I’m a naturalized citizen. Neighbors are also considering not going to work, not sending their kids to school, not going grocery shopping, not going to the laundromat — the very simple things that just keep families going. Lack of child care is incredibly important right now for families. So, we’re really hoping to tap into those mutual aid networks to support families in this time. And it’s difficult, as someone that’s watching and hearing and is very tapped into rapid response, to hear the number of people that are taken every hour here in the Twin Cities, in good conscience to tell folks that it feels safe to walk out on your street today.

AMY GOODMAN: In addition to the massive influx of ICE agents, you have now President Trump said they’re revoking TPS status for Somalis — you have a large Somali community in the Twin Cities — and that they will also denaturalize Somali citizens. And they’re going to do mass deportation? What do you understand is going on here? They would have to leave by February, he said.

HWA JEONG KIM: So many of our Somali neighbors are citizens. And so, I think this is incredibly — this is an incredibly dangerous tactic, as we see them attempt to strip away TPS statuses for many communities. And many folks know, here in the Twin Cities, Somali folks are incredibly important to the fabric of our neighborhoods, and not just because of the value that they bring, but because they are humans and that deserve dignity and protection. And the vast majority of our Somali neighbors are citizens.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us about the Saint Paul mayor recently saying, “I wasn’t born here. I’m carrying my passport card and my ID with me all the time, because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained”? Her family fled Laos for the United States when she was 3. Your response?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, Mayor Kaohly Her is a close friend of mine. I myself, my partner is trans. We’ve been carrying around two forms of ID for many, many months. And it was a conversation that I personally had with her, as well. Folks that look like us and look like our communities that we serve and our neighbors are very afraid right now. And even if you are a citizen and you are not white, it is an incredibly fearful event leaving the house every single day and stepping onto the streets of our city. And yeah, we see a lot of our neighbors stepping up to make sure that we’re protected, that we have eyes on each other, and that we’re supporting each other to the best of our abilities in this really difficult time.

AMY GOODMAN: Faith and labor leaders and groups in Minneapolis are calling for a general strike January 23rd. Are you supporting this?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So much great organizing is coming from our labor unions, and even with SPFE. Our Teachers Union stood up an incredible program to help protect our students. So, yes, I’m incredibly supportive. I’m signed on, and I plan on participating.

AMY GOODMAN: Final comment on the loss of the six experienced attorneys in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minneapolis who have all just quit, followed by five attorneys in the Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C., because President Trump’s former personal lawyer Todd Blanche has said they won’t be doing a civil rights investigation into the death of Renee Good? If you can talk about the loss of this experience and these attorneys who would be involved with an investigation into Renee’s death?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I think a lot of folks are putting everything on the line to do what’s right. I think what’s resonating with me in this moment is seeing those resignations, knowing that there’s a line in the sand that folks are unwilling to cross, because the bottom line that a lot of us feels, that there’s there’s no one coming to save us. And that feels really scary, but also empowering, because if it’s up to us, and we draw the line in the sand, and we have the ability to follow through and be accountable to our constituents, to protect them and ensure that immigrant communities and families are safe, we should absolutely do everything within our power and everything within our privilege to do that. And so, seeing them stepping down, I think, is an incredible sign of where the value set and the moral line is for folks right now that are attempting to keep our community safe.

AMY GOODMAN: Hwa Jeong Kim, I want to thank —

HWA JEONG KIM: And that we’re not going to —

AMY GOODMAN: Go ahead.

HWA JEONG KIM: We’re not going to just step down — we’re not just going to turn a blind eye, but we’re doing everything in our power.

AMY GOODMAN: Hwa Jeong Kim, vice president of the Saint Paul City Council, also a member of Immigrant Defense Network.

When we come back, what happens when ICE hires agents with minimal or no screening, then sends them into the streets armed and masked? We’ll speak to a journalist who applied for an ICE job and was offered it without even a background check. And we’ll look at the rapid expansion of ICE detention in Trump’s first year in office. Stay with us.

Half of Americans view ICE unfavorably More generally, about half (52%) of Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of ICE.
While there is not majority support for eliminating ICE, support for this position has increased since Donald Trump's first term as president.
In contrast, majorities of Republicans support keeping ICE in its current form and expanding its size and funding.
In addition to supporting several other restrictions to ICE, majorities of Americans support rules that would make ICE agents more identifiable.","On January 7 in Minneapolis, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good. The shooting sparked an escalation in protests against ICE, an agency that has drawn increasing criticism since the Trump administration significantly increased its funding and hiring and deployed agents to cities across the U.S.

YouGov polling in October 2025 found that majorities of Americans disapproved of ICE and had concerns about the agency's treatment of both citizens and immigrants. New YouGov polling shows that majorities of Americans say that Ross' shooting of Good was not justified and that it should lead to criminal charges. More broadly, Americans view ICE far less favorably than several other federal agencies. Nearly half of Americans now say that ICE should be eliminated as a federal agency entirely, a significant increase from past polling. Majorities of Americans support major changes that would place new restrictions on ICE. (The findings on this poll are largely consistent with other recent YouGov polling about ICE and the shooting conducted in partnership with the Economist and Yahoo News.)

Majorities of Americans say the ICE agent was not justified in the Minneapolis shooting and should face criminal charges

Two-thirds (67%) of Americans say they have heard a lot about Ross shooting and killing Good (the question didn't name either person). Only 11% say they have not heard about the shooting. Democrats are more likely than Independents and Republicans to say they have heard a lot about the shooting (80% vs. 61%).

Additionally, most Americans (70%) say they have seen video footage of the shooting. Only one-quarter (26%) say they have not seen any video footage.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that Ross was not justified in shooting Good. Only 28% say the shooting was justified. While majorities of Democrats (88%) and Independents (58%) believe the shooting was not justified, only 15% of Republicans agree. A majority (61%) of Republicans say that Ross was justified in shooting Good.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that Ross should face criminal charges for shooting Good. Only 30% say he should not face charges. Majorities of Democrats (90%) and Independents (54%) say Ross should face charges, but only 14% of Republicans agree. A majority (63%) of Republicans say he should not.

Most Americans think ICE often uses unnecessary force against people, regardless of immigration status or violations of immigration law

Taking a broader view, most Democrats and Independents think that ICE uses unnecessary physical force against U.S. citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants. About 90% of Democrats, 60% of Independents, and 30% of Republicans say ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary force against each group.

In our October poll, Americans were more likely to say that ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants than to say the agency uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens or immigrants who have not committed any violations. That distinction still exists among Republicans: 35% say ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants, compared to 28% who say they use unnecessary force against U.S. citizens. But Democrats and Independents are now slightly more likely to say ICE uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens than to say it does so against unauthorized immigrants.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful, compared to just 12% who say they are not forceful enough. And nearly half (46%) of Americans say they are somewhat or very concerned that ICE could mistreat someone they know, equal to the share who say they are not very or not at all concerned about this (46%). More Americans approve than disapprove of recent protests against ICE (49% vs. 42%). These figures are all similar to those expressed by Americans in the October poll of attitudes about ICE.

Half of Americans view ICE unfavorably

More generally, about half (52%) of Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of ICE. Only 40% view the agency favorably. For comparison, we also asked Americans about their views of eight other federal agencies. ICE is the only agency included in our poll that is viewed unfavorably by more Americans than the share who view it favorably. It is also the agency viewed favorably by the smallest share of Americans, and unfavorably by the largest. The next least popular agencies in the survey — the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — are viewed unfavorably by only 39% of Americans each.

While ICE is unpopular overall, views are highly polarized by party. The agency is overwhelmingly viewed negatively by Democrats: ICE has a net favorability rating of −68 among Democrats, meaning the share of Democrats with unfavorable opinions of ICE is 68 percentage points larger than the share who have favorable opinions. No other agency in our poll comes close to such a negative outlook among Democrats. The next lowest net favorability among Democrats is for the FBI: −4. In contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly view ICE favorably, giving the agency a net favorability of +57. This means ICE is viewed more favorably by Republicans than all but one other agency in our survey: the National Weather Service (+60). The NWS is also the most popular agency in the survey among Democrats (+66) and Americans overall (+64).

Nearly half of Americans would eliminate ICE as a federal agency

Americans are divided over whether ICE should be abolished entirely: 42% somewhat or strongly support eliminating the agency, while 45% oppose doing so. While there is not majority support for eliminating ICE, support for this position has increased since Donald Trump's first term as president. In 2018, 29% of Americans supported abolishing ICE, and in 2019, 33% supported it — according to polls that, unlike the latest one, specified that if ICE were abolished, it would be replaced with a different agency.

Younger adults are particularly likely to support eliminating ICE. A majority (58%) of adults under 30 would eliminate the agency, as would nearly half of Americans between 30 and 44 (46%, compared to 35% who oppose eliminating it) — both higher than in 2019. There has also been an increase in support among older Americans, though a majority of Americans 45 and older still oppose eliminating ICE.

Majorities of Americans say ICE needs big change and restrictions

A majority (56%) of Americans say that deaths caused by ICE agents or in ICE custody show that there is a fundamental problem with ICE that needs to be fixed. Only 28% of Americans say that these deaths are unavoidable and do not show that there is a fundamental problem with ICE. Majorities of Democrats (90%) and Independents (59%) say that these deaths reflect a problem in ICE that needs to be fixed. Only 19% of Republicans agree; a majority (61%) do not see these deaths as indicative of a fundamental problem.

Americans are more likely to support than to oppose several changes to ICE that would place more restrictions on the agency. Two-thirds (68%) of Americans strongly or somewhat support creating stricter recruitment requirements for ICE agents. A majority (58%) support criminally prosecuting any ICE agent who kills someone. And more Americans support than oppose reducing ICE's size and funding (49% vs. 38%).

In contrast, more Americans oppose than support keeping ICE in its current form (49% vs. 37%). Expanding ICE and loosening restrictions on its recruitment are even less popular. Half of Americans oppose expanding ICE's size and funding (50% vs. 36% who support it). A majority (63%) oppose loosening recruitment requirements so that ICE can hire new agents more quickly.

While there is majority support for proposals that would restrict ICE and widespread opposition to expanding the agency, these potential changes are viewed very differently by Democrats and Republicans. While Democrats overwhelmingly support creating stricter recruitment requirements for ICE, criminally prosecuting ICE agents who kill people, and reducing the agency's size and funding, far fewer Republicans support these changes. In contrast, majorities of Republicans support keeping ICE in its current form and expanding its size and funding. One source of some agreement: Less than half of both Democrats and Republicans support loosening recruitment requirements so that ICE can hire new agents more quickly, though this proposal is still opposed by far more Democrats than Republicans.

In addition to supporting several other restrictions to ICE, majorities of Americans support rules that would make ICE agents more identifiable. Over two-third (69%) of Americans say agents should be required to wear uniforms when making arrests, compared to just 17% who say uniforms should not be required. And a majority (55%) say that ICE agents should not be allowed to wear masks that hide their identities when making arrests, compared to 31% who say such masks should be allowed.

Majorities of Democrats and Independents support requiring uniforms and banning face masks for ICE agents. Republicans are also more likely to support than to oppose uniform requirements (44% vs. 37%), but a majority of Republicans (63%) would allow ICE agents to wear masks that hide their identities. Only 23% wouldn't allow it.

A majority of Americans also believe that ICE should comply with instructions from states' governors, not just from federal leaders. About half (48%) of Americans say that if a state's governor calls on ICE to leave an area, agents should be required to leave. A further 11% say that agents should voluntarily leave, though they should not be required to do so. Only about one-quarter (27%) of Americans say ICE should not leave an area after a governor calls on them to do so.

A majority of Americans say ICE should stay away from schools

After an ICE agent shot Good, and other agents were seen outside a high school, Minneapolis Public Schools and neighboring districts closed schools to ensure students would be safe from ICE activities. A majority (58%) of Americans say this closure was a reasonable precaution, while only 31% say it was an unreasonable reaction. While majorities of Democrats (83%) and Independents (60%) say the closure was reasonable, only 30% of Republicans do. A majority of Republicans (61%) say it was unreasonable.

More broadly, most Americans (64%) say that ICE agents should not be allowed on K-12 school campuses. Only 20% say they should be allowed. While most Democrats (87%) and Independents (68%) say ICE agents should not be allowed on school campuses, Republicans are about evenly split: 39% of Republicans say agents should be allowed on campuses, while 36% say they should not.

The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, region, 2024 presidential vote, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. 2024 presidential vote, at time of weighting, was estimated to be 48% Harris and 50% Trump. Baseline party identification is the respondent’s most recent answer given around November 8, 2024, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at that time (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). The margin of error for the overall sample is approximately 4 points.

Researcher is in the United States legally on a work visa, yet he’s being held at ICE’s detention center in Batavia.

A screenshot of Huseynov’s Facebook page.

The Trump administration maintains its mass deportation program is aimed only at “the worst of the worst.”

In reality, the crackdown on immigrants is a dragnet, one that’s now ensnared a well-regarded neuroscience researcher from the University at Buffalo.

Azerbaijan native Shovgi Huseynov has no criminal record and a visa that allows him to work in the United States through 2029. But on January 7, Huseynov made a wrong turn onto the Peace Bridge and was detained by border agents upon his return to Buffalo.

A spokesperson for U.S Customs and Border Protection said agents “determined he may be subject to removal from the U.S.” and turned him over to ICE. He gave no specific reason for his arrest.

Huseynov has been held at the Batavia detention center for the past week.

According to UB spokesperson John Della Contrada, Huseynov had been working as a researcher at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences since 2022 on a work authorization approved by the Department of Homeland Security. Huseynov entered the country on a J1 visa commonly extended to university students and researchers, a spokesperson from ICE said, who indicated Huseynov had an application for another visa or other legal status pending.

The ICE spokesperson, in a statement, alleged Huseynov didn’t have legal status and said the agency is now seeking to deport him.

Huseynov is not alone. In the past year, at least five other people have been detained by immigration authorities after making a wrong turn onto one of the bridges in the Buffalo area to Canada. That figure, however, only counts people who were criminally charged upon reentry because they’d been previously deported. More people, like Huseynov, have been detained after a wrong turn but not criminally charged.

Such consistent ICE detentions following a wrong turn are a new phenomenon, said Jennifer Connor, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Justice for Migrant Families. Under past administrations, she said, such mistakes would often just delay a traveler. Sometimes they would result in a brief detention and an order to appear before an immigration judge.

“After January 2025, [detention] became the rule,” she said. “It seemed like everyone got detained.”

A respected researcher

For four years, Huseynov has been conducting complicated neuroscience research at the Jacobs School, focusing on various biological phenomena in the brains of opioid-addicted mice in an attempt to understand how the brain and immune system work together. He’s published several research papers alongside colleagues.

In recent Facebook posts, he’s noted his son’s success at swim meets, announced he had attended a large neuroscience conference in San Diego and celebrated his cultural heritage.

“We have been living in the United States of America for 5 years now, but as true Azerbaijanis, we keep our national and moral values, traditions alive [and] we teach our children,” he wrote in a March post. “We are proud to be Azerbaijani and represent it here.”

In other posts, he wrote about how dedicated he was to his job at UB. In a post from December 2024, Huseynov apologized for falling out of touch with friends due to focusing on his research and his family.

“I came to America with 1 purpose, 1 deed, and from the first day of my arrival, no reason has been able to divert me from my path and lead me in other directions,” he wrote. “I spend at least 12-14 hours in a day doing science. Real science is such a thing that you always have to think, do research, get acquainted with the latest innovations and publications in your field of research.”

One colleague at UB, research professor Michael Morales, spoke highly of Huseynov.

“He’s a good scientist, a good citizen. I consider him very hard working,” Morales said. “He was fun to work with.”

Morales noted that Huseynov has a wife and two young children, one of whom is a U.S. citizen.

“He’s certainly not a troublemaker or anything like that,” he said. “He’s found the same pathway that lots of international scientists have.”

Investigative Post attempted to reach Huseynov for this story but was not successful. Phone and text messages left for him at the ICE detention center were not returned. An attorney working with Huseynov, Siana McLean, declined to comment.

In a statement, Della Contrada said UB is aware of Huseynov’s arrest and is monitoring the situation.

“As more information becomes available, UB will provide appropriate support to his family and to his personal attorney,” he said.

Wrong turns lead to detention

In both Buffalo and Lewiston, it can be easy to drive into the wrong lane and get stuck heading to Canada with no way to turn around.

In at least five cases over the past year, migrant drivers have gotten stuck in the wrong lane, crossed into Canada and were detained by U.S. border agents upon their return.

The case of Giovanni Bernal Guerrero is typical.

On the evening of July 19, he was the passenger in a car that made a wrong turn onto the Peace Bridge. The driver traveled across to Canada, turned around and attempted to re-enter the United States. Upon inspection, Bernal Guerrero was found to have been previously deported to Mexico and agents arrested him.

He’s since been deported a second time.

Then there’s the case of Oscar Hernandez Sanchez.

Driving a tractor trailer last June, Hernandez Sanchez realized he’d taken the wrong lane of exit 9 and pulled over near the Duty Free store on the U.S. side of the Peace Bridge. He then attempted to back his truck down the ramp so he could re-enter Interstate 190. That’s when two Customs and Border Protection agents stopped him “out of concern that a traffic accident would occur,” according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The agents asked Hernandez Sanchez for documentation, which included a Mexican passport and an ID from the Mexican consulate. They found he had been previously deported in 2011 and arrested him. He was ordered deported in September.

Arrests and detentions at bridges common

It’s not just a Western New York phenomenon. In Detroit, NPR reported that more than 200 people were detained at the Ambassador Bridge between January and April of last year, most the result of a wrong turn into Canada.

In other local cases, entire families have been detained at the bridges after being turned back from Canada. Last March, for example, a family attempting to emigrate to Canada was denied entry and subsequently held at the Rainbow Bridge for two weeks.

Connor, of Justice for Migrant Families, said detentions at the bridges worry her — whether for wrong turns or another reason — because there’s no public information about those held there. When a person is held at an ICE detention center, their names can be found in an online database. Not so for those detained in a cell at a bridge. That makes getting someone out all the more difficult.

“The issue that still exists with the detentions at the bridges is the complete lack of transparency,” Connor said.

One of her solutions? Don’t take Interstate 190. Find an alternative route.

“I give people advice about this constantly, because I’m trying to do damage control on it,” she said. “It’s like this very easy mistake with devastating consequences.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-13-at-6.54.39-PM.png,N,,2026-01-15 05:58:08.543377

Agents taking part in President Donald Trump's immigration sweeps have been repeatedly accused of targeting anyone with black or brown skin without proof they are undocumented, and now some Native American tribes are advising members on their rights if they encounter ICE.

This week, ICT, a nonprofit news group that shares stories from Indigenous communities, reported that at least five Native Americans were detained during ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, despite being U.S. citizens.

Tensions in Minneapolis, and nationwide, grew this week in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by ICE agents in the city. Protests took place across the country on Sunday, Jan. 11, against ICE.

In the wake of the Minneapolis shooting and detentions, Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle cautioned members in a Facebook post that ICE may operate in the Upper Peninsula, and reminded tribal members they hold U.S. citizenship.

""In recent weeks, heightened tensions have emerged as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have stopped and detained tribal members and tribal descendants, raising urgent concerns about dignity, safety, and respect for Native American citizens,"" Gravelle wrote. ""Tribal citizens, including all Bay Mills Indian Community tribal citizens, are United States citizens by law — by virtue of the Snyder Act, also known as the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. ICE has no jurisdiction over U.S. citizens in matters of immigration.""

Gravelle added that ""These encounters cut against the sacrifices of our ancestors, who fought to protect our people, our lands, and our inherent rights, and they violate our shared values of respect for human life and the responsibility we share to protect one another.""

In a separate press release, Sault Tribe Chairman Austin Lowes also spoke out against ""recent aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities.""

“The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians strongly condemns recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities that have created fear, confusion, and anxiety within Indigenous communities and among minority communities more broadly. Enforcement actions that rely on intimidation and racial profiling undermine public trust and place innocent people at risk,"" Lowes said in the release.

“Let me be clear: the Sault Tribe opposes any ICE activity that creates fear and anxiety in both tribal communities and larger communities as a whole. No one should feel unsafe in their neighborhood, workplace, or homeland because of how they look, the language they speak, or the country they were born in,"" Lowes said in the release. “Recent incidents involving the unlawful detention of tribal citizens from federally recognized tribal nations are deeply troubling and unacceptable. Tribal citizens are members of sovereign governments. These actions disregard tribal sovereignty and the government-to-government relationship between tribal nations and the United States.""

Here's what to know.

What is the Snyder Act?

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, also known as the Snyder Act, was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on June 2, 1924, granting full citizenship to American Indians and Alaska Native Americans, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior - Indian Affairs.

The 15th Amendment, passed in 1870, granted all U.S. citizens the right to vote regardless of race, but it wasn't until the 1924 that American Indians and Alaska Native Americans could enjoy the rights granted by the amendment, the Department of the Interior said.

""That all non-citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided that the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property,"" the Act says.

Why would ICE agents be in Michigan's UP?

Gravelle said ICE agents may be more likely to be in the Sault Ste. Marie and Bay Mills areas because of the international border with Canada at the Soo Locks.

""Bay Mills Indian Community is located in a border region near the international boundary between the United States and Canada, and because of this proximity, federal law enforcement activity may be more visible in and around our homelands, and community members may encounter ICE or other federal agents more frequently,"" she wrote.

Do Native American tribes offer proof of citizenship?

Gravelle reminded members that their tribal ID cards provide proof of citizenship.

""While Tribal Identification Cards are valid and should be sufficient to establish U.S. citizenship and immigration status, it is not guaranteed that every ICE agent will recognize or understand this reality, creating unnecessary risk and harm,"" Gravelle wrote.

“First, tribal citizens concerned about potential encounters with ICE are encouraged to carry their tribal identification card or a copy of their degree of Indian blood, along with a state-issued ID at all times,"" Lowes said. ""Tribal identification affirms tribal citizenship and political status and establishes your identity as a member of a federally recognized tribal nation and as a United States citizen.""

What do officials recommend tribal members do?

In a two-page FAQ, the Bay Mills Community said all tribal citizens should ensure they have a valid and current tribal ID and enrollment card. The FAQ also advised members to be prepared to show additional documentation if asked, including such things as passport, passport card, Real ID license or immigration status paperwork.

Lowes also said tribal members may remain silent.

“If you are harassed, stopped or detained by ICE, remain calm,"" Lowes said. ""You have the right to remain silent and the right to ask to speak with an attorney. Do not sign anything ICE gives you. As a tribal citizen, you cannot be deported. ICE cannot enter your home without a warrant signed by a judge, and you are within your rights to ask them to identify themselves as ICE agents with proper documentation.

“Third, if you are detained, or if a family member is detained, I strongly encourage you to state, ‘I am a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized tribal nation. Under the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, all Native American people born within the territorial limits of the United States are recognized as U.S. citizens by birthright. I am both a tribal citizen and a U.S. citizen. Therefore, ICE has no lawful authority to detain me,’"" Lowes' release said.

How should tribal members deal with ICE in public spaces?

The Bay Mills FAQ said tribal members should ask ICE agents if they are free to leave and do so if possible. It also said they have the right to record agents.

If someone is detained, they have the right to remain silent and request an attorney. The FAQ recommended showing ID to the agents, but reiterated members do not have to speak.

If ICE arrives at a private home, the sheet suggested speaking through a closed door, peephole or window. Residents should request a signed judicial warrant before allowing entry.

The FAQ noted most ICE warrants are administrative (signed by an ICE official) rather than judicial (signed by a judge) and do not allow entry into a home without permission.

""If there is not a valid judicial warrant, you do not need to open your door or consent to any searches,"" the FAQ says.

However, if ICE agents enter a home without consent, the tribe recommends avoiding physical resistance, but to clearly state that a person does not consent.

How should members deal with ICE at tribal buildings?

The Bay Mills Community FAQ notes ICE only may access public spaces, including the lobby of the governmental center and waiting room of the health center without a judicial warrant.

Employees are instructed to ask for a judicial warrant if they encounter ICE, and the FAQ notes only the president can grant access to private areas.

If no warrant is provided, employees should ask ICE to leave. If agents refuse or start a search, employees should state that they do not consent to a search and while contacting tribal officials.","https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/19/PMJS/83729181007-mjs-enbridge-18-3.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 05:58:13.234863

The vehicle was driven by a migrant in San Antonio, sending an agent to the hospital, according to an X post from Governor Greg Abbott.

Abbott posted the allegations to his X account on Wednesday morning, stating, ""A criminal illegal alien rammed ICE vehicles in San Antonio, sending an agent to the hospital.""

He calls for the arrest of those obstructing immigration enforcement, claiming organized groups are putting officers and law-abiding civilians at risk.

The incident happened on Tuesday on the North Side at the Walmart Supercenter along Blanco Road near Wurzbach Parkway.

The video, shot by ICE, was first broadcast Tuesday night on ""Hannity."" It shows ICE agents surrounding the vehicle while speaking with the driver, whose windows are up.

According to the ""Hannity Report,” the driver was allegedly in the country illegally.

The driver begins to move the vehicle, despite agents’ attempts to stop him. They then try to flee, reversing and slamming into a vehicle behind him, and then forward again, crashing into a second car as ICE agents attempted to intervene.

Agents are seen drawing their weapons as the situation escalates. The driver eventually exits the vehicle and lies on the ground, where he is taken into custody.

We have been able to confirm with federal sources that the agent on the driver's side of the vehicle is Miguel Vergara, Field Office Director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

But many questions remain. We reached out to San Antonio police, but no police report on the incident exists. We also reached out to the Bexar County Sheriff's Office to see if they were called, and we've also called ICE for comment. We haven't received any additional information about the agent who was injured or what hospital they were taken to.

In an interview with Fox News, ICE director Todd Lyons said agents face roadblocks like this every day. He says while people have the constitutional right to protest, it's unlawful to impede or obstruct law enforcement operations.

""It's constant impediments, constant attacks like this, and, you know, it's not safe for my folks. It's not safe for the public. It really needs to stop.""

Lyons said the agent who was inside the vehicle that was rammed had to be hospitalized for neck injuries. He says HSI, ICE, and the FBI are investigating incidents like these and intend to hold people accountable.

When asked about the Philadelphia District Attorney's threat to prosecute ICE agents, Lyons said they don't have to worry about arresting his agents.

""What I'll say is the men and women of ICE, the men of women of VRO, the men women of HSI, they're not committing any crimes. So he doesn't have to worry about arresting any of my folks, because what we're doing is we're enforcing the law. We are out there every day making this nation and his city safe again. So he shouldn't worry about the men or women of ICE.""

Each group had roughly a dozen people in attendance, with many signing up to speak during public comment. Some speakers even led chants with their groups when they had a chance to talk.

“ICE out now! ICE out now!” one chant exclaimed during Tuesday’s city council meeting.

“Trump’s ICE agents are terrorizing our cities,” Sawant said at the council meeting. “Thousands of immigrant, working, and poor people are being grabbed off the street.”

SAARPR launched an “anti-ICE petition” for members of the Seattle City Council to sign, demanding accountability for ICE’s actions while additionally calling for an immediate end to ICE raids and mass deportations in the region.

The council engaged in a back-and-forth discussion with the public after the public comment period closed, but the interruptions got out of hand, prompting the council to briefly suspend its meeting.

“Will you let us continue our business?” Hollingsworth asked. “OK, we’re going to go into a 10-minute recess to cool it out.”

The Seattle City Council was able to take up business after a recess. Newly elected City Council President Joy Hollingsworth agreed to meet with SAARPR after the council meeting, but it ended abruptly when Hollingsworth would not commit to signing the petition at that time.

“Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth claimed that she would meet with us face to face, and we had a short meeting where she and the rest of the council admitted she had not read our letter, and would not be signing onto it,” SAARPR stated on social media after the meeting. “Knowing this, we have declined the meeting on Wednesday.

Bucks County Sheriff Danny Ceisler made the announcement during a press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 14, outside the Bucks County Justice Center on North Main Street in Doylestown.

“After careful evaluation, I have determined that the certain public safety costs of this ICE partnership are greatly outweighed by any potential public safety benefits that this partnership may offer,” Ceisler said. “That is why this morning I signed an order terminating the 287(g) partnership between the Bucks County Sheriff’s Office and ICE.”

In April 2025, Fred Harran -- who was the Bucks County Sheriff at the time – announced a plan for his office to partner with ICE under the 287(g) agreement, allowing local law enforcement agencies to become deputized to perform immigration enforcement.

“The 287(g) program dates back to the Clinton administration but has been far more widely used during the Trump administration, particularly during the second Trump administration, as a method to assist in the administration’s stated goals of deporting over one million men, women and children per year,” Ceisler said.

Ceisler explained that 287(g) partnerships can take the forms of jail enforcement, warrant service or a task force, with the task force model granting “exceptionally broad authority” to local law enforcement agencies.

“It allows officers to stop, interrogate and detain anybody who they believe is in the country without current authorization,” Ceisler said.

Harran described the task force as a “common-sense initiative” that allowed select deputies in his office to utilize a federal immigration database and identify individuals who were in the country illegally and were taken into custody based on existing criminal charges and outstanding warrants in Bucks County.

Harran defended his efforts to work with ICE during an appearance on NBC10 @Issue and Battleground Politics with Lauren Mayk. Harran insisted the task force would only go after those who were charged with crimes in the Bucks County region.

“What is so bad about making the arrests, which we do now, but now, afterwards, ship them out so they can’t commit crimes tomorrow? Because our courts, our judicial system, our prisons are packed,” Harran said. “They cannot hold the amount of people. So why not save the U.S. taxpayer dollar and ship them back to the country they came from? Only those people that have already been charged with a crime. I’m not talking about somebody owning a pizza shop or working a landscape company. That’s not who we’re talking about here.”

Harran’s initial announcement of the plan led to considerable backlash, including a lawsuit from the ACLU of Pennsylvania, Make the Road Pennsylvania, NAACP Bucks County, and the BuxMont Unitarian Universalists. The lawsuit – which was filed in September 2025 – accused the sheriff of making the move illegally and claimed that the decision should have been made by the Bucks County Commissioners.

Bucks County Judge Hon. Jeffrey Trauger sided with Harran in an October 2025 ruling, however.

“Today’s court ruling is a victory for the law-abiding residents of Bucks County and a validation of a common-sense approach to public safety which fully leverages partnerships and resources to keep our communities safe,” Harran said at the time. “This decision affirms our ability to use this simple tool to ensure individuals who commit crimes in our county are held fully accountable – regardless of their immigration status.”

A month after the ruling however, Harran – a Republican – was ousted by his Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler in the Bucks County sheriff’s race. Ceisler won by a margin of about 15% as part of a “blue wave” in a county that was long considered “purple” as far as politics.

After his victory, Ceisler, a U.S. Army veteran, attorney and former public safety official in the Shapiro administration, assumed office on Jan. 5, 2026.

During Wednesday’s announcement, Ceisler said 16 deputies in Bucks County had received expanded immigration authority under Harran though no immigrants had actually been detained. While explaining his decision to end the partnership, Ceisler talked about Bucks County’s community of over 50,000 immigrants, primarily from India, South Asia, Latin America, Liberia and Ukraine.

“Those immigrants are our neighbors. They are our friends. They are taxpayers,” Ceisler said. “And they deserve the protection of law enforcement in this community.”

Ceisler said he received feedback from immigration leaders in the community who told him immigrants were living in fear under the county’s ICE partnership.

“One leader in the Latino community who wasn’t able to make it today reported to me that not a single member of their community had called 911 or felt comfortable reporting a crime since this partnership became public,” Ceisler said. “They feared that local law enforcement responding to a crime they reported would take them too.”

Ceisler said tensions with ICE across the country also amplified those fears.

“We have seen good, law-abiding residents who are doing everything right to earn their citizenship detained and deported by the Trump administration,” Ceisler said.

In addition to terminating his office’s partnership with ICE, Ceisler also signed an additional order prohibiting his deputies from asking crime victims, witnesses, or court observers about their immigration status.

Despite the ending of the partnership, Ceisler insisted Bucks County will not be a so-called ""sanctuary county.""

“We will ensure that actual dangerous criminals who are in the country illegally are deported, which has been standard practice in Bucks County for decades,"" Ceisler said.

Officials also said the Bucks County Department of Corrections will continue to share information with ICE regarding its inmate population and ICE will also have 24/7 access to the county jail.

Wednesday afternoon, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson sent NBC10 a statement on Ceisler's decision.

Officials say those agents have arrested around 2,500 people so far.

Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, protests continue. Advocates say what's happening inside the courtrooms is also alarming.

A group of Minnesotans makes it their job to watch what happens. Known as court observers, they're a team dedicated to watching, listening and documenting.

Madeline Lohman is the advocacy director at The Advocates of Human Rights. She oversees court observers inside immigration courtrooms.

Their job is simple: monitor hearings like asylum claims and removal orders, providing a record of what happens.

""Courts are one of the places where people are supposed to access justice,"" Lohman said.

The group has conducted court monitoring since 2017. Observers typically sit in the back of the courtroom notebook and pen in hand, documenting how the hearing is unfolding and how the individual is treated during the proceeding. But advocates say this year has been the most challenging.

Lohman says since early 2025 access to court proceedings were limited, even at times doors were looked.

""They've spent really a lot of time in this administration to hide what they are doing to make it difficult to document,"" she said.

Lohman says when observers are granted access, they've seen injustices happening like people being denied to argue their case. Other times, names and complete case numbers are removed making it tough for observers to identify the person and follow the case.

That limitation is the reason why a demand letter from attorneys was sent to the courts Friday, putting them on notice.

Lohman said this week, observers were allowed inside the courtroom. But access to the lobby is still being denied.

According to a fact sheet on the U. S Dept of Justice's website, immigration courts are open to the public with limited exceptions. That includes if the judge grants a party's motion to close the hearing or if the judge decides to limit attendance.

Protests erupted in cities across the United States after Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross during a chaotic encounter.

Federal officials, including President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vance, have claimed Ross acted in self-defense. However, state and local leaders, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have emphatically rejected those claims while demanding federal agents leave.

An analysis by USA TODAY of videos taken at the scene of the shooting show the situation unfolded. A nationwide poll conducted in the days after the shooting found more than half of voters thought the shooting was not justified.

Here's what to know about your rights if federal immigration enforcement agents show up at your door.

Do I have to open my door for ICE?

You don't have to let police officers or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain types of warrants.

If police have an arrest warrant, they're legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. But a warrant of removal or deportation doesn't allow immigration agents to enter your home without your consent.

You have the right to remain silent even if the officer has a warrant.

What should I do if ICE is at my door?

To reduce the risk to yourself, stay calm and keep the door closed – opening the door doesn't give ICE permission to enter, the ACLU says, but it is safer to speak through the door.

Then, the ACLU recommends that you:

Ask if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.

Ask the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.

Ask if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.

Don’t lie or produce any false documents, and don’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.

State: “I do not consent to your entry.”

If agents force their way in, don't resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”

If you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159939007-2256087844.jpg?crop=5812,3270,x0,y302&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 02:57:28.137127

Since taking office a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards and screening immigrants' social media posts and past speeches.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump's immigration and travel-related policies, saying they harm due process guarantees and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies seek to improve domestic security.

ICE's actions have been subject to particular criticism by protesters, community leaders, Democrats and human rights advocates.

allows people from nations going through natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises to live and work temporarily in the United States.
Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S.","Immigrant rights lawyers on Wednesday urged a federal appeals court in California to affirm a district court’s order that would block the Trump administration from ending temporary deportation protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States.

In oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, lawyers representing immigrants who had been covered under the protections said many of their clients had already lost their jobs and businesses as the program, known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., has been allowed to expire.

Hundreds of Venezuelans have been detained and deported, and parents are being separated from their American-born children, the lawyers said.

“We absolutely have shown harm in all 50 states,” Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the panel at the hearing in Pasadena, Calif.

Sarah Welch, a lawyer with the Justice Department, urged the appeals court to overturn the district court order. She said the Supreme Court had already made two rare interventions on the issue, both favoring the Trump administration’s decision to end T.P.S.

In October, the Supreme Court temporarily stayed the district court ruling and allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its new policy while arguments continued in the lower courts. Whatever the Ninth Circuit decides, the outcome is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Ms. Welch said that Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, had followed appropriate legal procedures to reverse the Biden administration’s extensions of the initiative and that Ms. Noem had done so in the interest of national security.

The hearing came as the relationship between the United States and Venezuela is entering new territory.

At the beginning of January, the Trump administration conducted a military operation that captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to New York to stand trial. Since then, President Trump has asserted that the United States is running Venezuela, working with Mr. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.

On Thursday, an envoy sent by Ms. Rodríguez will visit Washington to explore reopening Venezuela’s embassy. On the same day, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuela’s top opposition leader, María Corina Machado.

Administration officials have sought to encourage Venezuelan immigrants to return to their native country, arguing that the removal of Mr. Maduro — a man whom American prosecutors accuse of being a narco-terrorist and a drug kingpin — would soon ensure a safer and more stable Venezuela.

The court case, brought by several T.P.S. holders and the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy organization, also seeks to preserve the protected status for roughly 330,000 Haitians that is slated to expire in February.

The hearing is the latest salvo in a wave of legal challenges around the country that are seeking to stop the Trump administration’s efforts to upend the T.P.S. program, slash the number of people admitted as refugees, dismantle the asylum process and end other humanitarian protections for immigrants.

Over the past year, Mr. Trump, long a skeptic of asylum seekers and refugees, has sought to drastically curb the forms of legal immigration, arguing that some petitioners are exploiting the programs and threatening national security.

Immigration lawyers and advocates say that the administration is embarking on the largest de-legalization effort in U.S. history as it seeks to expel millions of immigrants from the United States.

T.P.S. allows people from nations going through natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises to live and work temporarily in the United States. For some recipients, the program had become all but permanent, as crises in their home countries have continued for decades.

Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S. program for more than a million people from Haiti, Venezuela and at least half a dozen other countries. This week, as more federal immigration agents descended upon Minnesota in the wake of a social services scandal implicating Somali Americans, the Trump administration announced that it would end T.P.S. for Somalis.

In the latest court filings, government lawyers argue that Ms. Noem initially moved to end the Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans because conditions in Venezuela had improved in critical areas, such as public health and the economy. But lawyers representing the T.P.S. holders countered that administration officials had not conducted a meaningful review of the country’s conditions, that Ms. Noem’s actions had violated federal legal procedures and that they were based on racial animus.

An estimated 130,000 Haiti-born residents and nearly 300,000 with Haitian roots live here, making Creole Florida’s third most spoken language.
For Michael Lambert, a TPS holder in the U.S. for nearly five decades, the situation takes a severe mental toll.
""Over 113,000 Haitian TPS [holders] are in the workforce in Florida alone,"" Petit said.
She noted that they contribute $1.3 billion in state and local taxes, while 63,000 TPS homeowners add $19 billion to housing values.","For Farah Larrieux, the United States is more than a place of residence. It is where she rebuilt her life.

A resident since 2005 and a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holder since the program was designated for Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, Larrieux sees herself as proof that TPS works. But with the program set to expire on Feb. 3, 2026, everything she has built is now in jeopardy.

""I’m one of the immigrants who contribute to the development of the United States, that the Trump administration wants to deport,"" Larrieux said during a vigil for the 16th anniversary of Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, hosted by Family Action Network Movement (FANM).

“TPS has changed my life,” she said. “The program has given me the opportunity to continue to build my life, develop my personal capacity and my career as a communication strategist and a social entrepreneur.”

Larrieux is one of approximately 350,000 Haitians whose legal right to live and work in the U.S. hangs in the balance after the Department of Homeland Security announced in November 2025 that Haiti no longer meets the TPS criteria. The administration argued that extending the designation would be “incompatible with national interests,” urging beneficiaries to prepare to leave the country or use the CBP Home app to “self-deport” — a program offering a free flight and a $3,000 stipend.

Living in a countdown

The looming deadline has sent shockwaves through South Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade County, home to the nation's largest Haitian diaspora. An estimated 130,000 Haiti-born residents and nearly 300,000 with Haitian roots live here, making Creole Florida’s third most spoken language.

At FANM, lead organizer Paul Christian Namphy said the dominant emotion is fear.

“It means great uncertainty,” Namphy said. “There is a lawsuit that has been launched to stop the administration from turning thousands of people's and families' lives upside down, but we don't know how that's going to go in court.”

Ongoing lawsuits, including Miot et al. v. Trump, argue that U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem violated administrative law and the Constitution by terminating Haiti’s TPS designation effective Feb. 3, 2026.

Dinah Escarment — a community advocate whose office, Escarment Multiservices, helps with immigration, and a Florida House candidate for the state’s 108th District — describes a community retreating into the shadows.

“They're telling me that they don't go to church anymore,"" Escarment said. ""Because they have fear, the one thing that's supposed to protect them and keep them safe, they feel like they don't even have access to that anymore.""

For Michael Lambert, a TPS holder in the U.S. for nearly five decades, the situation takes a severe mental toll.

“I’m a nervous wreck,” he said. “Every day, I look outside, I hear sirens, and I’m thinking they’re coming for me.”

According to Namphy, families face three impossible choices as the deadline approaches:

""Are you going to stay in the shadows, in fear, where at any moment anything can happen to you? Are you going to try to go to a third country? Or are you going to go to Haiti under very difficult conditions?""

Lambert represents the deep integration of TPS holders. He sold property in Haiti to build a life here, only to face losing it all. When asked about his plans following Feb. 3, Lambert said he feels he has no choice.

“If it is what it is, I would just have to go back to my country and try to avoid getting killed,” leaving his kids and wife behind, he said. “I don’t know, my marriage might end up being gone too, because out of sight.”

Reality on the ground

The U.S. government’s assertion that conditions in Haiti have improved enough to resume deportations stands in stark contrast to reports from human rights organizations. Since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, armed gangs have seized control of large parts of the country.

District 2 Miami-Dade Commissioner Marleine Bastien emphasized the deterioration of the island nation.

""It would have been encouraging to tell you that after 16 years, things are better,” she said. “Haiti is 10 times worse off than it was in 2010.”

She noted gangs control 90% of the capital with ""war weapons.” The U.N. human rights office reported at least 2,680 killings in early 2025, hundreds kidnapped, and sexual violence and child recruitment on the rise, while the International Organization for Migration found the number of displaced residents climbed to 1.4 million by October 2025.

“Young women and girls do not think about if they’re going to be raped,” Bastien said. “They think about when they’re going to be raped. This is a country at war.”

Recently, the Associated Pressreported that Doctors Without Borders suspended services at a Port-au-Prince clinic due to escalating violence.

“If TPS was given because of the earthquake and now the country is in worse shape, how can we plan to deport people who have lived their lives here, who work here?” Bastien asked.

A broken system

Larrieux said the deadline is only the latest chapter in a “broken” immigration system. She described a past residency interview that she said derailed her life.

""She (the immigration officer) coerced my husband at that time and forced him to sign a document to withdraw his petition, which could have granted me the permanent residency,"" Larrieux recalled.

Though the agent eventually interviewed Larrieux separately and ""finally realized that she had made a mistake,” Larrieux said officials lacked the ""moral conscience to fix the mistake,"" making the damage irreversible.

“It affected me for years, to the point that I fell into depression. I lost my hair, and I even became suicidal,” Larrieux said.

Most recently, the administration ended family-reunification parole programs and halted all immigration processes, including adjustment of status, for Haitians and nationals of 15 other countries.

“We are not undocumented by choice. We have been denied immigration reform by legislators, some of whom are children of immigrants who have benefited from immigration reform in the past,” Larrieux said.

Economic fallout

Beyond the human toll, advocates warn of severe economic consequences.

“Without immigrants, South Florida doesn’t exist,” Namphy said. “Immigrants are essential to our way of life, to our economy, to hotels, restaurants, and basic health structures.”

Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, highlighted the financial stakes.

""Over 113,000 Haitian TPS [holders] are in the workforce in Florida alone,"" Petit said.

She noted that they contribute $1.3 billion in state and local taxes, while 63,000 TPS homeowners add $19 billion to housing values.

Escarment says the labor market is already contracting.

""A lot of my clients have lost their jobs since last year,"" she noted. ""The employers are like, 'You're not going to be able to work here long, then I'll have to hire someone else.'""

What’s next?

Community leaders are demanding legislative courage. Namphy criticized local officials who claim to support constituents while cooperating with federal deportation efforts.

“They have a choice now. Many of them are choosing to harm our communities,"" Namphy said.

Escarment, eyeing a seat in the state legislature, believes a pragmatic, financial approach is the only language the administration understands. She proposes a ""pay for status"" model through which long-term residents pay a fee to regularize their status.

""The administration hears money, so we have to talk in their language,"" Escarment argued. ""Think about all these people. It's a win-win because we're going to try to pay for it anyway.”

Larrieux called on the White House to recognize immigrant contributions.

The big picture: Americans are showing signs of discomfort about the far-reaching federal intervention of ICE and Border Patrol, with major cities like Boston and Phoenix anticipating agent arrivals.

That expanded intervention has so far led to thousands of arrests across the country, a CEO's resignation, employees forced out of their workplaces and protesters directly arguing with federal agents, attracting criticism from lawmakers and prominent podcasters from Joe Rogan to comedian Tim Dillon.

""These are not well-trained law enforcement people in ICE,"" Dillon said. ""They're not the cream of the crop.""

By the numbers: A majority of Americans say ICE is making the country less safe rather than more safe (47% vs 34%), according to an Economist and YouGov poll released Tuesday and conducted from Jan. 9-12.

The same poll found that a majority of Americans say shooting Good was not justified (50% vs. 30%), while 20% were unsure.

Here are five flashpoint moments to know.

Renee Good shooting in Minnesota

An ICE officer shot and killed Good, a 37-year-old mother, in early January during ""targeted operations"" in Minneapolis, Axios previously reported.

Good was not the target of the enforcement activity, law enforcement officials said at the time.

The shooting came amid a surge of immigration enforcement in Minnesota, which included thousandsof agents entering the state.

Protesters took to the streets nationwide for ""ICE Out For Good"" protests and vigils after the fatal shooting.

DHS, DOJ investigations into ICE shooting

Tension has bubbled as federal authorities indicated they wouldn't probe the officer's conduct in the Minnesota shooting.

There's ""currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation,"" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Tuesday.

Federal investigators have restricted Minnesota investigators' access to case materials and put the FBI in charge of the probe.

What they're saying: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the shooting, calling Good's actions an ""act of domestic terrorism"" before any investigation concluded.

""As we uncover more of this criminal activity, we're going to continue to surge resources to make sure this abuse of government funds and government power no longer continues in Minnesota,"" Noem said, per CBS News.

The other side: More than 50 lawmakers signaled support for articles of impeachment against Noem.

""Secretary Noem is failing the American people by threatening, intimidating, and harassing my neighbors and I believe she must be removed from office,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.).

CBP shooting in Portland

A separate shooting incident involving federal agents in Portland further added to the mounting tension.

Federal officials said the two people who were shot were trying to harm Border Patrol agents. But local officials decried the incident as an example of federal law enforcement overreach.

Though not an ICE incident — ICE and Border Patrol are different entities — the shooting happened a day after Good's killing, giving protesters more fuel for their demonstrations.

Minnesota woman ripped from car in viral video

A woman in Minneapolis was arrested Tuesday after allegedly impeding an ICE operation in the city, according to multiple reports.

In a video with more than 3.3 million views on X, the woman can be seen near ICE vehicles while driving close to a protest. The agents then yanked the woman from her car in a chaotic scene.

As the woman was dragged away from her car, she can be heard yelling: ""I'm disabled, I'm trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I couldn't move. I am an autistic disabled person, I'm trying to go to the doctor.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe accuses ICE of holding members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, which is one of the largest Indigenous tribal nations in the U.S., accused ICE of illegally holding tribal members who were picked up during Minnesota raids, Axios reports.

Oglala Sioux Tribe president Frank Star Comes Out wrote in a memo to federal officials that the tribal members should be released.

The four men who were picked up were homeless, he wrote.

Zoom in: Star Comes Out said that federal officials told the tribal nation that they would receive information about the detained tribal members only if the tribe entered into an agreement with ICE.

The tribe declined.

For more on ICE's operations in Minnesota, I'm joined now by the state's attorney general. That is Keith Ellison.

Attorney General Ellison, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.

Keith Ellison, Minnesota Attorney General:

Thanks for having me.

Amna Nawaz:

So, I want to begin with a little legal news today, because I know your office had asked a federal judge to temporarily block a surge of ICE agents to the Minneapolis area. The judge declined to rule today, giving DOJ until Monday to respond.

So does that mean that another surge of agents is on their way? And what are you anticipating in the way of the size and scope of that new surge?

Keith Ellison:

Well, it certainly does mean that they have a little bit more time to search, which concerns me, because the searching they have done so far has been destructive, not helpful to anybody. It has risked public safety. It has depleted public resources. It has increased fear.

And It has eroded Americans' confidence in their government and has been a whole -- wholly a failure in every conceivable way. So I am a little disappointed. But I believe that this is a wonderful judge, who's a deeply thoughtful person, who really just wants to make sure the best decision she can make.

And that takes time. No doubt, however, that, as time is of the essence, right, and we need relief from this surge, this dramatic escalation founded on lies and untruths, which is doing so much damage.

Amna Nawaz:

I also want to put to you another piece of news today. We heard from the Border Patrol, Bovino, who said on FOX the Department of Justice is also sending additional prosecutors to Minnesota to process those immigration cases. What's your reaction to that?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I mean, quite honestly, I mean, it -- I'm not shocked, because the -- President Trump is making sure that he is targeting our state, which is odd because we are not a state that has the most immigration in America.

Many other states have dramatically higher rates of immigration than we do. We do have some, and we're very proud of our neighbors who've chosen to make America their home. But I guess I'm not surprised that we're getting unwarranted, unasked-for attention from President Trump.

He's made it very clear that, because he believes that he won Minnesota three times, but in fact lost it, he's upset about that, has repeated that numerous times. So we expect the persecution will continue while he operates the way he's operating.

Amna Nawaz:

You heard there the border czar...

(Crosstalk)

Amna Nawaz:

Sorry. Go ahead.

Keith Ellison:

Or until a court tells him he can no longer do it.

Amna Nawaz:

Well, you probably heard in our report there the border czar Tom Homan telling my colleague Liz Landers that this is about what they call their your sanctuary policies in Minnesota and Minneapolis.

Specifically, there is this idea of not honoring an ICE detainer, meaning, if there's an undocumented person in city or state custody in Minnesota, they're not handed over to ICE. And I do want to point out that you did issue in an informal opinion last year, you wrote that Minnesota law prohibits law enforcement from holding someone on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody.

So what does that otherwise released from custody mean? Do you ever hand people over to ICE or not?

Keith Ellison:

Well, what it means is that we comply with the law and the Constitution of the United States of America and the state of Minnesota.

And I would submit to you that Minnesota is not a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary state. What we do is, we devote all of our state resources to state matters and that the federal government has its responsibility. We don't interfere with them, but we don't devote state resources to federal projects like immigration enforcement.

So we don't really -- so this idea of some sort of a sanctuary state is a misnomer. We have never claimed that. And I think it's wholly -- I think the voters and the taxpayers of our state expect that the resources of our state will be devoted for the purposes of our state and that the federal government, they're paid to do their job and we don't interfere with them doing it.

We also don't do their job for them.

Amna Nawaz:

Before we go, I want to briefly ask you too about the ongoing investigation into the shooting and killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

I know Minnesota officials were shut out of the federal investigation. Your office has since launched essentially a parallel probe. You have probably seen the news of DHS saying that the ICE officer was injured and suffered internal bleeding. My question to you is, are you going to have any access to any of these medical records, the agent, any other evidence, body camera footage?

And, if not, how can your office carry out a thorough investigation on this issue?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I will just point out that all we have been asking for is a fair, free, open investigation. How they would make such a claim without producing a medical record to prove it I find curious and why in the world they would not just do the investigation.

We have heard that the Department of Justice Civil Rights Department has been excluded from doing the investigation. These people know the most about these cases in the federal government, yet they're not doing the case.

And at the same time, they're reject -- they're stopping the state from doing the work that we're supposed to do. I do not necessarily take the word of those people. I will take the word of a trained medical professional who's made a diagnosis and a medical record made for the purpose of diagnosis and medical treatment.

But I'm not going to just take the word of some nameless, faceless bureaucrat who's just -- I don't know. But, I mean, let me just say this.

I find it interesting that the federal government, the federal authorities shut the state of Minnesota out from the investigation, will not let the most expert people in their own institution investigate the case, but like to -- like to send out little pieces of information that they believe benefit them, like the video that is purported to be from Jonathan Ross and now this non-medical personnel giving testimony or giving public statements about medical conditions.

So I will stop right there.

Amna Nawaz:

That is Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison joining us tonight.

""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""","A federal court has upheld the new congressional map approved by California voters last month, giving Democrats a chance to counter the nationwide redistricting effort led by President Trump and his Republican allies.

The court challenge to the redistricting plan had been brought by the California Republican Party and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court found that the new district map did not violate laws against racial gerrymandering.

The Republicans argued that the new map was motivated by a desire to increase the voting power of Latinos. The court, in a two-to-one ruling, rejected that claim, noting that voters approved the measure, called ""Proposition 50"" and there was no evidence they acted on racial grounds.

""The evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton in the majority opinion.

The court denied the Republican plaintiffs' request the court issue an injunction blocking the redistricting as the case proceeds to a final judgement. The Republicans could still appeal the ruling.

Usually states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census. But Trump set off a mid-decade redistricting race as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the House. This summer he pushed Texas Republicans to redraw that state's districts, potentially helping the GOP win five House seats in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina have each redistricted to help the GOP in one seat.

After the Texas redistricting, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to respond by redrawing the map in his state. At his urging, lawmakers put the matter on the ballot and California voters approved a redistricting plan there in a special election Nov. 4. That measure passed with 64 percent of the vote.

For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump

For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle. Supporters largely viewed it as an opportunity for the blue state to push back against the Trump administration. Newsom argued the approach was necessary to counter the GOP-led redistricting effort in Texas and ""fight fire with fire"" and boost Democrats' chances ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The Republican-led lawsuit against the measure contended it violated the law by disproportionately giving the state's Latino voters a stronger voice over other racial voting blocs.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kenneth Lee, who was appointed by President Trump in 2018, said the designer of the map, hired by the Democrats, had publicly said that he was aiming to boost Latino voting power.

""The Democratic supermajority in the California state legislature wanted to curry favor with Latino groups and voters—and to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party,"" Lee wrote.

The majority ruling rejected that argument, finding that it was not the mapmaker or even the legislature that held the deciding power but rather the voters on the proposition and that it was debated by proponents and opponents as a partisan move.

In her opinion, Staton, appointed to the bench by President Obama, found a ""mountain of evidence produced by Defendants that the voters intended to enact a partisan gerrymander.""

""Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed,"" wrote Newsom in a statement. ""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""

Overall, the redistricting race is close with Republicans on track to tilt a couple or few more seats their way than Democrats have. Indiana Republicans refused to follow Trump's lead last month and redistrict there. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to lead his state in drawing a new map that will favor the GOP.

Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have started the redistricting process to favor their party in that state. Currently, the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats and if Democrats take control, they could slow Trump's agenda or launch investigations into his administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8253x4642+0+430/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F5d%2F3c49cc9043eeac66acbac65f3c2b%2Fap25309666893880.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 00:59:16.910989

The case is Carolina Migrant Network et al.","-- Two immigrant legal groups have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in North Carolina federal court Wednesday to pry loose records about the agency's purported blanket use of ankle monitors in its Alternatives to Detention program, which they said is intended to induce self-deportation.

Prompted by press reports about the policy shift, nonprofits Carolina Migrant Network and Amica Center for Immigrant Rights sought a June 9 memo and related field guidance containing a directive to place ankle monitors on everyone enrolled in the program, except pregnant women, according to their suit.

The groups first sought the documents, which they said have not been made public yet, through a Freedom of Information Act request filed Oct. 28, but sued after the agency failed to act on the request, they said.

The groups say ICE ""has a great deal of discretion"" to release immigrants with pending immigration court hearings into the community through the Alternatives to Detention, or ATD, program, which uses various forms of monitoring to ensure immigrants show up to those hearings.

Carolina Migrant Network and Amica says the program has ballooned over the past five years, with 181,000 immigrants enrolled as of December, nearly three times the number of detained immigrants.

Of those enrolled in the program, the groups said 36,000 are wearing ankle monitors, double the number as of the end of 2024.

Even though ICE has said the ATD program is meant to boost compliance, the groups cited reports showing that enrollees actually have lower compliance rates. They also said the use of ankle monitors inflicts serious financial, physical and psychological harms, disrupting day-to-day life and at times causing injuries and worsening health conditions.

A study cited in the complaint found that 60% of ATD program participants wearing ankle monitors reported severe ""impact"" to their health, the groups said.

""As media reporting on ATD makes apparent, ICE's true purpose in imposing a blanket 'ankle monitoring for all' policy is the goal of coercing noncitizens into accepting 'voluntary' deportation,"" they said.

Counsel for the groups and for ICE did not return requests for comment on Wednesday.

If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.","A top Trump administration lawyer pressed a federal judge Wednesday to block a newly enacted California law that bans most law enforcement officers in the state from wearing masks, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Tiberius Davis, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, argued at a hearing in Los Angeles that the first-of-its-kind ban on police face coverings could unleash chaos across the country, and potentially land many ICE agents on the wrong side of the law it were allowed to take effect.

“Why couldn’t California say every immigration officer needs to wear pink, so it’s super obvious who they are?” Davis told U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder. “The idea that all 50 states can regulate the conduct and uniforms of officers ... flips the Constitution on its head.”

The judge appeared skeptical.

“Why can’t they perform their duties without a mask? They did that until 2025, did they not?” Snyder said. “How in the world do those who don’t mask manage to operate?”

The administration first sued to block the new rules in November, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act and its companion provision, the No Vigilantes Act, into law. Together, The laws bar law enforcement officers from wearing masks and compel them to display identification “while conducting law enforcement operations in the Golden State.” Both offenses would be misdemeanors.

Federal officials have vowed to defy the new rules, saying they are unconstitutional and put agents in danger. They have also decried an exception in the law for California state peace officers, arguing the carve out is discriminatory. The California Highway Patrol is among those exempted, while city and county agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, must comply.

“These were clearly and purposefully targeted at the federal government,” Davis told the court Wednesday. “Federal officers face prosecution if they do not comply with California law, but California officers do not.”

The hearing comes at a moment of acute public anger at the agency following the fatal shooting of American protester Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis — rage that has latched on to masks as a symbol of perceived lawlessness and impunity.

“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” California Department of Justice lawyer Cameron Bell told the court Wednesday. “The state has had to bear the cost of the federal government’s actions. These are very real consequences.”

She pointed to declarations from U.S. citizens who believed they were being abducted by criminals when confronted by masked immigration agents, including incidents where local police were called to respond.

“I later learned that my mother and sister witnessed the incident and reported to the Los Angeles Police Department that I was kidnapped,” Angeleno Andrea Velez said in one such declaration. “Because of my mother’s call, LAPD showed up to the raid.”

The administration argues the anti-mask law would put ICE agents and other federal immigration enforcement officers at risk of doxing and chill the “zealous enforcement of the law.”

“The laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the government said in court filings.

Davis also told the court that ICE‘s current tactics were necessary in part because of laws across California and in much of the U.S. that limit police cooperation with ICE and bar immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as schools and courts.

California contends its provisions are “modest” and aligned with past practice, and that the government’s evidence showing immigration enforcement would be harmed is thin.

Bell challenged Department of Homeland Security statistics purporting to show an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE agents and a 1,000% increase in assaults, saying the government has recently changed what qualifies as a “threat” and that agency claims have faced “significant credibility issues” in federal court.

“Blowing a whistle to alert the community, that’s hardly something that increases threats,” Bell said.

On the identification rule, Snyder appeared to agree.

“One might argue that there’s serious harm to the government if agents’ anonymity is preserved,” she said.

The fate of the mask law may hinge on the peace officer exemption.

“Would your discrimination argument go away if the state changed legislation to apply to all officers?” Snyder asked.

“I believe so,” Davis said.

The ban was slated to come into force on Jan. 1, but is on hold while the case makes its way through the courts. If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.

The unbelievable claims were discredited by video evidence and by local officials. The president and his team peddled the lines anyway, hoping not only to smear the victim but also to convince Americans not to believe their lying eyes.

There’s some evidence to suggest those efforts haven’t worked, at least not yet.

The latest Economist/YouGov poll, for example, found that the vast majority of Americans are familiar with what transpired in Minneapolis, and by a 20-point margin, people saw the shooting as unjustified (50% vs. 30%). The same survey found that a 56% majority of Americans believe that both state and federal officials should be responsible for investigating the shooting, which is the opposite of the Trump administration’s position.

“It’s grocery bills, utility costs, rent, property taxes, and paychecks that don’t go far enough,” Mr. Blakeman said in a statement.
Ms. Hochul appeared at a news conference last week to trumpet a 20 percent decline in murders in the city.
Perhaps the most surprising area of conflict between Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul involved a topic on which they ostensibly agree.","As the presumptive Republican candidate for governor of New York, Bruce Blakeman could be expected to find flaws in Gov. Kathy Hochul’s State of the State address.

Appearing in the State Capitol on Wednesday, a day after the annual address, he criticized the Democratic governor’s record on crime, complained about taxes and derided her child care agenda as a New York City giveaway.

But perhaps the starkest difference between them was in their stances on the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, which Ms. Hochul has portrayed as an outrage.

“When you look at both videos, it looks like the individual that was shot, that person was engaged in trying to run down the ICE officer,” Mr. Blakeman told reporters in Albany, with the caveat that he would like to see a full investigation.

And he mused that a similar incident, which he said had resulted from a lack of respect for law enforcement, could happen in New York City, now being led by Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.

It was a striking warning that underscored the differences between the visions of the state offered by Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The remarks came as Mr. Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, made his first trip to Albany as a candidate for governor. The visit was somewhat ill-timed: Scheduling conflicts (his own inauguration) kept Mr. Blakeman away from the Capitol on Tuesday; by the time he arrived in Albany, most of the Legislature had left for the weekend, leaving a single Republican assemblyman to stand by his side.

Mr. Blakeman announced his intention to run for governor last month, leading to a tense behind-the-scenes dance among state Republicans, a vast majority of whom had already committed to supporting Representative Elise Stefanik. But his candidacy received a boost from President Trump, who undermined Ms. Stefanik’s bid by declining to endorse her. Shortly after, she announced that she would not run for governor, or seek re-election to Congress.

On Wednesday, Mr. Blakeman, a staunch Trump ally, made his loyalty clear. “I support a lot of his policies, if not all of his policies,” he told the reporters gathered outside the press room on the third floor of the Capitol.

That seemed to include the president’s cutting and withholding of billions of dollars in city and state resources.

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he would withhold all funds from states like New York that contain so-called sanctuary cities, where local law enforcement officers are largely barred from helping federal immigration authorities. It was the latest in a series of Trump administration threats to cut funds for infrastructure, health care, social services and counterterrorism.

Asked about the cuts on Wednesday, Ms. Hochul took a hard line. “This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission, and that is something we’ll never do,” she said, noting that the state already cooperates with immigration authorities on criminal investigations.

But Mr. Blakeman disagreed, arguing that the president was right to withhold the funds.

“The problem is not with President Trump,” he said. “The problem is with the mayor and the City Council. You want to be a sanctuary city, you want to violate federal law, there are consequences.” He added later that he didn’t “want to put any shackles on ICE.”

Even so, Mr. Blakeman veered from the president’s insistence that prices have been falling and affordability is not an issue.

“It’s grocery bills, utility costs, rent, property taxes, and paychecks that don’t go far enough,” Mr. Blakeman said in a statement. “Families don’t need more rhetoric — they need results.”

And while Ms. Hochul has put forth a slate of programs, from energy assistance and auto insurance reform to universal child care and free school lunches, Mr. Blakeman said she had not done enough, and he promised to cut taxes if elected governor.

Mr. Blakeman is expected to replicate the strategy that his fellow Long Island Republican Lee Zeldin used to come within six percentage points of the governor’s mansion in 2022, prioritizing affordability issues and crime.

But on that front he may well face challenges: Crime in New York is down from its post-pandemic peak, when Mr. Zeldin was running. Ms. Hochul appeared at a news conference last week to trumpet a 20 percent decline in murders in the city. The decline came amid a 3 percent drop in major crime categories (the one exception was reported rapes, which increased partly because of a new broader definition of sexual assault).

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions on Wednesday but did not decide the closely watched dispute over the legality of President Donald Trump's global tariffs.

The court did not announce the next date when it will issue rulings. It does not announce in advance which rulings will be released on a given date.

The challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to office in January 2025. The outcome will impact the global economy.

During arguments in the case on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.

Yanira Cardona, the city’s Hispanic Outreach Coordinator appointed by Mayor Donna Deegan, said early Wednesday that people who are taken in should “comply,” but they should have a plan because “they’re out in Jacksonville.”

By the end of the day, a Deegan spokesperson said Cardona was on leave while the administration addressed the matter.

Here’s some of what led to her suspension.

“We are living in very difficult times, but my best advice is: 1. Have a plan in place with your lawyers. 2. Give someone you trust power of attorney for your business and your children. 3. If you are stopped by law enforcement, please cooperate and follow their instructions/orders,” Cardona wrote Wednesday, with a video explaining where people should be most careful.

The video was posted during business hours on a weekday and appears to be filmed in an office in City Hall, though the barking of a dog at one point suggests that may not be the case.

“ICE is out and about,” she said. “They are doing speed traps. They are, they’ve been seen on Emerson, on Beach Boulevard, on Atlantic and on the highway. They are targeting, literally, they’re targeting any lawn care companies, any AC company construction vans. They’re literally stopping them just to make sure that they have their paperwork.”

“I wish I could do more, and I wish I could say more. But this is the best I could do,” Cardona added.

Cardona’s comments elicited backlash.

Attorney General James Uthmeier said “this is illegal and needs to be seriously addressed!

“My office will be writing a response on this. Absolutely unacceptable! Her actions are not in alignment with Florida’s immigration laws. I want to know how many more taxpayers dollars are paying for salaries encouraging lawlessness?,” asked Rep. Kiyan Michael.

Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, who had joined three other Republicans to advance the resolution alongside Democrats last week, flipped after they said they received assurances from the Trump administration.

With Hawley and Young’s votes, the Senate was split 50-50 on the resolution. JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins cast their votes for the war powers resolution alongside Democrats.

Senate Democrats forcefully condemned Republican opposition to the resolution, which aimed to check the president as he threatens further action in other countries including Greenland, Iran and Mexico.

“Make no mistake about it: this vote makes things more dangerous, not less,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said. “It emboldens Donald Trump to push further down this reckless path.”

Tim Kaine, the Democratic senator from Virginia who has championed several war powers measures, said he was prepared to file “a whole lot more” to block Trump from carrying out military operations without congressional authorization.

“They can run but they can’t hide,” he said, referring to Republicans, whose support would be needed to approve the resolutions.

The president had put intense pressure on his fellow Republicans to vote down the measure that would have checked his ability to carry out further military attacks on Venezuela.

Trump lashed out at the five Republican senators who joined with Democrats to advance the resolution last week. Yet even the possibility that the Republican-controlled Senate would defy Trump on such a high-profile vote revealed the growing alarm on Capitol Hill about the president’s expanding foreign policy ambitions.

Democrats forced the vote after US troops captured the deposed Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month.

Young, one of five Republicans who voted with Democrats last week, says he now sides with Trump.

In a statement, Young said he “has received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela” after speaking with secretary of state Marco Rubio, and that if Trump were to pursue “major military operations”, he would ask Congress “in advance for an authorization of force”.

Hawley similarly told reporters that he had been persuaded after discussion with both Rubio and Trump that the resolution was no longer necessary.

The defeat comes less than a week after the US Senate advanced a bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela, after Trump authorized a pre-dawn raid to capture its leader, Nicolás Maduro, without giving Congress advance notice. The vote amounted to a rare rebuke of the president, and Trump responded by saying that the Republican senators who supported the resolution “should never be elected to office again”.

Wednesday’s vote hinged on a procedural maneuver challenging the resolution’s relevance based on the fact that no US troops were currently deployed in Venezuela. The motion allowed Young and Hawley to vote to kill the resolution without abandoning their initial objections to military action in Venezuela.

Paul, a libertarian long opposed to US military intervention abroad, called it an “absurdity” to argue Trump hadn’t already taken actions of war in Venezuela. “If we don’t know it’s a war until after all the people die ... wouldn’t it then be a little late?” he told reporters in advance of the vote.

Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said it was necessary for Congress to reassert its role and put a check on presidential authority that had “atrophied” under recent administrations.

Meanwhile, on social media, senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, accused Republicans of voting in favor of “forever wars, and against the best interests of the American people”.

The Trump Administration has taken action to share Medicaid data provided by states to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement purposes. This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share such information and ICE would not use such information for immigration enforcement purposes, including assurances made to the public, applicants and enrollees, health care providers, and states that information collected to determine eligibility for health coverage programs would not be used for immigration enforcement.

This issue brief provides an overview of a new data sharing agreement for CMS to share Medicaid data with ICE and its potential implications. This sharp departure in policy to allow sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE for immigration enforcement raises several key issues:

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with a current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing. Under pending litigation, CMS is prohibited from sharing certain information from the plaintiff states, including information for lawfully present individuals or citizens. If the data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present in the dataset that will be shared with ICE.

Going forward, the sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care and other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall. Even prior to the public notice of the new data sharing policy, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

The data sharing raises broader questions and concerns about data privacy and protections, which may extend beyond immigrant families. Individuals enrolled in Medicaid did so under prior assurances that information would not be shared for immigration enforcement purposes. Applying new policy retroactively to people who took actions under previous policy and safeguards may broadly increase concerns about privacy and safeguards of data. Health care providers, including community health centers and hospitals, may also have growing concerns about potentially being required to share patient information.

What Medicaid data do states report to CMS?

Medicaid is jointly administered by the federal government and states, and states must share certain information with CMS for program administration. State Medicaid agencies collect and maintain personal and health information for applicants and enrollees to determine eligibility and provide care. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other federally-funded coverage, but payments for emergency services may be made to hospitals on behalf of individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. States include information about these payments in their reports to CMS. Some states provide health coverage to some immigrants regardless of immigration status using state-only funds. However, states are not required to submit this state-only program information to CMS. States cannot require applicants to provide citizenship or immigration status for any family or household members not applying for coverage.

Under the data sharing agreement, CMS will be sharing data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System or T-MSIS with ICE, which provides robust information on Medicaid enrollees but is significantly lagged. T-MSIS data also are made available to researchers, providing insight into what data it includes. The data available to researchers are generally almost two years old (e.g., calendar year 2024 data are available in 2026) and include demographic and eligibility files with information on age, gender, race and ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, and coverage through Medicaid managed care. There are also claims files that include claims for all services covered by the states, premium payments from the states to managed care plans, and records of services used by managed care enrollees. In some cases, states provide more data to the federal government than are made available to researchers such as KFF. It is likely that CMS has access to more timely data too, but it is unknown how timely those data are and the extent to which timeliness varies across the states.

In the T-MSIS data available to researchers, there are a few types of information related to immigration status, but no indicator that allows for separate identification of immigrants who are undocumented. Specifically, T-MSIS includes the following data elements:

Immigration status, which indicates whether a person is one of the following:

“A qualified alien,” which is a specific subset of noncitizens with lawful immigration status, such as lawful permanent residents (LPRs or “green card” holders), who may be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP and certain other federal programs. Many must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll in coverage.

“Lawfully present under CHIPRA 214,” which includes lawfully residing pregnant people and children in states that have taken up the option to eliminate the five-year wait to enroll in coverage for eligible immigrants with qualified status and extend coverage to lawfully present pregnant people and/or children beyond those with a qualified status.

“Eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” which includes individuals who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. This group includes undocumented immigrants, noncitizen immigrants with a qualified status who are in the five-year waiting period for coverage, and lawfully present immigrants without a qualified status.

“A U.S. citizen or U.S. national.”

Whether or not the enrollee’s immigration status has been verified, and

The date on which the five-year waiting period for receiving Medicaid and other federally funded benefits ends.

Undocumented immigrants are included in the population that is “eligible for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” but that group also includes some groups of lawfully present immigrants, and the dataset available to researchers does not separately identify these groups within that population. Additionally, because of the data lag, immigration status may have changed for some people since the data were collected.

What actions has the Trump Administration taken to share Medicaid enrollee data?

In July 2025, CMS and ICE established an Information Exchange Agreement that enables immigration enforcement officials to access the personal data of millions of Medicaid enrollees. A news organization made the agreement public in January 2026, after it was released as part of a lawsuit several states brought against the Department of Health and Human Services and DHS. Under the agreement, CMS will provide ICE, “access to the CMS Integrated Data Repository to retrieve information concerning the identify and location of aliens in the United States.” The agreement indicates this information will allow ICE to, “receive information concerning the identity and location of aliens in the United States, such as address, telephone number, banking information (routing number, account type, account number), email address, internet protocol (IP) addresses and other information relevant to identifying and locating aliens in the United States.”

The agreement specifies that CMS will provide direct access to the T-MSIS to a select set of ICE employees for renewable two-month periods, and that ICE employees will access the T-MSIS to receive information concerning the identification and location of aliens in the U.S. It identifies Medicaid recipients’ name, address, Medicaid identification number, social security number, date of birth, sex, phone number, locality, ethnicity and race as the data elements to be shared. The agreement does not specify whether ICE access to Medicaid data is limited to a certain subset of Medicaid enrollees, such as noncitizens. As such, the agreement could provide ICE employees access to these data for all Medicaid enrollees, regardless of their immigration status. Also, the stated purpose of the access is to identify and locate aliens in the United States, not specifically those who are undocumented.

This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share and ICE would not use health coverage eligibility information for immigration enforcement purposes. Under this prior policy, ICE, CMS, and states made assurances to the public, applicants and enrollees, and health care providers that information collected to determine eligibility for and administer health coverage programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace, would not be used for immigration enforcement. CMS previously stated on its website that the information regarding individuals that it collects will only be used for administration of its programs: “To protect your privacy, we’ll tell you before we collect any personal information we need to run our health care programs and only use it for that purpose.” CMS also previously stated on its website that it will not use immigration status for immigration enforcement purposes: “We won’t use any immigration status you share with us for immigration enforcement purposes.”

A preliminary injunction temporarily halted the Trump Administration’s actions to share Medicaid enrollee data with ICE in some states. In June 2025, there were reports that the Trump administration shared the personal and health data of millions of noncitizen Medicaid enrollees living in California, Illinois, Washington, and D.C. with immigration enforcement officials. Following court challenges, a preliminary injunction temporarily blocked the data sharing in the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing in August 2025. The court found that while “there does not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement, that the data sharing was implemented without a “reasoned decision making process” and likely violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The injunction did not govern data sharing in other states that are not involved in the lawsuit.

On November 25, 2025, CMS issued anoticeoutlining its plans to begin sharing Medicaid data it receives from states with DHS and ICE once the preliminary injunction is lifted. The notice specifies that ICE, “contemplates requesting from CMS available biographical, contact, and location information, though ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting other information on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.” CMS indicates that the notice makes the public aware that it intends to disclose certain information to DHS and that it will update relevant websites to reflect its authority to share information with DHS. CMS asserts that the policy change is exempt from a notice and comment period because it is a policy statement outlining actions that are consistent with federal law. ICE also issued a policy memorandum to rescind its previous policy of not using health coverage eligibility information to pursue immigration enforcement action.

In December 2025, the court updated its ruling, allowing CMS to share a subset of information it intends to share as outlined in the CMS notice. Under the injunction, CMS may only share information with DHS and ICE that is associated with the Medicaid program (not any other health programs); pertains only to individuals who are not lawfully present in the U.S.; and is limited to citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID. It prohibits the sharing of any additional information, such as health information, or information related to lawfully present individuals or citizens and precludes sharing additional information that may be requested on a case-by-case basis. It also specifies that, “to the extent that such basic biographical, contact, or location information about unlawfully present aliens is not severable from other information that DHS and ICE are not entitled to obtain (e.g., information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, sensitive health records), HHS or CMS may not share it.” The injunction only applies in the 20 plaintiff states involved in the lawsuit, meaning the data sharing can proceed as outlined in the agreement and notice in other states.

Issues to Consider

Courts will ultimately determine the legality of the data sharing policy within the context of existing data privacy and protection laws. Beyond that determination, there are also issues to consider regarding how the data sharing policy can be operationalized in ways consistent with what the courts have allowed so far and broader implications for families, health care providers, and states.

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with the current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 states challenging the data sharing agreement. If the T-MSIS data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present. Existing T-MSIS data elements identify individuals eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services. However, any data shared with ICE using that identifier will include people who are lawfully present (those subject to the five-year waiting period and those who do not have qualified status) as well as individuals who are not lawfully present. The data may also include some individuals who may not have been lawfully present at the time their information was entered into the system, but who have since transitioned to lawfully present status. In the future, the 2025 reconciliation law’s restrictions on Medicaid eligibility for certain lawfully present immigrants (including refugees and asylees among others), which begin in October 2026, will mean that the share of lawfully present immigrants identified as eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services will increase.

Going forward, the sharing of health coverage data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care as well as other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall as well as other restrictive immigration policies, including changes in public charge policy and the recission of protections from immigration enforcement in sensitive locations such as health care facilities. Prior to the CMS notice of plans to share data, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or CBP (Figure 1). These fears may contribute to individuals delaying or avoiding medical care. About one in seven (14%) immigrant adults, including 48% who are likely undocumented and 20% who are parents, say that they or a family member have avoided seeking medical care since January 2025 due to immigration-related concerns.",https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2026/01/Potential-Implications-of-the-New-Medicaid-Data-Sharing-Agreement-Between-CMS-and-ICE_FI.png,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:29.753159

Illinois is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration, challenging everything from federal funding freezes to what the state calls aggressive and unconstitutional immigration enforcement tactics.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss how the legal efforts are going amid a tense relationship between the state and federal governments.

On the lawsuit over immigration enforcement:

Illinois and Chicago officials are suing the Trump administration over what they describe as “menacing, violent and unlawful” immigration enforcement actions.

Notable violent encounters with federal immigration agents include the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, in suburban Franklin Park in September. In October, Marimar Martinez was shot five times after following agents by car.

Minnesota filed its own, separate lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on similar grounds following the fatal shooting of poet and mother Renee Good earlier this month.

“It’s important to note that our lawsuit is not saying that immigration enforcement should not happen. Of course it should happen,” Raoul said. “There are what are called enforcement and removal officers who have traditionally done that work on the interior and they are trained to do so. It’s targeted enforcement with warrants -— with not being violative of people’s privacy — not just doing sweeps and asking everybody whether or not they are a citizen of the United States.”

On the Supremacy Clause:

There are concerns that Illinois’ lawsuit may clash with the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which maintains that federal law supersedes state law. However, both Illinois and Minnesota’s suits argue that the federal government’s aggressive tactics are trying to force the states to abandon their sanctuary policies that protect immigrant communities, and that those tactics violate the Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

The 10th Amendment states “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

“It was Justice Scalia that said in a case, U.S. v. Prince, that the federal government cannot commandeer states and state and local resources to do what is the federal government’s work,” Raoul said. “The 10th Amendment gives us our sovereignty, gives us a state’s rights. It used to be that Republicans would advocate for the protection of state rights.”

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “It really is astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law — which is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause — and then go right back to federalizing every state responsibility possible when they get back in power. Spare us.”

On sanctuary laws and the Constitution:

The legal battle intersects with Illinois’ Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Raoul said Illinois’ policies are consistent with the U.S. Constitution.

A recent report from Raoul’s office found that four Illinois sheriff’s offices complied with immigration detainers or civil immigration warrants, defying the state’s sanctuary laws.

“They’re self-reporting to us,” Raoul said. “We communicate back once they alert us that there may have been a violation as to how to avoid it happening again. These are situations where we’ve been alerted and we try to work with our law enforcement partners into making sure they’re abiding by the state law.”

On the federal government freezing funding to social safety net programs:

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary, two-week restraining order blocking the Trump administration from freezing roughly $10 billion in federal funding for child care and family services programs in Illinois, California, Colorado, Minnesota and New York. The order prevents the funding from being withheld while the case moves forward.

As justification for freezing the funds, the Trump administration cited concerns about fraud and undocumented immigrants receiving benefits and said it needed to conduct internal reviews and collect documentation.

“It’s violative of … the Administrative Procedures Act in that it’s arbitrary in how they’re doing it, but it’s also political retribution,” Raoul said. “It’s just five states. It’s a fishing expedition.”

He continued: “We have systems in place to make sure that people who are receiving these benefits are people who sorely need these benefits, truly need them and truly qualify for them. Could there be a case here or there where somebody scams the system? Absolutely. We actually partner with the federal government in investigating and sometimes prosecuting such fraud.”

On ongoing legal battles:

Illinois is currently involved in dozens of lawsuits against the federal government — a number Raoul said could grow.

“It’s looking that way, and it’s not because I’m looking for battles with the Trump administration, but it’s because our Constitution and our laws are being violated,” Raoul said.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:25.371245

A proposed policy affirms IPS will protect student confidentiality and provide access to education for all children

This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.

Indianapolis Public Schools has rescinded resolutions signaling support for undocumented students following a lawsuit from state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

Instead, a new proposed policy on student access, safety, and privacy says the district will continue to protect the confidentiality of student records and information while providing “equal access to public education” for all students who live within the district — regardless of immigration status.

The proposal comes in the wake of a November lawsuit from Rokita’s office that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement. Rokita alleged that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country with his son, an IPS student.

Attorneys for IPS have said in court that the district would adopt a new policy that would render the state’s lawsuit moot. The board is expected to vote on the policy proposal at its meeting in February, according to board president Angelia Moore.

The updates could ultimately change little in how the district serves and protects undocumented students, whose rights to education and privacy are already protected by a string of state and federal laws and a U.S. Supreme Court case. The lawsuit, however, claims the district policy violates a state law that prohibits government entities from restricting immigration enforcement.

Neither IPS nor Rokita’s office immediately responded to a request for comment. School board president Angelia Moore declined to comment on the proposed policy, citing the ongoing litigation.

New resolution maintains IPS support for all students

At a retreat on Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026, the IPS school board rescinded two prior resolutions supporting undocumented students. One was adopted early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and the other was adopted early in his second term, amid high-profile and controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

One 2017 resolution stated the district’s support for creating a safe place for all students regardless of immigration status. It directed employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

Another 2025 resolution reaffirmed this commitment to all students.

But the resolution to rescind these prior commitments still maintains that the district supports all students and employees. It also references a variety of state and federal laws to protect immigrant families, including the federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

The resolution also references the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. Legal experts say Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can only enter school grounds under certain circumstances.

And the resolution references the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe that undocumented students have a right to public education.

The proposed IPS policy states that IPS will operate within the legal framework provided by the United States Constitution, the state constitution, federal and state civil rights laws, federal education privacy laws, and Indiana statutes on public education.

The superintendent will adopt training and protocols for staff regarding student privacy and requests from outside agencies seeking information or access to students, the proposed policy states.

Rokita’s ICE lawsuit hinges on deportation flight

Rokita’s lawsuit alleges that an IPS student, the son of a Honduran national, went to school on the morning of his father’s scheduled deportation flight. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the lawsuit claims.

The district said it would not release the child to an ICE officer without a judicial warrant or court order, the lawsuit states.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as he had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” the lawsuit states.

Rokita’s lawsuit targeted several district policies, including the 2017 resolution.

His office has previously argued that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. He has also argued that school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2023/01/20/PIND/de6fa688-203b-4548-9b72-d2662b0acc23-IPSSchoolBoardMeeting_01192022_GH006.jpg?crop=7928,4460,x166,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 03:59:29.438696

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MINNESOTA’S ‘FEEDING OUR FUTURE’ FRAUD AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP’S LATEST CRACKDOWN

Somalia has drawn heightened scrutiny from federal officials following a sweeping fraud scandal centered in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered massive abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programs. Many of those involved are Somali nationals or Somali-Americans.

In November 2025, a State Department cable sent to posts around the globe instructed consular officers to enforce sweeping new screening rules under the so-called ""public charge"" provision of immigration law.

The guidance instructs consular officers to deny visas to applicants deemed likely to rely on public benefits, weighing a wide range of factors including health, age, English proficiency, finances and even potential need for long-term medical care.

Older or overweight applicants could be denied, along with those who had any past use of government cash assistance or institutionalization.

""The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,"" State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement.

""Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES MORE THAN 100,000 VISAS IN FIRST YEAR BACK

While the public charge provision has existed for decades, enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers historically given broad discretion in applying the standard.

Exceptions to the new pause will be ""very limited"" and only allowed after an applicant has cleared public charge considerations.

A 2022 version of the public charge rule under the Biden administration had limited the scope of benefits considered — primarily to cash assistance and long-term institutional care — excluding programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, Medicaid or housing vouchers.

The Immigration and Nationality Act has long permitted consular officers to deem applicants inadmissible on public charge grounds, but President Donald Trump in 2019 expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That expansion was challenged in court, with portions ultimately blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.

Philadelphia elected officials are doubling down on last week’s rhetoric against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who violate the law

District Attorney Larry Krasner joined Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal and some city council members in speaking out against the potential for mass ICE raids in the city during a news conference at Salt and Light Church in the city’s Kingsessing neighborhood.

Krasner said ICE agents who break the law in Philadelphia will be arrested.

“We will arrest you. We will put handcuffs on you. We will close those cuffs. We will put you in a cell,” he said. “We will do everything in our power to convict you and we will make sure you serve your entire sentence because Donald Trump has no power whatsoever to pardon you.”

Krasner also defended Bilal, who got national attention last week when she said she would “bring the smoke” against ICE. She doubled down on that statement today.

She said that when someone commits a crime “in the city and the DA charges you, you will be arrested and you will go to jail. That’s the smoke.”

Councilmember Rue Landau said ICE raids can have a chilling effect that will prevent those without documentation from coming forward to testify in criminal cases, especially in cases such as domestic violence where the perpetrator could go free because of a lack of eyewitness testimony.

“If folks are scared to go to court, if they are scared the second they step out of their house to even get to that court hearing, they are in jeopardy,” Landau said. “If going to the hearing and walking outside puts them in harm’s way of ICE agents who are going to jump out of unmarked cars with unmarked vests and not showing their badges, they are going to jump on them, attack them and drag them away. They’re not going to participate in the process.”

Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who is the daughter of immigrants, said her concerns with the ICE raids are not only focused on those without documentation.

President Donald Trump’s “secret police executed Renee Good, a mother, an American citizen, in broad daylight,” she said. “We see Trump’s actions for what they really are, a violent attempt to seize power and scare those who disagree with him.”

Gauthier pointed to next week’s commemoration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and urged those in attendance to implement his nonviolent method of protesting to send a message to Washington, D.C.

“What he would want from our city, I think we all know that he was calling us to fiercely fight for our immigrant neighbors, not remain silent in the face of injustice,” she said.

It’s the second week in a row that a group of Philadelphia’s elected leaders gathered to decry activities related to federal immigration agents.

Last Thursday, Bilal drew national headlines for her criticism of ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis. Bilal denounced ICE agents for wearing masks and called them “fake law enforcement.”

Krasner dismissed the argument that the ICE officer fired his weapon in self-defense and repeated his pledge to prosecute any federal officers who commit crimes in Philadelphia. “We will charge any ICE agent who tries this nonsense here,” Krasner said last week.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel put out a statement Friday saying the police department was flooded with calls from around the country in response to those comments. Bethel’s statement clarified that Bilal’s office is a separate entity from the police department and does not police the city or conduct criminal investigations.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/larry-krasner-kp-011426-02.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:26.436062

Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week.
Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training.","Since last Wednesday, both the general populace and policymakers have debated whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officer Jonathan Ross, who allegedly shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, properly applied the Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy. In the aftermath of the shooting, protests broke out not just in Minneapolis, where it occurred, but throughout the nation; those marching aver overly aggressive law enforcement officers outright murdered Good. Conversely, Vice President J.D. Vance alleged that Good was “part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to dox, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job” and that she used the techniques of domestic terrorism to target federal officials; Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem vowed to send hundreds more of her employees to Minnesota to support her department’s ongoing operations there in the face of local resistance. Little agreement exists between the political poles on how to describe that fatal moment.

Whether Ross violated Homeland Security’s deadly force policies—and thus also potentially Good’s Fourth Amendment rights—is certainly one of the most important questions to arise out of her death. But amid the high passion and tumult of the debate, other, equally pressing issues remain largely unaddressed: Namely, what do the events which occurred immediately before Ross took the slack out of his trigger, and the response of him and his colleagues right after the final press, tell us about how ICE is conducting itself as it executes the largest apprehension and deportation operation in the history of the United States?

The answers are not comforting; they will provide little balm to anyone concerned with civil liberties, the lives of civilians, or the application of safe and proven law enforcement techniques (by which I mean ones that protect officers themselves from both adversarial danger and legal liability). Based on what has been publicly released, the whole interaction between Good, Ross, and the other ICE officials was a series of unforced errors by the government. The entire encounter, even accounting for Ross’s own footage, illustrates the general lack of professionalism with which ICE has operated over the past few months and its abandonment of its own internal policies.

This article will not wade into the debate over whether deadly force was justified at the exact moment Ross fired into the vehicle (that debate will largely focus on a narrow legal question—did he have a reasonable belief that Good would use her car as a weapon to hit him—in a manner that will frustrate many observers, and should rely on a much larger tranche of evidence than many observers realize). Because even if Ross’s deadly force was justified in the moment he fired his weapon, what much of the nation has now seen was not professionalized or situationally appropriate law enforcement. It was a series of incredibly bad choices leading to an unnecessary death. At every step which led to the fatal trigger press, ICE could have behaved differently. It could have behaved more tactically. It could have behaved more humanely. The nation—to say nothing of Renee Nicole Good’s family—deserves an honest accounting of why it did not.

* * *

Why was ICE interacting with Good in the first place?

The question isn’t rhetorical. Video footage shows that she was clearly—at least for a few moments, if not longer—blocking traffic by positioning her car in the middle of the road; furthermore, she was doing so while in the presence of law enforcement vehicles with lights and sirens activated. Such behavior would appear to be a prima facie violation of Minnesota Statute 169.20 §5, a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine, and perhaps diversion to a remedial driving school. If a peace officer with the appropriate authority ordered her to move, and she chose not to comply, she also may have been violating Minnesota Statute 169.34 §1(11).

But much of the analysis actually hinges on the phrase “peace officer.” Not all law enforcement agencies are authorized to enforce all statutes; generally speaking, state and local departments enforce state and local laws, while federal officers and agents enforce federal laws and constitutional violations. States can provide exceptions to this general rule by enacting an enabling law granting federal officials the authority to enforce state laws, which confers peace officer status.

Minnesota defines a peace officer as “an employee of a political subdivision [i.e. a local municipality] or state law enforcement agency,” and only grants their federal counterparts arrest authorities for the purposes of state and local violations when a number of conditions are met. The most important of these prerequisites requires that the federal officer be on duty, acting at the request of a local or state officer, and operating pursuant to the supervision of that local or state officer. At this point, neither ICE management nor any executive branch officials have argued that these conditions were met; indeed, the tenor and tone of statements by the Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor would certainly suggest otherwise. The proper remedy, then, for Good’s obstruction of traffic would have simply been for the ICE officers to request that local police join in the response and facilitate the movement of her vehicle.

But let’s put this argument aside, for the moment.

Even if ICE had no authority to enforce state traffic regulations, it may argue that Good was violating 18 U.S.C. §111, which prohibits “assaulting, resisting, or impeding” federal law enforcement officials. But as the Justice Department itself maintains, that statute requires an element of force on the part of the offender, and also requires that the officer be engaged in the performance of official duties. With respect to the first part, it is difficult to see, in any of the videos released thus far, any moment at which Good deployed force against the officers. What she and others appear to have been doing is videotaping them, verbally sparring with them, and perhaps blowing whistles. But every federal appellate court which has addressed the issue recognizes a First Amendment right to film the police, regardless of whether one is a bystander or the actual criminal subject; ICE’s behavior with regard to this sort of activity in other jurisdictions, which is becoming increasingly frequent, clearly violates the Constitution. Even Ross’s own footage does not appear to demonstrate any behavior by Good at the outset of the interaction which violates a federal criminal law or would not be shielded by First Amendment protections.

But let’s put this argument aside for the moment as well.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, and the question still remains whether they acted in a manner that comports with their own internal policies. The agency’s Employee Code of Conduct §5.4 mandates that “ICE employees must be professional, polite, respectful, and patient in all official activities that involve contact with…members of the public, even in the face of considerable provocation.” It is difficult to understand how yelling at a woman to “get out of the fucking car” when she is not acting violent, or calling her a “fucking bitch,” after shooting at her three times, would comport with this rule. ICE’s own disciplinary guidance mandates suspensions for “using rude, impolite, discourteous, unprofessional, obscene…or similarly inappropriate language, gestures, or conduct…to members of the public.” Making improper comments during operations is similarly prohibited and punishable under the guidance. It might be a small violation, not particularly important for the larger issues at play here, but it is a data point, nonetheless.

But let’s put aside this argument, too, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law and operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines. The question still remains whether they appropriately de-escalated the situation before resorting to force. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons himself recently noted, in an Associated Press feature, that “[i]n any type of law enforcement situation you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.” The agency’s head firearms instructor promised that “[w]e do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that [dangerous] environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision. Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot…” But none of the footage thus far released, by bystanders or the agency, reveals any moment in which any of the officers tried to defuse the situation without violence. Ross spent an inordinate amount of time videotaping his interaction with Good on his cellphone, and at no point in his own recording does he attempt to calm the situation or even betray any sense of his own self-possession. The officers who come to assist him do not interact with Good at all, except to run towards her vehicle while shouting “Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car,” before trying to forcibly open her door.

But let’s also put this argument aside, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, and had attempted to de-escalate the situation. The question still remains whether they needed to immediately approach Good’s vehicle. Other standard law enforcement techniques exist to remove someone from an automobile that will less likely lead to a violent outcome, and are actually safer for the involved officers. The intersection near which Good was parked—East 34th Street and Portland Avenue—lay on a standard city grid. A plethora of law enforcement vehicles were in the immediate vicinity, some of which could have redeployed in less than a minute to block Good’s means of egress. ICE could have established a “surround and call out,” wherein they isolated and contained Good, stayed themselves in a position of safe cover, and, if necessary and justified, had drawn and aimed their weapons as a prophylactic measure. After establishing a perimeter, they could have utilized their vehicles’ microphones and loudspeakers to issue instructions for Good to exit her vehicle in a manner that ensured everyone’s safety.

To be clear, while this would not be a common technique to use for someone who was not the identified subject of a warrant or acting violent, it was an available option if ICE seriously thought removing Good from her car, for some reason, was absolutely necessary.

But let’s put this argument aside as well, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, had attempted to de-escalate the situation, and that a surround and call out had not successfully extricated Good from her vehicle. The question still remains whether ICE approached her automobile in a tactically sound manner. Video footage indicates that the first movement occurs when Ross maneuvers himself from the side of Good’s vehicle to its front, all the while videotaping his actions with his cellphone in what appears to be his dominant hand (he switches the device to his other side when it comes time for him to draw his weapon). This change in position defies both standard practice and common sense: As the former chief of the FBI’s Tactical Training Unit noted to The New York Times, “Obviously just from a safety standpoint, officers are taught to approach vehicles from angles that would not put themselves squarely in the traffic path if at all possible.” If Ross thought himself in danger, it also defies explanation why he occupied his best hand with his phone, solely to capture video footage.

The other officers, who quickly join Ross, similarly eschew standard law enforcement techniques. Generally speaking, most agencies train personnel to approach a vehicle deliberately when there is an unknown risk combined with no imminent threat; all the officers here sprinted toward Good’s automobile. A car contains a number of potentially dangerous areas that officers need to observe before any substantive interactions with the occupants: the trunk or rear cabin; the back passenger side, which gives a view as to whether anyone is ensconced in the back seat or on the floor of the vehicle; and, the front driver’s side, which allows the approaching officer to see who is sitting in the front of the car while simultaneously keeping an eye on the hands of the driver. Officers generally should approach these positions cautiously and with enough distance to look through the windows before making any further tactical decisions. (Although I’m referring to deliberate movement and observations, these words do not mean that the personnel should move tentatively or without alacrity, but simply that their actions should rely more on forethought and training than adrenaline and emotion.) In this case, the officers other than Ross both proceed immediately to the driver’s door. Only one maintains a distance and position that would not entangle him with the vehicle should it begin moving.

At this point, we have run out of arguments which we can momentarily cabin. As videos of the incident show, as Renee Nicole Good turns her steering wheel to the right and begins to drive away, three shots ring out, her vehicle careens into a parked car and light post, and the assembled bystanders scream.

* * *

The crack of the shots dissipates into the air, the car sits crumpled and smoking, and then something does not happen. None of the ICE officers appear to be in any hurry to go render aid to Good; they do not approach the crash site tactically, nor do they rush towards it. The only reaction any of the officers seem to have is when Ross appears to exclaim that Good was a “fucking bitch.” ICE personnel actually prevented civilian medics on the scene from rendering any aid.

The withholding of aid alone could have serious consequences for the involved officers if they ever find themselves facing a color of law civil rights investigation, as it speaks to a deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition as prohibited by the relevant statute. The notion that law enforcement personnel would rush to provide medical assistance to someone they have just shot seems counterintuitive to those who have never worn a badge, but in the years following the death of George Floyd, the federal government overhauled its guidelines to mandate this very behavior. The Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy specifically requires the following:

As soon as practicable following a use of force and the end of any perceived public safety threat, DHS LEOs shall obtain appropriate medical assistance for any subject who has visible or apparent injuries, complains of being injured, or requests medical attention. This may include rendering first aid if properly trained and equipped to do so, requesting emergency medical services, and/or arranging transportation to an appropriate medical facility.

Federal law enforcement officers and agents generally receive fairly extensive medical training throughout their careers, particularly with respect to gunshot wounds; a standard part of their issued tactical gear, carried on their ballistic vests, is the basic equipment necessary to staunch the attendant bleeding, such as tourniquets, Israeli bandages, and occlusive dressings. Many personnel—certainly those certified as tactical medics—can perform a field tracheotomy and, if needed, intubate someone with an endotracheal tube. Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week. Officers refine their training throughout their careers, and most have a refresher of the basics during the active shooter training which are now a regular part of the job[1] [2] . It is possible that not a single ICE officer on the scene ever received any of this instruction, or that none of them had any medical equipment on hand. But it is also unlikely.

Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training. But perhaps, then, their leaders should reconsider whether the agency is best suited to be the tip of the spear in operations to apprehend “the worst of the worst.”

After a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renée Good in Minneapolis last Wednesday, Trump administration officials were quick to come out in the agent’s defense.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Jonathan Ross—a veteran officer with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm who has been identified by multiple media reports as the shooter—followed his training and the agency’s protocol. Vice President JD Vance claimed Ross had reason to fear for his life and acted in self-defense. And press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to Good as a “deranged lunatic woman” who tried to run over the office with her vehicle as a weapon. Officials repeatedly accused Good of perpetrating “domestic terrorism.”

The narrative put forward by the administration is largely disproved by available video evidence. And it has even been received with skepticism by some former ICE employees, who are condemning Ross’ use of force against the 37-year-old mother of three and warning that their one-time agency has lost its way.

Former ICE chief of staff Jason Hauser recently wrote in USA Today: “When enforcement is driven by messaging instead of mission, when optics outweigh judgment and when leadership substitutes spectacle for strategy, the risk to officers, civilian and public safety increases exponentially.”

The second Trump presidency has taken ICE off the leash. The agency is now the highest-funded law enforcement body in the United States, with a budget that eclipses that of some countries’ militaries. With its near-unlimited resources and aggressive directions from the White House, ICE is sending federal immigration agents not trained in community policing to make at-large arrests in cities across the country. (Days after the shooting, Noem announced DHS would deploy hundreds more agents to Minneapolis.)

Two ex-ICE workers I spoke with described an agency that, in pursuit of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mandate, is engaging in reckless and risky behavior.

“They’re essentially operating now in a resource constraint-free environment and doing very dangerous things,” said Scott Shuchart, who previously worked at the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within DHS and more recently as ICE’s assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy under the Biden administration. Violent interactions with the public aren’t surprising, he added. “That’s sort of by design.”

Dan Gividen, an immigration lawyer who acted as deputy chief counsel for ICE’s Dallas field office between 2016 and 2019, compared what the agency is doing as akin to running into a crowded movie theater and yelling “fire.” “You’ve got these ICE officers that are pouring out of these vehicles, pointing guns at US citizens—people who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong—and causing chaos.”

ICE removal agents charged with doing administrative arrests, he said, lack the tactical training to safely do operations out in communities. “It’s not at all surprising that this is happening with these ICE ERO officers being sent out to basically treat people terribly,” he said, anticipating more escalation of violence.

Another former ICE trial attorney I spoke with said that, typically, removal officers weren’t trained in high-risk operations because the daily demands of the job didn’t require it. In the past, if such an encounter took place, local law enforcement might have gotten involved to help keep the situation under control. “What has changed is there has been an encouragement from the top to be much more aggressive in enforcement and ramp things up and get the job done,” the ex-counsel for the agency told me.

In Gividen’s view, the federal immigration agents didn’t have a reason to interact with Good to begin with. “He had no reason to believe she had committed any offense that he actually has the authority to investigate,” Gividen said of Ross. “They murdered her, plain and simple. That is all there is to it. The notion that they were in any way, shape, or form acting in self-defense to put three bullets in that woman is absolutely absurd.”

An ICE’s use of force and firearms policy directive from 2023 states that authorized officers should only use force when “no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” is available. It also mandates that the level of force be “objectively reasonable” given the circumstances and instructs officers to “de-escalate” the situation. The guidelines further state that an agent who uses deadly force should be placed on administrative leave for three consecutive days. (ICE didn’t respond to questions from Mother Jones about its policies and whether Ross had been put on leave.)

“The question isn’t: Was he in any danger?” Shuchart said. “The question is: Was the use of force the only thing he could do to address the danger? And was the use of immediate deadly force the appropriate level of force?”

One of the videos shows that Ross appeared to move out of the way to avoid possible contact with the car. “I don’t understand how you get from there to the idea that deadly stop and force against the driver was necessary to protect the officer from serious bodily harm,” added Shuchart, who until January 2025 was part of a team that handles ICE-wide policy and regulations.

A DHS-wide 2023 policy on use of force generally prohibits deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject” and the discharging of firearms to “disable moving vehicles.” But a recent Wall Street Journal investigation identified at least 13 instances since July where immigration agents fired at or into civilian cars, shooting eight people—including five US citizens—and leaving two dead.

Instead of de-escalating, Shuchart said, Ross only “exacerbated the danger.” Shuchart pointed to a number of errors Ross made that could have been avoided, starting with his decision to step in front of the car. “This officer was not just freshly coming across the scene when a vehicle lurches at him,” he said. “[He] had already violated policy creating a danger to himself by crossing in front of the vehicle that wasn’t in park. You have to assess what was reasonable in those circumstances from the fact that he had created the potential danger to himself.”

Prior to joining ERO, Ross did a stint with the Indiana National Guard in Iraq and worked as a field intelligence agent for the Border Patrol. His job as an ICE deportation officer in the Twin Cities area involved arresting “higher-value targets,” according to his own testimony from court records obtained by Wired, related to an accident last June when Ross was dragged by a car during an arrest.

“As a matter of what someone in law enforcement anywhere would be trained to do, and what someone would be trained to do under DHS policy, what he was doing was nuts,” Shuchart said of Ross’ actions last week. “He was so completely out of line with respect to what would have been safe for him and the other people on that operation. It was not at all how any kind of operation should go.”

According to Shuchart, the agents at the scene also failed to follow protocol in the aftermath of the shooting by appearing to not immediately render medical assistance or confirm that, if the target was in fact a threat, they no longer presented danger.

Speaking to the New York Times, Trump appeared to try to justify Good’s killing by saying she had been “very, very disrespectful” to law enforcement.

“The fact that their feelings are hurt by US citizens disapproving of what they do loudly is completely irrelevant,” Shuchart said. “The point of the job is not to have your feelings well-cared for by the public.”

Under pressure to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 daily arrests, ICE has been on a hiring spree. The agency is offering candidates signing bonuses and plans a $100 million “wartime recruitment” effort that includes geo-targeted ads and influencers targeting gun rights supporters and UFC fights attendees to bring in as many as 10,000 new hires. Earlier this month, DHS publicized the addition of 12,000 officers and agents—from a pool of 220,000 “patriotic” applicants who responded to the government’s “Defend the Homeland” calls—more than doubling ICE’s workforce.

So far, the result of that expansion drive has been less than optimal, with recruits failing fitness tests and not undergoing proper vetting. Experts have also raised concerns about the lowering of standards and reduced training times for new hires as the administration pushes to get more agents in the streets and rack up arrest numbers quickly.

“I would be skeptical of anyone who would take a job with an agency that is willing to defend behavior this unprofessional,” Shuchart said. “There are thousands of law enforcement agencies in this country. If you’re a decent recruit, go work for one of the others that has more reasonable standards and expectations.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260113_trump-ice-design_2000_v2b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:08.333630

In a follow up email ahead of publication, APD spokesperson Anna Sabana said, “Chief Davis said the rule change comes after city legal advised her that current general orders should address administrative warrants and ensure mandates of [Senate Bill 4] are adhered to.”

The move comes after immigration advocates and legal experts raised questions about APD’s decision to turn over a Honduran mother and her young daughter to ICE earlier this month.

APD officers called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after encountering the woman during a disturbance call. In a statement, Davis initially said APD was required to notify ICE because the woman had an ICE “administrative warrant.” In fact, Austin police officers have reported dozens of people with similar warrants to ICE since President Donald Trump started his second term, city records show.

Legal experts questioned whether this cooperation was required, noting the department’s policy only required contact with ICE for people who federal authorities have formally requested they detain.

But Davis said the department’s policy has been out of step with state law and needs updating. She said local police will now be able to freely contact ICE and may even ask for the immigration status of people they encounter, a notable departure from current policy that has discouraged prioritizing immigration enforcement.

“I have no doubt that officers have been confused on this,” she said. Adding that the new general order “is going to help with that confusion.”

Late Wednesday, multiple members of the Austin City Council said they do not anticipate more cooperation between APD and ICE under the new department policy. .

Councilmember José “Chito” Vela said his understanding was that individual APD officers will not be freely calling ICE because they would need to run their decisions by a commanding officer. He hopes that under the new policy, which he pointed out has not been finalized, notifications to ICE would only happen rarely, as when the person involved also was guilty of certain violent criminal offenses.

“We have to be very careful in our decisions when to call ICE about the administrative warrants.” he said “Because of [state law], we cannot adopt a blanket policy of ‘we can’t call ICE,’ so we have to be very judicious about the policy that we do adopt and make sure it’s an exceptional circumstance.”

The City of Austin did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Newsroom, but Vela provided a memo dated January 14 from the city’s legal team that he anticipates will shape the final policy.

He said he expects the new APD policy to be finalized soon.

While ICE actions in Austin have remained relatively low profile, the move comes as immigration enforcement has become a part of daily life in some US cities, prompting nationwide protests.

APD reported dozens of people to ICE

APD’s current policy, General Order 318.3.4, only explicitly mandates officers alert ICE when a so-called “ICE detainer” or request to hold a person is issued.

A detainer is a formal request from federal authorities to hold someone in police custody for a suspected immigration violation. Administrative warrants, by contrast, are routinely issued by federal agents to flag someone who may have violated civil immigration law.

Administrative warrants and detainers “are different things in federal immigration law,” Elissa Steglich, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Texas Newsroom. She said as far as she can tell, “there is room for Austin to not notify ICE” regarding warrants.

But lawyers working for the city disagreed, according to Davis.

She said they advised her recently that APD cannot stop officers from contacting ICE when they uncover administrative warrants under state laws. Those laws require local police to cooperate with federal law enforcement and allow local officers to detain people they suspect of being undocumented. Some of these provisions are being challenged in court.

“Senate Bill 4 does not allow us to tell officers they cannot call ICE on these things,” Davis told The Texas Newsroom.

Davis said she was unaware that department policy needed to be updated until after the incident with the Honduran mother and her child this month. Advocates with Grassroots Leadership said the pair was deported, despite them saying the daughter is a U.S. citizen, after APD reported them to ICE.

The Texas Newsroom was unable to independently confirm this information.

Davis said ICE notified APD of the uptick in administrative warrants in early 2025, when immigration authorities flooded a federal police database with 14,000 warrants under the second Trump administration.

Some officers began reporting people with these warrants to ICE but APD policy was never updated to reflect their ability to do so, Davis added.

Since January 2025, Austin officers have reported people with administrative warrants to ICE dozens of times. The City of Austin requires APD to file quarterly reports detailing police interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over someone’s immigration status. An analysis of these reports shows that APD contacted ICE 33 times from January through September of last year.

Data for the fourth quarter of last year has yet to be released.

Some of the people reported to ICE were reaching out to police for help. In one instance, a man contacted EMS “to speak with a doctor about his mental health.” EMS contacted APD, which found that the person was the subject of what the report calls an “ICE warrant.”

“Officers contacted ICE,” the report described, “but no federal officials were available.”

In this case, EMS voluntarily took the caller to the hospital. It’s unclear whether immigration agents contacted that person after he was discharged.

In total, around 13 of the individuals who were determined to have ICE warrants were not taken into custody.

In eight instances, the people were booked into the Travis County jail, from which ICE routinely takes people into its custody. Four times, ICE arrived at the scene of an APD investigation to immediately take people into custody.

Davis said she was unaware local police were present during ICE apprehensions until this month.

The city reports also documented the race/ethnicity of the people reported to ICE: 26 were listed as Hispanic, eight as White and one as Middle Eastern. The reporting did not indicate if any of those people listed as White also identify as another ethnicity as well.

Advocates say that administrative warrants are commonly applied even to immigrants pursuing legal asylum claims. They worry that migrants who may have been flagged with a warrant without being aware may misunderstand their risk of deportation when interacting with local police.

“They may not be aware that [in] calling the police, or coming into contact with police, their information may be run and they will then have ICE called on them,” Sabina Hinz-Foley Trejo, an organizer with the group Grassroots Leadership, told The Texas Newsroom.

How APD policy on ICE will change

Davis said that she does not believe the new policy will contradict earlier statements she made that it is not APD’S job to enforce civil warrants.

Last year, she told The Texas Newsroom that officers lose community trust and their ability to fight crime when they become immigration enforcers. She said at the time, “We do not ask about immigration status here in Austin.”

She said the new general orders will specify a chain of communication that officers must observe when they decide to notify ICE that they have found someone with an administrative warrant. Under her proposal, officers will first notify a duty commander that they intend to contact immigration authorities.

“The officer may want to call ICE and may opt to do that [...] the decision to remain on scene will be with the commander,” Davis said. “The decision to wait would be on a commander.”

She said some details of the new policy are still awaiting input from city legal staff. But the city and police department may be releasing more information about the changes by the end of the week, according to an APD spokesperson.

The Texas Newsroom asked if the changes to policy mean Chief Davis may stop telling the public that APD officers do not ask about people’s immigration status. She replied, “you know what? I don't know how to answer that.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90995d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4583x2406+0+324/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fd9%2Fea1fd16e4c32bbc8e24dfa6fc36d%2Faustin-police-department-49585644311-o.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:12.169662

The lawmakers called it “unconscionable” that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider building another migrant jail in New Jersey, even after an uprising and a detainee’s death at Delaney Hall, the Newark facility that opened last year. They urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to “immediately cease” any plans for a jail in Roxbury.

Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

“Immigration detention facilities in New Jersey have become notorious for inefficiency and waste in addition to humanitarian failure. These failures have inflicted trauma both on detained individuals and on surrounding families, communities and local governments who have been forced to grapple with the ongoing harms associated with immigrant detention,” they wrote in the three-page letter.

According to the Washington Post, internal ICE documents show the Trump administration is seeking contractors to turn industrial warehouses into jails to hold thousands of immigrant detainees. Roxbury is among two dozen locations across the country where officials are mulling warehouse jails.

“The proposal would subject thousands of people, the majority of whom pose no threat to public safety, to confinement under cruel and inhumane conditions. Warehouses are designed for storage and shipping, not for safely housing people,” the lawmakers’ letter reads.

They stressed that ICE detention facilities “already have a poor track record.” Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, making it one of the deadliest years in the agency’s history, according to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that track in-custody deaths.

The Democrats noted in their letter that prior to Delaney Hall’s opening, they warned of the dangers of expanding immigrant detention and urged officials to reverse those plans. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered into a 15-year contract with prison company Geo Group to operate the 1,000-bed facility anyway, and the facility opened last spring.

Since then, Delaney Hall has been at the center of numerous controversies. Newark city officials alleged Geo Group opened it without securing the proper permits, prompting a lawsuit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there May 9 — he was charged with trespassing, and prosecutors quickly dismissed the case — and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) was charged with assault in connection with the melee that occurred when agents moved to detain Baraka. In June, four detainees escaped after knocking down a shoddy wall, and in December, a detainee died less than a day after arriving at the jail.

The letter from Democrats comes on the heels of Roxbury’s all-GOP council unanimously passing an ordinance that says the town is “not an appropriate municipality” for a detainee processing facility. The ordinance says township officials have not been approached or solicited by the federal government about opening the facility there.

Currently, New Jersey is home to two detention centers, Delaney Hall and Elizabeth Detention Center.

Hearing: Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program – A Trojan Horse with Flawed Vetting and Deadly Consequences

Date: January 14, 2026

Submitted by: Refugees International, Afghan American Foundation

Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee:

Between 1996 and 2001, Afghanistan was governed by the Taliban, then an unrecognized but highly centralized regime that imposed an extreme social order, ruling primarily through clerics and armed militias rather than civilian institutions. Under heavy international sanctions and with virtually no technocratic bureaucracy, the Taliban remained diplomatically isolated and incapable of delivering economic recovery nor a viable future for the Afghan people. Girls’ education was largely banned nationwide, women were barred from most work and severely restricted in their movement, and public life was stripped of music, television, and most sports. Punishments were carried out publicly and included beatings, amputations, and executions. At the same time, humanitarian conditions were catastrophic – millions faced chronic hunger amid drought and economic collapse, with widespread shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, and medicine. Regrettably, many of these conditions have resurfaced following the United States withdrawal in 2021.

For two decades, the United States pursued a political and development mission in Afghanistan at enormous cost in American lives and resources. Alongside combat operations, sustained investments in education, healthcare, and human rights produced measurable gains across the country. Afghanistan’s education system expanded dramatically, moving from a period in which girls’ public schooling had been effectively shut down to one in which, by 2020, roughly nine million students were enrolled—up to three and a half million of them girls. Literacy rates among children, including girls, rose substantially over the same period. Health outcomes also improved. The expansion of clinics and the training and deployment of female health workers enabled millions of women and girls to access essential care for the first time. Life expectancy increased, while infant mortality fell by nearly half. These development gains were closely intertwined with advances in human rights and public participation. Millions of Afghans—many of them women—entered civic and public life as teachers, doctors, journalists, civil society leaders, and elected officials. Independent media and civil society organizations expanded, and space opened, however imperfectly, for public debate, political participation, and accountability.

Many of these gains would not have been possible without the close partnership between American forces and Afghan allies, some of whom came to the United States and became valuable community members. For two decades, Afghans stood with the U.S. mission in the belief that it offered a path away from repression and extremism. Afghans supported and sacrificed alongside American service members and civilians so that their children could return to school, their wives and daughters could become doctors, engineers, journalists, and public servants, and their country could begin building institutions capable of sustaining a more just and stable democratic future. That shared project created not only progress in Afghanistan, but trust, personal relationships, and migration pathways to the United States for certain Afghans. Congress established the Special Immigrant Visa program in 2009 to provide a viable pathway to safety in the United States for Afghans who supported the U.S. mission, were subject to extensive vetting, and faced serious threats as a result of their service. Afghans who arrived in the United States in the 2010s, as SIVs or who sought asylum in fear of return to Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban, have become integrated members of our communities, establishing businesses, raising U.S. born-children, working as professionals and continuing to support the U.S. mission of advancing human rights in Afghanistan.

Following the United States withdrawal, interpreters, women leaders, journalists, and partners of U.S. organizations in Afghanistan were placed at acute risk of reprisal by the Taliban. Indeed, following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, the remaining hope for many Afghan allies was the promise, explicit and implicit, that the U.S. would stand by those who stood with it. The U.S. prioritized evacuation and resettlement through the US Refugee Admissions Program of these individuals who met specific eligibility requirements and passed security and medical screenings. Afghans were also evacuated to U.S. military bases and paroled into the United States through Operation Allies Welcome. Although different policy choices could have been made regarding the operational execution and processing of Afghans on overseas bases and in the United States, the screening and vetting procedures were rigorous to protect our national security.

At the outset of Operations Allies Welcome, community-based organizations– such as two in Virginia, one founded by veterans, volunteers, and neighbors called NovaRaft and another founded by Afghan-Americans whose families had arrived as refugees in the 1980s and 1990s called Fresh Start Refugee Assistance–stepped in to resettle newly arrived Afghans. They secured apartments, enrolled children in school, provided English and IT classes, helped obtain drivers licenses, and connected people with jobs. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, Jason Malloy, a U.S. military veteran who had worked closely with Afghan interpreters, began volunteering with the Afghan-American community in Omaha. He helped newly paroled Afghan evacuees with airport pickups, transportation to medical and DMV appointments, and school enrollment for their children. He remains in touch with many of the families he supported and describes them as among the hardest-working and most grateful people he has known. For him, and for the many thousands of our veterans, supporting Afghan allies is not an act of charity, but a continuation of service and a fulfillment of the United States’ moral obligation to those who stood with it.

Even so, tens of thousands of Afghan allies were left behind, either hiding across Afghanistan or stranded in precarious conditions in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan. Many Afghans fled in hopes of accessing parole, refugee or SIV pathways, but have since faced mistreatment, detention, and/or forcible return to the Taliban. The Trump administration has not only cut off access to refugee resettlement in the United States for Afghans abroad at risk of return to persecution, it has also stopped processing asylum applications by Afghans in the United States, begun detaining Afghan asylum seekers for deportation, and called for re-examination of resettled Afghan refugees. This betrays not only Afghan allies, but also the many Americans who generously welcomed them to communities across the country.

There are several stories of our Afghan allies now at risk, including from those below, using pseudonyms to protect their identity.

Hajera worked on a USAID-supported medical project that provided life-saving care to pregnant Afghan women. Massoud worked as an interpreter with U.S. military training programs for the Afghan National Army. Massoud, Hajera, and their three children were unable to board U.S. evacuation flights in August 2021. They remained in hiding in Kabul for several months and then moved to Mazar-e-Sharif, hoping it would be safer. They repeatedly sought evacuation options, but months passed without a viable pathway. Without any other option, they traveled first to Brazil, then to Mexico, and entered the United States through the CBP One process. They are now in the U.S. with a pending asylum case. Under the new policies, their case has been suspended.

Fatima was a police officer in Afghanistan. She escaped the Taliban with her elderly mother and sister. They made their way through the Darien Gap and eventually to Mexico, where for most of 2024 they waited for a CBP One appointment, first in Mexico City, and then, after being bussed southward by Mexican immigration authorities, in Villahermosa. Once they received their appointment, they flew to Tijuana, were screened and paroled for two years by CBP officers at the port of San Ysidro, joined their friends and relatives in Sacramento, and applied for asylum. Like all others who arrived via CBP One appointments, they received a notice sent en masse terminating their parole regardless of the specifics of their individual cases. Their immigration court hearing, which had been scheduled for a date in June, disappeared and has been listed as “pending” in the immigration court system ever since. Fatima wrote to Refugees International asking whether they would be detained when they go to their regular check-in with ICE.

These are just a few of the tens of thousands of Afghan allies who took extraordinary risks to support U.S. objectives and help rebuild their country. Fatima and Hajera are now at risk of being deported back to Afghanistan. This is unconscionable. It would return two women who supported U.S. objectives to a country where the state enforces gender apartheid through a tightening national system of bans and restrictions designed to remove women and girls from public life—blocking education, employment, movement without a male guardian, and participation in public spaces and civil society. For humanitarian actors, the result is an operating environment where women’s visibility and agency are treated as violations, and where the impact of donor withdrawal is magnified by deliberate repression. Across the country, the Trump administration is also arbitrarily detaining law-abiding Afghans who arrived in the United States more than a decade ago and have active asylum cases. These are parents, elderly, business owners, and community members, who are now deeply rooted in their neighborhoods, paid taxes, and call America home. These actions do not make our country safer. They are tearing families apart and punishing our Afghan allies using pretext that has no relationship to their cases nor respects their longstanding contributions.",https://d3jwam0i5codb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RI_Social_Share.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:58:04.371362

The State Department, which oversees visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, said it would indefinitely pause the issuance of immigrant visas requested by citizens of 75 countries, halting legal immigration channels for roughly 38% of all nations in the world.

Officials said the pause would apply to immigrant visas, meaning those requested by people abroad who have been sponsored by American relatives or employers to move to the U.S. permanently. The suspension, officials said, does not affect temporary visas requested by would-be tourists and travelers seeking to come to the U.S. on a short-term basis.

The State Department said the 75 countries were chosen as part of an effort to bar the entry of immigrants who were likely to rely on public assistance once in the U.S. Officials said they would examine immigration procedures during the pause to better identify and bar would-be immigrants from those countries who were likely to become a ""public charge"" — or an economic burden — on the U.S.

""The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,"" the department said Wednesday. ""The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.""

The State Department did not formally publish a full list of the 75 affected nations, but said Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea are among them.

Longstanding federal law bars immigrants from coming to the U.S. or getting lawful permanent residency if they are deemed to become a public charge. Historically, the restriction has been applied in limited cases, such as when immigrants would require long-term institutionalized care in the U.S.

But dating back to President Trump's first administration, his aides have sought to dramatically expand who can be considered ineligible to immigrate to the U.S. on public charge grounds.

Surprising, I know. Why?

Obama was the last Democrat who, despite my disagreements with many of his ideas and policies − especially Obamacare, which I view as a failure − often made sense, particularly on immigration. In two terms, Barack ""Deporter-In-Chief"" Obama deported over 3.1 million immigrants via ICE. In fiscal year 2012, over 407,000 people were removed. He was even publicly scolded for doing home raids and told to stop.

Though this was a bit controversial, Democrats didn't seem to mind much. Republicans did criticize Obama for favoring amnesty, but these actions were necessary to maintain law, order, and our social contract.

This is different from what the Democratic Party espouses today. Rather than looking at the meltdown in Minnesota as an example to avoid, the Democratic Party seems to be doing the opposite. Progressive Democrats in both chambers are urging their party to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless it includes restrictions tied to ICE. Some prominent Democrats are even calling to abolish ICE after last week's deadly event.

This would be a huge mistake, but one that I'd suggest Democrats go ahead and make, especially if it's truly reflective of their values and beliefs. This way, Americans can truly see that they have become a party purposely defying the very social contract that keeps America's fabric stitched together. It will cost Democrats.

National spotlight is on the mess in Minnesota

My home state of Minnesota remains in the national spotlight after a flurry of events involving ICE, residents, and Minnesota lawmakers. On Jan. 14, a judge allowed ICE operations in Minnesota to continue despite the fact that state officials are suing the Trump administration over his immigration crackdown, something they say is an authoritarian reach of power by President Donald Trump.

Several prosecutors in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were resigning after they learned that the DOJ would not be opening an investigation into what happened during the shooting that led to Renee Nicole Good's death. For what it's worth, I think this is a mistake, not just for optics' sake but clarity.

Good's death sparked controversy and outrage over ICE's role in Minnesota and immigration issues at large. The mess in Minnesota has also demonstrated, probably, the single biggest difference between Republicans and Democrats right now.

Democrats want to upend our social contract

Minnesota's Democratic lawmakers, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who are outraged over ICE's very presence, have made this entire debacle much harder than it needs to be.

I understand that home raids, or ICE agents going door-to-door seems scary. ICE agents should strive to act in accordance with our laws. They should not behave like thugs. But they are in a difficult position: entering the U.S. illegally is already a crime. If Minnesota law enforcement apprehended more lawbreakers, there would be no need for ICE to participate in home raids or for ICE to swarm metro cities, arresting known rapists and drug traffickers.

Walz and Frey blame ICE's tactics for Minnesota's brewing civil unrest, but in reality, being soft on state and federal crime created the need for ICE to swoop in and enforce them.

I've been disappointed to see that since Obama's term ended in 2017 − perhaps as a reaction to Trump's presidency − the Democratic Party began viewing immigration, in particular, as laws that are optional and ICE as federal agents who aren't legitimate members of law enforcement. This seems to have encouraged former President Joe Biden to undo several Trump-era policies that helped secure the border, allowing a record number of migrants into the U.S. in 2023. ICE is now forced to rectify what Biden allowed.

Federal immigration laws are not just a cornerstone of America's sovereignty and well-being, but of most advanced countries. Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama believed this. The ideas of philosophers − Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau − reinforced this.

They are rooted in the idea that there is a delicate but vital social contract between citizens and governments: Individuals collectively give up some liberty and agree to obey laws to receive security, peace and order. Without this, there is chaos.

Democrats now seem to be openly advocating for the disruption of this social contract − even calling to defund or abolish ICE altogether.

Most Americans don't agree with or want this. Before the 2024 election, immigration was among the top concerns of most Americans.

The Trump administration could do its part better. They need not make this overtly political by trading jabs and smearing Democratic lawmakers. That riles everyone up more and is not a good example of leadership. But they must continue to systematically and methodically enforce immigration law, through ICE, and steer clear of actions, antics or optics that make it look like they are simply thugs hunting down innocent people for kicks.

Our social contract depends on this. Just ask Obama. Democrats upend this at their peril.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159938007-20260113-t-163347-z-1171368889-rc-2-f-0-jau-3-g-8-l-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpminnesota.JPG?crop=5494,3091,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-14 18:59:20.589586

This announcement follows Congresswoman McCollum’s Friday announcement(link is external) that she would support efforts to impeach Secretary Noem.

“Secretary Noem should be fired, but we know President Trump won’t do that. That’s why I support impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate for her obstruction of Congress and violation of the public trust,” said Congresswoman McCollum. “Over the past year, Americans in cities across the United States have felt the chaos and terror of Secretary Noem’s Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Secretary Noem has demonstrated that she is unable to enforce immigration law in a peaceful and ethical manner. Her deployment of unprofessional, poorly trained, masked immigration agents has put our neighbors in danger of physical harm. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go.”

The Constitution gives the U.S. House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Congresswoman McCollum is an original co-sponsor of Congresswoman Kelly’s three articles of impeachment:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants. Members of Congress have been denied entry into ICE facilities in Minnesota, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She’s also violated due process by directing ICE agents to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against U.S. citizens and lawful residents.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing, residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million in public funds to award an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the standard competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

The suspension would not apply to people seeking to enter the United States temporarily for tourism, business or medical treatment.

The Trump administration has also intensely focused on Somalis in recent weeks, deploying roughly 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minnesota.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration also said it would end temporary deportation protections for more than 2,000 Somali migrants living in the United States.","The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would suspend the processing of immigrant visas for people from 75 countries, intensifying its efforts to curtail legal migration to the United States.

The State Department said in a social media post that the effort was meant to discourage immigration from countries “whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.” It did not provide a full list of the countries affected by the pause, but it confirmed that Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea would be included. It also did not specify the percentage of immigrants from those countries who use public assistance.

The announcement is part of the federal government’s crackdown on immigration, which has included efforts to upend legal pathways for migrants seeking to enter or stay in the United States. It also comes as the Trump administration conducts an immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota, the state with the largest population of Somalis in the United States.

Federal officials said that the pause would begin on Jan. 21 and would remain in place while the department reassesses its processing procedures. The suspension would not apply to people seeking to enter the United States temporarily for tourism, business or medical treatment.

“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement.

Mr. Pigott said the department would “use its longstanding authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge,” referring to people who rely on government benefits.

The Trump administration has taken various steps in recent months to tighten legal pathways for migrants. The administration has already imposed full or partial travel restrictions on citizens from 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, Somalia and Chad. Federal officials have said the travel ban was necessary to protect national security.

The administration has also taken measures that could make it more difficult for certain immigrants already living in the United States to remain in the country. In December, the Department of Homeland Security put on hold immigration applications from citizens of the countries subject to the president’s travel ban, pausing their efforts to obtain benefits such as U.S. citizenship and green cards.

The announcement on Wednesday is also a reprisal of the Trump administration’s focus on immigrants who depend on public assistance. During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration sought to deny green cards to immigrants who relied on public benefits such as food assistance and housing vouchers.

The Trump administration has also intensely focused on Somalis in recent weeks, deploying roughly 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minnesota. Federal officials said the move was meant to crack down on fraud and illegal immigration. On Tuesday, the Trump administration also said it would end temporary deportation protections for more than 2,000 Somali migrants living in the United States.

His administration’s focus on Minnesota came after revelations about a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the state in recent years. More than 90 people have been charged in the federal fraud investigations, and most of the defendants are of Somali descent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14trump-news-visas-JFK-wkcb/14trump-news-visas-JFK-wkcb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:19.508622

No immediate judicial decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown

A judge made no immediate decision Wednesday on Minnesota's request to suspend the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in the head on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

""What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,"" state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case ""on the front burner"" and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

""It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,"" the judge said of the timetable, noting there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Government attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down.

""What we see right now is discrimination taking place only on the basis of race: Are you Latino or are you Somali? And then it is indiscriminate thereafter,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told Fox News. ""In other words, they are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets and you don't need to take my word for it at this point. This has been very well documented.""

The shooting, according to multiple outlets, has threatened to destroy spending negotiations with some Democrats calling for a freeze on ICE funding even if it means another deadlock.
Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.","Representative Seth Moulton Wednesday introduced a bill that would reverse a recent funding boost to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made through President Donald Trump’s signature budget reconciliation bill and reallocate the dollars to fund premium-lowering health care tax credits.

The bill comes after more than a dozen House Republicans broke from party leadership and sided with Democrats to pass an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that lapsed at the beginning of the new year. Negotiators in the U.S. Senate are now reportedly finalizing a compromise measure to revive the subsidies.

“We absolutely want to extend the ACA premiums tax credits, they shouldn’t be lapsing, but we’re funding it by taking money from ICE’s budget,” said Moulton in an interview, calling the Trump administration’s priorities “completely out of whack.”

“The One Big Beautiful Bill nearly triples ICE’s budget at a time when American families across the country are facing higher premiums due to the ACA premiums tax credit lapsing,” said Moulton referring to the Trump administration’s signature spending package that gave ICE $75 billion in funding through 2029.

The bill, Moulton said, would restore ICE funding to its previous annual level of $10 billion and repurpose the rest. Cosponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. André Carson on Indiana, Darren Soto of Florida and Sylvia Garcia of Texas.

Moulton’s bill also comes as public outrage grows over the recent killing of a woman by an ICE agent in Minnesota, and as Congress struggles to piece together spending measures ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline to avoid another shutdown. The shooting, according to multiple outlets, has threatened to destroy spending negotiations with some Democrats calling for a freeze on ICE funding even if it means another deadlock.

The latest shutdown lasted a record 43 days as Democrats refused to support a funding deal that allowed the health care subsidies to expire. Eventually, a portion of Democrats voted to support a GOP deal to reopen the government.

Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.

“What happened in Minnesota was an outright murder for anyone who can look at it with their own two eyes, and we should not be funding the continuation of ICE terrorizing American cities,” said Moulton.

The Trump administration has defended the shooting in the name of self defense.

“A lot of GOP colleagues are privately concerned about ICE,” Mouton said. “One approached me after the Minnesota shooting and said that as a former law enforcement official himself, he thinks it’s criminal what happened, but they won’t say any of this out loud because they’re too scared of Donald Trump.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/d21ab5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5248x2755+0+372/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2F5d%2F58190f000ec7699b087344d6112a%2Fap20043631430758.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:25.331150

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.
That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said.
“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd.

Bucks County Sheriff Danny Ceisler officially withdrew his office from a collaboration agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, citing public safety concerns and the need to reestablish trust between local law enforcement and the county’s more than 50,000 immigrant residents.

“When large numbers of our residents are afraid to call 911, or come to court and testify, that makes our entire community less safe,” Ceisler told a small crowd Wednesday in front of the Bucks County Justice Center. “This is not a public safety problem for immigrants. This is a public safety problem for everyone.”

Sheriff’s deputies are now prohibited from asking crime victims, witnesses and court observers about their immigration status per the order Ceisler signed this morning.

Former Sheriff Fred Harran signed the 287(g) agreement with ICE last spring, triggering widespread backlash and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania that argues Harran did not have the authority to enter into the agreement without the approval of county commissioners. In October, a judge upheld Harran’s authority and rejected a preliminary injunction order seeking to stay implementation of the program.

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.

That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said. “It allows them to stop anybody, detain anybody who they believe is in the country without current authorization.”

Harran argued that the sheriff’s office would only assist ICE in detaining people who have committed “serious” crimes.

Sixteen sheriff’s deputies underwent training to participate in the program, Ceiseler said, but Harran never fully implemented the collaboration.

Ceisler, a U.S. Army veteran, campaigned heavily on the issue in the 2025 elections, vowing to withdraw from the program. The Democrat won more than 55% of the vote to oust Harran, a Republican.

“This is what was on voters’ minds, and we won, and we won handily,” Ceisler said Wednesday.

Immigrant rights advocate and Bucks County resident Heidi Roux said the immigrant community is “breathing a collective sigh of relief.”

Because of the agreement, Roux said that some immigrant community members feared calling 911 or coming to the courthouse to pay a parking ticket.

“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd. “Violent criminals should absolutely be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their immigration status. I believe criminal activity can be addressed while simultaneously supporting the human rights and the dignity of all of our residents.”

Bucks is ‘not a so-called sanctuary county’

Ceisler said that the county “has not severed all ties with ICE, nor precluded future partnership with ICE when it comes to dangerous criminals.” The county “is not, has never been, and will never be a so-called sanctuary county,” he said.

“We will ensure that actual criminals, people involved in human trafficking, fentanyl distribution, child exploitation, violent crime and fraud and are in the country illegally are deported, which had been the standard practice in Bucks County for decades,” he said.

The county’s Department of Corrections shares data and fingerprints from anyone booked in the system via a database called LiveScan, Ceisler said, which is accessible to ICE and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies across the country. Bucks County correctional facilities continue to honor ICE judicial warrants, he said.

“After months of open dialogue with our local police chiefs and community leaders, they have affirmed that this is the right balance between protecting our community from crime and protecting our community from fear,” Ceisler said.

Ceisler condemned Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal’s remarks last week calling ICE “fake, wannabe law enforcement” as “counter-productive.” Bilal “blurred jurisdictional lines,” Ceisler said, and “stepped on the toes of [Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin] Bethel.”

“I understand that many people are angry and frustrated, but we all have our role and responsibility in this process, and as a law enforcement executive, what she did is not it,” he said.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ceisler-ice-agreement-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:29.669364

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://theoutlookonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:07.947378

“That, to me, has red flags all over it,” the former ICE agent said.
“You can't train someone to do all the basic law enforcement stuff, let alone the law.
You use Google?” the current ICE agent said.
Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.","The current and former agents spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record on behalf of the agency.

The DHS told TIME that Good had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.”

But videos of the incident contradict that account. They appear to show Ross positioned to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired three shots that killed her, with her wheels turned away from him.

Both the former agent and the current agent also questioned why Ross was assigned to this operation in the first place, given a previous injury involving a driver at the wheel of a vehicle just a few months before the confrontation with Good.

“That, to me, has red flags all over it,” the former ICE agent said.

“So when this person took off, I'm sure that prior incident came to mind, because he's an experienced officer. And then he just reacted, in my opinion, not in the correct way,” the former agent added.

Last Monday, the Trump administration deployed roughly 2,000 agents from ICE to the Twin Cities area amid a growing fraud scandal at day care centers run by Somali residents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media that the agents are there to conduct “ a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.”

The current ICE agent pointed out that while the pretense of the immigration operation in Minneapolis is to investigate welfare fraud, neither border patrol officers nor ICE agents in charge of deportation, also known as Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers, are trained to investigate financial fraud.

“You can't train someone to do all the basic law enforcement stuff, let alone the law. Immigration law used to be a five or six-month course at the academy. How do you know that people are here legally unless you know the law? You use Google?” the current ICE agent said.

The former ICE agent also said that this rushed training could lead to a domino effect as more senior ICE agents plan for retirement, and the new recruits, who didn’t have as much legal and enforcement training as previous generations, fill the gap.

Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.

“The biggest concern is jeopardizing your pension. And then, of course, violating the law. If you're ordered and you know that you're violating the law and you say no, then you stand a chance of being terminated. And then you jeopardize your pension,” the former agent said, adding that some officers are asked to work for 16-hour shifts six to seven days a week. “For most of us, it's not worth it.”

Even before Good’s shooting, public support for the agency has been dropping sharply. A YouGov poll conducted the same day as the shooting killing found that 52% of respondents now either somewhat or strongly disapproved of how ICE was handling its job, compared to 39% who somewhat or strongly approved. For the first time, more people now support abolishing the agency than oppose it.

Asked about the public’s biggest misconception about ICE, both the current and former agent said that ICE, like all government agencies, is at the mercy of the Administration.

“Where was all this energy when the election was happening? Everyone knew this was what the Administration was going to do,” the agent said, adding that for the most part, the agents conducting deportations and arrests are not breaking the law.

“You're putting people in a position where they have to quit and try to find work in a really bad job market. So they justify themselves, and they say, hey, it's legal, and as long as I'm not violating rights or doing something immoral or illegal, I'm going to do it because this is what the American voters voted for.”",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254678149.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 15:59:10.105506

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – who they describe as people who may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

The state department wrote on social media that it “will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates”.

The Guardian obtained a state department cable with the full list of countries affected.

“The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,” the statement continued. “We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused.”

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has intensified to record levels, even as nationwide protests over the killing of Renee Good have drawn attention to law enforcement practices. The state department says it revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office, while the homeland security department reported last month that more than 605,000 people have been deported, while an additional 2.5 million left the country on their own.

The administration has particularly focused on Somali Americans following fraud allegations and federal investigations in Minnesota. Trump referred to the Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar as “garbage” during a cabinet meeting last month and said he did not want Somalis in the US and they should “go back to where they came from”.

The pause follows Trump’s December expansion of travel bans to 39 countries, suspension of asylum processing, and halting of citizenship and green card applications for citizens of countries already subject to restrictions.

Research contradicts administration claims about immigrant welfare use. In February 2025, the libertarian Cato Institute published a paper showing that native-born Americans consumed, on an average per capita basis, more welfare and entitlement benefits than all immigrants. The study found immigrants consumed 21% fewer welfare and entitlement benefits than native-born Americans on a per capita basis in 2022.

Migration policy experts also warned the move will have far-reaching consequences beyond those directly affected by visa denials.

“The likely result will be that many immigrant families will be afraid to access any public benefits for which a household member is eligible, forgoing supports in times of need to preserve future immigration prospects,” Julia Gelatt, associate director of the US immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an analysis posted on Wednesday.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ba42c16b4c0adaa21271947f5936cb3231c20f/387_0_4409_3526/master/4409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7e530d704caf8e6c48bb58af15eac95",N,,2026-01-14 15:58:57.936413

The State Department issued its advisory for Americans.
But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension.
The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.","The Trump administration is publishing contrasting information about on-the-ground conditions in Venezuela, raising questions about how different agencies are making policy decisions towards Venezuela and its nationals in the U.S., as well as American travelers.

The Department of Homeland Security, when ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in February 2025, said that while some conditions for the deportation protections continue, there have been “notable improvements” in sectors like the economy, public health and crime. That made it possible for Venezuelans “to be safely returned.”

But in a recent security alert on Jan. 10, the State Department urged any Americans to depart Venezuela immediately. It emphasized reports that pro-regime groups were stopping people for evidence of U.S. citizenship or U.S. support and highlighted the risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, kidnapping, crime, poor health infrastructure and civil unrest.

The safety alert from the State Department comes days after the United States bombed military installations in Caracas and snatched Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. It also comes as uncertainty around Venezuela’s political future has renewed calls in the U.S. to restore TPS for the over half-a-million Venezuelans residing in the U.S. who lost the protections.

The United States has said since 2019 that U.S. citizens should not visit Venezuela for any reason, and its embassy in Caracas suspended diplomatic operations and consular services that same year.

Both the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department told the Miami Herald that the descriptions of Venezuela agency communications and documents about conditions in Venezuela are not inconsistent with each other.

“The State Department’s travel messaging is for American citizens and is written with their safety in mind. Noting that it may be safe for Venezuelans, does not mean it is safe for Americans,” spokespersons for both agencies in separate statements.

A spokesperson for the State Department said that “the Trump administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.” Meanwhile, Tricia McLaughlin at DHS said “there is no discrepancy here. The State Department issued its advisory for Americans. You seem to be under the impression that the United States is here to serve foreigners and act as a forever haven for gang members, rapists, drug dealers and narco terrorists.”

The State Department’s “Do not travel” advisory, reissued Dec. 3 without changes, says that violent crimes like armed robbery and homicides are common; that the government is engaged in a brutal crackdown against opposition groups; that shortages of basic supplies like gasoline, electricity, and water are commonplace throughout much of the country; and that access to medical care is limited and that facilities may not have basic medications available.

“You cannot warn Americans not to travel to Venezuela because of extreme risk, persecution and danger, while simultaneously telling Venezuelans in the United States that they can safely return because the country is now safe for them. That contradiction is not just policy inconsistency, it is a failure of common sense, humanitarian responsibility and due process,” said Adelys Ferro, the director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus.

Independent groups like Human Rights Watch say the Venezuelan government intimidates human rights advocates, arrests and detains protesters and harasses journalists. There are also armed gangs in border states that control daily life and pro-regime groups that intimidate opposition candidates, according to the watchdog organization.

Nearly 8 million people have fled Venezuela in the past decade In the last days of the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela another year and a half, citing the “severe humanitarian emergency.” About 5.1 million Venezuelans live with hunger and 53% of the population in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations.

But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension. It noted the “notable improvements” in certain conditions that allowed for a safe return and warranted the end of TPS. The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.

“Temporary Protected Status is meant to be just that: temporary. President Trump is bringing stability to Venezuela and bringing to justice an illegitimate Narco Terrorist dictator who stole from his own people. Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love,” said McLaughlin.

Human Rights First, which tracks Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals, said in a Jan. 9 report that the Trump administration has not sent any deportation flights to Venezuela since Dec. 10. Last month, the Venezuelan government announced that the federal government had unilaterally suspended its twice-weekly deportations amid escalating tensions.

It remains to be seen how ongoing negotiations following Maduro’s capture will impact future deportations.

In a recent letter, U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Darren Soto of Florida, along with Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, asked the Trump administration to bring back TPS for Venezuela in the wake of Maduro’s capture, which has left his former vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, as interim president.

“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the lawmakers wrote. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/kqlgmm/picture314147088/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GettyImages-2253875369.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:33.995116

The move was first reported by Fox News.

Trump has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown since returning to office in January. His administration has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and sparking violent confrontations with both migrants and U.S. citizens.

While he campaigned on stopping illegal immigration into the United States, his administration has made legal immigration more difficult, for example, by imposing new and expensive fees on the applicants of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.

""This administration has proven itself to have the most anti-legal immigration agenda in American history,"" David Bier, Cato’s Director of Immigration Studies and The Selz Foundation Chair in Immigration Policy, said in a statement.

""This action will ban nearly half of all legal immigrants to the United States, turning away about 315,000 legal immigrants over the next year alone,"" Bier said.

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

The State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump took office, it said on Monday. The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.

In November, Trump had vowed to ""permanently pause"" migration from all ""Third World Countries"" following a shooting near the White House by an Afghan national that killed a National Guard member.

President Donald Trump's administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

The November guidance on which Wednesday's decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S.

While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn't be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.

Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations.

The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants' English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.

Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already tightening those rules.

Staff at Samhsa were not consulted on the cuts or even told they were happening, according to two sources familiar with the cuts who asked for anonymity to speak about sensitive matters. The agency also endured massive cuts throughout 2025.

Providers woke up this morning to learn they would need to lay off staff and end programs immediately, Hampton said. Many of these programs are on the frontlines of mental health and substance use, functioning as the first point of contact for people who need care.

“These are programs that save lives, so the impact could be really devastating,” said Regina LaBelle, former acting director of the Biden White House office of national drug control policy and professor at Georgetown University.

“It really covers the spectrum of prevention, treatment and recovery services, both on substance use and mental health,” said Yngvild Olsen, who until last July served as the director for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at Samhsa and is now a national adviser at Manatt Health.

The cuts will affect overdose-prevention work, naloxone distribution and use by first responders, mental health and substance use support within schools, support for pregnant and postpartum women who receive assistance for substance use disorder, underage drinking prevention and recovery support programs – all cut without warning.

“Overnight, our entire backbone and infrastructure of addiction and mental health in this country flipped up on its head,” Hampton said. “These grants are lifesaving tools that honestly are a good reason why we have started to see a reversal in trends of drug overdoses in this country.”

Overdoses soared over the past two decades, but in recent years they began falling. In 2024, the US overdose rate dropped by 27%. Now, with these abrupt cuts, “a lot of lives are going to be lost”, Hampton said. “A lot of harm is happening in real time this morning.”

The cuts “came as a surprise, given all the changes that grantees had already made in response to executive orders and Samhsa guidance”, Olsen said. “This potentially could have an unbelievably disruptive impact on people’s access to services. It could mean really thousands of people losing access to the treatment.”

The funding was appropriated by Congress to Samhsa, which then disburses funding to organizations around the country. Congress does not appear to have been involved in the cancellations. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating funding, and these cuts seem to be politically motivated, said LaBelle, who added: “We didn’t know that the administration would just basically use their regulatory authority to pull the plug.”

The awards were terminated because they no longer aligned with the Trump administration’s priorities, according to a letter to grantees from Christopher Carroll, the deputy assistant secretary at Samhsa, obtained by the Guardian. The administration’s goals include “innovative programs and interventions” to reduce mental illness, substance use, overdoses and suicide, the letter said.

“You can’t tell me that naloxone distribution, providing mental health support in schools, providing outreach to get people into treatment who are unhoused, providing drug court services, that these are not in line with administration priorities. They are 100% in line with administration priorities, as stated by the administration as recently as two or three months ago,” Hampton said.

“All of us are in a state of complete and utter shock that the administration would take such a reckless action.”

The cuts are for nearly all discretionary funds, which account for nearly $2bn of Samhsa’s budget. The grants that were not affected include the state opioid response block grants, the certified community behavioral clinics program, and the 988 hotline.

Samhsa did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s inquiry about whether staff were consulted or informed of these changes and how they would affect care.

The cuts were made under the same rule as previous health agency layoffs and cutbacks, which were successfully challenged in court.

“My hope is that this will go to court and the courts will stop it,” Hampton said. But “the harm is happening in real time right now, and as this gets sorted out in the courts, people will die. People will die.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489573a411a21951fbaac3e40c36ceb70f5b6c19/900_7_4135_3307/master/4135.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61c2e8a7b5c971076dd6d0bc1dd2650b",N,,2026-01-14 16:58:26.255033

And indeed, the chief justice found that Representative Mike Bost, the Illinois Republican who challenged his state’s election rules, clearly had that kind of stake in the outcome.
They argued that allowing mail-in ballots to arrive after Election Day and still be counted ran counter to Congress’s intent.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with a conservative congressman who had sued over rules in Illinois that allow mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after an election.

The question in the case was not the rule itself but whether a political candidate has the right to challenge the rules governing the vote count in the candidate’s election.

A majority of the court found that the answer was yes.

The justices have said they will hear a more significant case evaluating the legality of late-arriving mail-in ballots later this year. That case will test rules in Mississippi that allow the counting of ballots received after Election Day.

But many election law experts had warned that a decision in the congressman’s favor in Wednesday’s case could clear the way for a host of lawsuits challenging all kinds of election rules in states throughout the country, particularly from Republicans who have advanced a narrative that some state rules, especially involving mail-in ballots, unfairly favor Democrats.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the Constitution required a legal challenger to have a “personal stake” in a case in order to sue. And indeed, the chief justice found that Representative Mike Bost, the Illinois Republican who challenged his state’s election rules, clearly had that kind of stake in the outcome. Mr. Bost argued that his campaign would incur extra costs to monitor the counting of late-arriving ballots.

“He is a candidate for office,” the chief justice wrote. “And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.”

The case is one of several lawsuits brought by allies of President Trump challenging rules around mail-in ballots after his 2020 election loss. Mr. Trump has long falsely blamed fraud resulting from the increased use of mail-in ballots during the pandemic in part for his loss.

The court’s other conservatives joined the chief justice in the outcome, although Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, wrote separately to say they would have found for Mr. Bost for slightly different reasons. The court’s other two liberals, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.

Chief Justice Roberts analogized the congressional elections to a 100-meter dash. He wrote that each runner would suffer if the race were “unexpectedly extended to 105 meters.” In much the same way, he wrote, “an unlawful extension of vote counting,” if one took place, would deprive candidates “of the opportunity to compete for election.”

Justices Barrett and Kagan said Mr. Bost had standing to sue because he had shown he suffered a financial injury, not because he was a political candidate.

Justice Barrett, in her concurrence, wrote that Mr. Bost had “suffered a traditional pocketbook injury” because of his increased campaign costs to monitor the ballots received after Election Day.

In her dissent, Justice Jackson said the majority had incorrectly carved out “a bespoke rule” for political candidates in a decision that “now complicates and destabilizes” the court’s standing rules and “America’s electoral processes.”

In a statement, Mr. Bost said he was thankful the court had ruled in his favor, a decision he called “a critically important step forward in the fight for election integrity and fair elections.”

A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. (As a result of the ruling, Mr. Bost’s lawsuit can now proceed in lower courts.)

The case is one of a number related to elections pending before the justices. In October, they heard arguments in a dispute over Louisiana’s congressional district map. That case, Louisiana v. Callais, began as a traditional fight over whether the map was an illegal racial gerrymander, but the justices significantly broadened the question last summer to include an evaluation of what role race can play in drawing electoral maps. That move called into question whether the Supreme Court would gut the Voting Rights Act, a landmark law from the civil rights era.

In the Mississippi case that will be heard later this term, Watson v. Republican National Committee, the committee, along with the state’s Republican Party and some individual voters, sued in 2024 over the state’s rules for mail-in ballots. They argued that allowing mail-in ballots to arrive after Election Day and still be counted ran counter to Congress’s intent.

The case will test the meaning of “Election Day.” Mississippi has defended its laws, asserting that Congress set a date for voters to decide, not a date for the ballots to arrive.

The justices have not announced a date for oral arguments in the case, but a decision upending Mississippi’s rules could affect dozens of other states, throwing election rules into chaos before the midterms.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14dc-scotus-ballots-gcjl/14dc-scotus-ballots-gcjl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:45.065336

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/kristinoemmay82025.jpg?h=616f4463&itok=3bzKipV5,N,,2026-01-14 14:57:53.840429

It also lowered the standard of review for those determinations.

“One thing is clear — this administration doesn’t want us to know what goes on inside these facilities,” Rep. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “Accountability is not optional.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued the rule late last week, a day after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis. The incident sparked nationwide outrage and calls — including by Randall — to impeach Noem.

Citing violence against ICE facilities, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that all requests by members of Congress to enter ICE detention facilities must be made “at least seven days in advance.”

“This was done in order to ensure the safety of staff, law enforcement, visitors and detainees alike,” McLaughlin said.

The privately run Northwest ICE Processing Center is one of the largest detention centers nationwide, with 1,575 beds. Advocates have decried the conditions for years, and government agencies and human rights groups have published wide-ranging concerns. It’s among various detention centers across the country that Democratic members of Congress have descended on for spontaneous oversight visits in the last year as the Trump administration ramped up immigration detentions and raids.

In April, Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was charged with two counts of assault after trying to block the arrest of Newark’s mayor during a tour of the city’s detention facility. Randall said the Tacoma facility denied her entry in August, and over the weekend, Minnesota Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to a detention center in Minneapolis.

Randall visited the Tacoma facility three days before Homeland Security published the new rule. “I heard again and again from detainees that they’re being denied proper medical care, and conditions continue to worsen,” Randall said.

It’s the federal agency’s second attempt at such a policy: A federal judge last month rejected a similar rule by Noem, stating that federal spending laws require unrestricted congressional visits to ICE detention facilities. Noem sidestepped the decision by leaning on a funding technicality: the judge said that funding derived from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is exempt from the limitation.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, who last visited the Tacoma facility in May, characterized the move as an attempt by the administration to hide the center’s poor conditions.

“The law allows members of Congress to conduct unannounced visits to ICE facilities whenever we want, no advanced notice or permission needed,” Jayapal said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “We are the authorizing and funding branch of government, and it is absolutely outrageous that DHS is trying yet again to prevent members from conducting our oversight responsibility.”

Jayapal, who is ranking member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, will host a field hearing Friday with Omar in St. Paul, Minn., to review actions by the Trump administration and ICE in Minneapolis and hear from witnesses.

With whistles and chants, cowbells and clanging pots, demonstrators gathered Tuesday night outside the Hyatt Regency Morristown to loudly protest the weekend’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions.

A Morristown High School senior, Juan Daniel Mendoza, was among several individuals rounded up Sunday morning near a Speedwell Avenue laundromat.

“I hear there are people saying that he is 19, that he’s in a gang back in Honduras, and that’s just not true. He’s a school student. He’s 17. He’s just trying to get an education,” said MHS freshman Zoe Lopez.

The Morris County Sheriff’s Office backed up Morristown cops, who estimated the crowd at 300. It was boisterous yet peaceful; officers occasionally reminded participants to be careful about keeping clear of traffic.

Some motorists honked in solidarity with people chanting “ICE out of Morristown” or waving flags from Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia. A couple of upside-down U.S. flags symbolized a nation in distress under President Trump’s immigration policies.

Video by Andrew Dutton and Kevin Coughlin for MorristownGreen.com:

Other demonstrators bore signs remembering Renee Nicole Good, an activist shot in Minneapolis last week by an ICE officer who claimed it was self-defense.

“People are getting killed, people are getting hurt, and people are getting taken. And we … don’t know what happened to them…that’s the issue, the lawlessness and the lack of accountability and the cruelty,” said recent MHS grad Miles Gorman.

“They are behaving lawlessly and cruelly, and nobody wants them here,” a woman named Liz said of ICE, over her cacophonous cowbell.

‘NOT A DREAM PLACE ANYMORE’

The throng included at least one Congressional candidate.

“I’m out here because this is home… we want to show that New Jersey stands with its neighbors, its friends and its family, and that ICE is not welcome here,” said Zach Beecher of Morristown, running for Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s former 11th District seat. Congress should fix the immigration system, he said, instead of funding “punitive, targeted raids that are based on politics and not on policy.”

Further down the sidewalk, Alexis Lake of Sussex and her friend Jackie Malone of Madison craned for a better view.

“Morristown runs on immigrants,” Lake said. “We have immigrants everywhere. They are our family, our friends, our co-workers, and it’s not right what’s happening right now.”

Lake is against open borders. “But for people that are here that are working that haven’t committed a crime, there’s no reason that they should be taken off the streets in the ways that we are seeing,” she said.

“My kids grew up here, they went to school here,” explained Morristown resident Dave Olander. “They enjoyed the diversity, and they are part of the community. I anticipated something like…this raid that happened over the weekend. And this just can’t happen.”

TAKING A STAND

Madeline Nelson, 34, emigrated from Haiti as a teen and is grateful for opportunities that enabled her to become a nurse practitioner.

“I just think that this is a time for people to take a stand,” Nelson said.

“I’m an immigrant, and I love this country. America is a great country. Wherever you are in the world, you dream of America. That was the past. I feel like now, people don’t think of America as a place to come anymore. It’s not a dream place anymore.”

Joel Tapia, 25, handed out more than 200 whistles, for blowing warnings when ICE is in the neighborhood. He was born in Denville, but his parents hail from Uruguay.

“I’m here because we have to remember that at the end of the day, if we don’t stand for something, we will fall for everything,” Tapia said. “The only thing that’s really a threat is the chaos that (ICE is) creating.”

Twenty-eight-year-old Keyri Escobar of Morristown organized the protest; she heard rumors that ICE agents were bunking at the Hyatt.

Escobar’s parents survived a perilous journey from El Salvador to the U.S. “I started this because I myself, and my parents, are immigrants. My parents have been here since 1995, working their ass off, paying taxes, giving me a better life.”

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Ross was taken to the hospital after Good allegedly hit him with her car on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Noem did not disclose the nature of his supposed injuries at the time but said Ross was released the same day.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, internal bleeding can range from a minor bruise to a severe condition requiring medical intervention. The extent of Ross’ injuries were not immediately clear.

Haverford Township commissioners have voted Monday night to restrict the police department from aiding United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on noncriminal federal immigration policies.

Following last week’s fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, Commissioner Laura Cavender sponsored the resolution for the meeting on Monday night.

Cavender said the resolution speaks to the township’s values, affirms the police department practices, and draws an important boundary in that immigration policy should not be pushed onto local officers.

In July, Radnor Township passed a similar resolution that states the municipality will not enter into any 287G agreement, which would allow ICE officers to partner with municipal law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.

The wording at the agency website is “allows your law enforcement agency to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law.”

According to U.S. census records, about 7 percent of the township, whose median household income is $127,000, is foreign born. Officials did not have an estimate on any number of illegal residents in the township.

A full house was on hand for the spirited discussion as residents and commissioners alike had a chance to present their views.

One resident said from a fiscal position signing a 287G agreement would cost the township financially with local police responsible for personnel expenses used in carrying out any mission while the officers were under ICE supervision.

“I don’t understand why we would imagine that entering into a 287G agreement would benefit us given that our property taxes go to pay for our public safety … ICE’s budget … has more than tripled. It’s now up to $27.5 billion annually, that’s more than all of the federal law enforcement agencies combined,” the resident said. “It is sufficiently funded.

Another speaker said the Minneapolis incident offers a teachable moment.

“In a situation involving law enforcement, even if concerned about actions of law enforcement, do not get directly involved, especially if you are operating a vehicle which is capable of becoming a weapon, keep your distance. If an officer tells you to do something, comply with what they ask,” he said.

Another man, who said he is a former police officer, opposed the resolution on the ground that, in his opinion, it puts residents, law enforcement and the future of the community at risk.

“Cooperating with ICE stops the engagement at street level,” he said. “It puts the engagements exactly where they belong, in detention centers.”

He went on to say reports that “jack booted” ICE agents ripping babies from their mothers and sending them back is not what is happening. That brought a groan from the audience, which consisted mostly of supporters of the resolution.

President Judy Trombetta quieted the crowd to allow the man to speak.

He finished repeating his oath when he became a police officer to uphold the constitution: “to protect the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.” He added, “And we have to protect this country from both foreign and domestic intrusion.”

One of the next speakers had a differing view.

“Clearly, ICE has overstepped,” she said.

She said what she sees is armed militia’s patrolling streets, dragging people from their cars and day care centers who are “on the hunt for people who are not breaking laws, and are only here to try to forge a better life for themselves and their families.”

She also noted the Boston Massacre was spurred when a militia was brought in to patrol the streets.

“We don’t like it. We haven’t liked it since the beginning of the Revolution,” she said in support of the resolution.

One resident asked if information from license plate readers is shared to track immigrants. Police Chief John Viola said to his knowledge that is not the case.

A woman said it is criminal to be here illegally, and she is worried that some undocumented immigrants who might be here, even if it is 1 percent, want to hurt us badly. She said police should support federal officers.

A woman speaking for the Havertown Community action group spoke strongly in support of the resolution.

“We have watched in horror as masked ICE agents have increasingly relied on violence, which has turned deadly as in the case of Renee Nicole Good,” she said. “Aggressive and unlawful ICE actions make our communities far less safe.”

One longtime resident said an illegal immigrant raped her 13-year-old niece. She said police had no facts on the man and the judge gave him a second chance and he then went on to impregnate three other women.

“I approve of ICE coming to Havertown … don’t we want to know who might want to hurt and kill our children … Dammit, we need to know who else is here, who has a criminal background,” she said.

She added the proclamation before the board is “laughable” and “come legally, become a citizen and do good.”

Haverford School Board member Chris Shelton reminded commissioners that in 2018 the school district adopted a resolution to welcome all students, regardless of immigration status.

“If the police department were to enter into any agreement with ICE, that would present where we could have students become at risk … I would ask the board to support the resolution in lines with the goals of the district,” he said.

‘Grandstanding’

One speaker who said he was a lawyer, compared the resolution to performance art, and in his opinion what has gone on to this point is legal.

He also asked if they have considered costs to the township could incur if the federal government decides to withhold funding or file suit against the township.

After reading on immigration law, another woman called the resolution “grandstanding” on the emotions of what has happened in Minnesota saying the law already exists.

Following the public time, Commissioner Larry Holmes said the Constitution protects everyone in the country, not just citizens. Holmes said he doesn’t want the township police department’s reputation to be hurt by the “reckless and criminal activity of ICE.”

Commissioner Brian Gondek said 287G actually consists of multiple programs.

He said he doesn’t like political theater and the topic creates a lot of hostility, which results in confusion. He said in reviewing the language of the resolution it would add to that confusion, adding to the combustion of the topic.

Gondek added ICE could still come into the town at any time and there is nothing the municipality can do.

Cavender said the feds don’t need local assistance.

“ICE does not need the assistance of our local government and they have been encouraging local municipalities to partner,” Cavander said, with that number growing by 600 percent.

Commissioner Kevin McCloskey said no one wants to see a 37-year-old mother get shot.

“None of us should want armed militia in the streets shooting us citizens at any point,” McCloskey said. “No disagreement, or blowing a whistle, or saying I don’t agree with what you are doing should ever lead to someone being shot by a trained officer of the federal government … it really shouldn’t be that complicated

Holmes said ICE has ignored laws and any benefit of the doubt they are entitled to “has been flushed down the toilet.”

Trombetta said she sees the resolution as a proactive measure so police are never put into an impossible situation between supporting federal requests and protecting all residents of the community.

She said the resolution makes clear police will enforce all criminal law but they will not be used as agents of federal civil immigration enforcement unless there is a judicial warrant signed by a judge. She said it protects civil liberties, protects safety and gives police officers clear direction.

“We are not refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement on criminal matters, we are not creating a sanctuary,” Trombeta said.

Gondek asked for an amendment on the wording, to include federal law, which was agreed to.

The motion passed 7-2 with commissioners Gondek and Michael McCollum voting against.",https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DTD-L-HAVERFORD-11020-1.jpg?w=1024&h=778,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:17.676595

He added, “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

Rogan, who was interviewing Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), said issues concerning immigration “are more complicated than anyone wants to admit.”

Cellphone videos of the encounter have prompted a mix of reactions from officials and lawmakers.

Federal officials have said that when Good pulled forward in her vehicle toward the ICE officer, he acted in self-defense and described the driver’s actions as ""an act of domestic terrorism."" Authorities have also said that Good had been following and harassing federal officers earlier that day.

The Illinois law allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to two weeks later. More than a dozen states, as well as the District of Columbia, accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday.
Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.
They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities.
House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House.","The Democratic representative Robin Kelly on Wednesday formally introduced articles of impeachment against Donald Trump’s homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, following the fatal shooting of a US citizen by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions”.

The new push comes amid mounting national outrage over the death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, killed at the wheel of her car on a residential street by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer during high-octane deployments of law enforcement in cities and towns across the country.

Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.

While Noem and the Trump administration have characterized the incident as an act of “domestic terrorism” by a “professional agitator”, video evidence and local officials have sharply contested that narrative. The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, described the shooting as a reckless use of power and demanded the agency leave the city. The administration has responded by sending more federal agents, as tensions between officers and residents escalate.

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” said a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. “We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”

In response, Kelly said of Noem: “You have violated your oath of office and there will be consequences.”

Late last year, the representative Delia Ramirez, a fellow Illinois Democrat, moved to impeach Noem, amid an immigration crackdown in Chicago.

They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities. It further alleges a violation of public trust through the use of “warrantless arrests” and the use of “violence against US citizens and lawful individuals”. It also charges Noem with self-dealing for “inappropriately” using taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment, and awarding the $200m recruitment contract to a firm run by the husband of the senior DHS official and chief spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin.

Despite rising fury among Democrats over the administration’s increasingly violent enforcement tactics, the party is at odds over how to respond. House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House. Other Democrats have called for using an upcoming government funding deadline to try to rein in ICE and slash funding to the agency. Kelly, who is running in a competitive Democratic primary to replace retiring Senator Dick Durbin in Illinois, has positioned herself more aggressively on the issue than leadership.

“We haven’t ruled anything in and we haven’t ruled anything out. Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, told reporters on Monday. Noem, Jeffries added, was “completely and totally unqualified” and should be “run out of town as soon as possible” but he questioned whether impeachment was “the best way to accomplish that objective”.

In 2024, House Republicans impeached Joe Biden’s secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, breaking precedent and pushing through charges that even some in their own party warned were political in nature. The Senate dismissed the charges on the basis that they did not”allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor”.

Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House to approve the charges, and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2dc5d994c2f52bb659f3f04425bc7b14b600d1/417_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65781cb03df0f40dcc45105b93fdfe5a",N,,2026-01-14 14:57:58.246891

In the Powderhorn neighborhood in Minneapolis, federal agents dispersed pepper balls and flash bangs amid the protests.","A hearing is expected Wednesday in the lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities challenging the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operation there, which the lawsuit calls “a federal invasion.”

The hearing follows the resignation of at least half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota amid pressure from the Trump administration on how to conduct an investigation into the deadly shooting of a woman by an ICE agent last week, a source said.

The killing of Renee Good, a US citizen and mother of three, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis as the Trump administration said it was deploying around 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection personnel to the region.

Here are the key things to know:

Lawsuit: The Wednesday court hearing involves the Minnesota lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, which is seeking a court order halting immigration enforcement operations. The lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action and says the Twin Cities are being targeted because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the federal government during immigration enforcement efforts. In response to the lawsuit, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Constitution was on the administration’s side and the surge of federal officers was needed because politicians in Illinois and Minnesota were not protecting their citizens.

Prosecutors resign: The senior career prosecutors who stepped down reportedly objected to pressure from the White House to shift the investigation into Good’s shooting away from the agent’s use of force and toward Good, her widow, and others connected to immigration protests. Joseph Thompson, who frequently handled investigations with political implications including one into social services fraud, was among those who resigned. Read more about who some of the other prosecutors were here.

No civil rights investigation: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department does not believe there is evidence to back a criminal civil rights investigation into the actions of the ICE agent who shot Good. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized the move. An FBI investigation of the shooting is ongoing, though local authorities have been blocked from joining the probe.

More federal agents: US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino said “hundreds and hundreds” of additional federal agents are being deployed to Minneapolis. The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, according to two federal law enforcement sources. This comes on top of the deployment of about 2,000 agents to the area that CNN reportedearlier.

White House reaction: Trump on Tuesday defended ICE agents operating in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” and warning online that a “day of reckoning and retribution is coming,” as the administration sends more federal agents to Minneapolis.

Federal funding: During a speech Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced the federal government will not make “any payments” to sanctuary cities or states with sanctuary cities starting February 1. A judge blocked the administration from denying funding to over 30 cities last year for policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Protests: A few blocks away from where Renee Good was killed federal officers clashed with protesters Tuesday. Agents smashed one woman’s car window and pulled her out of the vehicle, video showed. In the Powderhorn neighborhood in Minneapolis, federal agents dispersed pepper balls and flash bangs amid the protests. Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, protesters chanted, waved signs and flags, and confronted federal agents parked at the gate, at times stepping into the street to try to block vehicles they believed were carrying ICE officers.

Somali community targeted: The Trump administration sharpened it’s focus on Minneapolis after allegations of widespread fraud at Somali-run child care centers in the area were raised in a video posted by a conservative YouTuber last month, with little evidence.

At least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota have quit.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

The six have one big reason - Justice Department officials pressured them to twist the investigation of a shooting in Minneapolis. Rather than focus on the federal agent who shot Renee Macklin Good in the head, political leaders wanted an investigation to find dirt on Good's widow. The resignations have disrupted other federal probes, such as an investigation of Social Service fraud the Trump administration says it cares about.

MARTÍNEZ: Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic has been covering both the fraud cases and the shooting death. Matt, why did the six attorneys resign?

MATT SEPIC, BYLINE: The attorneys aren't speaking publicly, but there are several reasons, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. That person asked that we use their name because they're not authorized to talk to the media. One of those reasons is tied to last week's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Trump administration officials say the agent fired in self-defense, but many state and local officials are pointing to video taken from multiple angles that contradicts claims that Good posed any threat.

The person with knowledge of the situation I spoke with says there's pressure from DOJ leaders to investigate Good's widow, Becca Good, for ties to activist groups, which is not illegal. The group also objects to the DOJ's reluctance to investigate Agent Ross and to exclude state police from the investigation. And the same source tells me that the veteran prosecutors are concerned that Trump's focus on immigration has drawn resources away from the fraud investigations.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. You mentioned they're veteran prosecutors - been around a while. What's significant about their decision?

SEPIC: Well, it's a loss of big talent. The attorneys spent their careers with the Justice Department and prosecuted many major cases. One of them is Melinda Williams, an assistant U.S. attorney who led the criminal division here. Another is Joe Thompson. He's been key in the government's prosecution of fraud, particularly the infamous Feeding Our Future case. Thompson charged 78 people with stealing around $300 million from federal child nutrition programs during the pandemic. Fifty-eight have been convicted. Investigators also uncovered massive Medicaid fraud. Last month, Thompson estimated that around $9 billion may have been stolen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOE THOMPSON: Taxpayers deserve to know the truth of the fraud. The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated.

SEPIC: The convicted food fraud ring leader is white, but nearly all of the other defendants are Somali American. Even though the majority are U.S. citizens, President Trump is using the fraud as a pretext for his immigration crackdown.

MARTÍNEZ: I would imagine leaders in Minnesota have a lot to say about these resignations.

SEPIC: Yeah, they do. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, is calling the prosecutors heroes. In a statement, he adds, quote, ""the people pushing to prosecute Renee's widow are monsters."" And U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democrat and a former prosecutor herself, says DOJ is politicizing the investigation into Good's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

AMY KLOBUCHAR: The first way they did it was cutting out the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That was such a bad sign that there was more bad to come because our Minnesota bureau has seasoned professionals. They've always worked together, and they cut them out.

MARTÍNEZ: What about the Justice Department, Matt? What are they saying?

SEPIC: Assistant Attorney General Todd Blanche says in a short statement, quote, ""there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation."" The DOJ tells me ICE is running its own investigation that's parallel to, quote, ""any FBI investigation."" But the same source, not authorized to speak on the record, calls that a lie and says ICE is not investigating the shooting.

MARTÍNEZ: That's Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public Radio. Thanks.

SEPIC: You're welcome.

“ALL THEY DO IS BREED CRIME AND VIOLENCE! If States want them, they will have to pay for them! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” he added.

The post follows his Tuesday speech at the Detroit Economic Club when he said sanctuary cities “do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.”

Sanctuary jurisdictions often limit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Some also provide social benefits to immigrants lacking legal status.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws. The list of states included California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

She urged them to comply with the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts or lose funding, citing an executive order signed by Trump in April.

The order directs Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”

The latest move comes after a federal judge ruled the executive order, which would have paused funding for more than 30 sanctuary cities, was likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge William Orrick, who was appointed by former President Obama, extended his preliminary injunction in August after the administration did little to object to the original order.

Orrick also barred officials from imposing conditions on grant programs that provide funding “for a variety of critical needs.”

Still, the Department of Homeland Security ramped up pressure by publicly listing more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including cities, counties and states, arguing they put American lives at risk by obstructing immigration enforcement.

The president’s crackdown on illegal immigration has also sparked protests across the U.S. Most recently, the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week and another shooting by Border Patrol agents in Portland, Ore., have fanned the flames.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26013662920667_5952cf-e1768333619342.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:04.982926

Federal agents and police cleared the Square to facilitate Trump’s desire for a photo opportunity at St. John’s Church.
In a moment where the focus should be on de-escalating tension between federal agents and communities, masks are making it worse.","Protect and serve. That’s supposed to be the job.

What could be further from that than masked agents roaming American streets in packs, refusing to identify themselves, and terrorizing—there is no other word for it at this point—American citizens?

Early on, the excuse for wearing masks was that it was necessary to protect the agents. From what? There were reports that they were being doxxed, which no one in law enforcement likes to deal with. But they’re the ones assaulting and killing people, which is far more problematic. Back in July, the Acting Director of ICE, Todd Lyons, said that he did not encourage agents to use masks but would continue to let them wear them in the field “if that’s a tool they need to keep them and their families safe.” Now masks and gaiters are emblematic of ICE agents and their colleagues from CBP (Customs and Border Protection) doing immigration work in places like Minneapolis.

You don’t routinely see the FBI or U.S. Marshals out doing their jobs with masks on. There is literally no legitimate reason for ICE and Customs Border Patrol (CBP) to continue to operate this way during immigration “enforcement actions,” especially in light of the recent history of documented abuses. Anonymity accelerates that kind of behavior. It tells the agents they aren’t accountable for violating people’s civil rights.

The overwhelming majority of federal law enforcement agents I worked with during my 25-year career at DOJ were men and women who were committed to following the law themselves while protecting their communities and prosecuting crimes. They believed citizens had constitutional rights. There’s no reason for the sudden change, a world where an agent shoots and kills a woman for no good reason, except that the current leadership in the White House and at DHS is willing to tolerate, if not encourage, what we’re now seeing. There are people ripped out of their cars, homes entered without a judicial warrant, agents who treat American citizens like they have no rights. This administration dishonors the service of the federal agents who spent their careers committed to constitutional policing.

Law enforcement officers are trained to de-escalate tense situations. Instead, we’re watching ICE agents act like the accelerant to a smoldering fire. The administration’s take on the failure of agents to behave like the good guys they’re supposed to be isn’t to put a stop to it. Instead, they revel in the Gestapo-like images of doors being busted down, school kids being knocked to the ground, and peaceful protesters being hit with pepper spray. So, it’s up to someone else to stop it.

The state of training at ICE is unclear, as new agents are rapidly hired and deployed. But what we’re seeing is troubling.

Some states have tried passing laws to prohibit masking.

California passed SB 627 (the “No Secret Police Act”) in late 2025, restricting law enforcement, including federal agents, from using extreme face coverings like ski masks during operations, effective Jan 1, 2026. There are logical exemptions to protect officer safety and the identity of undercover operatives. California Governor Gavin Newsom said at the time, “This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.”

The language of the bill explains that “facial coverings limit the visibility of facial expressions, which are essential components of nonverbal communication. In high-stress or emotionally charged interactions, the inability to read an officer’s expression may lead to misinterpretation of tone or intent, increasing the risk of conflict escalation” and that “the visibility of an officer’s face is vital for promoting transparency, facilitating communication, and building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.” It also points out that “when officers are not readily identifiable, it increases the risk of impersonation by unauthorized individuals, which further undermines public trust, endangers public safety, and hinders legitimate law enforcement operations.”

But the Constitution protects federal supremacy, and the predictable challenge to the law from DOJ ensued in November 2025, arguing that the measure infringes on federal authority and endangers agent safety in an environment of accelerating threats made against them. California agreed it would not enforce the law until a judge had the opportunity to rule on the federal government’s request for a preliminary injunction. The concession was viewed as “a tactical decision by the state, speeding the court proceedings toward a conclusion while avoiding a temporary restraining order that likely would have prevented the law from taking effect in the meantime.” A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to take place this week.

Other states and localities are working with similar measures, including Denver, New Jersey, and New York. Congress could get into the act, too, avoiding the Supremacy Clause issue. California Representative Eric Swalwell has suggested it could be possible, for instance, to deny agents who are inappropriately masked the benefits of qualified immunity if they engage in misconduct. Greg Sargent detailed his conversation with Swalwell in a series of tweets. Other Democratic representatives have suggested on social media that they, too, would support such a move, but it remains to be seen whether it can gain any traction with Republicans.

Law enforcement can adapt to measures that prohibit masking except when necessary (as in SWAT operations or for undercover agents). Although federal law doesn’t contain any restrictions on wearing masks, in 2022, the Secret Service and the Park Police agreed to wear badges and identify themselves in public, as a result of the debacle in Lafayette Square during the first Trump administration, when rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash bangs were used on peaceful protestors. Federal agents and police cleared the Square to facilitate Trump’s desire for a photo opportunity at St. John’s Church.

Whether or not the California law passes constitutional muster, its rationale is strong. In a moment where the focus should be on de-escalating tension between federal agents and communities, masks are making it worse. It would be a simple measure and a show of good faith toward communities like Minneapolis to end their use. That the administration won’t take even that simple step tells you all you need to know about where this is headed.

Three of the four Oglala Sioux Tribe members who were arrested in Minneapolis on Friday have been transferred to an ICE facility at Fort Snelling, President Frank Star Comes Out said in a statement released with a memorandum sent to federal immigration authorities.

“The Oglala Sioux Tribe's memorandum makes clear that ‘tribal citizens are not aliens’ and are ‘categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,’” Star Comes Out said. “Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty.”

Details about the circumstances that led to their detention were unclear.

In the memorandum sent to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Star Comes Out said the when tribal nation reached out to the agency it was provided with only the first names of the men. Homeland Security refused to release more information, unless the tribe “entered into an immigration agreement with ICE.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

Star Comes Out said the tribe has no plans enter an agreement with ICE.

In a post to his Facebook page, Star Comes Out said that the four detained tribal members are experiencing homelessness and living under a bridge in Minneapolis. One of the members was released from detention.

In the press release, he demanded information on the status of the three men in detention, the release of all tribal citizens in ICE custody and a meeting between the tribe and the government.

Fort Snelling has a troubling history for Indigenous people. It was the first military outpost in the area, and Dakota people were held prisoner there during the Dakota War of 1862, an armed conflict between the U.S. and Native Americans, said Nick Estes, an associate professor in American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.

“It has this really notorious anti-Indigenous, specifically anti-Dakota, history,” Estes said. “It’s kind of like a continuation on the monopoly of violence from the military outpost to the ICE facility.”

It's not the first time in recent months that ICE agents have detained tribal members.

Last year, elected leaders in the Navajo Nation said that tribal citizens in Arizona and New Mexico reported being stopped and detained by ICE officers. In November, a member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona who had been arrested in Iowa was mistakenly scheduled to be deported before the error was caught and she was released.

That same month, Elaine Miles, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon and an actress known for her roles in “Northern Exposure” and “The Last of Us,” said she was stopped by ICE officers in Washington state who told her that her tribal ID looked fake.

Indigenous rights groups as well as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians have established places in Minneapolis where tribal citizens can apply for tribal ID cards, in case they are approached by ICE and need to provide identification.

“I never thought that I’d have my tribal ID hanging around my neck, but I do,” said Mary LaGarde, executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Center. “So, it’s just important that they have proper identification on them and not to panic.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a75f3f9e-257a-4036-af1e-d3dd70607921/wirestory_29ac43de85569b80bd64875388097ab6_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-14 12:58:25.362892

Hours after the shooting, a crowd of thousands gathered around the site to remember Good and protest the ICE action that took her life. Thousands more have gathered at other events since then, including an ""ICE out of Minnesota"" march hosted by the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee on Jan. 10.

Anne Attea, a longtime parishioner at Church of the Ascension in North Minneapolis, attended a ""Vigil of Hope"" at the state capitol Jan. 9. She said many in the Spanish-speaking immigrant community at her parish experienced what she described as an ""Advent of darkness"" as the ICE crackdown in the city began. Both documented and undocumented immigrants have been living in fear, she said, because ICE agents have been engaged in aggressive racial and ethnic profiling.

""We as a Catholic body should become more forceful in denouncing hate, evil, racism and lack of respect for human dignity,"" said Attea, who is program minister in the Center for Spirituality & Social Justice at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.

About 400 people prayed Jan. 13 outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where people are being detained by ICE. Participants held signs denouncing ICE and remembering Good.

""I think solidarity in times like this is so important,"" said Aaron Sinner, a parishioner at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in St. Paul. ""ICE has a pretty clear mandate, and it's a pretty narrow mandate by law. It's scary to see the wanton disregard for what their scope of duty is and the reckless abandon with which they are exceeding their mandate and putting lives at risk.""

Marty Roers, of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Justice Office in St. Paul, belongs to an interfaith group that has been showing up to pray at the federal immigration detention facility every month for 12 years. On Jan. 13 he said he was there ""standing up for a better way to work with the issues and struggles of immigration.""

The ICE agents in the Minneapolis area in recent weeks wearing black head coverings have reminded Houa Her, a parishioner at Presentation of Mary Parish in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood, of the Communist military forces that came to his village in Laos. They questioned people about their activities and loyalties and took some away, never to return, he said.

People were living in fear, he told The National Catholic Reporter. Her was 12 years old at the time. He eventually came to the U.S. with his brother from a refugee camp in Thailand and has been a U.S. citizen since 1995.

Currently in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, ICE agents have not limited their actions to city streets. They have also entered people's homes and, in doing so, have created a sense of fear that is disrupting family life, according to a Latino parish ministry worker in the archdiocese who did not want her name to be used out of safety concerns. She described a feeling of great desolation in the community.

""These (people) are not threats to our community,"" said Fr. Dale Korogi, pastor of Ascension Church, in remarks about immigrants at an interfaith press conference in Minneapolis Jan. 8. ""These are really good people!"" The priest said that families were afraid to leave their homes. They're not being inconvenienced by ICE, he said, they're being harassed, terrorized and traumatized by ICE. In the memory of Renee Good and in the name of God, Karogi called for an end to this cruelty.

Korogi said Mass attendance among Spanish-speakers at Ascension is down about 80%. Fear of leaving home has also contributed to an over 60% drop in attendance numbers at the Sunday afternoon Spanish-language Mass at Assumption Catholic Church in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, another parish with a large Spanish-speaking immigrant congregation. The same story is playing out at other parishes in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis since ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge"" began in December.

""Currently in Minneapolis we see so much inhumanity,"" said one South Minneapolis pastor in his weekend homily. ""Whatever our nationality or race, our true citizenship is in the Kingdom of God. Let's live that way,"" said the priest who didn't want to be identified out of concern for his parishioners' safety.

""When it comes to ICE operations, I understand they are doing their job,"" said Digna Yaurincela, a parishioner at St. Richards Catholic Church in Richfield, ""but they're focusing on the wrong people.""

Yaurincela, who is a U.S. citizen, related several accounts of people being picked up by ICE agents. They included a 17-year old who was picked up at the Richfield Target store, then released 3 miles away at the Bloomington Walmart after producing a passport to establish his U.S. citizenship. She worries her own children might be picked up based simply on how they look.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud.
After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

“Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:08.731906

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.
Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.
Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.
“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) – The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-shooting-minneapolis-01-07-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:59:05.435992

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars.
But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.
“Because of what happened to Renee, I felt like we had nothing to lose anymore,” said Ms. Lopez, who has joined patrols that blow whistles and set off their own car alarms if they see ICE agents.
“When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not.","It began in Los Angeles, in Signal chats and strategy sessions on Zoom. Last year, as immigration raids proliferated throughout the city, Latino activists and neighbors began organizing a response, monitoring for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents along sidewalks and in Home Depot parking lots and texting their networks when they spotted an arrest underway.

By late summer, activists in Chicago were trained and ready. Before the Trump administration had announced a crackdown called Operation Midway Blitz, immigrant rights organizations had handed out orange whistles for volunteers to use as a public warning system, formed “rapid-response” groups and advised people to report sightings of ICE agents and memorize their own legal rights. Chicagoans, even many without formal ties to protest groups, showed defiance against ICE with “Hands Off Chicago” signs adorned with the city’s beloved starred-and-striped flag, placed prominently in windows of restaurants and bungalows.

And in recent weeks in Minneapolis, the latest focus for a Trump administration surge of immigration enforcement, a loose but growing network of neighborhood volunteers has shown up near reported arrests, yelling at agents and recording them on iPhone cameras. Some gathered near hotels where agents were believed to be staying, pounding drums and making noise.

President Trump’s sweeping effort to tamp down illegal immigration, using masked federal agents who film their interactions with cellphones and often question American citizens about their legal status, has set off a surge in confrontational activism fueled by both large liberal advocacy groups and hyperlocal neighborhood networks.

Participants say they have been propelled into action with two goals in mind: an urge to protect their neighbors, many of whom are in the country without authorization but have no criminal backgrounds, and also to push back against what they see as a violent and overreaching federal government.

“It’s a lot of people who wouldn’t normally involve themselves in politics, but at the same time don’t like what’s happening in their community,” said Sandra Trevino, a Chicago resident who works in sales but spends her weekends patrolling the city for immigration agents and texting her networks with updates.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, has called the actions of such activists dangerous, part of “a coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement.”

In Minnesota, where an ICE agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, last week, tensions have mounted since an immigration crackdown began there in early December. Some Minnesota residents have thrown icy snowballs or other objects at agents, called them Nazis and fascists and trailed them in their cars, honking their horns, a practice frequently used in Chicago last year.

“Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who obstructs or assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the department said in a statement on Tuesday.

It is not yet clear how deeply the Goods were connected to anti-ICE efforts in Minneapolis. Becca Good was wearing an orange whistle around her neck as she confronted federal agents while filming them with her cellphone, videos show, moments before Renee Good was fatally shot in her car.

In a statement issued to Minnesota Public Radio, Becca Good suggested that the two women had taken part in a protest on the day of the shooting, but their involvement beyond that day is unknown.

“On Wednesday, Jan. 7, we stopped to support our neighbors,” Becca Good said. “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Anti-ICE tactics by volunteers and so-called patrollers who track and follow immigration agents in caravans have only intensified in the Twin Cities in the last week, despite Ms. Good’s death, activists and officials said in interviews.

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars. But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.

Ashley Lopez, who works in education and lives in the city of West St. Paul, has become active in anti-ICE neighborhood groups only in the week since Ms. Good’s death.

“Because of what happened to Renee, I felt like we had nothing to lose anymore,” said Ms. Lopez, who has joined patrols that blow whistles and set off their own car alarms if they see ICE agents. “Why should she be the only one who put herself in danger?”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, said that before the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, her organization received dozens of emails a day from people asking how they could get involved. That has now grown to hundreds daily.

“People are still showing up and defending their community despite seeing such a violent act,” she said. “They’re calling for justice, even though there is a chance they could be hurt in the process.”

Patrollers in Chicago said this week that they were still roaming around the city looking for ICE agents. But many of their Signal chats and Facebook groups have gone quiet, a sign that the Trump administration’s focus has shifted squarely to Minneapolis — at least for now.

That feels far different from how it did in Chicago last fall, when masked federal agents walked down the Magnificent Mile downtown, startling residents and tourists. As residents began protesting their presence in neighborhoods, agents used aggressive methods to disperse crowds, releasing tear gas and pepper spray along blocks around the city.

“In a way, it really galvanized local support against them everywhere they went,” said Brandon Lee, a coordinator for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not. You’re going to get tear-gassed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 10:58:37.074702

But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.
Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.
Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged.
“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said.","“The broader Hispanic community certainly feels let down,” said Javier Palomarez, the organization’s president and CEO. “It would be different if immigration and the economy had not been principal talking points for [Trump]. On both fronts, we didn’t get what we thought we were going to get.”

The combination of ongoing economic uncertainty and stubbornly high prices driven by Trump’s tariffs — coupled with the economic impact of the Trump administration’s ongoing raids in immigrant-heavy communities — makes the situation increasingly dire for some Hispanic business owners.

Trump and his allies argue that they’re just cleaning up the mess left by the previous president.

“Republicans are putting in the work to fix the Bidenflation mess we inherited. From lowering inflation to creating a housing plan, President Trump is fighting for the working families Democrats left behind,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Monica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told POLITICO about a South Phoenix restaurant hit hard by tariffs and labor shortages. Then, a series of ICE raids in the parking lot in front of the restaurant caused customers and workers to stop showing up and forced the owners to shut it down for several days. She predicted this kind of situation will blow back on Republicans in the next election.

“We certainly do sense that our members — our clients in Arizona and across the country — feel a sense of betrayal by this administration, given its excessive overreach,” Villalobos said. “Now that we’ve had a taste of [the Trump administration], I think you’re going to see a big shift [in the vote].”

In 2024, Trump won 48 percent of self-described Hispanic or Latino voters, the highest mark for a Republican presidential candidate in at least a half-century, driven largely by economic anxiety. But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.

In a November POLITICO Poll, a plurality — 48 percent — of Hispanic respondents said the cost of living in the U.S. is “the worst I can ever remember it being,” and a majority (67 percent) said responsibility lies with the president to fix it.

According to a November Pew Research poll, about two-thirds (68 percent) of U.S. Hispanics say their situation today is worse than it was a year ago, and just nine percent say it is better; 65 percent of Latinos disagree with this administration’s approach to immigration, and a majority (52 percent) said they worried they, a family member or a close friend could be deported, a ten-point increase since March.

Trump’s net favorability rating among Hispanics is now at 28 percent, per a recent The Economist/YouGov poll, 13 points lower than it was in February of last year.

“Small business owners are becoming a swing constituency, when you think about the midterms coming up,” said Tayde Aburto, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of E-Commerce. “And not because their values have changed—it’s just because their costs did.”

Latino voters have swung hard back toward Democrats in recent elections as well. In Passaic County, New Jersey, Latinos voted narrowly for Trump in 2024 but in November backed Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill by double digits. And in Miami, where over 70 percent of residents are Hispanic, a Democratic mayor was elected last month for the first time in 28 years last month.

Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.

“[Trump’s] agenda literally does little to nothing to help Hispanic families,” Ulvert said. “Worse, it preys on Hispanic families. And what we heard on the campaign trail most pointedly is the old adage: is my life better today than it was yesterday under new leaders? And resoundingly, not only verbally, but through the ballot box throughout the year, Hispanic families are saying, ‘no, my life is actually worse.’”

Joe Vichot, the Republican Party chair in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, said he knows many Hispanic Republicans in Allentown who are supportive of curbing illegal immigration and fighting crime. “But there’s also stories of people who have been here for 10 years or more with their family, but they’ve never been legal, that are now caught up into the [deportation] system,” he said.

“There should be a way to find some type of common ground where that won’t happen.”

The White House has tried to ease the ailing economic sentiment by sending Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the road, delivering a series of stump speeches on affordability in working-class areas, including Vance’s Dec. 16 stop in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which includes the Hispanic-majority city of Allentown. They insist the economy deserves an “A+++” grade, and are now buoyed by a December consumer price index report released Tuesday that showed inflation rising at a slower pace than expected.

“Joe Biden gave us a colossal catastrophe, but my administration has rapidly and very decisively ended that,” Trump said during a speech in Detroit Tuesday. “We have quickly achieved the exact opposite of stagflation — almost no inflation and super high growth.”

But cooling inflation rates just mean prices aren’t rising as fast as they had been — prices still remain much higher on many goods than they had been in recent years. And improving macroeconomic trends are not yet being felt by consumers, said Massey Villarreal, a business executive in Houston.

“I’m like most Americans. I hear the inflation number and I don’t translate it to my going to the grocery store, when I look at the cost of hamburger meat,” said Villarreal, a former chair of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.

Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged. “While we were talking about GDP and unemployment and jobs growth rates, people were worried about the rent and the price of gas and the price of eggs. And we’ve got kind of the same thing here,” he said.

In Chicago, where some of the most-publicized immigration enforcement occurred last year, Hispanic-run businesses have been hit hard. Sam Sanchez, CEO of Third Coast Hospitality, said 2025 was the hardest period for business of his four decades in restauranteering, aside from the COVID pandemic.

“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said. “Everything’s just starting to fall apart.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F11%2F74%2F1b0726414d549e42ba7e117b7668%2F201101-trump-az-ap-773.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:52.340179

Good was partially blocking a street with her SUV on Wednesday as ICE agents operated in the area.
An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV.
Good’s wife, Becca Good, said in a statement last week that the couple had “stopped to support our neighbors,” adding, “We had whistles.
Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document.","The woman killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week served on the board of her son’s school, which linked to documents encouraging parents to monitor ICE and directing them to training.

The documents shed new light on Renee Good’s connection to efforts to monitor and potentially disrupt ICE operations – an association that federal officials have made clear is at the center of their review into the deadly incident that occurred as she partially blocked ICE agents in the street with her SUV.

But four legal experts who reviewed the documents for CNN said they largely describe nonviolent civil disobedience tactics practiced at American protests for generations – far from the sinister depiction of extremism and domestic terrorism portrayed by Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance.

“There’s nothing in there that suggests attacking ICE agents or engaging in any other form of physical harm or property damage,” said Timothy Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School who wrote a book on protest law. “This is authoritarianism 101 where you blame the dissenters and the activists for causing their own death.”

At least six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis resigned Tuesday over pressure from the Trump administration to focus their probe on the actions of Good and those around her, according to a person briefed on the matter.

One of the documents linked by the school appears to be a message to parents dated December 16 that begins, “Thank you to families who have been on ICE watch, helping to protect their neighbors.”

The note links to a separate training document with guides on getting whistles to alert neighbors to ICE raids and contact information for a school parent offering “noncooperation training.”

“ICE are untrained bullies looking for easy targets. Neighbors showing up have saved lives,” that training document reads.

Another guide linked to in the training document stresses nonviolent responses to ICE agents, while also encouraging a refusal to “comply with demands, requests, and orders.” It suggests “creative tactics,” noting that “Crowds, props, traffic, and noise can make detentions difficult, sometimes ICE vehicles can’t move (‘whoops!’).” It does not specifically suggest blocking operations with a vehicle.

The December 16 note, titled “School Report,” was an item on the school board’s meeting on that date, an agenda shows – a meeting that Good attended as one of three parents on the board of the Southside Family Charter School.

Records don’t indicate that the board voted on the message. It’s unclear whether it was more widely shared with families at Southside, a small charter school with a long history of progressive activism. Neither the school nor other board members who served with Good responded to messages from CNN.

Two sources familiar with the school said the “School Report” message appeared similar to past newsletters shared with parents, but neither was on the email list at the time to confirm if it was sent out.

The “School Report” message was uploaded to the school’s public Google Drive about two weeks into the federal operation ramping up immigration enforcement actions in the Minneapolis area, which federal officials had launched to target the region’s Somali community.

Good was partially blocking a street with her SUV on Wednesday as ICE agents operated in the area. An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV. Videos of the deadly interaction show that Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it’s unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.

Federal officials have claimed without providing evidence that Good was engaging in “domestic terrorism” and had been “stalking agents all day long,” while some state and local lawmakers have decried that rhetoric as false and incendiary.

Good’s family members have said that she and her wife had come from dropping off their son earlier that morning at Southside, about a mile and a half from where Good was shot.

Good’s wife, Becca Good, said in a statement last week that the couple had “stopped to support our neighbors,” adding, “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Legal experts who spoke to CNN said it was troubling that federal officials appeared to be focusing on low-level violations by protesters instead of the shooting of Good itself.

Gregory Magarian, a professor and First Amendment expert at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said that the noncooperation tactics described in the guide could potentially violate some laws depending on the context of the situation. But overall, he said, the document endorsed standard nonviolent protest actions that don’t merit an investigation by federal law enforcement.

“If the FBI has an inkling of investigating the protest organizers, it should read that and say, ‘OK, there’s not a fruitful path of inquiry here. Nothing about that raises red flags, nothing about that raises alarms, we should get back to doing our job,’” Magarian said. The idea that the agency would investigate protesters instead of the use of deadly force is “appalling and really dangerous,” he added.

Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, added that attempts to investigate activists and protesters appear to have “the goal of trying to justify the officer’s conduct.”

Good joined the Southside school board in August 2025, a few months after she moved to Minneapolis with her wife and six-year-old son, according to board meeting notes. Her leadership role at the school has not been previously reported.

Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document. It offers programming like student trips to the South to study the history of the Civil Rights Movement and “hands-on experience planting and harvesting” as part of a curriculum on environmental issues.

“The heart of the school’s mission, social justice education, is woven into every subject and grade level,” an annual report read. “By addressing social justice issues at an early age, the school encourages children to see themselves as citizen activists who can change the world and also helps children avoid internalizing the effects of discrimination.”

The documents show that Good was deeply involved with the school community, even as a relatively recent arrival. Good regularly attended board meetings, with records of one meeting noting that “Renee had some questions about the future growth of the school.”

The same school bulletin that encouraged activism to monitor ICE last month also shared how Good and her wife had “brought pots for us to paint” to a school event: “We will sell them at our plant sale in the spring. They look beautiful!”

Rashad Rich, a former physical education teacher at Southside who taught Good’s son in his class, said the couple were familiar faces at the school.

When they dropped off their son, he “would say goodbye several times before they could leave, and then they would drive around the front of the school so they had a window where he could see them,” Rich told CNN. “They’d wave. They were just awesome parents.”

In the wake of Good’s shooting, Rich said, teachers and staff members at the school have had their names and addresses posted on social media.

“They’re getting threats,” he said. “It’s a scary thing right now.”

Donald Trump’s administration said Tuesday it will end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Somalia, the latest move in the president’s mass deportation agenda.

The move affects hundreds of people who are a small subset of immigrants living in the United States with TPS protections. It comes during Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where many native Somalis live and where street protests have intensified since a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed a U.S citizen who was demonstrating against federal presence in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that affected Somalis must leave the U.S. by March 17, when existing protections, last extended by then-President Joe Biden, will expire.

“Temporary means temporary,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, adding that the decision puts “Americans first.”

The Congressional Research Service last spring said the Somali TPS population was 705 out of nearly 1.3 million TPS immigrants. Trump has ended protections across multiple countries in his second presidency.

Homeland Security secretary says conditions in Somalia have changed

Noem insisted circumstances in Somalia “have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which advocates for fair treatment of Muslims in the U.S., criticized the latest rollback as a “bigoted attack” that will send some Somalis back to a war-torn, unstable nation.

“This decision does not reflect changed conditions in Somalia,” CAIR said in a statement released jointly with its Minnesota chapter. “By dismantling protections for one of the most vulnerable Black and Muslim communities, this decision exposes an agenda rooted in exclusion, not public safety.”

Located in the horn of Africa, Somalia is one of the world’s poorest nations and has for decades been beset by chronic strife exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. Al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab controls parts of the country and has carried out truck bombings and other assaults in the capital, Mogadishu, in recent years that killed dozens of people.

Congress established the Temporary Protected Status program in 1990 to help foreign nationals who’ve fled unstable, threatening conditions in their home countries and are living in the U.S. It allows the executive branch to designate a country, generally in 18-month increments, for the protected status. Citizens of that country who are already in the U.S. and qualify for protection can apply with Homeland Security for the designation.

If approved, recipients can legally work and are protected from deportation but there is no pathway to a green card or U.S. citizenship and they are reliant on the government renewing the TPS designation every few years.

Critics say that while these designations are supposed to be temporary, they are renewed so often that they essentially become permanent.

Somalia designation traces to the elder Bush’s administration

Somalia first received the designation under President George H.W. Bush amid a civil war in 1991. The status has been extended for decades, most recently by Biden in July 2024.

The 2025 congressional report stated that Somalis had received more than two dozen extensions because of perpetual “insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees.”

Trump has targeted Somali immigrants with racist rhetoric and accused those in Minneapolis of massively defrauding federal programs, charges he renewed again Tuesday speaking in Michigan. He promised, without a clear legal basis, to “revoke the citizenship of any naturalized immigrant from Somalia, or anywhere else who was convicted of defrauding our citizens.”

In December, Trump said he did not want Somalis in the U.S. at all, saying they “come from hell” and “contribute nothing.” He made no distinction between citizens and non-citizens or offered any opinion on immigration status.

Temporary status widened during Joe Biden’s presidency

Biden’s administration broadly expanded the number of people covered by Temporary Protected Status but the Trump administration has steadily sought to strip protections away from various nationalities including 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians. The actions have prompted multiple court challenges but the U.S. Supreme Court has twice issued emergency rulings, last May and again in October, that allowed the Venezuelan revocations to continue as court cases proceed.

It’s not immediately clear how quickly those Somalis covered by TPS could be removed from the country once their protections expire. Most attempts by the administration to end a TPS designation have ended up in the courts. And people covered by TPS can also apply for asylum or other immigration avenues to stay in the U.S., although the Trump administration has made those options more difficult as well for Somalis as well as other nationalities.

Any investigation runs parallel to the FBI’s investigation into the shooting, a Justice Department official said.
Officials in Minnesota have criticized federal authorities for barring the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the investigation.
The Trump administration cited the fraud investigation when it dispatched ICE officers to Minnesota.","At least three prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a person familiar with the resignations told NBC News on Tuesday.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment by NBC News.

The attorneys had felt pressure from Justice Department leadership, both in Minneapolis and in Washington, to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thompson was a “principled public servant” who spent more than a decade in law enforcement in the state.

“This is a huge loss for our state,” Walz said of the resignations. “This is the latest sign that President Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the Department of Justice.”

Good was in the driver’s seat of an SUV in a residential part of Minneapolis last week when she was killed.

Video from eyewitnesses shows officers telling Good to get out of her car before she begins driving away. Gunshots can be heard, and the SUV slams into a parked vehicle. Video obtained by NBC News that appears to have been recorded by Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good, captured Good and her wife talking to an officer in the moments before he opened fire.

In the video, Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

Ross shouts what sounds like “whoa” and fires, as multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face.

Ross’ phone levels out and captures the SUV accelerating down the street. A male voice said, “f-----g bitch” moments before Good’s car crashes.

The FBI is investigating. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement Tuesday there was ""currently no basis"" for an investigation by the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

ICE’s Office of Public Responsibility is conducting its own internal investigation, Blanche said, as is protocol for the agency after every officer-involved shooting. Any investigation runs parallel to the FBI’s investigation into the shooting, a Justice Department official said.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Good, an award-winning poet, “weaponized” her vehicle against the ICE officer who fatally shot her in self-defense.

Local and state officials have disputed that claim, saying Good, 37, was only trying to leave the scene.

Officials in Minnesota have criticized federal authorities for barring the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the investigation. Asked about the decision last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused state investigators of allowing people to harass and incite violence against federal officers.

The New York Times first reported the resignations.

Thompson, one of the prosecutors who resigned, oversaw a yearslong investigation that resulted in dozens of charges against people accused of defrauding millions of dollars in government funds. The Trump administration cited the fraud investigation when it dispatched ICE officers to Minnesota.

The statement from the governor’s office said Thompson “has worked extensively with state regulators and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to bring federal prosecutions against fraud involving public programs. His work supported oversight, enforcement, and program integrity.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a statement about the resignations, “The legitimacy of the justice system depends on institutions — not rhetoric.”

“Joe Thompson is an institution within law enforcement, directly responsible for building and prosecuting the fraud cases now being cited to justify this moment,” he said, referring to allegations of fraud at child care facilities.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making those cases, it signals that this isn’t about prosecuting fraud,” O’Hara said in the statement.

Last week, the Trump administration deployed more than 2,000 officers and agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations to Minneapolis after a right-wing influencer accused several Somali-run day care facilities of fraud.

State officials who investigated the allegations said they found no evidence to back up the claims.

Within the main Justice Department in Washington, at least six leaders at the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division were taking early retirement, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News. A third person familiar with the departures said that they were planned before the Minnesota shooting.

The division, which is tasked in part with investigating possible abuse by law enforcement, has lost hundreds of attorneys since President Donald Trump returned to office. MS NOW first reported on the departures.

Kristen Clarke, the former head of the division under President Joe Biden, said the departures would have a major impact.

“The hollowing out of the Civil Rights Division’s national expertise hurts every American,” Clarke said. “Unparalleled expertise and commitment to impartiality is precisely what’s needed in this moment.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260113-minneapolis-ice-car-ew-312p-7dd794.jpg",N,,2026-01-14 10:58:52.002625

Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Shaheen, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Durbin, Chairman Cotton, and Vice Chairman Warner:

We write to urge you to convene immediate public oversight hearings covering President Donald Trump’s January 3, 2026 military operation in Venezuela, which Congress did not authorize. The American people deserve clarity as to why the President put our service members in harm’s way and what his plan is in Venezuela moving forward.

Nicolás Maduro was an illegitimate, brutal leader who lost, and then stole, the country’s 2024 elections. There is also no doubt as to the bravery and skill of the U.S military, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel who contributed to this operation. However, we have seen no evidence justifying the administration’s initial decision to take military action to oust Maduro – particularly without Congressional authorization or even Congressional notification.

Equally important, with Maduro now in U.S. custody, the administration has provided Congress absolutely no coherent justification for keeping 15,000 U.S. forces and dozens of U.S. military assets in the region. Congress must decide whether we should permit this administration to maintain this military build-up, and assess the broader national security implications of the President’s military intervention in Venezuela.

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

1. What are U.S. interests in Venezuela and how do they justify the military actions that President Trump ordered without Congressional authorization? President Trump mentioned oil roughly 20 times in his January 3 press conference. Meanwhile, other senior administration officials justified U.S. actions as necessary to counter illicit narcotics, assert U.S. influence as a “great power” in the Western Hemisphere, access Venezuela’s vast natural resource wealth, and prevent illegal immigration. The American people deserve to understand why the President put our military in harm’s way and may do so again.

2. Under what legal authority did the administration carry out the January 3 operation? The scope of the operation, involving hundreds of U.S. military personnel and planes, is not consistent with a law enforcement operation.

3. How many people were killed in the January 3 operation, and what country or countries were they from? Reports suggest that 32 Cubans may have been killed.

4. With Maduro in U.S. custody, why have we not redeployed our military personnel to other priority missions from which they were distracted? Every member of Congress should be asking why this administration still has thousands of U.S. personnel and dozens of U.S. assets deployed off the coast of Venezuela, and be wary of the openended nature of this mission.

5. Did the administration misrepresent intelligence to justify its military operation? In July 2025, the Department of the Treasury designated Cartel de los Soles as a “terrorist organization” and in November 2025 the State Department followed suit, although the administration never provided Congress intelligence to justify this designation. Yet on January 3, 2026, the Department of Justice issued a revised indictment against Maduro, which no longer claims that Cartel de los Soles is an organized entity that threatens Americans. This reversal calls into question the legal and intelligence framework that the Trump administration repeatedly cited to justify Congressionally unauthorized military operations in the region since September 2025.

6. What diplomacy did President Trump authorize prior to invading Venezuela? U.S. officials and the Maduro regime reportedly held detailed negotiations, including at least one phone conversation between President Trump and Maduro. Congress needs to better understand the substance of those negotiations and why they did not produce a peaceful outcome.

7. When did President Trump authorize U.S. military action to capture Maduro? In recent months, officials from some U.S. departments and agencies may have failed to fulfill their statutory obligations to keep Congress currently and fully informed of their agencies’ activities planning for regime change in Venezuela

8. Why did the Trump administration consult privately with oil companies “before and after” the operation, as the President put it – but not with Congress?

There is no reason for the President to brief corporate interests ahead or instead of the American people’s elected representatives regarding a U.S. military operation in a foreign country. While President Trump and Secretary Rubio claimed that they could not brief Congress for fear of potential leaks, this justification rings hollow when President Trump himself and members of his cabinet have disclosed sensitive, apparently classified information to the public, to journalists in Signal chats, and even U.S. adversaries. Moreover, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the President to consult Congress “in every possible instance” before sending troops into war, unless the action is in response to an imminent threat facing American citizens or servicemembers – which was not true regarding Venezuela.

9. What does President Trump mean when he says he is prepared to deploy “boots on the ground” in Venezuela? Venezuela’s legitimate leadership did not invite the U.S. military to occupy its territory, and Congress has not authorized a military occupation.

10. What is the Trump administration’s plan to “run” Venezuela, as the President put it, and does that plan include a timeline for transitioning to Venezuela’s democratically elected government? President Trump stated on January 3: “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” However, other administration officials have suggested there will not be a transition and that U.S. policy is to coerce what remains of the Maduro regime to undertake unspecified actions in line with U.S. interests.

11. What factors led the Trump administration to abandon the bipartisan U.S. policy of recognizing Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate democratically elected leader of Venezuela? President Trump suggested that the opposition lacks support, but González overwhelmingly won the 2024 elections.

12. Did the Trump administration cut a deal with elements of interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her associates prior to the January 3 military operation, and what specific demands have we made of Rodríguez? The administration must publicly disclose the terms of any arrangement, as well as what the administration intends to do should Rodríguez not comply with any U.S. demands.

13. What intelligence led the Trump administration to conclude that Maduro’s security services will cooperate with any U.S. plan to “run” Venezuela and exploit its oil? The Venezuelan security services have a clear financial interest in maintaining the status quo. Congress must determine if the Trump administration plans to bribe illegitimate, corrupt, and repressive elements of the Maduro regime as part of the White House’s quest to control Venezuela’s oil.

14. What financial or other commitments has the Trump administration made to facilitate the expansion of U.S. oil companies’ footprint in Venezuela? On January 5, President Trump said that the United States may subsidize oil companies so that they can rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. Congress must determine if the President plans to make the American people foot the bill for private corporate interests in Venezuela.

15. Does the Trump administration plan to invade Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Greenland? President Trump has long asserted that Greenland, which is part of Denmark, should be a U.S. territory, implying willingness to take U.S. military action against a NATO ally. He similarly indicated a desire to pursue military action against Colombia and Mexico, longstanding U.S. counternarcotics and trade partners. Secretary Rubio also suggested that Cuba could be a future target of U.S. military action. Congress has not authorized any of these dangerous potential military operations.

The President’s recent actions in Venezuela risk implicating the United States in a corrupt bargain to govern a sovereign country alongside elements of an authoritarian regime, seemingly for the purpose of exploiting Venezuela’s oil. This is an unprecedented and dangerous break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. What the Trump administration does next in Venezuela – to say nothing of potential action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, and Mexico – will have serious implications for U.S. national security.

Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct oversight and reassert its role in future decisions regarding Venezuela. The American people expect that we will do our jobs on a bipartisan basis, and we encourage you to convene hearings on these questions and related issues without further delay.

Sincerely,

He did this in 2019, when a war powers resolution mandating that the U.S. military cease its participation in the war in Yemen was passed in both the Senate and the House.
A war powers resolution is an act of Congress that is based on a 1973 law of the same name.
The day after that meeting, the war powers resolution was blocked by two votes.
The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death.","President Trump seemed angry after the Senate voted last Thursday to pass a war powers resolution to the next stage, where lawmakers could approve the measure and seek to curb the president’s ability to wage war in Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Trump said that day that five Republican senators who supported bringing the measure to a vote — Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.), Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Todd Young (Ind.) — “should never be elected to office again.”

Why should he get so riled up about this, to the point where he could put his own party’s control of the Senate at risk in November? Even if this resolution were to pass both houses of Congress, he could veto it and ultimately be unrestrained. He did this in 2019, when a war powers resolution mandating that the U.S. military cease its participation in the war in Yemen was passed in both the Senate and the House. Many people think that such legislation therefore can’t make a difference.

But the president’s ire is telling. These political moves on the Hill can get results even before the resolution has a final vote, or if it is vetoed by the president.

The Trump administration made significant concessions before the 2019 resolution was approved by Congress, in an attempt to prevent it from passing. For instance, months before it was approved, the U.S. military stopped refueling Saudi warplanes in midair. These concessions de-escalated the war and saved tens of thousands of lives.

A war powers resolution is an act of Congress that is based on a 1973 law of the same name. That law spells out and reinforces the power that our Constitution has allocated to Congress, to decide when the U.S. military can be involved in hostilities.

The U.S. military raid in Caracas that seized Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is illegal according to international law, the charters of the Organization of American States and the United Nations, as well as other treaties to which the United States is a signatory. According to our own Constitution, the government violates U.S. law when it violates treaties that our government has signed.

None of that restrained the Trump administration, which has not demonstrated much respect for the rule of law. But the White House does care about the political power of Congress. If there is an expanded war in Venezuela or anywhere else that Trump has threatened to use the military, the fact that Congress took steps to oppose it will increase the political cost to the president.

This is likely one of the main reasons that the Trump administration has at least promised to make concessions regarding military action in Latin America — and who knows, possibly he did make some compromises compared with what had been planned.

On Nov. 5, the day before the Senate was to vote on a war powers resolution to halt and prevent hostilities within or against Venezuela by U.S. armed forces, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and White House counsel had a private briefing with senators.

They assured lawmakers that they were not going to have a land war or airstrikes in Venezuela. According to news reports, the White House counsel stated that they did not have a legal justification for such a war. It is clear that blocking the resolution was very important to these top officials. The day after that meeting, the war powers resolution was blocked by two votes. Two Republicans had joined the Democrats and independents in support of the resolution: Murkowski and Paul. That added up to 49 votes — not quite the needed majority.

But on Thursday, there were three additional Republicans who voted for the new resolution, so it will proceed to a final vote.

The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death. The blockade involved in the seizure of oil tankers is, according to experts, an unlawful use of military force. This means that the blockade would be included as a participation in hostilities that would require authorization from Congress.

Since 2015, the United States has imposed unilateral economic sanctions that destroyed Venezuela’s economy. From 2012 to 2020, Venezuela suffered the worst peacetime depression in world history. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP, or income, fell by 74%. Think of the economic destruction of the U.S. Great Depression, multiplied by three times. Most of this was the result of the sanctions.

This unprecedented devastation is generally attributed to Maduro in public discussion. But U.S. sanctions deliberately cut Venezuela off from international finance, as well as blocking most of its oil sales, which accounted for more than 90% of foreign exchange (mostly dollar) earnings. This devastated the economy.

In the first year of Trump sanctions from 2017-18, Venezuela’s deaths increased by tens of thousands of people, at a time when oil prices were increasing. Sanctions were expanded even more the following year. About a quarter of the population, more than 7 million people, emigrated after 2015 — 750,000 of them to the United States.

We know that the deadly impact of sanctions that target the civilian population is real. Research published in July by the Lancet Global Health, by my colleagues Francisco Rodriguez, Silvio Rendon and myself, estimated the global death toll from unilateral economic sanctions, as these are, at 564,000 per year over the past decade. This is comparable to the worldwide deaths from armed conflict. A majority of the victims over the 1970-2021 period were children.

The Trump administration has, in the last few days, been moving in the direction of lifting some sanctions to allow for oil exports, according to the president’s stated plan to “run Venezuela.” This is ironic because Venezuela has for many years wanted more investment and trade, including in oil, with the United States, and it was U.S. sanctions that prohibited it.

Such lifting of sanctions would be a big step forward, in terms of saving lives of people who are deprived of food, medicine and other necessities in Venezuela, as a result of these sanctions and the economic destruction that they cause.

But to create the stability that Venezuela needs to recover, we will have to take the military and economic violence out of this campaign. There are members of Congress moving toward that goal, and they need all the help that they can get, before it’s too late.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/076818f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2F33%2F7943dedc407e900a8e9892bf9cc0%2Fmurkowski-reelection-21054.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 09:57:37.382778

And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.
That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.
It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.

After several months of study and public input following questions raised about Minneapolis police’s crowd control tactics during the overly militarized Lake Street raid in June, the city amended the separation ordinance to strengthen and clarify this issue. In addition, MPD has used its own settlement agreement process with the state Department of Human Rights to gather its own public input, and released a revised immigration policy that both more clearly prohibits assisting ICE and provides more protection to the public.

One can make the case that this wouldn’t have happened without strong and sustained public pressure, but the bottom line is that it did happen.

MPD Chief Brian O’Hara described the new policies at a press conference just days after the Trump administration announced “Operation Metro Surge,” which continues to seize members of both our Somali and Hispanic communities and create chaos. The new policy restates the current general rule that MPD will “not participate in immigration enforcement,” and goes further to say that MPD also shall “not assist in the removal or transportation of people”; “not provide crowd management solely at the request of immigration enforcement agencies”; and, absent “a clear an immediate threat to life, serious injury, or destruction of property…will not escort federal immigration agents to enforcement locations or close streets when there are no traffic or public safety issues.”

Finally, the new policy specifically affirms that gathering a crowd to protest is a “First Amendment-protected event”; that MPD will record and report any federal violations of this right; and that MPD “will verbally or physically intervene” against any federal use of excessive force as soon as there is “a reasonable and safe opportunity to do so.”

During his press conference, O’Hara made clear that this incudes responding to 911 calls from terrified residents. Indeed, he told the New York Times this week that his agency has seen a marked increase in 911 calls responding to the newly volatile situation.

Of course, MPD cannot and must not launch an armed attack against federal officers, but they have made clear that their foremost duty is to “protect and serve” our community, not invasive federal agents. And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.

As O’Hara pointed out, the new policies and training will “remind our officers of their duty to intervene.”

The dilemma that our community faces is that MPD’s recent commitment to the law and Constitution — refraining from escorting ICE agents or providing ICE crowd control, while upholding First Amendment rights by declining to dispatch officers to ICE protests absent a “clear and immediate threat” — means that MPD may not be present to intervene when ICE attacks protesters suddenly and without any forewarning or provocation.

That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.

Even in the face of this dilemma, however, MPD has continued to honor its reinforced commitment to constitutional policing during the massive protests following the killing. It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.

This is a good example of the kind of transformation that citizens demanded after the police murder of George Floyd, and which was codified by the settlement agreement with the Department of Human Rights.

Even in the face of the current chaos and distress, we should all be encouraged by this strong step by our local law enforcement in the right direction.

""President Trump is making our country safer, and the American people will remember it in November.”","NEW YORK -- It's only two weeks into the new year, and President Donald Trump has already claimed control of Venezuela, escalated threats to seize Greenland and flooded American streets with masked immigration agents.

And that's not even counting an unprecedented criminal investigation at the Federal Reserve, a cornerstone of the national economy that Trump wants to bend to his will.

Even for a president who thrives on chaos, Trump is generating a stunning level of turmoil as voters prepare to deliver their verdict on his leadership in the upcoming midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Each decision carries tremendous risks, from the possibility of an overseas quagmire to undermining the country's financial system, but Trump has barreled forward with a ferocity that has rattled even some of his Republican allies.

“The presidency has gone rogue,” said historian Joanne B. Freeman, a Yale University professor. She said it's something ""we haven’t seen in this way before.”

Trump seems undeterred by the potential blowback. Although he doesn't always follow through, he seems intent on doubling and tripling down whenever possible.

“Right now I’m feeling pretty good,"" Trump said Tuesday in Detroit. His speech was ostensibly arranged to refocus attention on the economy, which the president claimed is surging despite lingering concerns about higher prices.

However, he couldn't resist lashing out at Jerome Powell, who leads the Federal Reserve and has resisted Trump's pressure to lower interest rates.

""That jerk will be gone soon,” Trump said.

Republican leaders have overwhelmingly rallied behind Trump throughout his turbulent second term. But new cracks began to appear this week immediately after Powell disclosed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve was facing a criminal investigation over his testimony about the central bank's building renovations.

Over the last year, the Justice Department has already pursued criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former national security adviser John Bolton, among other Trump adversaries.

But going after Powell, who helps set the nation's monetary policy, appeared to be a step too far for some conservatives. Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, a fierce Trump defender, was unusually critical.

“It just feels like most on Wall Street do not want to see this kind of fight,” she said during her Monday show. “The president has very good points, certainly. But Wall Street doesn’t want to see this kind of investigation.”

The Federal Reserve plays a key role in the economy by calibrating interest rates, which Trump insists should be lower. However, reducing the institution's independence could backfire and cause borrowing costs to increase instead.

At the same time, Trump has decided to expand the United States' role in complicated foreign entanglements — a seeming departure from the “America First” foreign policy that he promised on the campaign trail.

No move was more significant than the U.S. military operation earlier this month to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from his country. In the months leading up to the attack, Trump frequently insisted he was targeting Maduro because of his role in the drug trade. He has quickly pivoted to portraying the move as an economic opportunity for the U.S.

Trump has said the U.S. will start controlling the sale of some Venezuelan oil, and he declared that the South American nation will be run from Washington. He even posted a meme declaring himself the “acting president of Venezuela.”

Trump has also threatened the leadership of Cuba and Iran, while insisting that the U.S. will control Greenland “ one way or the other ” — a position that has raised questions about U.S. relations with European allies. Greenland belongs to Denmark, a NATO member.

Meanwhile, Trump's immigration crackdown continues to spark confrontations in American cities. Some have turned deadly, such as when a federal agent shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis.

Administration officials have said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer acted in self-defense, accusing Good of trying to hit him with her car. But that explanation has been widely disputed by local officials and others based on videos circulating online.

The incident came after Trump dispatched 2,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, responding to reports of fraud involving the state's Somali community.

On Tuesday, Trump said the administration was targeting “thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention.”

The Trump administration's moves have created “chaos, confusion and uncertainty,” said Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, who leads the Democratic Mayors Association.

“There’s so much uncertainty across my city right now. The ICE raids in Minneapolis have really shocked the consciousness of many of my residents, and we’re trying to do everything we can to calm that concerns and quell those fears,"" Bibb said. “But people don’t feel like the world is getting better. People don’t feel like the economy is getting better.”

Voters across the nation will have their next chance to weigh in on Trump's leadership at the ballot box this November, when Republicans hope to retain control of Congress for the last two years of his presidency.

Democratic campaign officials in Washington are focused largely on the economy in their early political messaging. Most voters maintain a decidedly negative view on the issue, despite Trump's rosy assessment this week.

Just 31% of U.S. adults approved of how the president is handling the economy, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That marked the lowest economic approval he’s registered in an AP-NORC poll in his first or second term.

“Donald Trump’s visit to Michigan puts a glaring, unflattering spotlight on how he and House Republicans have failed to address the affordability crisis,"" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the Democrats' House campaign arm.

But some activists are frustrated that their party's leadership isn't focusing more on Trump's unprecedented power grabs.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he expects Trump's actions to get worse as his second and final term nears its conclusion.

“Folks at the end of last year who thought he would become a typical lame duck and limp toward a midterm loss have a framework for understanding this moment that is drastically outdated,” Levin said. “Authoritarians don’t willingly give up power. When weakened and cornered they lash out.”

Trump has repeatedly insisted he's only doing what voters elected him to do, and his allies in Washington remain overwhelmingly united behind him.

Republican National Committee spokesperson Kiersten Pels predicted that voters will reward the party this year.

“Voters elected President Trump to put American lives first — and that’s exactly what he’s doing,"" she said.

GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.
“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said.
A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.
“It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants.","The ‘skip tracing’ contract will supercharge surveillance of immigrants, financial incentives will turn contractors into bounty hunters, critics say.

The federal government has hired a company owned by a controversial private prison firm to track immigrants they’re looking to deport, even as experts and civil rights activists condemn the move as a “recipe for disaster.”

Under a two-year, $121 million contract between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a subsidiary of GEO Group called BI Incorporated, the company will perform “skip tracing” services for the federal government. GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.

According to an announcement about the contract, the work includes “enhanced location research with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation to verify current address information and investigate alternative address information for individuals on the federal government’s non-detained docket.”

In other words, the company will be searching public records and other data sources to track down the undocumented immigrants ICE hasn’t been able to find yet, experts said.

In the statement announcing the deal, GEO Group Chairman George Zoley crowed that the contract “is a testament to the high-quality solutions BI has provided to ICE for more than 21 years.”

But others, including advocates for immigrants, academics, and civil liberties watchdogs, say the federal government’s decision to outsource and effectively privatize data mining and surveillance operations will lead to nothing but trouble.

“Basically, it’s going to be what we would think of as bounty hunting — minus the ability to actually physically detain someone,” said Lori Nessel, a law professor at Seton Hall University and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights and International Human Rights Law Clinic.

“But what’s really disturbing is the language allows for ‘all available technology’ in terms of the surveillance. So there are huge privacy concerns,” she told The Jersey Vindicator.

Nessel also said the contract is incentive-based, which will encourage the firm to find as many people as it can, and quickly. That rush to meet a quota often leads to mistakes and constitutional violations.

She also suspects there will be little transparency about how, exactly, BI Incorporated goes about its work.

“It’s not clear where the legal authority comes from for a government agency to contract out this type of law enforcement function without limits,” she said. “So, I’m not sure where the accountability and oversight will come from … It’s a recipe for disaster.”

The deal has also attracted the attention of at least one member of Congress, and he expressed similar concerns in a November letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

“Allowing private contractors to perform enforcement activities under a system of performance-based financial incentives, essentially bounty hunting, outsources one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability,” Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote.

“Once the state begins contracting out its power to police, it invites the very abuses, secrecy, and corruption our founders sought to prevent,” Krishnamoorthi, who is also running for the U.S. Senate, said. “The idea of authorizing unknown private individuals to walk through neighborhoods, observing, photographing, and verifying the whereabouts of those they believe to be undocumented, is deeply troubling.”

Dillon Reisman, a staff attorney with the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, also worried that the contractor happens to be a subsidiary of GEO Group, which has for months been accused of abusing and neglecting detainees at Delaney Hall.

“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said. “Why would we trust this specific company with our data and with this task that is inherently harmful to civil liberties?”

BI Incorporated did not respond to a request for comment. A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.

How skip tracing works

Skip tracing isn’t new, experts said.

But it’s usually performed by real law enforcement agencies trying to find missing people who skipped out on bail, a debt, or a court date, according to David Opderbeck, a Seton Hall law professor and the co-director of the Gibbons Institute of Law, Science & Technology and the school’s Institute for Privacy Protection.

The job’s gotten easier as more and more public records migrate online, and recent leaps in artificial intelligence will let contractors use automated tools to scrape social media profiles and other parts of the web.

“It’s getting pretty sophisticated,” Opderbeck said.

And because ICE has information-sharing agreements with other federal agencies — including the IRS — contractors will likely be able to get their hands on tax records and other financial documents, he said.

“It’s always a concern when you’ve got a third-party contractor handling potentially very sensitive data,” he said. “Who knows what civil rights guardrails are built into this contract? I doubt many.”

Opderbeck worried ICE could weaponize the information against legal immigrants and those with valid asylum claims — or citizen watchdog groups who constantly protest the agency.

“Governments have been doing this kind of stuff for a long time,” he said. “But there’s a big potential for overly aggressive surveillance and maybe abuse of these tools … that’s pretty frightening to me.”

Nessel, his Seton Hall colleague, agreed.

“I think everyone needs to be concerned about losing privacy protections,” she said. “It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants. It’ll be U.S. citizens, it will be all of us that will be impacted by this surveillance.”

The final details of ICE’s plan are still unclear, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security gave a glimpse of the operation in documents obtained by The Intercept via a Freedom of Information request in late October.

In the nine-page document, the agency said it wants its contractor to use “government-furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation services to verify alien address information, investigate alternative alien address information, confirm the new location of aliens, and deliver materials/documents to aliens as appropriate.”

That might include searching through public records, social media sites, and other apps for information, then using the results to track down an undocumented immigrant’s home and job.

The request also asked for “a collection of photos and documents” to verify the addresses, and asked contractors to document each visit and provide “time-stamped photographs of the location.”

Then they would report back to the feds as soon as possible.

Given the Trump administration’s fixation on deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, the work will be plentiful. Department of Homeland Security officials said its initial docket would include the names of 10,000 people, and that could balloon up to 1 million over time.

The agency also offered an “incentive-based pricing structure” that pays out based on the contractor’s success rate, according to the document.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security will pay more if the contractor verifies an immigrant’s home on the first try or finishes 90% of the caseload before the deadline.

“This encourages the vendor to prioritize accuracy, efficiency, and professionalism in their operations,” an agency official wrote.

In his letter, Krishnamoorthi, the Illinois congressman, pilloried the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for those pay incentives, which he said turn contractors into bounty hunters.

“In such a system built on quotas and cash rewards with minimal oversight, mistakes are not just possible — they are certain. When that happens, it is not a paperwork error but an entirely predictable violation of rights with real human costs,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

“This approach does not invite abuse; it guarantees it, putting the liberty and well-being of the American public at risk,” he wrote.

Reisman, of the ACLU, would agree.

“It’s really dangerous to get private companies invested in the mission of investigating, arresting, and detaining people — it makes the incentives profit-based,” he said.

“That means the system is not geared towards justice or mercy or fairness,” he said. “It’s geared towards getting more money.”",https://jerseyvindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/K104269-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 06:58:45.954302

Opponents argue the bill would infringe on federal authority and create legal chaos by allowing states to regulate federal agents.
Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale -- who served in law enforcement for decades himself -- said the bill could further inflame anti-law-enforcement sentiment.
Supporters acknowledge that Congress could amend federal law to address the issue directly but argue states must act in the absence of federal reform.
The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers are again positioning the state in direct opposition to the Trump administration, this time with legislation that would allow residents to sue federal immigration officials for alleged constitutional violations.

The proposal, Senate Bill 747, authored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, seeks to close what supporters call a longstanding legal loophole that shields federal law enforcement officers from civil lawsuits in cases where state or local officers could be held liable.

Wiener has dubbed the measure the “No Kings Act,” arguing it is necessary amid increased immigration enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“We’re here today because ICE and the Trump administration are trampling over the Constitution and need to be held accountable,” Wiener said. “We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE.”

Under current federal law — specifically Section 1983 of the U.S. Code — individuals may sue state or local officials for violations of constitutional rights, but federal officers are excluded. SB 747 would create a state-level cause of action allowing lawsuits against federal agents for misconduct occurring in California.

Supporters say the bill does not break new legal ground but instead addresses an imbalance in accountability.

“We are not breaking radical new ground here,” said Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park. “We are closing a loophole.”

They also clarified the intention of the bill.

“This is not an attack on law enforcement. This bill is not anti-law enforcement. This bill is pro Constitution, pro accountability and pro public trust,"" said Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park.

Civil liberties advocates argue the lack of accountability has left victims with little recourse. Anya Bidwell, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, said federal officers are often able to avoid lawsuits because courts routinely dismiss claims under doctrines such as discretionary immunity.

“If this were state or local officials, we would be in court right now,” Bidwell said.

The Institute for Justice represents George Retes, a U.S. citizen and military veteran who was detained for 72 hours by ICE last July while driving to work. Retes said officers broke his car window, deployed tear gas and pepper spray, and forcibly removed him despite his claims that he did not resist.

“I was free to go, and I just got to live with the experience that they put me through,” Retes said.

Bidwell said Retes has not filed a lawsuit because existing law makes such cases unlikely to succeed. That is why the two stand firmly behind SB 747.

“The reason ICE does what it does is because they know it is extremely difficult to sue,” she said.

Opponents argue the bill would infringe on federal authority and create legal chaos by allowing states to regulate federal agents.

“We cannot have 50 different states deciding how they think we should be operating,” said Bill Essayli, first assistant U.S. attorney. “The states do not have the authority to regulate federal agents, period.”

Essayli added that it's Congress that regulates federal authorities.

Republican lawmakers also criticized the proposal. Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale -- who served in law enforcement for decades himself -- said the bill could further inflame anti-law-enforcement sentiment.

“I believe that this is going to feed a fire of anti-law enforcement that is unjustified,” Lackey said.

Supporters acknowledge that Congress could amend federal law to address the issue directly but argue states must act in the absence of federal reform.

If passed, SB 747 would apply only to incidents occurring in California and would be retroactive to March 1, 2025, a provision that could open the door to lawsuits over recent enforcement actions.

The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability. A separate bill by the senator that would restrict most officers from wearing masks while on duty is scheduled for a hearing this week and has already drawn opposition from the Trump administration.

The bill passed through the Senate Judicial Committee with a majority vote late Tuesday. The bill advances to the Senate Appropriations Committee next then would advance to the Senate floor.

This article features a Government Accountability Project case and was originally published here.

Lawmakers from both parties and houses of Congress have agreed to provide about $653 million to fund Voice of America’s parent agency, rejecting President Donald Trump’s demand to defund the international broadcaster and shut it down.

The outlay is included in a broader bipartisan spending deal negotiated by House and Senate appropriators. The package still requires House and Senate approval before heading to Trump’s desk.

“We understand the realities of the appropriations process, but I am disappointed that Congress is proposing half a billion dollars more in funding than we requested,” Kari Lake, the deputy CEO installed by Trump to shut down the agency, wrote in a statement Monday. “While reductions from prior years are a step in the right direction, USAGM can still advance President Trump’s message and share America’s story globally without wasting so much taxpayer money.”

The bipartisan commitment to funding USAGM reflects continued congressional support for America’s role in promoting the free flow of news and information abroad, a long-standing foundation of its soft power around the world.

Congress’s funding proposal comes after a dire year for USAGM. Trump signed an executive order in March calling for the dismantlement of the government agency, which oversees Voice of America and funds nonprofit groups including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. To carry out the order, Lake placed more than 1,300 Voice of America staffers on paid administrative leave — many of whom are still not working — and halted broadcasting operations the same month.

Lake, a former Arizona television anchor who lost high-profile races for governor and U.S. Senate in recent years, has defended the cuts and called for the agency’s eventual elimination. She told Congress in a June hearing that USAGM was “incompetent, corrupt, biased, and a threat to America’s national security and standing in the world.” She has also said USAGM is “not salvageable.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in April ordering the agency to uphold its statutory obligations for broadcasting. As a result, VOA began producing content again in four languages: Farsi, Pashto, Dari and Mandarin. (VOA previously broadcast in 49 languages.)

When Lake subsequently ordered mass layoffs at USAGM through a reduction-in-force, or RIF, Lamberth blocked her from doing so, saying those cuts would put the agency out of compliance with his injunction. He also chastised Lake and her “concerning disrespect” for the law and ordered that she be deposed under threat of contempt proceedings.

Lamberth, an 82-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan, also criticized the administration for not spending what it was appropriated by Congress. “When Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for FY 2025, it did not anticipate that such a significant sum of taxpayer funds would be used to pay employees to sit at home for months on end, making no contribution to VOA’s statutory mandate,” Lamberth wrote, noting the total specifically appropriated for VOA’s use in USAGM’s last budget.

The bill allocates $199.5 million of the total appropriation to VOA and $138 million for USAGM’s operations. Additionally, nonprofit grantees will also be funded through this bill to the tune of $112.5 million for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, $69 million for Middle East Broadcasting Networks, $53.5 million for Radio Free Asia and $40.5 million for the Open Technology Fund. The Trump administration pushed to defund the nonprofit media outlets, but Lamberth has largely restored their funding in court after they all sued.

Radio Free Asia previously said it was pausing operations but in recent months has resumed some publishing activities. “With new funding, if enacted, RFA anticipates ramping up additional news operations that have been paused in the Asia-Pacific region,” RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan said in a statement.

Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the top Democrat on the state and foreign operations subcommittee, applauded the bipartisan negotiation that led to the bill but expressed worry that it still represented a cut to government broadcasters.

“While the bill ensures continued funding for our international broadcasting grantees,” he wrote in a statement, “it forces cuts at a time when they are trying to provide critical services in Ukraine, the Middle East, and across the Indo-Pacific.”

Schatz and his House counterpart, Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Florida), previously criticized the Trump administration’s “illegal gutting” of the agency.

Successful civil suits against federal officers over constitutional rights are less common.
Good’s death outraged Democratic leaders across the country, who accuse federal officers of flouting laws in their efforts to deport thousands of undocumented immigrants.
In New York, legislators are proposing legislation similar to the one proposed by Wiener that would allow state-level civil actions against federal officers.
Newsom last year signed legislation authored by Wiener that prohibits law enforcement officials, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks, with some exceptions.","A week after a Minnesota woman was fatally shot by a federal immigration officer, California legislators moved forward a bill that would make it easier for people to sue federal agents if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

A Senate committee passed Senate Bill 747 by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), which would provide Californians with a stronger ability to take legal action against federal law enforcement agents over excessive use of force, unlawful home searches, interfering with a right to protest and other violations.

California law already allows such suits against state and local law enforcement officials.

Successful civil suits against federal officers over constitutional rights are less common.

Wiener, appearing before Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said his bill has taken on new urgency in the wake of the death of Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota, the 37-year-old mother of three who was shot while driving on a snowy Minneapolis street.

Good was shot by an agent in self-defense, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who alleged that Good tried to use her car as a weapon to run over the immigration officer.

Good’s death outraged Democratic leaders across the country, who accuse federal officers of flouting laws in their efforts to deport thousands of undocumented immigrants. In New York, legislators are proposing legislation similar to the one proposed by Wiener that would allow state-level civil actions against federal officers.

George Retes Jr., a U.S. citizen and Army veteran who was kept in federal custody for three days in July, described his ordeal at Tuesday’s committee hearing, and how immigration officers swarmed him during a raid in Camarillo.

Retes, a contracted security guard at the farm that was raided, said he was brought to Port Hueneme Naval Base. Officials swabbed his cheek to obtain DNA, and then moved him to Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He was not allowed to make a phone call or see an attorney, he said.

“I did not resist, I did not impede or assault any agent,” Retes said.”What happened to me that day was not a misunderstanding. It was a violation of the Constitution by the very people sworn to uphold it.”

He also accused Department of Homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin of spreading false information about him to justify his detention. DHS said in a statement last year that Retes impeded their operation, which he denies.

Retes has filed a tort claim against the U.S. government, a process that is rarely successful, said his attorney, Anya Bidwell.

Lawsuits can also be brought through the Bivens doctrine, which refers to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Agents that established that federal officials can be sued for monetary damages for constitutional violations. But in recent decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly restricted the ability to sue under Bivens.

Wiener’s bill, if passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be retroactive to March 2025.

“We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE,” said Wiener at a news conference before the hearing. “We need the rule of law and we need accountability.”

Weiner is running for the congressional seat held by former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).

Representatives for law enforcement agencies appeared at Tuesday’s hearing to ask for amendments to ensure that the bill wouldn’t lead to weakened protections for state and local officials.

“We’re not opposed to the intent of the bill. We’re just concerned about the future and the unintended consequences for your California employees,” said David Mastagni, speaking on behalf of the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, which represents more than 85,000 public safety members.

Blanco Gallegos told News4 he fears what would happen if his husband is deported back to his home country.","A D.C. couple has been forced apart for more than a month and now their future together is in limbo.

The husbands are a mixed-status couple — Jonathan Blanco Gallegos is a U.S. citizen, and his husband, Elias Perez-Zuazo, is undocumented.

Perez-Zuazo was detained Dec. 10 during what they thought was supposed to be a routine, annual check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The couple was already in the process of applying for Perez-Zuazo’s green card.

Blanco Gallegos and Perez-Zuazo were married in D.C. Feb. 27, 2024. At the time, the idea of life apart was unthinkable. Now, it’s their reality.

“Basically, it feels like something from inside you,” Blanco Gallegos said. “They take him away, and your life’s put on pause. And I need somebody to come back and press play, right, but it’s not gonna happen.”

Perez-Zuazo had a check-in with ICE at a facility in Chantilly, Virginia, which Blanco Gallegos says his husband had been doing annually. What normally would take 45 minutes, Blanco Gallegos says, took several hours. As he waited for Perez-Zuazo in the parking lot, he realized something was wrong.

“He has been detained with no reason, no excuse, no paperwork, no nothing,” he said. “They just give me his stuff outside of the parking lot. An ICE agent coming out from the building and says, ‘oh, are you Elias' husband?’ Yes. ‘Okay, here is his stuff. He's been in detention.’”

Perez-Zuazo is from Panama. Blanco Gallegos says his husband crossed into the U.S. without documentation in November 2021. Blanco Gallegos says his husband was processed by immigration authorities at the Texas/Mexico border and was released on his own recognizance, allowed to go live with a sponsor in Washington, D.C. while his immigration case played out in court.

Perez-Zuazo and Blanco Gallegos met in 2023, started dating and eventually got married. They’ve started the green card application process and have made some progress. Perez-Zuazo’s I-130 petition was approved, which is the first step needed for someone to obtain U.S. residency through a spouse or family member. But now, with Perez-Zuazo detained and with no clarity over if or when he’ll be released, Blanco Gallegos says he’s not sure that the future they pictured will come together.

“I got home; my bed is empty. He's not in there. He's not cooking anymore for me. So it's so many things that your life changed,” he said. “Like from day to night. My heart is broken.”

Blanco Gallegos says their attorney has been seeking clarity from ICE, trying to figure out why his husband was detained and whether he’s facing any charges. Blanco Gallegos claims ICE has not been responsive.

News4 reached out to the agency asking why Perez-Zuazo was detained. ICE sent a statement which says, “On December 10, ICE arrested Elias Enoc Perez-Zuazo, an illegal alien from Panama. He illegally crossed the border in November 2021 and was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration. He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 2021 and was RELEASED into this country by the Biden administration. This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.”

Blanco Gallegos shared his husband’s “Order of Release On Recognizance” form with News4 – which was issued by ICE. The form states Perez-Zuazo was placed in removal proceedings after he was initially processed by immigration authorities in November 2021, but so far, News4 has been unable to find out if an immigration judge has issued a deportation order for Perez-Zuazo. A search for his case in the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online database yields zero results. Perez-Zuazo’s attorney denies that an immigration judge has issued a deportation order, saying that’s not consistent with the documents he’s reviewed in the case and argues that if such an order was actually issued, Perez-Zuazo would have already been deported.

In the meantime, Perez-Zuazo’s attorney filed a ""habeas corpus petition” in federal court, which challenges the detention, characterizing it as unlawful. Blanco Gallegos told News4 he fears what would happen if his husband is deported back to his home country.

“It’s going to be hard since Panama is not a gay-friendly country,” he said. “Because same-sex couples is not allowed over there. So our life is going to be at risk.”

Perez-Zuazo’s case underscores the Trump Administration’s massive push to detain immigrants in ICE facilities. According to the latest data compiled by the The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, the number of people detained by ICE jumped by nearly 40,000 from 2024 to 2025.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2026/01/DC-couple-in-limbo-after-husband-is-detained-by-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-13 23:57:22.567636

Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.
Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.
Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.
“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

The quick pronouncement by administration officials before any meaningful investigation could be completed has raised concerns about the federal government’s determination to conduct a thorough review of the chain of events precipitating the shooting. Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/464f823/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2194+0+204/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F36%2F79%2F6a20b336abcc5a36022284269229%2F36c7ff5099fa495885f8579d8a5b0355,N,,2026-01-14 00:57:34.572282

Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.","Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on Tuesday over the Justice Department’s push to investigate the widow of a woman killed by an ICE agent and the department’s reluctance to investigate the shooter, according to people with knowledge of their decision.

Joseph H. Thompson, who was second in command at the U.S. attorney’s office and oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that has roiled Minnesota’s political landscape, was among those who quit on Tuesday, according to three people with knowledge of the decision.

Mr. Thompson’s resignation came after senior Justice Department officials pressed for a criminal investigation into the actions of the widow of Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman killed by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

Mr. Thompson, 47, a career prosecutor, objected to that approach, as well as to the Justice Department’s refusal to include state officials in investigating whether the shooting itself was lawful, the people familiar with his decision said.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said in an interview that Mr. Thompson’s resignation dealt a major blow to efforts to root out rampant theft from state agencies. The fraud cases, which involve schemes to cheat safety net programs, were the chief reason the Trump administration cited for its immigration crackdown in the state. The vast majority of defendants charged in the cases are American citizens of Somali origin.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making the fraud cases, it tells you this isn’t really about prosecuting fraud,” Mr. O’Hara said.

The other senior career prosecutors who resigned include Harry Jacobs, Melinda Williams and Thomas Calhoun-Lopez. Mr. Jacobs had been Mr. Thompson’s deputy overseeing the fraud investigation, which began in 2022. Mr. Calhoun-Lopez was the chief of the violent and major crimes unit.

Mr. Thompson, Mr. Jacobs, Ms. Williams and Mr. Calhoun-Lopez declined to discuss the reasons they resigned. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tuesday’s resignations followed tumultuous days at the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota as prosecutors there and in Washington struggled to manage the outrage over Ms. Good’s killing, which set off angry protests in Minnesota and across the nation.

After Ms. Good was shot, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, told her staff that she would not consider opening an investigation into whether the agent had violated federal law, according to three current and former department officials who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the situation. At least four prosecutors who had already intended to quit or retire signaled they would accelerate their departures, those officials said.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation” into the ICE agent.

Instead, the Justice Department launched an investigation to examine ties between Ms. Good and her wife, Becca, and several groups that have been monitoring and protesting the conduct of immigration agents in recent weeks. Shortly after Wednesday’s fatal shooting, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, referred to Ms. Good as a “domestic terrorist.”

Mr. Thompson strenuously objected to the decision not to investigate the shooting as a civil rights matter, and was outraged by the demand to launch a criminal investigation into Becca Good, according to the people familiar with the developments, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.

Mr. Thompson had originally set out to investigate the shooting in partnership with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state agency that reviews police shootings. Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.

Drew Evans, the superintendent of the bureau, called Mr. Thompson’s departure a major setback for the effort to root out fraud in the state and for public safety.

“We’re losing a true public servant,” said Mr. Evans. “We really need professional prosecutors.”

The absence of a credible and comprehensive investigation into Ms. Good’s killing stands to “undermine trust in our public safety agencies,” Mr. Evans added.

Mr. Thompson’s departure came during the chaotic immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which has angered many residents and left officials bracing for an escalation of violence.

Begun in December with the deployment of roughly 100 federal agents from out of state, the operation has swelled to include some 2,000 federal agents. By comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.

Local leaders and immigrant rights groups have decried the agents’ conduct, saying that they have been stopping people based only on looks and accents. Often, these stops have led to the violent arrest of both immigrants and American citizens, according to local officials and observers who have recorded mayhem using cell phones.

On Monday, Minnesota’s attorney general and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an end to the crackdown, asserting that it had led to numerous abuses and civil rights violations.

The Minneapolis police chief, Mr. O’Hara, told The New York Times in an interview that the operation could lead to more deaths and the kind of widespread civil unrest that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

The Trump administration has cited the fraud investigation that Mr. Thompson led to justify the surge of agents, which federal officials have called the largest immigration enforcement operation in history.

Most of the defendants charged to date are of Somali ancestry, but are American citizens by birth or naturalization.

President Trump and several top aides have seized on the matter to argue that Somalis are swindling the nation. Mr. Trump has called Somalis “garbage,” and he said his administration was considering denaturalizing some, because, he says, “they hate our country.”

Mr. Thompson grew frustrated in recent weeks as the immigration surge became a distraction for the office’s work on fraud, undermining the goal the administrations said it was trying to pursue, according to people familiar with his thinking.

The fraud cases — which involve plots to bill state agencies for safety net services that were never provided — have cost taxpayers several billion dollars, according to Mr. Thompson.

After new facets of the investigation came to light this fall, the scandal became a major crisis for Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who has struggled to explain why so much money was stolen on his watch.

But this month, facing threats and investigations from federal agencies, the governor suspended his campaign. Mr. Walz said he concluded that the work of rooting out fraud demanded his entire attention during the final year of his term, which will end shortly after the end of this year.

Mr. Walz lamented Mr. Thompson’s resignation on Tuesday, calling him “a principled public servant who spent more than a decade achieving justice for Minnesotans.” He added: “It’s also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants.”

Mr. Thompson’s departure is a major blow to the effort. A self-described workaholic, he has encyclopedic knowledge of dozens of investigations involving a complex web of defendants and transactions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/13nat-minnesota-prosecutor-1-kfvg/13nat-minnesota-prosecutor-1-kfvg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:57:17.668903

(January 13, 2026)—Today, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem demanding records and information about the hiring of individuals connected to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol and the use of face coverings by federal law enforcement officers to hide their identities.

“We know that some participants in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have been rewarded with high-ranking positions in the Department of Justice (DOJ). However, it remains unclear how many more have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents and officers that have dragged, tackled, beaten, tased, shot, and killed citizens and non-citizens alike in communities around the country,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Earlier this month, Ranking Member Raskin and House Judiciary Committee Democrats released a report documenting the careers of individuals involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election who are now employed in senior roles within the DOJ and DHS.

For example, Jared Wise, a former Supervisory Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), stormed the Capitol on January 6. He threatened police and applauded violence against them, shouting: “Yeah, fuck them! Yeah, kill ‘em!” After President Trump issued a blanket pardon for January 6 rioters, Wise escaped accountability for two pending felony charges—civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers—plus four additional offenses, including unlawful entry. Today, Wise serves as senior adviser to the Deputy Attorney General, alongside fellow January 6 participant Ed Martin, now the U.S. Pardon Attorney and head of the DOJ Weaponization Working Group.

DHS appears to be actively courting pardoned January 6 participants. It has deployed white nationalist “dog whistles” in its recruitment campaign for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seemingly targeting members of extremist militias—including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters—involved in the insurrection. The campaign launched with a $50,000 sign-on bonus, elimination of college degree requirements, and relaxed vetting standards.

Less than one year into Donald Trump’s second term, masked DHS agents and officers have terrorized communities, including more than 170 US citizens who have been detained. Unlike any other law enforcement agency or armed services branch, ICE officers conceal their identities by wearing masks and removing their names from uniforms. Last week, a masked ICE agent shot a mother of three(link is external) at point-blank range as she attempted to drive away from him.

“Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6 and were convicted of their offenses? The American people deserve to know how many of these violent insurrectionists have been given guns and badges by this Administration,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Ranking Member Raskin is demanding that Bondi and Noem produce information on federal agents’ use of facial coverings to obscure their identities and provide information on all individuals employed by DOJ and DHS who have received or sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, or who have been charged or investigated in connection with the January 6, 2021 attack.",,N,,2026-01-13 21:57:21.825019

As ICE agents and civilians clashed on Jan. 12 near the intersection of Third Street North and 33rd Avenue North in St. Cloud, some St. Cloud-area residents continue to keep an eye on where agents go next. Those interested in ICE activities are posting sightings online at iceout.org.

As of Jan. 13, there are unconfirmed civilian reports listed on iceout.org in St. Cloud, Clear Lake, Clearwater and Princeton. These civilian submissions typically disclose the time of the sighting, whether it is confirmed, what type of activity was observed and the uniform the agents were wearing.

There are several categories of sightings on iceout.org. Report types include observed, active and critical. Observed includes activities like eating or visiting a gas station, active includes questioning people and critical includes raids, according to the website.

Tensions with ICE agents have increased after an agent on Jan. 7 reportedly shot Renee Good, 37, in south Minneapolis. The shooting sparked protests across the country.

The website is often referred to as People Over Papers, according to the site, which is powered by the Pueblo Project Foundation.

""Our objective is to collect community-submitted information about possible ICE activity to help inform the public and raise awareness,"" the website's 'about us' section reads. ""All reports are reviewed by our moderator team before appearing on the map.""

Despite all iceout.org reports being reviewed by a moderator team, the website's organizers urge those using the platform to proceed with caution and ""cross-reference it with their local or state rapid response networks.""

What to know about Monday's clash in St. Cloud

Immigration agents reportedly tried to detain one individual midday near Star Market, 3425 Third Street N., according to state Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud. He said some people at the strip mall engaged with ICE agents. Putnam said he was at the scene to reduce tension.

“ICE came to collect one individual,” Putnam said. “The community responded.”

There were at least 65 ICE agents present and at least 50 civilians. Immigration officials reportedly pepper-sprayed individuals at the scene, including St. Cloud resident Ali Warsme. It was not disclosed as to what perpetuated the pepper spray.

”I was one of the first people who got sprayed,” Warsme said. “Luckily someone had milk, but my eyes are still irritated.""

St. Cloud Police Chief Jeffrey Oxton wrote in a statement that he was not initially aware of a federal operation taking place in St. Cloud on Monday. Oxton said the operation happened in the strip mall's parking lot. St. Cloud police assisted with crowd control.

On Monday night, a group of at least 25 protesters voiced frustrations about ICE agents in St. Cloud outside area hotels where they thought agents might be staying.

Immigration surge in Minnesota

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security deployed roughly 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota earlier this month. That deployment started on Jan. 4, just days before Good's death. The DHS said the shooting was an act of self-defense by the agent, while local leaders, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, dispute that claim.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference on Jan. 7. ""Having seen the video myself I want to tell everybody directly, that is bull----.""

United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that hundreds of additional ICE agents would be deployed to the North Star State.

USA TODAY reports that Minnesota and Illinois sued Noem on Monday. Officials in Minnesota want the DHS to stop deploying agents to the state, according to USA TODAY. While Illinois wants bar federal agents to stop tactics like excessive force, such as chemical agents.

Pending court approval, case will be fully and permanently resolved in Maryland’s favor

BALTIMORE, MD – Attorney General Anthony G. Brown today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss its appeal of the final judgment that permanently blocks the Trump administration’s effort to unlawfully impose immigration enforcement requirements on U.S. Department of Transportation grants and other funding that amount to more than $1 billion a year for Maryland. By dropping its appeal, the Trump administration submits to the lower court ruling, fully resolving the case in favor of Maryland and the 21 other states that sued the administration.

“The Trump administration’s unlawful actions threatened funding that keeps Marylanders safe and our State moving,” said Attorney General Brown. “Our lawsuit protected the federal resources that maintain our roads and bridges, support public transit, reduce deadly crashes, and ensure people can get to work, school, and their homes safely. Those investments are essential to Maryland’s economy, public safety, and daily life.

Maryland receives more than $1 billion a year in funding from the Department of Transportation to build and maintain vital travel infrastructure like the roads, highways, airways, and bridges that connect communities and carry their residents to their workplaces and homes. This includes the funding necessary to prevent fatal traffic accidents and stop drunk drivers; the funding to provide transit for seniors and those with disabilities; and the funding that protects and restores roads after environmental disasters like fires or flooding. Neither the purpose of these funding programs, nor the criteria that govern them, are in any way connected to immigration enforcement.

The Constitution is clear: Congress, not the President, decides how federal money is spent. And for decades, Congress has passed laws guaranteeing funding to states like Maryland to improve their roads and protect those who use them — funds that the federal government generally has by virtue of the taxes it receives from the people of Maryland and other states. Yet despite the constraints imposed by Congress and the Constitution, the Trump administration attempted to seize Congress’s power of the purse by imposing unlawful conditions on transportation funding. In doing so, the Trump administration violated two key principles that underlie the American system: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act outside the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government is subject to strict limits when it seeks to use the spending power to influence states to adopt its preferred policies.

On November 4, 2025, the district court issued final judgment in favor of Maryland and the states that challenged this unlawful conduct, issuing an order permanently enjoining the Trump administration from unlawfully imposing the conditions and vacating the conditions across all U.S. Department of Transportation funding programs. In issuing its decision, the Court found that the Trump administration has “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitutions demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Illinois and Minnesota officials are separately suing the Trump administration over the enforcement tactics used by federal immigration agents.

The lawsuits seek broader limits on the conduct of immigration agents in both states.

It comes after last week’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Following the shooting, Vice President JD Vance said the agent was “protected by absolute immunity.”

The Illinois lawsuit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsti Noem and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, among others, as defendants. A spokesperson for DHS said the lawsuit is “baseless,” and that DHS looks forward to “proving that in court.”

Harold Krent, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss the lawsuits and the legality of immigration agents’ use of force.

Do immigration agents have absolute immunity?

“The vice president is simply wrong. There have been a number of cases and judicial pronouncements that say that the individuals are not absolutely immune, and no Supreme Court decision has ever held that. That being said, the road to a prosecution by a state official is tough, and obviously we’re not going to see a federal prosecution in this administration, but there could be a federal prosecution in a subsequent administration. There are some civil damages routes that are available as well. … There are some avenues available for some kind of accountability.”

Could the Illinois and Minnesota lawsuits clash with the Supremacy Clause?

“What Illinois and Minnesota are saying is that the use of these aggressive tactics, moving patrols, interrogations and the use of tear gas, is simply trying to bludgeon the states into changing their form of government, which is also protected under the Constitution in our 10th Amendment. What these lawsuits are saying is that this use of aggressive tactics is trying to brow-beat the states into abandoning their sanctuary policies to protect migrants within the communities, and that the use of tactics to affect that aim is actually itself a violation of the Constitution because of the rights protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution.”

Several supervisors in the criminal section of the Justice Department's civil rights division have also given notice of their departures, they said.

The resignations follow growing tensions over a decision by the Trump administration to block the state out of the investigation into the shooting of Renee Good, who was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week.

Lawyers in the civil rights division, which generally investigates high-profile officer shootings, were also recently told that the section would not be involved in the probe at this stage, two people familiar with the matter said.

The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into Good's killing, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the division out of the investigation marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said.

At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

Concerns over political pressure

The resignations are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations ""a loss for our state and for public safety"" and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics.

Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the civil rights division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday.

The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program ""well before the events in Minnesota,"" and added that ""any suggestion to the contrary is false.""

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the civil rights division has a long history of investigating shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges.

The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what's known as a ""pattern or practice"" investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0e7621b9-d53a-4bc5-95b5-ed33bf43e6ea,1768343522203/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C189%2C2796%2C1572%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-13 22:58:38.049489

Santa Clara County has taken a stand against President Donald Trump in court over the last year, challenging efforts to end birthright citizenship, disrupt federal funding for not complying with Trump’s agenda and more.

The county sued the federal administration nine times in 2025 — and has won favorable rulings in five cases. During Trump’s first term, the county filed seven lawsuits in total. The actions are part of a broader effort of local governments, organizations and states fighting against Trump’s actions. California has sued the administration 53 times so far, including its most recent lawsuit over Trump freezing welfare and child care funding.

“When brazen, politically motivated and unlawful edicts are imposed by fiat — disregarding the rule of law and harming our residents — we have a duty to act,” Otto Lee, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, told San José Spotlight. “We have taken decisive legal action to halt reckless, cruel and arbitrary orders and to protect our communities.”

Trump’s actions are putting $3.6 billion of federal funding at risk in the county every year, according to estimates provided by county officials. A spokesperson for County Executive James Williams said his office isn’t tracking how much is being spent on these lawsuits. The spokesperson said one case has protected $48 million in federal homeless funds, keeping more than 1,800 county residents housed.

“We are fortunate to have one of the strongest public law offices in the nation, steadfastly representing the interests of our county and our community every day,” Williams told San José Spotlight. “Time and time again, we have fought — and won — against the Trump administration in court before, and we will continue to push back against its unprecedented and unlawful overreach, which has only grown more extreme in this second term.”

Here are the lawsuits the county has filed and where they stand.

County of Santa Clara v. Trump

Santa Clara County filed a Jan. 30, 2025 lawsuit to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, calling the order unlawful and unconstitutional.

Trump issued the order within hours of taking office on Jan. 20, calling for the rejection of a 150-year-old constitutional provision stating everyone born in the United States is a citizen regardless of their parents’ citizenship.

The 14th Amendment guaranteed birthright citizenship in 1868, as one of the post-Civil War reconstruction amendments to address the treatment of enslaved people. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the amendment in a 1898 ruling involving a baby born in San Francisco to Chinese parents, which was filed in the same federal court as Santa Clara County’s lawsuit.

The court issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump from ending birthright citizenship.

San Francisco v. Trump

After Trump issued executive orders to deny federal funding to “sanctuary” cities, San Francisco, Santa Clara County and other local governments sued the Trump administration on Feb. 7, 2025. A sanctuary city protects immigrants by limiting local cooperation with federal immigration agents.

A preliminary injunction was granted, protecting the 50 plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit including Oakland, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Portland, Oregon and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The case is ongoing before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“At a time when we continue to see tremendous federal overreach, the court’s ruling affirms that local governments can serve their mission and maintain trust with the communities they care for,” Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti previously said in a statement.

Louisiana v. Department of Commerce

On Jan. 17, 2025 Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and Ohio sued the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Census Bureau, challenging a longstanding rule that counts all residents for the census. The states argued only citizens should be counted in the census. Santa Clara County intervened on Feb. 14, 2025 as a defendant.

The case was temporarily paused to allow time for the new leadership at the Department of Commerce to transition.

American Federation of Government Employees v. Trump

A coalition of labor unions and local governments including Santa Clara County sued Trump on April 28, 2025 in response to an executive order to conduct mass reductions in the workforce and reorganize federal agencies.

A preliminary injunction was granted to block the mass layoffs from happening in the agencies named in the lawsuit, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on June 2, and the justices intervened to allow Trump to continue restructuring the agencies.

The case was vacated and sent back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is being litigated. The federal government must produce a plan for the restructuring as part of the discovery process.

King County v. Turner

Santa Clara County, San Francisco and more than 70 local governments sued the Trump administration on May 2, 2025 for imposing conditions onto grants to align with the president’s policy agenda, including prohibiting programs supporting immigrants, abortion and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

A preliminary injunction was granted, blocking the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services and HUD from imposing these requirements. The case is ongoing before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Department of Health and Human Services issues the most grants of any federal agency, providing funding for child welfare, social services and more. Santa Clara County gets more than $275 million through the department annually.

“The grant funding at stake in this lawsuit is more important than ever in light of the unprecedented federal funding cuts the county is facing,” LoPresti said in a statement. “These grants are essential for the county’s work to deliver lifesaving care at our hospitals and clinics, prevent infectious disease, serve vulnerable children and families and many other services.”

County of Santa Clara v. Noem

Santa Clara County, San Francisco and more than two dozen local governments filed a Sept. 30, 2025 lawsuit challenging the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security for imposing conditions onto emergency funding to comply with Trump’s agenda. A preliminary injunction was granted, blocking the federal administration from withholding funding.

District 2 County Supervisor Betty Duong said the administration’s attempt to cut emergency funding puts thousands of lives in danger, particularly the most vulnerable Americans.

“County of Santa Clara v. Noem is a prime example of the mean-spiritedness and pettiness of the current federal administration,” Duong told San José Spotlight. “I am so proud that our county is a leader in this lawsuit. And I’m also proud that the court agrees with us that the Constitution forbids the Trump administration from forcing local governments to abandon their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in order to receive lifesaving federal funding that has long been critical to safeguarding the safety and resilience of our communities.”

San Francisco v. Department of Justice

Santa Clara County, San Francisco, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona sued the Trump administration on Oct. 28, 2025 in response to the U.S. Department of Justice imposing requirements to comply with Trump’s agenda to receive Community Oriented Policing Services grants. The case is ongoing.

The grants are one of the federal government’s primary sources of funding for local law enforcement agencies, and have allowed jurisdictions to create community policing programs and more. More than $21 billion in grants has been given since the program was established in 1994.

National Council of Nonprofits v. McMahon

The county — along with a coalition of nonprofits, unions and local governments — filed a lawsuit on Nov. 3, 2025 against Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for disqualifying those not aligned with Trump’s agenda from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, including organizations working toward LGBTQ+ rights and racial equity. The case is ongoing.

The loan forgiveness program allows people working in public service and certain nonprofits to have their federal student loans forgiven after 10 years if they have made monthly payments.

National Alliance to End Homelessness v. HUD

The county, San Francisco and other local governments and nonprofits sued the federal administration on Dec. 1, 2025 in its attempt to upend grants dedicated to permanent housing programs.

A judge has temporarily blocked HUD from stripping permanent housing funds and moving it to temporary housing programs.

“At a time when the federal government is taking aggressive action to undermine the Constitution, attack our immigrant communities and strip critical funding for health care and other services, the county has been proud to stand as an example of good government that remains deeply committed to serving our residents,” LoPresti told San José Spotlight. “We’re taking a multifaceted approach to responding to the Trump administration’s policies. Litigation has been — and will continue to be — an important tool for protecting the county’s interests.”

According to the report, DHS intends to build several detention centers across the country, including in Kansas City, to hold approximately 80,000 immigrants. DHS recently awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to an organization that had no previous history of government contracts to facilitate the plan—which is just shy of the $30 million threshold that requires the administration to justify forgoing a competition process for the award.

“Since day one, this administration has fractured communities with ICE raids and severed families with hundreds of thousands of deportations, sweeping up legal residents and American citizens in the process. While we believe strongly in an orderly immigration system, Kansas Citians and I do not want to see the stench of these extreme mass deportation policies centralized in Kansas City,” Congressman Cleaver wrote in a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons.

“No human deserves to be rounded up as cattle, shipped across the country, imprisoned in warehouses, and stripped of their dignity. The proposed plan will degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture,” Rep. Cleaver continued.

“America’s immigration system is far from perfect, and border security is a key component. But those millions of dollars for detention centers would be better spent on finding criminals rather than attacking families and those with no criminal history,” Cleaver concluded.

In addition to condemning the administration’s plans, Rep. Cleaver requested answers to the following questions by January 23:

Has the administration briefed Congress on the plans and locations of these facilities?

Why did the administration pursue a no-bid contract, as opposed to a competitive, transparent application process?

Will the administration provide Congress and the general public with the locations of the proposed facilities?

How has the administration coordinated with local governments? Will the administration honor the local zoning policies and process?

United States two complicated questions concerning federal habeas review.

Federal habeas law allows persons to challenge in federal court the grounds for their detention. It creates separate procedures for state inmates seeking relief from their state convictions in federal court and for federal inmates challenging their federal convictions. Addressing that division, Bowe identified two ways in which the procedures for state and federal inmates differ in federal court.

The case deals with federal inmates who are filing a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (the habeas statute for federal inmates) to challenge their convictions and sentences. In Bowe’s case, he filed multiple motions under Section 2255 seeking to invalidate his guilty plea to a firearm offense resulting from his role in a robbery of an armored car in which two guards were shot. But before a federal inmate like Bowe may file a successive Section 2255 motion, the inmate must satisfy certain gatekeeping requirements. The gatekeeping requirements are described in general terms in Section 2255(h), which sets forth two possible grounds for getting relief in a successive Section 2255 motion – newly discovered evidence of innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court – and identifies procedures for pursuing a successive Section 2255 motion. As to the procedures, which were at the heart of the case, Section 2255(h) says that the successive motion “must be certified [approved of] as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals” before these motions may move forward.

The first question in Bowe addressed what happens if the panel of the court of appeals refuses to grant the inmate permission to file a successive motion (because it fails the gatekeeping requirements), which happened in Bowe’s case. Under one provision in Section 2244 – namely, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(E) – the inmate may not seek further review of an appellate panel’s decision before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court: “The grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application,” according to Section 2244(b)(3)(E), “shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.” One issue in Bowe was therefore whether that provision applies to federal inmates seeking to file a successive Section 2255 motion and whether the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review rulings on such a motion.

Court rejects interpretation that would limit its appellate jurisdiction

To understand the majority’s and dissent’s analyses of whether (or to what extent) Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal inmates, it is helpful to understand both the rules that apply to state – as opposed to federal – inmates and what the other provisions in Section 2244(b)(3) say. (Warning: it’s about to get complicated.)

To begin with, all of the justices agreed that Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to state inmates who file successive petitions seeking federal habeas relief and blocks state inmates from filing petitions for a writ of certiorari (or petitions for rehearing en banc (by the full court)) if a panel on the court of appeals refuses to grant permission to file the successive habeas petition.

The justices also all agreed that the preceding subsections in Section 2244(b)(3)(A) through (D) apply to state and federal inmates. Those provisions require that for an inmate to obtain authorization to file successive petitions from the appropriate federal court of appeals (Section 2244(b)(3)(A)), the authorization: (1) should be decided by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals (Section 2244(b)(3)(B)); (2) that the successive petition must make a prima facie case of satisfying the requirements for a successive habeas petition (Section 2244(b)(3)(C)); and (3) that the appellate panel should decide within 30 days of the inmate’s filing whether to grant or deny permission to file the successive petition (Section 2244(b)(3)(D)). The justices also seemed to agree that the bar on filing en banc petitions in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to both state and federal inmates.

But by a 5-4 vote, the justices held that the clause in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) barring certiorari petitions applies to state inmates only, and federal inmates may thus still seek Supreme Court review if the court of appeal’s panel denies them authorization to file a successive Section 2255 motion.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, began by invoking a principle that Congress must provide a “clear indication” in a statute before removing the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction and it had not done so here. Justice Sotomayor denied “that this clear-indication requirement comes from ‘thin air’” (as asserted in Justice Neil Gorsuch’s dissenting opinion). In addressing the clear-indication rule, the majority focused on a handful of Supreme Court opinions from the last several decades that briefly discuss the subject. Given that the issue implicates fundamental questions about the relationship between Congress and the Supreme Court, this discussion is surprisingly abbreviated, however. The court further invoked avoiding harsh consequences to habeas petitioners, but that rationale neither distinguishes federal from state inmates nor explains how its review of overwhelmingly nonprecedential decisions is particularly helpful to inmates.

Turning to how to apply the clear-indication rule, the majority did not dispute a variety of features of the habeas statutes that point toward Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applying to federal inmates: the statutory scheme overall limits successive habeas petitions; is designed to make adjudication of applications to file successive motions relatively speedy; and strips Supreme Court review for state inmates of a denial of permission to file a successive habeas petition. Also, closely neighboring provisions in Section 2244(b)(3)(A) though (D) apply to federal inmates.

Against those considerations, Justice Sotomayor relied on not only the clear-indication rule, but also stressed that when Section 2255(h) cross-references Section 2244, it does so by referring to what the court of appeals panel must do, not what the Supreme Court must do.

Gorsuch’s dissent, which Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas joined in full and which Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined as to the jurisdictional issue, relied on the language and structure of the habeas statutes in arguing that all of Section 2244(b)(3) applies to federal inmates. As Gorsuch summarized, “§2244 bars state prisoners (and governments) from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction to challenge adverse certification decisions. Section 2255 extends that bar to federal prisoners. And because that bar applies here, we lack jurisdiction to decide this case.”

Court rejects that statute barring inmates from refiling the same claim applies to federal inmates

After determining that the court possessed jurisdiction over Bowe’s petition, the justices turned to whether 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(1) applies to federal inmates. The majority concluded that it did not.

According to Section 2244(b)(1), “[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under Section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.” Here, the court emphasized that Section 2244(b)(1) expressly refers to “Section 2254,” which governs only state inmates, not federal ones. Although the court rejected for several reasons that Section 2244(b)(1)’s bar on refiling the same claim applies to federal inmates, the court allowed in footnote 10 that common-law standards, like abuse of the writ, may still preclude “repetitive filings made by federal prisoners in the absence of § 2244(b)(1).” That said, little binding precedent elaborates on when common-law standards bar an inmate from raising a claim again – and the court thus left that issue unresolved.

Implications

Based on the above, the effects of Bowe will likely be limited. Although the case deals with a law stripping the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction – a matter of great importance – few other statutes do so. That said, if Congress seeks to strip jurisdiction in the future, it now knows that it must say so clearly.

As to habeas litigation, many practical considerations ought to limit how often the court agrees to review the denial of an application for a successive petition, including the stringent standards in Section 2255(h), statutes of limitations, and mootness, to name just a few. Indeed, for some of these reasons and others, it is unclear whether Bowe will lead to meaningful relief for Bowe himself on remand. Some features of Bowe may nevertheless engender further litigation in the lower courts. For example, parties may dispute whether the court left in place the bar on en banc review in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) for federal inmates. Presumably, the clear-indication rule deals with the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and therefore does not apply to en banc review in a court of appeals, but defendants will point to ways that Sotomayor’s opinion could be read as stopping short of deciding the issue.

In short, Bowe is unlikely to yield seismic change in habeas litigation, but the breadth of the court’s discussion of habeas law may make it relevant to a variety of habeas issues.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/supremecourt-2-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 22:58:59.997992

Renee Nicole Good was shot by ICE officer Jonathan Ross during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation and deemed a ""domestic terrorist"" by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shortly after the incident.

Vice President JD Vance called Ross's actions ""self-defense,"" and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed the media for smearing an ICE agent who ""properly defended himself from being run over by organized leftist protesters.""

Federal sources previously claimed Renee Good was involved with an activist group described as part of an “ICE Watch” network — organizations that train volunteers to monitor ICE operations and, in some cases, attempt to interfere with enforcement activity tied to President Trump’s nationwide immigration crackdown.

Becca Good released a statement last week explaining that she and her wife ""stopped to support our neighbors"" when a tense confrontation with ICE agents broke out, leading to the shooting.

At least five tribal citizens were reportedly detained by ICE last week in Minneapolis, reported ICT, an Indigenous news organization. Four are citizens of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the fifth is a descendant of the Red Lake Nation, the news organization reported.

Reports of Indigenous people being targeted by ICE agents prompted Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear to issue a public safety alert on social media Friday.

ICE intensifies Twin Cities operation after killing of Renee Good, protests

Standing Rock is working on a designated telephone line to ensure tribal members know their rights if they come into contact with immigration agents, Sitting Bear said in a statement.

“Our Nation is a sovereign government and our members are not immigrants,” he said. “We are not subject to immigration enforcement on our own lands.”

The Spirit Lake Nation and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate in a joint statement with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe said ICE’s activities in Minnesota have “caused fear and uncertainty” among their citizens.

The joint statement also condemned the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

“As Dakota people, we are reminded of the sacrifices of our ancestors and the enduring impacts of displacement and violence experienced by our Nations,” the tribes said.

Tribal governments have advised tribal members to carry tribal identification cards, certificates of degree of Indian blood or other official documentation.

The warnings come as at least 2,000 ICE agents are in neighboring Minnesota, with Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem reportedly ordering additional federal agents to the area.

“As tribal nations, our fundamental rights are not granted, they are inherent and written in our treaties, our sovereignty, and our laws,” North Dakota Native Vote Deputy Director Kendyl Harrison said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Any attacks or discrimination on any Indigenous person is a clear violation and intrusion upon those rights.”

Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure in a Facebook post also denounced ICE’s activity as “divisive and abhorrent.” He told tribal citizens that ICE cannot go on tribal land without the consent of the tribe.

In addition to the incidents in Minneapolis, ICE reportedly detained multiple Arizona tribal citizens last year, with one woman nearly being deported in November, according to the Arizona Mirror.

Tribal leaders also urged citizens who are approached by immigration agents to contact their respective tribal governments, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Native American Rights Fund.

“We’re seeing the same reports that Native people are being unlawfully detained as U.S. citizens,” said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. “It appears that there is certainly unlawful force and violence being used in these detentions.”

He said the organization is investigating the reports. Campbell invited any tribal citizen who has been detained by ICE to contact his organization.

“We certainly welcome speaking to them to understand the issues and what has been happening, and looking at what a lawsuit may look like,” he said.

Texas is slated to potentially see two new detention facilities in the eastern portion of the state, bringing the total number of facilities to seven.
He elaborated further, emphasizing his distaste for Kansas City having any association with said immigration processes.
However, the latest news about the nearly $30 million contract with KPB, the Washington Post’s report and Cleaver’s letter to top DHS officials place Kansas City at the center of the debate.
While the contract is public record and lawmakers are reacting, it is still unknown when and where this facility could be built in Kansas City or the surrounding area.","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have introduced plans to build a “mega” detention center large enough to hold 5,000-10,000 immigrant detainees in Kansas City, according to government documents.

A public database tracking U.S. government contracts and spending shows that on Nov. 28, 2025, DHS and ICE awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to KPB Services LLC, a Holton, Kansas-based company owned and operated by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.

The contract description states that KPB would be responsible for “due diligence services and concept design for processing centers and mega centers throughout the United States.”

These records coincide with a December 2025 report from the Washington Post, which describes a large-scale immigration enforcement operation spearheaded by the Trump administration to renovate seven industrial warehouses across the U.S.

The administration’s goal is to transform them into detention centers capable of housing approximately 80,000 immigrant detainees (up to 10,000 each) and renovate 16 smaller processing sites. These sites would have enough space for about 500-1,500 people at a time.

This operation is part of the Trump administration’s latest immigration efforts to make deportation operations more efficient for ICE, as they process and transport immigrant detainees in and out of these new facilities.

The Washington Post report lists six states as potential mega center sites, including Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri. Texas is slated to potentially see two new detention facilities in the eastern portion of the state, bringing the total number of facilities to seven.

Since news of the report spread, local politicians, like U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II, issued a statement condemning the DHS’s contract and asking the agency to share more information about its plans.

The long-time representative sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons on Tuesday, in which they stated that the contract with the Kansas-based company raises concerns, as KPB has no prior affiliation or contract with a government agency.

He said he fears a lack of transparency from KPB and that it may not meet the legal and safety requirements necessary to operate under a large-scale federal contract.

Cleaver added that since the Trump administration took over, it has “fractured communities” through its ongoing ICE raids and deportation efforts. He elaborated further, emphasizing his distaste for Kansas City having any association with said immigration processes.

“While we believe strongly in an orderly immigration system, Kansas Citians and I do not want to see the stench of these extreme mass deportation policies centralized in Kansas City.”

“No human deserves to be rounded up as cattle, shipped across the country, imprisoned in warehouses, and stripped of their dignity. The proposed plan will degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture,” Rep. Cleaver further stated.

The local representative concluded that, although he is aware that America’s immigration system is “far from perfect,” he would rather see the money from the nearly $30 million contract go toward “finding criminals rather than attacking families and those with no criminal history.”

Cleaver then added a list of four questions for the administration to answer by Jan. 23:

Has the administration briefed Congress on the plans and locations of these facilities?

Why did the administration pursue a no-bid contract, as opposed to a competitive, transparent application process?

Will the administration provide Congress and the general public with the locations of the proposed facilities?

How has the administration coordinated with local governments? Will the administration honor the local zoning policies and processes?

“Kansas Citians do not want this administration’s reckless, deadly, and incompetent deportation

policies in our back yards,” Cleaver stated in the letter.

“Instead of focusing on the root causes of mass migration and the growing costs of living for Americans, this administration is wasting taxpayer money on no-bid contracts with unqualified LLCs.”

Cleaver’s statement was further backed by Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, who said on Tuesday afternoon that his office is “working to verify press reports of potential DHS or ICE detention facilities in Kansas City.”

He concluded that he “stands in agreement with the words of Congressman Emanuel Cleaver that such a facility would be a stain on Kansas City.”

Over the course of the last year, the Trump administration has repurposed and reopened various facilities across the nation to serve as immigrant holding facilities.

Locally, the city of Leavenworth, Kansas, has been at the forefront of immigration talks, with CoreCivic having filed for a special use permit (SUP) back in December after a lengthy legal battle with the city to reopen and operate a small immigrant detention facility at the site of the former Leavenworth Detention Center.

The Tennessee-based company, which has owned the detention center since 1992, has seen several lawsuits from the City of Leavenworth since its facility shut down in 2021, and it was awarded a contract with ICE last year.

For months, CoreCivic fought the city and its demands that it file for an SUP — a key statute listed in Leavenworth law.

The company tried to claim that its contract with ICE gave it the authority to bypass this ordinance, allowing it to forcefully open the 1,000-person detention facility without the SUP.

However, CoreCivic’s opening was denied by a federal judge in May 2025, and it eventually complied with city law when it filed for the SUP in December.

Over the last year, Leavenworth has been the only local spot that has seen itself in the mix of immigration conversation. However, the latest news about the nearly $30 million contract with KPB, the Washington Post’s report and Cleaver’s letter to top DHS officials place Kansas City at the center of the debate.

Representative David Rouzer has already introduced the Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would make the Trump administration’s policy permanent through legislation.","The lawsuit stemmed from an April letter in which Duffy threatened to withhold billions in transportation funding from states that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell wrote in his November ruling that Duffy and DOT had “blatantly overstepped” their authority in attempting to link highway funding to immigration demands.

“The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior,” McConnell wrote.

What matters for trucking operations is that, while DOT lost this particular fight, the agency has pursued the same policy objectives through entirely different channels. Last week, Duffy announced the cancellation of $160 million in highway funding for California after the state missed a deadline to revoke 17,000 licenses issued to legal immigrants, including refugees and asylum seekers. That’s separate from the $40 million already withheld for California’s refusal to enforce English-language requirements for truckers.

These actions don’t require the same Congressional authorization that DOT sought in the dropped appeal. They’re structured as compliance enforcement actions under existing FMCSA authority, giving the agency a different legal footing entirely.

The Non-Domiciled CDL Situation Remains a Mess

For fleets relying on non-domiciled CDL holders, the regulatory environment has become nearly impossible to navigate. DOT’s September emergency interim final rule, which would have restricted non-domiciled CDL eligibility to only H-2A, H-2B, and E-2 visa holders, effectively eliminating approximately 194,000 drivers from the market, sits frozen under a D.C. Circuit Court stay.

The court’s November 13 order questioned whether non-domiciled CDL holders are actually underrepresented in fatal crashes. According to FMCSA’s own data, while they account for approximately 5% of all CDL holders, they represent only about 0.2% of fatal crashes. The court noted that DOT’s rule was based on five crashes out of more than 2,399 fatal crashes involving large trucks and buses through September 2025.

Even with the court stay in place, most states have chosen not to resume issuing non-domiciled CDLs. California is actively revoking 17,000 licenses it determined were improperly issued. Texas is conducting a full internal review with no timeline for reopening. Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio are proceeding with extreme caution.

Arizona technically resumed issuing non-domiciled CDLs, but only to the narrow categories the stay rule would have allowed anyway, not the broader pre-September eligibility criteria.

What This Means for Motor Carriers

Fleet operators with non-domiciled CDL holders on their roster need to understand that Tuesday’s dropped appeal changes nothing about their immediate operational challenges. The regulatory pressure on immigrant drivers isn’t going away; it’s being applied through different mechanisms.

Current non-domiciled CDL holders aren’t losing their licenses immediately under the stayed rule. But as those licenses come up for renewal over the next two years, FMCSA anticipates that roughly 190,000 of approximately 200,000 current holders would fail to meet the new eligibility requirements. The court stay pauses that outcome but doesn’t resolve it.

Carriers that built capacity around non-domiciled drivers are already reporting disruptions. Spot rates have increased in multiple regions as driver availability tightens, according to industry reports. The U.S. Postal Service announced last week it will require contracted trucking providers to phase out any use of non-domiciled CDL operators who haven’t been thoroughly vetted by the Postal Inspection Service.

Meanwhile, the American Trucking Associations at its November conference made a notable shift, acknowledging that the industry faces a shortage of “quality drivers” rather than an absolute driver shortage. Secretary Duffy has been unambiguous in his position: “We don’t need non-domiciled CDL drivers to make sure our goods flow through the country.”

The States Are On Their Own

The dropped appeal means states can’t be forced to participate in immigration enforcement as a condition of receiving transportation funding. But individual enforcement actions against states for alleged CDL compliance failures continue.

California faces the most aggressive enforcement posture. DOT alleges that more than 25% of non-domiciled CDLs reviewed in the state were improperly issued, with some licenses valid for years beyond the expiration of drivers’ legal presence documentation. State officials dispute the findings and claim California’s CDL holders have a fatal crash rate nearly 40% lower than the national average.

The legal battle will continue through separate proceedings. States that issued non-domiciled CDLs under the previous regulatory framework now face potential funding consequences for compliance failures, regardless of Tuesday’s dropped appeal.

Whats Next

For carriers, the future requires acknowledging that federal policy is actively hostile to non-domiciled CDL holders regardless of their legal status in the country. If you’re running a fleet that relies on non-domiciled drivers, you need a transition plan. That doesn’t mean immediate panic; the court stay provides breathing room, but it does mean recognizing that the current situation is temporary. Either the D.C. Circuit will eventually rule on the merits of DOT’s emergency rule, or Congress will act to codify the restrictions permanently.

Representative David Rouzer has already introduced the Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would make the Trump administration’s policy permanent through legislation. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association supports the bill, arguing it protects “critical safety reforms from being undone by future court decisions or a new administration.”

The dropped appeal on transportation funding doesn’t change any of this. It’s one skirmish in a much larger campaign. Motor carriers would be wise to plan accordingly.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08/Borderlands_Mexico_cargotheft.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:11:51.275985

The entirety of Kristi Noem’s tenure at DHS has marred by the trampling of the department’s stated values of “integrity, vigilance, and respect.""

Americans across the country have witnessed ICE and Border Patrol Agents in masks racially profiling Americans, using aggressive and often violent tactics against communities, destroying property, and violating people's civil rights. Guns have been pointed at protestors, and under Sec. Noem’s “leadership,” eight people have been shot by DHS, 5 of whom were U.S. citizens, and two were killed. One of those killings happened in Minneapolis last week, when an ICE agent shot and killed a mother of three. Instead of ensuring accountability and transparency would be at the center of a joint investigation with state officials, Noem immediately defended the agent, lied about what Americans saw for themselves, and attacked the victim.

At the same time, Secretary Noem has sought to deny Members of Congress access to federally-funded immigration detention facilities, blocking important oversight, especially of privately-run facilities. Her agency has been slow and frequently unwilling to respond to casework inquiries, and she has established a pattern of ignoring Congress in order to obscure what is happening within her agency from the American public. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE detention while she flew around the country for photo ops.

On her watch, DHS violates court orders, fails to hold private contractors accountable, and engages in blatant corruption. She has protected agents who have used excessive force, encouraged antagonism instead of deescalation, and has ignored well-established norms for accountability.

Secretary Noem has weaponized a powerful federal law enforcement agency to create an environment of fear and intimidation across communities in America. She has been untruthful, created a poisonous culture inside DHS, and made America less safe.

Americans should not have to live in fear of their own government.

I support the impeachment of Kristi Noem.

Referendum on justice reform set for 22-23 March; immigration courts could feel impact

The Meloni government confirmed on 12 January that Italians will vote on a constitutional reform separating the careers of judges and prosecutors on 22-23 March.​cite​​turn7view0​​

Supporters argue the overhaul will curb politicised prosecutions and accelerate decisions in economic and immigration cases by clarifying jurisdictional responsibilities. Critics—including magistrates’ unions and centre-left parties—see a power grab that could hamper investigations into migrant-detention conditions and asylum-fraud networks.

If approved, the reform will split the Superior Council of the Judiciary into two bodies chosen partly by lottery, and ban career-switching, a change expected to reduce transfers into overloaded immigration benches. Legal analysts predict an initial slowdown as new appointment rules take effect, followed by faster case-processing once specialised career paths mature.

Amid this shifting legal landscape, organisations and travellers can streamline visa and residence-permit planning through VisaHQ’s Italy portal (https://www.visahq.com/italy/), which tracks regulatory updates in real time and offers end-to-end application support—an asset if new court procedures temporarily slow permit appeals.

For multinational companies, the referendum introduces uncertainty around timelines for challenging work-permit refusals or labour-law fines. Firms with active litigation may wish to accelerate hearings before structural changes take hold. HR teams should follow the campaign closely; a “No” vote could weaken the current coalition and stall parallel migration-law initiatives.

Polling remains tight, and the government has ruled out early elections if defeated, but business-lobby groups worry that prolonged political wrangling could delay secondary legislation needed to implement the 2026 Flow Decree and EU Blue-Card digitisation.

The crisis of missing migrants represents one of the most urgent humanitarian tragedies of our time. Thousands of people have gone missing while attempting to reach safety through migration routes, particularly those fleeing armed conflicts, persecution, poverty, and environmental disasters. According to estimates by the International Organization for Migration, more than 50,000 people have gone missing along migration routes worldwide since 2014, including over 28,000 in the Mediterranean Sea alone. These figures do not merely represent numbers; they reflect shattered lives and families condemned to a state of perpetual uncertainty. Despite the magnitude of this tragedy, the fate of the majority of missing migrants remains unknown, and their families continue to wait—often for years—for any news or evidence that might dispel the darkness of the unknown and put an end to the torment of waiting.

The Mediterranean Sea is considered the most dangerous migration route in the world. Since 2014, it has witnessed the deaths and disappearances of tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, turning it into a vast, open grave. For families, the tragedy does not end with the sinking of a boat or the loss of contact; rather, a prolonged and painful suffering begins, marked by the absence of information, the lack of official recognition, and the failure of states to assume responsibility. Mothers, fathers, spouses, and children remain suspended between hope and despair, unable to mourn, unable to move on, and unable to access their most basic rights, while they await a piece of news or proof that might illuminate the fate of their loved ones and bring closure to an unending ordeal.

Impact of Enforced Disappearance on Families of the Missing

The suffering of victims’ families does not end with the sinking of a boat or the loss of contact; rather, it marks the beginning of a long and bitter phase of suffering for the families of the missing. Families live in a state of chronic uncertainty, described in psychology as “ambiguous loss,” in which the family does not know whether it should mourn the missing person or continue waiting for their return. This situation causes severe psychological pain that extends over many years: persistent anxiety and trauma, nightmares and insomnia, feelings of guilt stemming from the inability to know the fate of their sons, daughters, and family members or to save them, and a hope that is repeatedly rekindled and extinguished over time in the absence of any definitive news. Studies have shown that family members of the missing are at heightened risk of mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as a result of remaining trapped in a cycle of doubt and being unable to obtain final answers. Human rights experts have considered that the prolonged psychological suffering imposed by this state of waiting -combined with the failure of authorities to reveal the truth- may amount to cruel or inhuman treatment of families, particularly where there is evidence of officials’ involvement in withholding information or deliberate negligence.

In addition to psychological pain, the disappearance of a family member produces serious social and legal consequences. Families frequently find themselves in legal limbo due to the absence of a death certificate or official proof regarding the fate of the missing person. For example, the wife of a missing person may be deprived of her rights to inheritance or child support and may be legally unable to rebuild her life (such as remarrying) unless a court issues a ruling declaring her husband deceased in absentia. Similarly, children may face difficulties in establishing legal parentage or accessing entitled social assistance. In cases where the missing person was the primary breadwinner, families also suffer economic hardship as a result of the loss of income. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe has noted that the absence of a death certificate for parents can even hinder the swift family reunification of orphaned children with relatives. In addition, families face practical difficulties in searching for the missing: many exhaust their savings communicating across multiple countries with smugglers or witnesses in an attempt to obtain any information about the fate of their loved ones. When the family itself is composed of refugees or migrants, these obstacles multiply, as they encounter language barriers and bureaucratic obstacles in the countries where they search, and may fear approaching authorities due to their irregular legal status or the risk of deportation. This combination of psychological pain, social dislocation, and legal pressure renders the right to know the truth an urgent and vital necessity for these families. It is the only means of breaking the cycle of uncertainty, enabling a degree of psychological closure, and allowing families to move forward in adapting to a new reality, however painful. Knowing the truth- even if it is the death of the missing person- is better for families than living indefinitely in the shadow of the unknown.

The Right to Know the Truth

The United Nations has affirmed that the right to know the truth for victims of gross violations and their families is an independent and fundamental right that is non-derogable. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has concluded that the right to know the truth constitutes an integral part of the effective enjoyment of other fundamental rights and may not be restricted, even in states of emergency. For families of the missing, access to the truth is considered a basic condition for moral recovery and for achieving a form of closure to an open wound. Conversely, the prolonged deprivation of any information regarding the fate of their loved ones, and the maintenance of families in a state of waiting and psychological torment, may amount to inhuman treatment under international human rights law—particularly where the disappearance results from the failure or complicity of the relevant authorities in providing information or conducting investigations.

Accordingly, the right to know the truth is not merely a moral demand made by victims’ relatives; rather, it is an inherent legal right whose content is grounded in the rules of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and which forms part of the victims’ and their families’ right to remedy and justice. International humanitarian law implicitly recognizes this right by obliging parties to conflicts to search for the missing and to inform their families of any available information. Article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977 provides that “the right of families to know the fate of their relatives” must be respected. Although the migration context differs from that of traditional armed conflict, the spirit of this humanitarian rule applies wherever comparable human suffering arises from the disappearance of persons. The United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED) has affirmed that States must guarantee every family’s right to know the fate of their missing relatives and take the necessary steps in this regard—including the establishment of DNA databases, the collection of information on unidentified bodies, their identities and possible burial sites, and enabling families to access such information. Notably, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has indicated, in the context of migration, that systematic failure to comply with duties of search and disclosure—including cases of widespread pushbacks carried out by certain States’ authorities—may amount to enforced disappearance in the legal sense, where State involvement and failure to fulfil obligations are established.

Obligations of International Law and Principles of Responsibility

International laws and instruments impose clear responsibilities on States with regard to cases of missing migrants and victims of irregular migration. The most salient of these obligations and principles may be summarized as follows:

First: The duty to protect the right to life. States bear a fundamental responsibility to protect the lives of all individuals within their legal jurisdiction, without discrimination—including migrants and asylum seekers present on their territory or within their effective control. This requires governments to take proactive measures to prevent avoidable deaths during migration. The European Court of Human Rights has clarified that Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to life) imposes a positive obligation on States to protect the life of everyone within their jurisdiction. In the migration context, this means that States should provide safe and lawful pathways to access asylum procedures, refrain from extreme deterrence policies that force people into dangerous routes, and ensure the availability of effective search and rescue operations on land and at sea to respond promptly to migrants in distress. These obligations also include refraining from any deliberate acts that endanger migrants’ lives, such as pushbacks or ignoring distress calls—practices that are prohibited under international maritime law and may constitute serious violations of the right to life.

Second: The duty to investigate deaths and disappearances. When a disappearance or death of a migrant occurs under unclear circumstances or as a result of violent acts (such as drowning caused by collision or gunfire at borders), the concerned State must conduct an effective and thorough investigation to uncover the circumstances of what occurred. This includes collecting available evidence and information (such as boat wreckage, victims’ belongings, and communication records), hearing the testimonies of survivors and witnesses, and cooperating across borders where incidents span more than one jurisdiction. It also entails efforts to identify victims through forensic and medico-legal examinations. International principles emphasize that investigations into disappearances must be prompt, effective, and independent, with the involvement of families of the missing and the guarantee that they are informed of developments without delay. Failure to conduct serious investigations into migrant deaths or disappearances may itself constitute a violation of the State’s legal obligations and sends a negative message that migrants’ lives are valued less than others—contrary to the principle of the universality of human rights.

Third: The right of families of the missing to know the truth and the State’s obligation to realize it. As noted above, the right to know the truth has increasingly been recognized as an inalienable legal right. In cases of enforced disappearance in the context of human rights violations, this right is considered a State obligation linked to victims’ rights to justice and reparation. In the context of missing migrants, this right also applies—particularly where State actions or policies contribute to the disappearance or increase the opacity surrounding it. For example, authorities’ failure to conduct adequate rescue operations despite having the capacity to do so, the implementation of unlawful pushbacks that forcibly return migrants, or poor border management leading to fatal incidents without documentation—all constitute failures that may engage State responsibility for the disappearance of persons. The United Nations has recognized the right to truth as an independent right that may not be restricted and has affirmed that States are obliged to take effective steps to realize it. These steps include—as highlighted by the Committee on Enforced Disappearances—the establishment of national DNA databases and their linkage to international platforms, the creation of information banks on unidentified bodies and burial sites, and ensuring families’ access to such information to assist in identifying their loved ones. The State’s obligation to disclose the truth to families of the missing extends its duty to provide an effective remedy to victims and their relatives (as stipulated in Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), including the right to receive information regarding the outcomes of investigations and the circumstances of the incident.

Fourth: Obligations under international humanitarian law. In addition to the above, international humanitarian law imposes explicit obligations—within the context of armed conflicts—regarding the search for missing persons and the provision of information to their families. Article 32 of Additional Protocol I (1977) requires parties to a conflict to work to ascertain the fate of missing persons and to inform their relatives. Although missing migrants do not usually fall within the framework of armed conflict, the core values of humanitarian law—particularly respect for human dignity and families’ right to know the fate of their loved ones—apply in situations of humanitarian catastrophe such as the crisis of missing persons along migration routes. From a humanitarian perspective, it is unacceptable that thousands of families remain unable to know what happened to their children simply because the loss occurred outside the context of a traditional armed conflict.

Fifth: International accountability for patterns of violations. Systematic policies or practices that result in deaths and disappearances among migrants may engage international responsibility and require accountability. For example, where a pattern of unlawful pushbacks at a State’s borders is established and contributes to migrants’ disappearance or death without identification, this may constitute a violation of the State’s obligations under human rights law. Such conduct may even fall within the definition of enforced disappearance if its constituent elements are met, particularly where official authorities are complicit or deliberately refrain from providing information. In the European context, the Council of Europe has stressed that those responsible for such violations must not enjoy impunity—whether unscrupulous smugglers or official actors whose actions or omissions contributed to the loss of life. It is worth noting that collective expulsions have been judicially ruled unlawful because they expose migrants to the risk of disappearance and death, and the international community has called for their immediate cessation. Ending the culture of impunity in this area and holding perpetrators accountable will send a clear message that migrants’ lives are neither cheap nor expendable.

Existing Efforts and Gaps in the Response

Despite the gravity of the crisis of missing migrants, the international response remains insufficient, fragmented, and far below the scale of the tragedy. Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed some positive initiatives and growing attention, including, for example:

At the United Nations level, the issue has been strongly placed on the agenda of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. In 2023, more than 200 international civil society organizations launched a joint appeal addressed to the Human Rights Council, calling for the establishment of an independent international mechanism to monitor violations at borders and enhance accountability in cases of migrant deaths and disappearances. This pressure resulted in an unprecedented discussion within the Council on the suffering of families of missing migrants and their right to know the truth. Although no new mechanism has yet been established, the mere presentation of this proposal at this level constitutes significant progress in breaking the wall of neglect surrounding the issue.

At the European regional level, the Council of Europe adopted a qualitative step in 2024 through the adoption of Resolution No. 2569 (2024) by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on missing migrants. The resolution recommended a set of concrete measures, most notably facilitating the issuance of necessary documents for families of the missing (such as certificates of disappearance or legal certificates of absence) to enable them to exercise their rights to inheritance and other rights, and to proceed with family reunification or resettlement procedures where applicable. The resolution also called on member States to appoint national focal points for missing migrants to serve as designated contact entities for inquiries and cross-border coordination regarding cases of disappearance, with these focal points exchanging expertise within a network overseen by the Council’s Special Representative on Migration and Refugees. This aims to enhance the speed of information exchange and cooperation between States when incidents of drowning or disappearance of migrants occur. These steps—although European in scope—represent a model that can be built upon globally to improve governmental responses to the issue of missing persons.

In the field of data and documentation, the Missing Migrants Project of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) constitutes a key tool for monitoring and documenting incidents of death and disappearance during migration. Since its establishment in 2014, the project has documented approximately 56,000 cases of migrant deaths/disappearances worldwide up to 2023, shedding light on hotspots where tragedies are concentrated (foremost among them the Mediterranean). However, the role of this project is limited to the collection of statistical data and does not extend to field search operations or criminal investigations into the fate of missing persons as individuals. It also does not include all cases of disappearance, meaning that while it provides an important general picture, it does not answer families’ questions about the specific whereabouts of their missing loved ones.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement also play an important role through the Restoring Family Links programme. Red Cross offices receive reports from families about their missing relatives and attempt to trace them through international humanitarian networks. They also provide some psychological and social support to families to help them cope with their ordeal. However, these humanitarian search efforts face numerous obstacles, most notably the lack of official information—government authorities often refrain from sharing data for political or bureaucratic reasons—as well as weak cross-border governmental cooperation in many complex cases involving multiple countries. This undermines the effectiveness of the programme in fulfilling families’ right to know the fate of their loved ones.

Some States have taken limited national initiatives. For example, Italy established a special commission to identify the bodies of migrants who drowned off the coast of Lampedusa in the 2013 disaster, using DNA analysis to match victims with samples from their relatives. Spain also established a DNA bank dedicated to relatives of missing migrants in the Canary Islands to facilitate the identification of remains found there. Although these initiatives remain limited in geographic and logistical scope, they represent steps in the right direction and confirm that techniques such as genetic analysis can succeed in determining the fate of missing persons even after many years.

Despite these efforts, major gaps continue to impede the achievement of a comprehensive and genuine solution to this humanitarian tragedy:

Absence of a specialized central international mechanism: Unlike situations of armed conflict—where mechanisms such as the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) were established after the Balkan wars, or the Kosovo Missing Persons mechanism under ICRC supervision, and more recently the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria (IIMP) established by the United Nations in 2023—there is still no international entity dedicated exclusively to missing migrants and to coordinating efforts among States in this field. The proposal to establish an international mechanism to search for missing persons along migration routes has been under discussion for some time but has not yet been translated into practical reality. This institutional vacuum leads to fragmented initiatives and the absence of a clear reference point to which families can turn for assistance in cross-border searches.

Weak cross-border coordination: Most cases of migrant disappearance occur in border areas (such as buffer zones between States), in international waters outside the jurisdiction of any single State, or during long journeys passing through multiple countries. This necessarily requires transnational cooperation among all concerned States—of origin, transit, and destination—to piece together the full picture. Currently, there is a clear deficiency in information-sharing and coordination among the authorities of these countries. Often, one State is unaware that its nationals are among the victims of an incident that occurred in another State, or data-sharing procedures falter due to the absence of a formal and secure cooperation framework. Experts in forensic medicine and disaster management have pointed out that international coordination is among the greatest challenges hindering the identification of migrant victims, given the multiplicity of jurisdictions and the difficulty of tracing missing persons across different systems. Even within a single State, fragmentation of competencies among multiple regions or provinces can complicate identification efforts if no central mechanism exists to unify information.

Lack of legal and procedural frameworks at the national level: Many States lack clear laws or protocols for dealing with cases involving unidentified migrant bodies or migrants missing during migration. For example, national legislation may not oblige forensic authorities to conduct thorough investigations when an unidentified migrant body is found on a shoreline; in some places, burial occurs quickly without analysis or attempts at identification. Several States also lack routine procedures for collecting DNA samples from unidentified bodies or from relatives of missing persons, thereby squandering the opportunity for later identification should new evidence emerge. The European Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that this legislative vacuum and lack of resources have sometimes left the task of identifying victims of maritime incidents to individual efforts, whereas in cases of air crashes or natural disasters, specialized teams and organized international coordination are deployed. This disparate treatment highlights the urgent need to close legal gaps and establish unified standards that take into account the specific context of migration.

Lack of technical and financial resources: Efforts in this field suffer from severe shortages of funding and technical equipment. Searching for missing boats, recovering bodies from deep waters, or conducting DNA tests and cross-border data comparisons all require substantial financial resources and advanced expertise. At present, most of this work relies on voluntary initiatives or limited budgets provided by some States and international organizations, which is entirely disproportionate to the scale of the global problem. The absence of sustainable funding hampers even existing good initiatives and limits their expansion, while discouraging potential new projects due to the lack of support resources.

Politicization of the issue and lack of political will: It cannot be overlooked that the issue of missing migrants has fallen victim to political polarization surrounding irregular migration. Rather than being viewed through a purely humanitarian lens as a matter concerning human lives and the suffering of their families, governmental responses are often influenced by domestic political considerations related to “migration deterrence” and avoiding appearing lenient. Consequently, some States may hesitate to highlight the high number of deaths at their borders to avoid media pressure or demands for compensation and accountability, or out of fear that this might encourage more migrants to come, believing that search and rescue efforts will be undertaken. Experts have pointed out that some governments fear that families’ knowledge of the truth could lead to legal claims against State authorities and demands for compensation for negligence or abuse. Official acknowledgment of large numbers of missing persons may also be considered politically embarrassing and provoke criticism of existing policies. As a result, this issue has largely remained in the shadows, and collective political will to take serious action has been absent despite the ongoing tragedy.

As a result, despite the aforementioned positive steps, the right to know the truth for families of missing persons along migration routes remains far from being fully realized to this day. There is an urgent need for international political will that transcends narrow calculations and adopts a shared humanitarian approach to a tragedy that knows no borders. The international community must act to close existing gaps and place the issue of missing migrants at the forefront of humanitarian priorities, in fidelity to human dignity and the universal rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In the following section, we present specific practical recommendations to advance this approach.

Recommendations

Based on the foregoing facts and legal provisions, this paper presents a set of practical recommendations that we hope will be adopted by the Human Rights Council, Member States, and the international community to support the right of families of the missing to know the truth and to take tangible steps in this direction:

1. Strengthening international cooperation through the activation of existing institutions:

We call for enhanced activation of cooperation and coordination among existing international institutions already engaged with the issue of missing persons. For example, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) possesses advanced technical expertise in managing genetic databases and identification at the international level—acquired through its work in the Balkans and elsewhere—and could play a pivotal role in addressing missing migrants along migration routes. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also has mechanisms for information exchange through the Restoring Family Links network. The same applies to the International Organization for Migration (Missing Migrants Project) and to specialized civil society organizations such as the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), which has collected thousands of DNA samples from families of missing migrants in Latin America and contributed to identifying hundreds of them. We also specifically note the Syrian National Authority for Missing Persons, established in 2025 as a national effort with international support, which swiftly signed a memorandum of understanding with ICMP aimed at building a sustainable and comprehensive mechanism to search for missing persons and clarify their fate in Syria, with a focus on developing the capacities of local experts in criminal investigations, forensic medicine, genetic analysis, and database management. This fruitful cooperation between a national civil authority and international expertise represents a model to be emulated for integrating local and international efforts in addressing the issue of missing persons. Accordingly, the paper recommends that the Human Rights Council call for the establishment of an international coordinating task force under the auspices of the United Nations, comprising representatives of the aforementioned entities (ICMP, ICRC, IOM, IIMP, EAAF, among others), as well as advisors from families and their associations. This task force would organize efforts, distribute roles, and facilitate the exchange of information and resources to ensure the absence of gaps or duplication. The task force should focus exclusively on the global crisis of missing migrants, serving as a global network linking national search and identification bodies with international platforms and establishing unified cross-border procedural standards.

2. Establishing and developing a unified international database linked to national databases, with a focus on DNA:

There is a need to adopt a project for a central database on missing migrants and victims of migration, overseen by a neutral international body such as ICMP or the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This database should include all available information from States and organizations: data on reported missing migrants (names, descriptions, photographs, fingerprints if available, DNA samples from relatives) and data on unidentified bodies recovered (forensic descriptions, distinguishing features, fingerprints, post-mortem DNA samples). Linking these data globally would enable rapid matching through computational technologies, potentially resolving thousands of unresolved cases and identifying many missing persons. We emphasize the role of DNA testing in identification processes: experience has shown that comparative genetic analysis is the most reliable method, particularly when bodies are decomposed or disfigured. Accordingly, national DNA banks should be established in destination and transit States to collect samples from survivors and relatives of the missing, securely linked to the international database. States should also be required to collect DNA samples from survivors of shipwrecks immediately upon reaching safety, following informed consent (especially survivors of incidents in which others went missing), for two purposes: first, to compare them with samples from families who reported missing relatives (in case some survivors were themselves reported missing by families unaware of their survival); and second, to use them as references for identifying other victims (for example, when one family member survives and another drowns, the survivor’s DNA can help identify the drowned relative’s body). Linking national databases regionally and internationally—with strict safeguards for privacy and personal data protection—would constitute a major breakthrough in efforts to clarify fate, fulfilling the call long made by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement for a global system to register missing migrants. In this context, existing tools such as Interpol’s databases on missing persons and unidentified bodies can be utilized by feeding them with new information and ensuring access for relevant authorities in each State.

3. Improving cross-border cooperation in search and investigation operations:

The threads of a missing migrant’s case are often spread across several countries—the country of origin where the family initiates the search, the transit country where the incident may have occurred, and the destination country that may hold some information or remains. Progress can therefore only be achieved through bilateral and regional cooperation agreements that remove bureaucratic obstacles to information exchange and joint investigations. The paper recommends that concerned States, particularly in the Mediterranean and Europe, initiate specific agreements for cooperation in boat sinkings and border death cases. These agreements should provide for rapid information-sharing mechanisms (such as the secure exchange of fingerprints, biometric data, and forensic reports) and for the possibility of forming joint investigation teams in major incidents affecting more than one State. Countries of origin (from which migrant victims originate, such as Arab and African States) should also be involved by appointing focal points in embassies and consulates to facilitate information transmission to families and coordination in the transfer of bodies or samples. Particular emphasis is placed on the responsibility of coastal States at points of departure—such as Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Türkiye, and Greece—which must be legally and ethically bound to intensify search and rescue efforts in their territorial waters and designated search and rescue (SAR) zones, and to exert every effort to identify those who perish on their shores. These States have, de facto, become the first line of confrontation in the Mediterranean tragedy and must cooperate transparently with destination States and international organizations in documenting shipwrecks and local burials. They must also cease any dangerous or hostile practices toward migrant boats—such as deliberately ramming boats or forcibly pushing them back—since such acts violate international maritime law and the right to life and have caused preventable deaths. We call on the Human Rights Council to appoint a Special Coordinator on Missing Migrants to facilitate international communication, urge States to cooperate, and monitor the implementation of relevant cross-border agreements and protocols.

4. Making investigation and accountability mandatory and ensuring no impunity for perpetrators:

States must align their national legislation to mandate the immediate and comprehensive investigation of any migrant death or disappearance within their jurisdiction, just as any death of a citizen within the country would be treated. The law should clearly stipulate the responsibility of competent authorities (naval forces, border guards, police, forensic services) to collect and examine evidence in such incidents—including boat debris, victims’ phones and belongings, and survivor testimonies—in addition to conducting autopsies and DNA testing and comparing results with missing persons data. Authorities should also prepare public reports announcing investigation findings and causes of incidents, as transparency is an integral part of the right of society and victims’ families to know the truth. Legal frameworks must include the possibility of holding accountable any entity proven to have contributed to the death or disappearance, whether unscrupulous smuggling networks whose negligence or criminal acts caused the disaster, or State agents who acted unlawfully (such as coast guard personnel who used violence against migrant boats or officials who deliberately ignored distress calls). Ending the culture of impunity in this context requires criminalizing acts that deliberately endanger migrants’ lives. We therefore recommend explicitly criminalizing the failure to render assistance to persons in distress at sea, holding accountable any ship captain or official who knew of a distress situation and failed to act to save lives. Likewise, failure to report any known sinking or disappearance should be criminalized as a complicity that deprives families of their right to know. Sending firm messages through prosecution of those responsible will affirm that migrant lives are not expendable and will ensure a minimum level of justice for their families. In this context, we also call on States to cooperate with international accountability mechanisms—such as universal jurisdiction or UN investigative mechanisms where appropriate—with respect to violations of migrants’ rights at their borders, to ensure that no accountability gaps allow perpetrators to evade justice.

5. Ensuring the effective participation of families of the missing in search and investigation processes:

Families who have lost relatives during migration have the right to be genuine partners in efforts to investigate and determine fate. States concerned—particularly transit and destination States where incidents occurred—should therefore be obliged to involve families of the missing at all relevant stages. This includes enabling families to submit any information or evidence they possess (such as dental records, distinguishing marks, or DNA samples) and listening to their testimonies regarding last contact with the missing person and their expected route. Authorities must also inform families regularly and without undue delay of investigation developments and results. International principles, including the Human Rights Committee’s General Comments, have emphasized that families’ right to know the truth about the fate of their relatives is inalienable, and that authorities have a duty of transparent communication with rights-holders. Accordingly, the paper recommends appointing liaison officers or contact persons within investigative bodies whose role is to communicate with families of the missing, keep them informed of updates, and involve them in decisions related to the fate of remains (such as consulting families on burial locations once a body is identified). Translation and logistical services should also be provided to ensure that language or geographical barriers do not hinder family participation—for example, facilitating visas and providing travel and accommodation support when families from another country are summoned to identify a body or give testimony. Treating families with respect and involving them effectively not only fulfills a humanitarian dimension but also enhances the effectiveness of investigations, as families often hold critical pieces of information that can assist authorities when assembled.

6. Empowering families of the missing and supporting survivors (psychologically, socially, and legally):

Families of missing migrants suffer from complex psychological and social crises, as previously noted, and require support and accompaniment throughout the long search process. This paper therefore recommends that States, in cooperation with international organizations, establish contact centers or dedicated offices to communicate with families of the missing and victims of migration. These offices should be tasked with receiving families’ disappearance reports and officially registering them, providing updated information on any progress in search operations or criminal investigations, offering legal guidance on available procedures (such as how to obtain a judicial declaration of absence or death after a certain period, or how to access entitlements and documents), and delivering psychological and social support through professionals—particularly to children and women—to help families cope with trauma. Special attention must also be given to survivors of tragic shipwrecks, who often suffer from acute psychological trauma and survivor’s guilt, requiring professional mental health care immediately upon arrival. States, in cooperation with relevant bodies and organizations, must therefore provide sustainable psychosocial rehabilitation programmes for survivors, with particular consideration for the most vulnerable groups, such as women who lost children or experienced violence during the journey, and child survivors who lost caregivers and require specialized support and care. We urge the ICRC, given its global presence, to ensure continuity of psychosocial support across different phases of movement, so that if survivors or families move from one country to another, their follow-up is transferred to the Red Cross or Red Crescent branch in the new country without interruption. Regarding contact centers, these should also provide multilingual hotlines to receive families’ inquiries from any country and facilitate communication with authorities. We further propose the establishment of an international assistance fund, contributed to by affluent States and donors, dedicated to covering families’ expenses during the search process—such as DNA testing costs, travel to identify bodies, or repatriation for burial—particularly for families with limited resources. Providing such material and moral support constitutes a humanitarian and ethical obligation of the international community toward those who have endured prolonged suffering while awaiting the truth.

7. Promoting safe migration pathways and preventing the recurrence of tragedies:

In the long term, the root solution to reducing the number of missing persons lies in preventing the tragedy from occurring in the first place by creating safe alternatives for migration and asylum. Numerous international organizations, including the International Organization for Migration and the Council of Europe, have called for the provision of regular pathways through which those seeking asylum or humanitarian migration can reach their destination without risking their lives across seas or deserts. These alternatives include increasing resettlement quotas for the most vulnerable refugees, opening humanitarian visa programmes or safe transit corridors coordinated between countries of origin and destination, and simplifying family reunification procedures through embassies instead of forcing families into dangerous journeys. The tightening of deterrence and pushback policies has proven ineffective in stopping migration; it has only driven people toward more dangerous routes, as statistics confirm. Accordingly, concerned States—especially in Europe—must review their policies and prioritize saving lives and preventing deaths as a supreme objective that takes precedence over border control considerations. It is ethically unacceptable to allow people to die of thirst in deserts or drown at sea under the pretext of sending a deterrent message to others. Adherence to the principle of non-refoulement and respect for human dignity must remain central to any migration management approach. In this regard, we recommend that the Human Rights Council encourage States to sign multilateral and bilateral agreements to fairly share responsibilities for rescue and reception—for example, as seen in European agreements on the disembarkation of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean on a rotational basis among different States. Ultimately, prevention is better than cure: providing safe options will directly reduce incidents of death and disappearance and alleviate the burden on search, rescue, and investigation mechanisms that consume extensive resources.

8. Honoring victims and preserving collective memory:

As part of respecting the right to truth and ensuring non-repetition, it is important for the international community and concerned States to take steps to document the memory of migrants who died or went missing during these journeys of hope. The paper recommends that States establish memorials or name plaques at appropriate sites (such as unidentified graves or coastal cities that witnessed major incidents) to commemorate the lives of those who perished while seeking a better future. International memorial gardens jointly funded by multiple States could also be established as symbols of cross-border human solidarity. In terms of awareness-raising, we call for annual events on the International Migrants Day (18 December) to highlight the issue of missing migrants and the suffering of their families, with official participation from governments and civil society organizations. Public acknowledgment of the scale of the tragedy and the pain of families breaks the wall of indifference surrounding this issue and increases public pressure on decision-makers to act and take necessary measures to prevent recurrence. A European newspaper once published a list of 34,000 migrants who died at the gates of the continent as a form of moral wake-up call; such initiatives are commendable and should be repeated and expanded officially, as assigning a name and identity to each number in the missing persons tally preserves victims’ dignity and reinforces the reality that they are not mere statistics, but human beings with stories and dreams cut short by borders.

9. Ratifying relevant international conventions and closing legal gaps:

Finally, we urge States—particularly transit and destination countries in Europe and elsewhere—to accede to core international instruments that strengthen the right to know the truth and combat impunity. Foremost among these is the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance of 2006, which to date has been ratified by only 68 States. This Convention obliges States to criminalize enforced disappearance, guarantee families’ right to know the fate of their relatives, and establish effective search mechanisms. Ratifying it and incorporating its principles into national legislation—including explicit recognition of families’ right to know and criminalization of information concealment—would send a strong message of States’ commitment to closing legal gaps in dealing with missing persons. We also recommend that States support the development of a new international protocol, if necessary, specifically addressing missing persons and deaths during cross-border migration. Such a protocol could establish binding standards for States regarding joint search efforts, data exchange, identification of remains, respectful handling of bodies, and protection of families’ rights across different judicial frameworks. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has recently proposed developing global guidelines to protect the rights of deceased migrants; this call can be built upon to develop a more comprehensive legal instrument. The existence of a clear international legal framework would remove much of the current ambiguity and strengthen State accountability and adherence to unified procedures, rather than leaving matters to disparate national practices. We also call on States of origin of refugees to establish national mechanisms to search for missing persons, following the example of Syria in establishing the National Commission for Missing Persons in Syria (NCMP), which, within its mandate, follows up on the cases of Syrian refugees outside Syria.

Taken together, these recommendations constitute a humanitarian and legal action plan that must be urgently translated into reality. We appeal to the forthcoming Human Rights Council and all concerned States to adopt and politically and logistically support these proposals. We also call for the establishment of a follow-up mechanism within the Human Rights Council to monitor the implementation of these measures, such as appointing a Special Rapporteur or expert group on the right to know the truth for missing migrants, to ensure sustained momentum and the translation of words into action. It is time for the suffering of thousands of families to no longer remain in the shadows, and for their right to truth to become a tangible reality safeguarded and protected by concerted international efforts. Let us finally grant these mothers, fathers, and children the answers they deserve, and honor the memory of those we lost by transforming the story of their tragedy into a catalyst for change and prevention. Human dignity is indivisible—and the dignity of every family in knowing the fate of its missing child is part of the dignity of us all.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota have resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division have given notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, according to people familiar with the matter.

The resignations follow growing tensions over a decision by the Trump administration to block the state out of the investigation into the shooting of Renee Good, who was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week. Lawyers in the Civil Rights Division, which generally investigates high-profile officer shootings, were also recently told that the division would not be involved at this stage in the probe, two people familiar with the matter said.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison likened the deployment of ICE agents to a “federal invasion.”

Attorney General Keith Ellison: “Deployment of thousands of armed, masked DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop. DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area and in cities across the state of Minnesota.”

The lawsuit was filed Monday, five days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, sparking nationwide protests. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried the actions of the federal agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement. We are not asking ICE not to do ICE things. We are asking this federal government to stop the unconstitutional conduct that is invading our streets each and every day. You’ve seen the videos. At times, there are as many as 50 agents arresting one person. The scale is wildly disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe.”

The state of Illinois has also sued the Trump administration over use of federal forces in the state.

Iran says it is prepared for war but ready to negotiate, as the Trump administration considers attacking Iran over Tehran’s crackdown on the recent mass protests. Trump is expected to be briefed today on options including launching strikes inside Iran and offensive cyberattacks. On Monday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that conduct business with Iran, including China, India, Turkey and Pakistan.

The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights says at least 648 protesters have been killed over the past two weeks. An Iranian official also reported today the number of dead could be as high as 2,000. We will have more on Iran later in the show.

In other news from Gaza, a headstone has finally been placed on the grave of Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer, more than two years after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on December 6, 2023. His body wasn’t recovered until 10 months ago. Inscribed on the headstone are the closing lines of his most famous poem: “If I must die, / Let it bring hope; / Let it be a tale.”

A bipartisan group of former Treasury secretaries and other top economic officials has blasted the Trump administration for launching a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The probe was set in motion after Powell refused Trump’s demands to lower interest rates. The former officials described the investigation as an “unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine” the independence of the Federal Reserve. Signatories to the letter include former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. The Wall Street Journal reports Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately warned Trump the move to investigate Powell could backfire.

The House Oversight Committee is facing growing criticism for voting to subpoena the prominent investigative journalist Seth Harp after he posted publicly available information about a Delta Force commander who reportedly played a role in the recent U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Harp is the author of the book “The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces.” On Monday, 20 press freedom and First Amendment groups, including the ACLU and Reporters Without Borders, called on the House committee to rescind the subpoena, saying Harp’s reporting is “fully and squarely within the protections of the First Amendment.” This is Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights and Dissent.

Chip Gibbons: “The subpoena against Seth Harp has few parallels in recent memory. We have to remember Seth Harp has done some of the most important investigative reporting on U.S. foreign policy. It’s been critical reporting. The House knows full well the dangers to press freedom that subpoenaing a journalist poses. That’s why in 2024 they actually passed legislation to prevent executive branch subpoenas against journalists about their news gathering.”

The New York Times is reporting the Pentagon may have committed a war crime by using a secret aircraft painted to look like a civilian plane to attack a boat in the Caribbean in September. Eleven people died in the attack. The Trump administration claimed, without offering proof, that the boat was carrying drugs. Under international law, it is a war crime to commit what’s known as “perfidy” — disguising military equipment as civilian.

Russia launched another massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, launching nearly 300 drones, as well as 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles. The attack targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving thousands more without heat. Four people were killed in Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, a U.N. monitoring group says about 2,500 Ukrainian civilians were killed last year, making it the deadliest year yet for civilians since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.

In Sudan, the UAE-backed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a drone strike on a Sudanese army base in the southeastern city of Sinjah on Monday. Twenty-seven people were reportedly killed. The attack came a day after Sudan’s military-led government returned to the country’s capital Khartoum after operating in the eastern city of Port Sudan for nearly three years. The government’s return comes nearly a year after the military recaptured Khartoum from the RSF.

In labor news, nearly 15,000 nurses have launched the largest nursing strike in New York City history. Striking nurses have accused management at six private New York hospitals of refusing to negotiate fair contracts that improve safe staffing, fully fund health benefits and protect them from workplace violence. Striking nurses picketed outside NewYork-Presbyterian and other hospitals on Monday.

Striking NYC Nurse: “I am fighting for my healthcare insurance. I don’t know how I can be here working at a hospital that will not give me health insurance. It is so important for me to have health insurance. It’s so important to take care of the community. I love being a nurse. I want to take care of patients. I want to be at bedside. And it’s so important for us to strike, because we are fighting for patient safety.”

I demand that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cease all operations in Minnesota immediately to allow local law enforcement officials to return to protecting our community from further violence and conduct a full and transparent investigation into ICE’s actions and conduct which caused this horrific shooting.

“My constituents are deeply troubled, and many are fearful of the dramatic chaos and unrest being stoked as a direct result of the Trump administration’s tactics of ordering more than 2,000 ICE and DHS agents to Minnesota to racially profile and arrest people in their homes, their workplaces, their schools, and on our streets. The outrageous and unprofessional behavior exhibited by ICE and other federal immigration agencies is not only making our neighborhoods, our cities, and our state more dangerous for everyone, it is making it more difficult for local law enforcement to conduct their daily work to protect and serve our community. Our children have a right to be safe at school, at home, and in our community. As parents and adults, it is our solemn responsibility to protect our children and our neighbors from violence. It is unconscionable this now includes violence perpetrated by our own government.

“Additionally, since December, I have been contacted by constituents and public officials who are deeply concerned about reports in the Washington Post and other publications that ICE is actively soliciting warehouse space to hold as many as 1500 detainees in Woodbury, Minnesota, located in my congressional district, and other communities across the country. Inquiries made to DHS/ICE by local officials have gone unanswered as they seek answers to their many questions about these reported plans.

“According to comments by ICE acting director Todd M. Lyons at a border conference in April, the Trump administration’s goal is to deport immigrants like Amazon moves packages: ‘Like Prime, but with human beings.’ Not only is this plan dehumanizing, it fails to account for the fact that structures designed for storage and shipping are not fit for human habitation, because they lack adequate ventilation and temperature controls.”

If the ICE officer who shot and killed Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week is not prosecuted criminally, or even if he is, can he also be sued?

Legal experts have different takes. Last week I spoke with a police misconduct attorney in Minnesota who seemed hopeful about the odds Good’s family might face in court. Others I spoke with were somewhat less optimistic. Winning lawsuits against cops who kill “is challenging by design,” as Michelle Lapointe, legal director of the American Immigration Council, an immigrant rights advocacy group, wrote on the group’s website.

To flesh that out, I caught up with Lauren Bonds of the National Police Accountability Project, a national group that works with civil rights attorneys to file lawsuits over police misconduct. Our conversation below, edited for length and clarity, explores the legal hurdles to beating an ICE officer like Good’s killer, Jonathan Ross, in civil court.

It’s notoriously tough to sue police, but it’s even harder when the officer is federal. What are the challenges?

You’re absolutely right: All the problems you have with suing a regular law enforcement officer exist, and then you have additional barriers. There are two distinct pathways to sue a federal officer for misconduct or excessive force: One is a Bivens action—a court-created pathway that allows you to sue federal agents for constitutional violations. And then there’s the Federal Tort Claims Act, a statutory provision that allows for these lawsuits to move forward.

The problem with Bivens is it’s been really, really narrowed in recent years by this particular Supreme Court. First there was Hernandez v. Mesa, a 2020 case where a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a child on the other side of the border in Mexico. And the court said it didn’t fit within the narrow confines of Bivens. And then there was a case in 2022, Egbert v. Boule, that foreclosed any new Bivens action: Basically the court said that this type of civil rights violation is something you can pursue under Bivens, but if it’s anything new, we’re not going that far.

The Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA) is where more people are going to get relief for violations by federal officers. It basically says that any tort that you would suffer under state law [such as false arrest, assault, or battery] you can sue the federal government for—with vast exceptions: There’s one that comes up a lot for law enforcement cases, the “discretionary function” exception, which says an officer can’t be sued for anything that he or she needs to use discretion for. Courts have done a good job of interpreting that to mean discretion in terms of policymaking decisions, but some courts get it wrong. So those are the two pathways—they’re both narrow, and they’re both complicated.

There’s the issue of qualified immunity for police officers, or even sovereign immunity for the federal government, right?

Sovereign immunity [a legal principle that says the federal government can’t be sued without its consent] wouldn’t come up in an FTCA case, because it’s a statute in which Congress waived sovereign immunity and agreed to be sued under certain circumstances. It does come up as a defense when [the government is] saying, Oh, this case falls within an exception, but they can’t assert it otherwise.

If you were to file a constitutional claim under Bivens, they could invoke qualified immunity, another protection that law enforcement officers have; it asks whether there is case law in the circuit that would have put the officer on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional. [If not, the officer is essentially off the hook.]

A lot of courts have taken that requirement to an extreme place, basically saying it’s got to be identical facts—like there are cases that have been thrown out on qualified immunity because a person was sitting with their hands up versus standing with their hands up. That level of granularity has been applied to defeat civil rights claims. And so it’s a difficult barrier to overcome.

Given how hard it can be to sue, what about criminal charges?

It’s definitely possible. There isn’t any immunity from criminal prosecution that federal officers are entitled to, none that I’m aware of anyway. I know this issue came up when some ICE raids were planned to take place in San Francisco back in early fall, with the DA of San Francisco asserting that she did have authority to pursue criminal action against ICE agents if they broke California laws.

What about the Supremacy Clause? It protects federal officers from state prosecution if they were performing their federal duties, right?

The Supremacy Clause protects federal officers when they’re engaged in legal activity, and so if their conduct is illegal, they wouldn’t be protected. So in Minneapolis, if the officer engaged in a Fourth Amendment violation, he’d be beyond the protection of the Supremacy Clause.

This issue has come up with California, too. The Trump administration is suing California over new state legislation that would create a crime for wearing a mask and obscuring your identity if you’re a law enforcement officer. And it’s suing Illinois [for a state law that allows residents to sue ICE agents in certain circumstances]. Those lawsuits have asserted that the Supremacy Clause makes these [state] laws unconstitutional—that you can’t take any action against federal law enforcement officers under state law.

Have you heard of cases in this past year of ICE officers being sued or prosecuted for misconduct?

I haven’t seen any prosecutions yet. In terms of lawsuits, we’ve seen an increase in FTCA cases against DHS agents.

Regarding the recent killing in Minneapolis, what do you see as the main path to accountability, and the main challenges?

There’s going to be all the standard barriers that we talked about, including the Supremacy Clause defense, particularly because you have so many high-ranking federal officials, including the president and Secretary Noem, who are saying that this shooting was the right thing to do and was consistent with him carrying out his obligations.

On the civil side, this could be a potentially difficult Bivens or FTCA case. I would note, since we’re on the heels of January 6: Ashli Babbitt, the woman who died during the Capital insurrection, filed a FTCA case, or her family did, and got a $5 million settlement from the government. It’s hard to factually distinguish these cases.

The federal government has authority to settle a case like that, but since the Trump administration is taking a very opposing position against Good, the woman who died in Minneapolis, I would be surprised if they would be willing to put money on the table.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12Jan2026_LaurenBonds.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-13 18:58:52.263512

Statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin:

On Jan. 12, ICE New York City arrested Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela and an employee of New York’s City Council. His criminal history includes an arrest for assault. He had no work authorization.

Rubio entered the United States on a B2 tourist visa in 2017 that required him to depart the U.S by October 22, 2017. He had no legal right to be in the United States.

Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you and we will arrest you.

The other side:

City officials disputed that account Monday, saying Rubio Bohorquez was detained despite complying with immigration requirements. City Council Speaker Julie Menin said the staffer had a valid work visa through October and described his arrest as ""egregious government overreach.""

Featured

Menin said Rubio Bohorquez had gone to what she described as a routine court appointment when he was taken into custody and later transferred to a detention center in lower Manhattan. She said the city was not given an explanation at the time for his detainment.

""Despite every indication that he was doing everything the right way, he still found himself the victim of egregious government overreach,"" Menin said at a Monday evening press conference.

Menin said Rubio Bohorquez has worked in city government for about a year and signed an attestation in January stating he had never been arrested. DHS later contradicted that claim.

Dig deeper:

City leaders said they learned of the arrest after Rubio Bohorquez used his one phone call following detainment to contact the City Council’s human resources department.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani called for Rubio Bohorquez’s immediate release, saying on social media that the detention amounted to ""an assault on our democracy, on our city, and our values.""

U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman said federal authorities were targeting migrants who comply with immigration requirements.

""That is the people who are going to court and going to their check-ins,"" Goldman said.

The arrest comes amid heightened tensions between Democratic officials and ICE over immigration enforcement tactics, including arrests at routine court appointments.

City Comptroller Mark Levine and New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued statements condemning the detainment and calling for Rubio Bohorquez’s release.

What we're watching: Minnesota officials are launching their own investigation into possible state charges against the ICE agent for Good's killing.
Flashback: The 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff raised the same legal knot now dogging the ICE agent shooting.","The investigation into the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good would likely be going very differently if a local police officer, instead of an ICE agent, had pulled the trigger last week in Minneapolis.

Why it matters: A local police shooting usually initiates a multi-agency investigation and the threat of prosecution. An ICE agent shooting is handled almost entirely inside the federal government — where accountability is far harder to reach.

ICE is a relatively young federal agency — created after the 9/11 attacks with fewer guardrails — and hasn't faced the number of court challenges that forced other agencies to rein in their officers.

That's unlikely to change under President Trump. His administration has halted all Department of Justice ""pattern-or-practice"" investigations into police departments accused of excessive force, and likely won't launch one into ICE despite a spike in shootings.

Catch up quick: Video footage of Good's death, watched by millions of Americans, splintered the nation into two irreconcilable camps, with one crying murder and the other terrorism.

Trump accused Good of ""violently, willfully, and viciously"" running over an ICE officer, and said ""it's hard to believe"" the officer survived, though critics said footage showed Good posed no threat.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President Vance also defended the ICE officer, as activists in hundreds of cities nationwide held ""ICE Out For Good"" protests last weekend.

Between the lines: Similar shootings or the use of excessive force by local police officers — when caught on video — are often followed by promises of a thorough investigation by independent agencies or a panel.

If the case is one of many drawing scrutiny of that agency, the DOJ faces pressure to launch a pattern-or-practice probe. That could force a city, county, or state to enter a consent decree on court-ordered reforms aimed at revamping a department, changing hiring standards and agreeing to more oversight.

DOJ's Civil Rights Division has launched dozens of pattern-and-practice investigations into local police departments since the 1990s.

But ICE has never faced one of them.

Zoom in: There have been at least seven ICE officer-involved shootings, two of them fatal, since Trump surged Homeland Security agents in city-by-city operations in early 2025, Axios' Brittany Gibson reports.

An Axios analysis of publicly known ICE excessive force cases shows that before 2025, the agency, on average, had one agent shooting case per year, and sometimes had none.

The big picture: An uptick in alleged abuse since Trump re-entered office should trigger a DOJ pattern-and-practice probe into ICE, Ira Kurzban, a civil rights lawyer and author of ""Kurzban's Immigration Law Sourcebook,"" tells Axios.

A growing number of U.S. citizens — many of them Latinos — have reported getting detained by ICE agents in what critics say are instances of racial profiling and overzealous policing.

Some Native American tribes say ICE immigration agents are harassing tribal members.

""The central question isn't whether they can prosecute. It's whether this Justice Department is willing to act like a Justice Department and actually do it,"" Kurzban said.

What we're watching: Minnesota officials are launching their own investigation into possible state charges against the ICE agent for Good's killing.

Some are accusing the Trump administration of limiting access to materials, interviews and the scene, possibly setting up more legal fights.

Flashback: The 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff raised the same legal knot now dogging the ICE agent shooting.

Why it matters: The issue is resurfacing fundamental divisions over strategy and messaging that have been dogging Democratic lawmakers throughout the second Trump administration.

Reps. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) clashed during a closed-door Democratic leadership meeting Tuesday over Kelly's efforts to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Kelly, a Steering Committee co-chair running in a competitive primary for U.S. Senate, argued that her effort fires up the base, sources said. Lee, the battleground representative to leadership, shot back that an impeachment vote would hurt Democrats in swing districts.

Driving the news: Kelly is not the only one trying to take action.

Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) is introducing a bill called the Quick Recognition Act that would require ICE agents to wear scannable QR codes on their uniforms linking to webpages with their names, badge numbers and other information, his office told Axios.

Democrats are also trying to use the appropriations process to implement policy changes that would constrain ICE.

Some progressives want to go even further, as Axios reported Monday, and refuse to vote to fund the government ahead of the Jan. 31 fiscal cliff unless ICE's funding is slashed.

What they're saying: Lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill this week telling Axios they got an earful from constituents back in their districts about the Minneapolis shooting.

""There were a number of protests about it, very concerned about the lawless nature of what ICE is doing,"" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), adding that the issue is ""at the top of the list of continued incoming to our office.""

""We've gotten calls, letters, people coming up to me, people texting me ... telling me how upset they are about it,"" said Rep. Rob Menendez (D-N.J.).

Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) told Axios that ICE is ""incredibly unpopular"" in her district and that the issue is ""high salience.""

What we're hearing: The topic came up during House Democrats' full caucus meeting Tuesday morning, according to lawmakers who were in the room, but only after leadership spent the first portion of the meeting focused squarely on issues like health care and affordability.

Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) were given time to speak about a field hearing they are holding in Minneapolis on Friday about the Renee Good shooting, which leadership has encouraged members to attend, sources said.

But there was only muted discussion about issues like ICE funding and no talk of impeachment, several lawmakers said.

One House Democrat told Axios that, despite the ICE issue ""popping up because of what just happened,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has been ""masterful"" at keeping the caucus as focused as possible on affordability and not sidetracked by ""shiny objects.""

The intrigue: While efforts to slash funding for ICE or impeach Noem are extreme long shots, some reform to the agency may be very much be on the table.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DHS, said his panel was ""down to a few issues"" in its negotiations on a bill to fund the department when the Renee Good shooting happened.

The incident meant ""that we have to come up with additional language"" to ""provide oversight"" of the agency, he said.

However, the centrist Texas Democrat shut down progressives' musings about going any further: ""We're not going to defund ICE.""

The bottom line: For some members, issues like ICE will simply never break through enough take precedence over kitchen table economic issues.

""It adds to the larger narrative of chaos and concern for this administration,"" said Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), but ICE ""has never been a top three issue"" in his district.

WASHINGTON – Today, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the termination of Somalia’s designation for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The termination will be effective on March 17, 2026.

“Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status,” said Secretary Noem. “Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests.

Somalia’s designation expires March 17, 2026. At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with appropriate U.S. government agencies, must review the country to determine whether the conditions supporting its designation continue to be met and, if so, how long to extend the designation.

Somali nationals who do not have a legal status other than TPS that would allow them to remain in the United States should use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP Home mobile app to report their departure from the United States. The app is a safe, secure way to self-deport and includes a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and the opportunity for potential future legal immigration.

Indianapolis Public Schools has rescinded resolutions signaling support for undocumented students following a lawsuit from state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

Instead, a new proposed policy on student access, safety, and privacy says the district will continue to protect the confidentiality of student records and information while providing “equal access to public education” for all students who live within the district — regardless of immigration status.

The proposal comes in the wake of a November lawsuit from Rokita’s office that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement. Rokita alleged that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country with his son, an IPS student.

Attorneys for IPS have said in court that the district would adopt a new policy that would render the state’s lawsuit moot. The board is expected to vote on the policy proposal at its meeting in February, according to board president Angelia Moore.

The updates could ultimately change little in how the district serves and protects undocumented students, whose rights to education and privacy are already protected by a string of state and federal laws and a U.S. Supreme Court case. The lawsuit, however, claims the district policy violates a state law that prohibits government entities from restricting immigration enforcement.

Neither IPS nor Rokita’s office immediately responded to a request for comment. School board president Angelia Moore declined to comment on the proposed policy, citing the ongoing litigation.

New resolution maintains IPS support for all students

At a retreat on Saturday, the IPS school board rescinded two prior resolutions supporting undocumented students. One was adopted early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and the other was adopted early in his second term, amid high-profile and controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

One 2017 resolution stated the district’s support for creating a safe place for all students regardless of immigration status. It directed employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

Another 2025 resolution reaffirmed this commitment to all students.

But the resolution to rescind these prior commitments still maintains that the district supports all students and employees. It also references a variety of state and federal laws to protect immigrant families, including the federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

The resolution also references the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. Legal experts say Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can only enter school grounds under certain circumstances.

And the resolution references the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe that undocumented students have a right to public education.

The proposed IPS policy states that IPS will operate within the legal framework provided by the United States Constitution, the state constitution, federal and state civil rights laws, federal education privacy laws, and Indiana statutes on public education.

The superintendent will adopt training and protocols for staff regarding student privacy and requests from outside agencies seeking information or access to students, the proposed policy states.

Rokita’s ICE lawsuit hinges on deportation flight

Rokita’s lawsuit alleges that an IPS student, the son of a Honduran national, went to school on the morning of his father’s scheduled deportation flight. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the lawsuit claims.

The district said it would not release the child to an ICE officer without a judicial warrant or court order, the lawsuit states.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as he had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” the lawsuit states.

Rokita’s lawsuit targeted several district policies, including the 2017 resolution.

His office has previously argued that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. He has also argued that school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment.",https://www.chalkbeat.org/resizer/v2/6JI5UYPYSBAXFGY2WPYQ733XG4.JPG?smart=true&auth=f76a93a2180eb40b83b863510362dfe54db760f665f5af8ae9314460042d14e6&width=1200&height=630,N,,2026-01-13 15:58:39.435191

Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalis living in the country, saying he does not want them in the United States.","The Trump administration is ending deportation protections for more than 2,000 migrants from Somalia, homeland security officials said on Tuesday.

The end of the program comes as federal officials are carrying out an intense immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota, the state with the largest population of Somalis in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security is dispatching roughly 3,000 officers and agents to Minnesota, a move that federal officials say is meant to crack down on fraud and illegal immigration.

The termination affects 2,471 Somali nationals who are able to live and work in the United States through the program, called Temporary Protected Status, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. About 1,380 Somalis in the country have pending applications.

The program, which is meant to help migrants who cannot safely return to their countries, is expected to end on March 17.

The protections were first authorized in the early 1990s, when the Somali government collapsed and the nation descended into civil war. Although T.P.S. is meant to be temporary, the protections for Somalis have been extended many times because of ongoing armed conflict and other safety threats in Somalia.

In justifying the termination, homeland security officials said that conditions in Somalia had improved and allowing Somalis to stay would not be in the “national interests” of the United States.

“Temporary means temporary,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement. “Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.”

The Trump administration has moved to end T.P.S. for hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. Some of those efforts have prompted concerns that migrants would be returning to unstable countries that still face conflict and violence.

In a social media post, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials urged Somalis covered by the program to leave the United States.

“Leave the U.S. on your own terms between NOW and March 17th … ,” the agency said in the post, “or receive a visit from ICE. The choice is yours.”

The announcement to end the program came after President Trump pledged to end the protections for Somalis in November. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalis living in the country, saying he does not want them in the United States.

His administration’s focus on Minnesota in recent weeks stems in large part from revelations about a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the state in recent years. More than 90 people have been charged in the federal fraud investigations, and Justice Department officials have said many are of Somali descent.

Roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry live in Minnesota, and a majority are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota that had already been approved, a move that prompted backlash among immigrant advocates who said those refugees had already been through an extensive screening process.

Other federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Labor, have also announced new investigations and other efforts they say are meant to root out fraud in Minnesota.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/13dc-somalis-pwgc/13dc-somalis-pwgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:58:58.572553

Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so.
“What can HPD do to federal agents?” Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.","Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.

An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.

After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.

But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.

In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”

About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.

We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.

This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.

“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”

“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.

Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.

Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”

Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.

Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.

Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.

But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.

That norm has now been broken.

One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.

Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.

Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.

One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.

“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”

DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.

McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.

Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.

“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”

DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”

After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.

In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.

Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.

According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”

Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.

Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.

But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.

The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.

“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”

In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.

“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”

In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.

“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)

A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”

Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”

DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.

When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”

But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.

In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.

Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”

When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”

That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.

The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.

Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.

Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.

A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.

Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.

“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.

Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.

When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.

“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.

Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.

Protesters have also been choked and strangled.

In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.

“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”

DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.

Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.

“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”

“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”

“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”

Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.

In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.

The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.

Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.

“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”

Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.

“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.

“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”

There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”

As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.

DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.

Experts may think there’s abuse. But holding officers to account? That’s another matter.

Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.

Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.

From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.

Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.

The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.

“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”

Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.

In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.

In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)

In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.

In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.

Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.

The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.

Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”

How We Did It

ProPublica journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.

We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.

Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.

We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hiresArtboard-1_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2026-01-13 15:58:22.081628

Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Good, had been with the department for about 10 years.
In the big picture, ICE officers’ training time has been significantly shortened to a period at or near what Warner cites.","The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jan. 7 brought more scrutiny on Trump-era training requirements.

On CNN’s “State of the Union” Jan. 11, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told anchor Jake Tapper the Trump administration had shortened ICE agents’ training time while scaling up its hiring.

“Remember we’re beefing up ICE 10,000 more agents,” Warner said. “They are not getting the traditional five months training. Literally, Jake, the training for the ICE agents now is 47 days. Why 47 days? Because Donald Trump is the 47th president.”

He also used this figure Jan. 8 when talking to a liberal commentator and Jan. 12 on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Other lawmakers, social media posts and journalists repeated the same line in the days after ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot Renee Good.

The Trump administration has confirmed to multiple news organizations it shortened the duration of immigration agent training, while taking issue with some outlets’ framing and declining to answer follow-up questions. Neither ICE nor DHS responded to PolitiFact’s queries. We were unable to confirm whether the number of training days is connected to Trump’s status as the 47th president.

Ross had been a deportation officer with the agency since 2015, The Associated Press reported, so he was subject to earlier, longer training standards.

Warner, who did not respond to PolitiFact, said on CNN that the investigation into Good’s killing needed to be completed before people reached conclusions.

When Tapper pointed out to Warner that the ICE agent who shot Good “had at least 10 years experience,” Warner said, “So be it, and again that’s why there ought to be an investigation.”

Trump’s ICE shortened training, but reports vary on how much

The training talking point stems from The Atlantic August story “Fast Times at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” Reporter Nick Miroff wrote that training for new deportation officers had been reduced from about five months to 47 days, citing three unnamed officials.

“Administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses,” the report said. “Academy training was shortened to 47 days, three officials told me, the number picked because Trump is the 47th president. DHS officials said the training will run six days a week for eight weeks.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that The Atlantic’s reporting was “false,” because training is eight weeks. The Examiner story, however, cited ICE acting director Todd Lyons as confirming an eight-week training schedule of six work days per week. That amounts to 48 training days.

The frequently asked questions page on ICE’s career website reflects the outdated training schedule, saying new deportation officers will complete almost five months of training — five weeks of language and 16 weeks of law enforcement.

The AP in August reported the agency “cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks,” citing Caleb Vitello, who runs ICE training. Vitello told AP the Spanish-language training that was cut would be supplemented with translation technology services.

News organizations and administration officials have reported training times shorter than 48 days in recent months:

An unnamed DHS official told NBC News in October that ICE had originally shortened its training from 13 to eight weeks before shortening it again to six weeks.

Government Executive, a news outlet that covers federal agencies, reported Jan. 5 that DHS has shortened ICE agent training from six months “to around six weeks.”

DHS has not offered clarity about new officer training since the Minneapolis shooting. A senior DHS official told People magazine Jan. 8, “Training to become an Enforcement and Removal Operations officer is 8 weeks long,” and declined to specify the number of days.

“The official did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for clarification, since eight weeks matches the timeframe that The Atlantic previously reported,” it reported.

ICE officer who shot Good had 10 years experience, additional training

Having worked for ICE for a decade, Ross would have followed the previous 16-week training schedule and five-week language program.

Ross also received specialized training after being selected for ICE’s special response team, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told AP.

Before becoming an ICE agent, Ross served in the Indiana National Guard and was deployed to Iraq and also worked as a Border Patrol field intelligence officer.

Our ruling

Warner said immigration agents “are not getting the traditional five months training. … The training for the ICE agents now is 47 days.”

News outlets and Homeland Security officials reported cuts to the length of ICE training during Trump’s second term, reducing it from about five months to six days a week for eight weeks. That’s 48 days of training over a 56-day period. (What it has to do with Trump’s status as 47th president is outside of the scope of this fact-check.) Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Good, had been with the department for about 10 years.

Two news organizations have since reported that the duration of training was further reduced to about six weeks; spokespersons from DHS and ICE did not respond to our requests for confirmation.

In the big picture, ICE officers’ training time has been significantly shortened to a period at or near what Warner cites.

Gas clouds filled a Minneapolis street near where Renee Good was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week. A man scrubbed his eyes with snow and screamed for help as agents in an unmarked Jeep sprayed an orange irritant and drove away.

It's common for people to boo, taunt and blow orange whistles when they spot heavily armed agents passing through in unmarked vehicles or walking the streets.

""Who doesn't have a whistle?"" a man with a bag of them yelled.

Brita Anderson, who lives nearby and came to support neighborhood friends, said she was ""incensed"" to see agents in tactical gear and gas masks, and wondered about their purpose.

""It felt like the only reason they'd come here is to harass people,"" Anderson said.

In Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, students protesting the immigration enforcement operation walked out of school as students elsewhere have done this week.

With the Department of Homeland Security pledging to send more than 2,000 immigration officers into Minnesota, the state, joined by Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued President Donald Trump's administration Monday to halt or limit the surge.

The lawsuit says the Department of Homeland Security is violating the First Amendment and other constitutional protections by focusing on a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants.

""This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and it must stop,"" state Attorney General Keith Ellison said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: ""What we are seeing is thousands — plural — thousands of federal agents coming into our city. And, yeah, they're having a tremendous impact on day-to-day life.""

Dozens of protests or vigils have taken place across the U.S. to honor Good since the 37-year-old mother of three was killed.

Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to the lawsuit, accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety.

""President Trump's job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,"" McLaughlin said.

The Trump administration has repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot Good, saying he acted in self-defense. But that explanation has been widely panned by Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and others based on videos of the confrontation.

Two Democratic lawmakers from Massachusetts announced Tuesday they are sponsoring a bill to make it easier for people to sue and overcome immunity protections for federal officers who are accused of violating civil rights. The bill stands little chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress.

In Wisconsin, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez is proposing that the state ban civil immigration enforcement around courthouses, hospitals, health clinics, schools, churches and other places. She is hoping to succeed Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, who is not running for a third term.

""We can take a look at that, but I think banning things absolutely will ramp up the actions of our folks in Washington, D.C.,"" Evers said, referring to the Trump administration. ""They don't tend to approach those things appropriately.""

Article Summary

Illinois filed a 103-page lawsuit that seeks to severely limit federal immigration agents’ authority to execute the types of aggressive raids that began in Chicago last September.

The state and city of Chicago asked a court to prevent the feds from using “roving patrol” tactics used by immigration agents, as well as face scans and crowd control tactics such as tear gas.

State and city leaders say the feds have used such aggressive tactics to try to coerce them into changing their immigration policies.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, seeking to severely limit immigration agents’ authority in the state after accusing the feds of unleashing an “organized bombardment” to coerce state and local officials to change their immigration policies.

State and city leaders want to end the feds’ “roving patrol” policy of interrogating people they encounter on the street about their citizenship and immigration status without any probable cause. They’re also seeking to limit crowd control tactics such as using tear gas to disperse nonviolent crowds and to prevent the feds from scanning the biometric information of state residents.

“Border Patrol agents and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers.”

Raoul, along with the city of Chicago, filed the 103-page lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. It accused the federal government of applying pressure over policy differences through means such as withholding federal funds, attempting to deploy the National Guard and, most disruptively, executing an immigration enforcement operation described by state officials as “causing turmoil and imposing a climate of fear.”

It also seeks to prevent immigration enforcement at “sensitive locations” without “appropriate reasoning,” including courthouses, schools, social service organizations and medical facilities. And it seeks to bar immigration agents from “trespassing” on private property to make arrests, in violation of the 4th Amendment. The suit argues immigration agents only have the authority to do so within 25 miles of a U.S. Border to prevent illegal entry to the country.

The state is asking the court to find that the federal government’s “menacing, violent, and unlawful incursion” violates the 10th Amendment, and to order federal agents to stop using tactics that exceed their statutory authority.

‘Unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations’

Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement in support of the lawsuit, writing that “in the face of the Trump Administration’s cruelty and intimidation, Illinois is standing up against the attacks on our people.”

“Today, Illinois is once again taking Donald Trump to court to hold his administration accountable for their unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations, and flagrant abuses of power,” Pritzker said.

The lawsuit names, among others, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino — the public face of DHS’ Operation Midway Blitz immigration enforcement campaign — as defendants.

Much of the lawsuit pulls from claims brought in an earlier suit by media organizations and protestors who challenged the feds’ use-of-force tactics. The plaintiffs motioned for the case to be reassigned to the same judge in that challenge, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, according to reporting by the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times. Previously, she issued an injunction against use of force in that case, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed it.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois in a statement the latest suit was “baseless.”

“The fact is that sanctuary politicians in Illinois and Chicago released violent criminals including murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists, onto its streets and their dereliction of duty cost lives—just ask Katie Abraham’s father,” McLaughlin said, referring to a 20-year-old Glenview woman who was killed in a hit-and-run crash last year allegedly by a Guatemalan in the country without legal authorization. “This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.”

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a similar lawsuit Monday seeking to block a surge of immigration enforcement in that state. It comes less than a week after an ICE agent shot 37-year-old American citizen Renee Nicole Good at close range while she was apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop.

‘Campaign of coercion’

The Illinois lawsuit claims that Midway Blitz is part of a “campaign of coercion” by the Trump administration attempting to force state and local governments, including Illinois and the city of Chicago, to change their sanctuary immigration policies.

The state’s TRUST Act, signed by then-Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017, generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with immigration enforcement unless a federal criminal warrant is presented.

Chicago has had “sanctuary city” status since 1985.

The state and federal policies are meant to foster trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by ensuring that interactions do not result in immigration detention or deportation. But these policies, which predominate in the nation’s blue states and blue cities, have been the target of ire from the Trump administration, which has accused state and local jurisdictions of impeding their mass deportation goals.

Trump sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last year seeking to invalidate the state and local policies, but the challenge was dismissed by a federal judge in July, who found that they were protected under the 10th Amendment.

Federal ‘occupation’

Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region. The department claims that it has resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants in the country without legal authorization.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview.

Confrontations initiated by immigration officers resulted in two shootings, including one with deadly consequences, during the height of Midway Blitz. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park in September after he attempted to flee a traffic stop. In October, a federal agent shot Marimar Martinez five times in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. She survived and the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago has dropped all charges against her.

Characterizing it as a federal “occupation” of a sovereign state, the suit accuses the feds of sending armed immigration agents to roam city streets to question people about their citizenship status, capture and retain biometric data without consent, arrest people without a warrant or probable cause and deploy tear gas and other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods and trespass on private property — all while concealing their identities with face masks and covering up license plates.

The suit includes a laundry list of documentation, alleging, for instance that federal agents deployed tear gas and other chemicals without warning at least 49 times in 18 separate incidents in Chicago over a 90-day period in 2025.

And following the launch of a “plate watch” hotline in late October, at least thirty-five distinct license plates were reported being swapped or used on more than one federal vehicle operated by Border Patrol or ICE, according to the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, which sent a “cease and desist” letter to DHS in October over the practice.

Return of Midway blitz?

While Midway Blitz has wound down in recent weeks, federal officials have been teasing a return with even larger numbers of agents in March. The filing includes Bovino stating, “Don’t call it a comeback; we’re gonna be here for years.”

The state is asking the court to bar Border Patrol agents from conducting civil immigration enforcement in Illinois, arguing that they are “not authorized or trained for large-scale removal enforcement in the interior of the United States.”

It’s also asking a judge to declare that tactics such as roving patrols, warrantless arrests, deploying tear gas and swapping plates, at least in this context, are in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs want those tactics barred in the future.

The lawsuit is just the latest in a litany of litigation between the state and federal government. Raoul has filed or joined in more than four-dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration over the past year, challenging everything from cuts to congressionally appropriated state funding to Trump’s now-aborted push to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago over the strenuous objections of Illinois’ elected leaders.

Actions like those, Raoul alleged in the latest lawsuit, are part of the Trump administration’s “coercion” campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court preventing the deployment of troops in Illinois. The underlying case Is still working through the courts, though Trump late last month dropped plans to deploy troops to American cities.

The federal government filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated. Like the latest lawsuit, the case largely rests on the 10th Amendment.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/59e0d641cd39c324695b7163/t/696636b914316c626a79903f/1768306361747/251028-BOVINO-TRUCK-2-AA.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-13 17:58:55.940307

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down a split decision on December 30, 2025, that could reshape how organizations conduct workplace training on sensitive topics. In a razor-thin ruling, five judges sided with two Missouri school employees who said their free speech rights were trampled during a required equity session.

Brooke Henderson and Jennifer Lumley worked for Springfield R-12 School District when they were told to attend Fall District-Wide Equity Training in October 2020. What happened during those sessions became the center of a constitutional fight that divided eleven federal judges in Henderson v. Springfield R-12 School District.

The training started with what seemed like standard ground rules. Staff received a handout listing principles: stay engaged, lean into your discomfort, acknowledge your privileges, be professional. Then came the warning that caught everyone's attention. A slide displayed during the presentation read: ""Be Professional - Or be Asked to Leave with No Credit.""

For Henderson and Lumley, that warning carried weight. No credit meant no pay, since the training was mandatory. Henderson attended virtually and was told to keep her camera on the entire time, even if she felt uncomfortable. Trainers said turning cameras off was disrespectful.

Both women spoke up initially. Henderson shared her view about Kyle Rittenhouse during a discussion. The district's chief equity and diversity officer told her she was wrong and confused. After that exchange, Henderson stayed quiet. She later said she felt unsafe voicing opinions and feared being written up or fired.

Lumley attended in person. After watching a video about George Floyd, she told her small group that his death wasn't a commentary on all law enforcement. Another attendee disagreed and seemed upset. When Lumley later said she didn't believe every white person is racist or that she was privileged because she grew up poor, a trainer told her that Black people cannot be racist. Other staff members raised their voices at her. The trainers didn't step in. Lumley described the next breakout session as very hostile and stopped talking.

Four staff members from another school told their principal they worried about having a target on their backs if they spoke up. When the equity officer heard about their concerns, she wrote back that the training wasn't an invitation but a requirement.

Henderson also had to complete online modules on her own time. The modules only let her move forward if she selected the pre-programmed correct answers. One question asked whether equity and diversity guidance was suggested or required policy. When she picked suggested, a message popped up: ""Incorrect! This is not suggested guidance. It is required policy and job responsibility.""

Another module asked how to respond when witnessing racism in the classroom. Henderson thought the answer depended on the situation and student, based on her twenty years in special education. But the module only accepted one answer: address it immediately. The system told her being an anti-racist requires immediate action.

Henderson believed the district might review her module responses, so she tailored some answers to get a higher score even though they didn't match her actual views.

The women sued in August 2021. A district court threw out their case, saying they hadn't been harmed and ordered them to pay the school district $312,869.50 in legal fees for bringing frivolous claims.

But the appeals court saw things differently. Writing for the majority, Circuit Judge Erickson said the employees showed a real threat of consequences if they disagreed with the district's views. Being kicked out of training and losing pay was enough to make a reasonable person keep quiet, the court found.

The majority pointed out that the harm isn't in actually getting punished. The harm is in the silencing itself. No one needs to suffer consequences before bringing a claim if the threat is credible enough.

Six judges disagreed strongly. Chief Judge Colloton wrote that sitting through a two-hour training you disagree with isn't a constitutional injury. Both women got paid, got their professional development credits, and kept their jobs. Lumley even got promoted.

The dissent warned the ruling opens the floodgates. Any employee who disagrees with any workplace training and stays quiet could now sue, they argued. If the next equity training takes a colorblind approach and tells people to be professional, employees who favor diversity and inclusion could sue too.

The case goes back to the lower court, where a judge will need to sort through whether the speech at issue was part of the women's job duties. That question could determine whether their claims ultimately succeed or fail.

For human resources professionals, the decision creates uncertainty around a common workplace practice. The ruling suggests that requiring agreement with specific viewpoints, threatening consequences for dissent, or using training formats that compel adoption of organizational positions could trigger legal exposure.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0343_639039237010366494.png,N,,2026-01-13 17:59:00.759950

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond their allotted funding and simultaneously restricts federal employees from working on a volunteer basis. The Act provides, in relevant part:

An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.

31 U.S.C. § 1342 (emphasis added).

During lapses in federal funding, voluntary services are only authorized in very limited circumstances, but the parameters of the “safety of human life” or “protection of property” exceptions have not been uniformly defined nor applied across the courts.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s 2026 Contingency Plan anticipated civil litigation would be curtailed or delayed, absent cases that would substantially affect the protection of human life or property interests. Indeed, the Contingency Plan instructed federal civil litigators to “approach the courts and request that active cases, except for those in which a delay would compromise to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property, be postponed until funding is available.” Nevertheless, the Contingency Plan also seemingly deferred to federal courts whether to stay proceedings, providing:

If a court denies such a request and orders a case to continue, the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue. The Department will limit its civil litigation staffing to the minimum level needed to comply with the court’s order and to protect life and property. Receipt of summonses, pleadings and motions by mail may be delayed.

A natural tension arises between the Anti-Deficiency Act, which aims to postpone cases, and Article III of the United States Constitution, which vests federal courts with the power to decide cases and controversies within its jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. As the cases discussed below illustrate, courts over time have endeavored to strike a balance between complying with the federal law and their constitutional authority during federal shutdowns.

In 2013, the D.C. Circuit court in United States, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc. et al., contemplated whether a stay of proceedings due to a lapse in appropriations was warranted in a time-sensitive civil proceeding. 979 F.Supp.2d 33 (D.C. Cir. 2013). There, the federal government initiated the suit and sought injunctive relief to block a merger between two airline corporations. Although the government argued that the Anti-Deficiency Act only allowed employees to work in limited emergency circumstances, the court noted the time-sensitive nature of the matter, the substantial amount of money at issue, and the impact of a stay on swift resolution of the matter. Accordingly, the court denied the government’s motion to stay and allowed the matter to proceed during the federal shutdown.

During the 2019 federal shutdown, the D.C. Circuit also denied a request to stay oral argument in a civil proceeding. See Kornitzky Grp., LLC v. Elwell, 912 F.3d 637 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The concurring judges noted that the DOJ’s FY 2019 Contingency Plan, similar to the 2026 Contingency Plan, provided that if a court denies a stay, “the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.” Specifically, the concurrence observed that the federal courts uniformly denied the government’s request to stay oral arguments during the 2013 federal shutdown and the government attorneys still appeared for oral argument.

Most recently, during the 2025 federal shutdown, a federal court denied the Department of Labor’s motion to stay proceedings and suggested that the DOL carried a burden to show “good grounds for either a stay or an extension of the deadlines previously established,” which was not met. Lehman v. Dep’t of Labor, 2025 WL 2808472, *2 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 2, 2025). While the court acknowledged the limitations set forth in the Anti-Deficiency Act, it recognized a circuit split on how strictly courts adhere to the general rule that government attorneys are not authorized to work during federal shutdowns—even on a volunteer basis—absent exceptional circumstances. Whereas the Sixth Circuit has traditionally taken a more literal interpretation of the Anti-Deficiency Act—finding government attorneys may exclusively work on “emergency” matters during a federal shutdown—the D.C. Circuit has taken a “less sanguine view” and has denied stays on the grounds that government attorneys must comply with federal court litigation timelines. Id. at *1 (comparing United States v. Trevino, 7 F.4th 424, 421 n.6 (6th Cir. 2021) (“The prosecution cannot continue without expenditures[,] [and] The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits any government official from carrying out the prosecution on an unpaid, volunteer basis.”) with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. USDA, 912 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (declining to stay scheduling deadlines during the 2019 federal shutdown)).

The Lehman court further explained that the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct apply to federal government attorneys who appear before the state’s courts and provide that “[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” Id. at *2 (quoting Mich. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.16(c)). While non-attorney government staff are not bound by the ethical rules, the court noted the DOL publicly announced that it has staff available to meet court-imposed deadlines. Unlike in US Airways Group and Kornitzky, which focused on the type of litigation and the stage of the proceedings to warrant postponement, here, the court appeared to focus on the government’s failure to show “good grounds” for a stay or deadline extension.

The Lehman approach was subsequently followed in New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget, 2025 WL 3089495 (D. Ma. Nov. 5, 2025), wherein the court echoed that federal courts retain the power to stay litigation and the Anti-Deficiency Act “does not require that non-emergency litigation cease.” There, the substantive issue was whether the federal government defendants could properly terminate funding for a federal grant that was formerly awarded to plaintiffs. After the federal shutdown took effect, defendants requested a stay to file a reply brief while plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment was pending. The court rejected defendants’ request, weighing the parties’ competing interests and finding a stay “could allow [d]efendants to continue to terminate funding but close off [p]laintiffs’ opportunity to resolve this matter pursuant to the parties’ agreed-upon schedule.” Stated differently, the court acknowledged that a stay could lead to a procedural advantage for the federal defendants by effectively preserving a status quo that is under scrutiny.

Conversely, in Dash Markets, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 3502097 (W.D. N.Y. Oct. 21, 2025) the court deviated from Lehman and New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget by deferring to the Anti-Deficiency Act. There, the plaintiff sued the United States, seeking remission of $3 million in Employee Retention Credits and the government requested a stay due to the 2025 federal shutdown. While the court recognized that stays are “subject to the sound discretion of the court,” the court stated that it was “disinclined to subject [d]efendant’s counsel to the risk of violating the [Anti-Deficiency] Act” and does not find plaintiff’s “alleged financial plight to constitute a potential emergency exception to the Act.” Id. Accordingly, the government’s requested stay was granted. Id.

As illustrated by the courts’ differing approaches to the Anti-Deficiency Act, federal shutdowns create significant uncertainty for clients involved in civil litigation with federal agencies or personnel. While the current shutdown has ended, this moment demonstrates the need for practitioners and clients alike to remain vigilant in anticipating delays for future lapses in federal appropriations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.11535_5738.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:58:01.590685

Trainings and Resources

Thousands of people have either already completed or signed up for the Monarca network’s legal observer trainings—so many, in fact, that all upcoming trainings through the month of January are already at capacity. However, Monarca has valuable resources for community members on its website: signage to print for your business or private property and know-your-rights posters, legal observer basics, and both a hotline (to report ICE sightings) and a non-emergency line (for legal questions) on their contact page. It’s possible that more trainings will be announced for February, so keep an eye on the website.

Unidos MN has a thorough “know your rights” resource walking through a number of situations, i.e. if ICE shows up at your home or workplace, if you’re detained by the police, what documents to carry, etc.

The Star Tribune has compiled a great resource detailing what, exactly, ICE agents can and can’t do, and what rights legal observers have during encounters.

If you are trying to find someone who has been detained by ICE, here’s a link to the Online Detainee Locator System.

Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) of Minnesota is offering a workplace know-your-rights training for restaurant workers on January 13 at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. In their words: “The restaurant and service industry is no exception when it comes to ICE enforcement and workplace targeting. Across the country, food service workers are facing fear and uncertainty due to raids and ICE activity. Knowledge is one of our strongest tools, and being prepared can make the difference between panic and protection for ourselves and our coworkers.” Here’s the link to register.

Restaurants and Businesses to Support

One of the most-asked questions I’ve seen circulating on social media is: What businesses have been hit hardest by ICE’s presence, so we can support them? In short, the answer is: immigrant-owned restaurants who have large immigrant customer bases. I can’t draft up an exact and comprehensive list, much as I wish I could, but I can give you some places to start based on some of my favorites: Go for lunch at Mercado Central and get pupusas at Rincón Salvadoreño and apple turnovers from ground-floor bakery Panaderia El Mexicana; pick up a pressure cooker that’ll likely knock the socks off your Instant Pot. For sweets: My favorites are rice pudding-filled doughnuts from Panaderia San Miguel; conchas and apricot-glazed hilos from Papá Chuy’s; halwo and vanilla cake from Albi Kitchen (also the sambusas here are great); malawax (sweet crepes) from Karmel Mall (yes, Hamdi is excellent, but if you wander around the ground floor you’ll find a number of other stalls selling their own equally delicious versions). For dinner: salmon and spaghetti at Mama Safia’s; smoky pozole from Habanero Tacos Street on Lake Street; Homi Restaurant’s entire caldos menu over in St. Paul; 18-inch, pastor-filled machetes from Taco Libre; fried tilapia and pilaf rice at Wiilo Restaurant & Bakery in Karmel Mall; pork belly gorditas at El Taco Torro in Midtown Global Market. For tacos: True Jalisco-style quesabirria at Taco Taxi; tacos de canasta at Las Charolas on the ground floor of Plaza Mexico and barbacoa de chivo at El Chivo Crazy just upstairs; tacos al pastor at Taqueria La Hacienda. If you’re feeding a crowd, Tacos El Primo does amazing catering-sized meals.

A key note, though. As you’re visiting and eating, please don’t take photos—given the very scary and inflammatory nature of the moment, doing so could potentially make staff or customers feel unsafe.

Restaurant Closures

Unfortunately, ICE’s presence throughout the metro has caused a number of restaurants and businesses to temporarily close to prioritize the safety and well-being of their employees. We’re keeping track of them here, but things change fast, so it’s wise to check your favorite spot’s socials before you head out for a meal or a cup of coffee. The MOST important takeaway is that even a few days of lost business can be a significant hit for a restaurant.

Grocery Stores Offering Free Food Delivery

A number of grocery stores around the metro are offering free food delivery given that many of their immigrant customers—including those who are citizens or are documented—are afraid to venture out in public due to ICE’s presence throughout the Cities. Their customer bases have also taken a hit, so they’re great businesses to support if you’re able.

All three locations of Colonial Market—in Minneapolis, North Minneapolis, and Bloomington—are offering home delivery. Call 651-508-0256.

Home delivery from Valerie’s Carniceria is suspended for the moment, but you can place an order ahead of time for pick-up. Call 613-823-4400.

Bymore Mercado in St. Paul continues to offer free food delivery.

Restaurant Specials

As of January 9, 10 percent of all sales at Mothership Pizza Paradise will go toward a fund supporting restaurant staff, and the restaurant has created a Venmo account where you can donate directly toward staff who are unable to work right now due to ICE’s presence in their neighborhood.

The Gnome is serving free barbecue, no questions asked, on January 14 from noon to 4 p.m.

There's never been a better time to order a cold brew (no ice) from Workhorse Coffee Bar. A portion of proceeds will be donated to Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.

Protesters and law enforcement officials have continually clashed in the days since Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Good, a motorist who federal officials claim was trying to run over law enforcement.

State officials thus far have backed the demonstrators and their defense of Macklin Good’s intentions

Their latest move — a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security — aims to stop the surge of immigration officers into the state and remove thousands already there.

Prosecutors resign

Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota, including the top prosecutor involved in fraud investigations, have resigned over the Department of Justice’s attempts to investigate the wife of Renee Good. Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week.

Four prosecutors in the DOJ’s civil rights division also reportedly resigned following a decision by the DOJ not to investigate the shooting.

Trump, Vance blame Democrats for ‘chaos’ in Minnesota

In separate social media posts, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday pointed to Democratic leadership in Minnesota for the unrest.

“This is an extremely important point: you’re only seeing chaotic ICE raids in blue sanctuary cities where local officials are fighting against federal law enforcement,” Vance wrote. “The chaos is created by ‘leaders’ who would rather promote rioting in their streets than follow the law.

Trump took aim at leaders in Minnesota and Illinois, defending federal immigration operations by saying agents — whom he called “patriots of ICE” — only want to remove “convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners,” among others, from the streets.

Official social media accounts for DHS and ICE echoed similar sentiments.

Menin did not share many identifying details about the man, who she said is from Venezuela and has worked for the council for about a year. The Department of Homeland Security, however, identified the man as Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez. DHS claimed that he had overstayed a tourist visa, which expired in 2017, and said he had been arrested for assault, though DHS did not say whether he had been convicted.

“He had no legal right to be in the United States,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you and we will arrest you.

The City Council disputed those claims. “Contrary to claims by DHS, the City Council employee provided documentation showing he was authorized to remain and work in the country. He fully cleared all background checks. Any suggestion to the contrary is false,” a council spokesperson wrote in a statement, adding that the employee was authorized to work under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and then was able to extend his work authorization even after President Donald Trump ended TPS for Venezuelans. City & State could not independently verify the employee’s legal status or alleged arrest record.

The Council added that this employee had gone through the standard vetting process. After he was detained, the staffer was granted one phone call, Menin said, which he used to contact the council’s human resources department late Monday afternoon. Menin said there was no indication the man had done anything illegal, and he was permitted to work for the City Council until October, 2026.

“This is an untenable situation. The fact that as the speaker of the City Council, I cannot get any information from ICE and had to call the Department of Homeland Security to get some information is unacceptable,” Menin said. She said she spoke to a deputy field office director from the Department of Homeland Security, who told her that the man was being detained at the federal facility on Varick Street in Manhattan.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a statement he was “outraged” and monitoring the situation. Gov. Kathy Hochul said “detaining people during routine court appearances erodes trust, spreads fear, and violates basic principles of fairness.” The City Council staffers’ union planned a protest to demand the release of their colleague on Tuesday.

Within hours of receiving notice of the man’s detention, Menin convened an emergency press conference with New York Immigration Coalition President Murad Awawdeh, Council Members Alexa Avilés, Harvey Epstein and Shaun Abreu and Rep. Dan Goldman. Goldman has made support for immigrants a central focus of his congressional office in recent months as ICE activity has ramped up in New York City under the Trump administration.

“This is the immigration dragnet that we are living in where secret masked police are killing Americans, are yanking anyone they can find out of cars out of homes out of courtrooms… and now targeting those who are trying to serve the public as employees of the New York City Council,” Goldman said. The arrest comes amid heightened tension between the Trump administration and liberal Democrats after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday.

While Menin said “We are doing everything in our power to secure his immediate release,” Goldman sounded more pessimistic, saying the man was “likely on a path to removal unless it can be stopped.”",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/12/55037515377_7807cd12b3_k/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:57:49.545535

Kelly, a former Navy captain, drew the ire of Hegseth and President Donald Trump after he filmed a video that told military personnel they could refuse unlawful orders.

Trump accused Kelly of ""sedition"", and Hegseth said he would open proceedings to lower Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a reduction in his pay.

The actions violated Kelly's right to free speech and due process, and did not follow military procedure, his case alleges. The defence department was ""aware of the litigation,"" a spokesperson said.

""As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation,"" the spokesperson said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kelly had a prominent career as an astronaut before being elected to the US Senate for Arizona in 2020.

He also founded a gun safety group along with his wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at an event in 2011 and survived.

He staked out a position as a centrist Democrat focused on defence, and has criticised Trump's use of National Guard troops to patrol US cities.

Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere has sparked major court battles. The Trump administration argues that the forces are necessary to suppress crime, and to protect federal immigration agents as they conduct sweeps in major US cities.

In November, Kelly, along with five other Democrats, filmed a video that told military personnel: ""Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.""

The video irked Trump, who posted ""LOCK THEM UP???"" on Truth Social. The president's account also reshared another user's post, that read, ""HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!""

Trump later clarified to Fox News: ""I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.""

Hegseth then announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as ""seditious in nature"" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The case filed by Kelly argues that Hegseth ""is disciplining Senator Kelly solely for the content and viewpoint of his political speech"".

Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade.

How it works: DPD would be responsible for enforcement, including arresting officers who violate the law, deputy legislative counsel Jon Griffin said.

Reality check: Marley Bordovsky, a lawyer at the City Attorney's Office, told council she's concerned about whether Denver police officers arresting ICE agents would mean local officers are violating federal law by interfering with federal agents' duties.

Between the lines: Undercover work, SWAT duties and tactical operations would still allow for face coverings under the proposal — carveouts bill sponsors said were made after hearing feedback from local law enforcement.

WASHINGTON – Today, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA) voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration following the government’s restoration of all Title X family planning grants that were the subject of NFPRHA’s litigation. The lawsuit, filed in April 2025 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of D.C. on behalf of NFPRHA and its members, challenged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) illegal withholding of 22 federal Title X grants, which left approximately 865 family planning service sites unable to provide Title X-funded services to an estimated 842,000 patients across nearly two dozen states.

“The Trump administration illegally withheld vital family planning funds that federal grantees were relying on to provide time-sensitive, critical care to hundreds of thousands of people in need,” said Clare Coleman, president & CEO, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA). “Our lawsuit succeeded in holding the administration accountable for its unlawful acts, and today, NFPRHA members’ grants have been restored. We are relieved all of our members now have access to their promised funds, but we know the fight for contraceptive access in this country goes on. We will continue to stand up for our members and the essential care they provide to millions of individuals.”

“When the Trump administration withheld critical Title X family planning funding, it blatantly violated federal law and left hundreds of sites unable to provide Title X-funded services,” said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project at the ACLU. “Fortunately, those Title X grants have been restored to NFPRHA’s members. But we know that the Trump administration will continue to attack reproductive freedom, and the ACLU will be ready to use every lever we have to fight those attacks and defend the Title X program.”

“We should never have had to sue to protect essential health care like cancer screenings, STI tests, and birth control,” said Arthur Spitzer, senior counsel at ACLU-D.C. “Restoring funding is a victory, but the larger fight to protect everyone's reproductive freedom continues.""

National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association v. Kennedy

The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), the lead national advocacy organization for the Title X family planning program, and the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over its unlawful withholding of $65.8 million in Title X federal family planning grants. Title X is the country’s only dedicated federally funded family planning program that provides access to preventive care like birth control, cancer screening, and STI screening and treatment, with priority given to patients with low incomes. As a result of the Trump administration’s unlawful actions, at least seven states — California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah — have been left without any Title X-funded family planning services, and approximately 842,000 people have lost access to Title X-funded care.

The news comes as Trump administration officials continue to lend credence to a YouTube video, published by internet creator Nick Shirley, alleging with little evidence that Somali migrants in Minnesota are committing fraud through child care centers. State officials have said the centers were operating normally.

The administration has cited the fraud claims as part of the justification for sending thousands of federal officers into the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in an immigration enforcement surge.

Temporary Protected Status was established by Congress in 1990. It does not grant permanent residency in the U.S. but does shield those who have it from deportation and allows them to work and travel.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services grants the status to groups of people who cannot return to their countries safely due to instability, such as an ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or an epidemic.

Recommended

The U.S. has designated Somalis eligible for the status since 1991 because of an ongoing civil war between government forces, militia fighters, African Union troops and others against the paramilitary group al-Shabaab, as well as widespread food insecurity and hunger. Last May, the U.S. State Department flagged Somalia as “Level 4,” its highest advisory level, urging Americans not to travel there.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said in a statement that conditions in the east African country had improved sufficiently and that Somalis no longer qualified for the designation under federal law.

“Temporary means temporary,” Noem wrote, adding that allowing Somali nationals to remain was “contrary to our national interests”.

“We are putting Americans first,” she added.

Donald Trump had first announced his intentions to end protection for Somali nationals in November, writing on Truth Social about Minnesota, which is home to a large Somali community: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”

The Trump administration has used Minnesota’s issues with fraud as a pretext to send a surge of immigration officers into the state. Trump has called Somalis “garbage” and referenced unverified reports, amplified by Republican lawmakers, suggesting the militant group al-Shabaab in Somalia benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota, though these claims still have not been substantiated.

Yesterday, Minneapolis and St Paul filed a lawsuit against the administration, alleging the state was being targeted for its diversity and political differences with the federal government. “[Department of Homeland Security] agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. Last week, the American citizen Renee Good was fatally shot in the head by a federal immigration agent in south Minneapolis during an enforcement operation, sparking tens of thousands to march in protest across the US.

The decision to withdraw TPS for Somalis in the US, first reported by Fox News Digital, affects 705 Somali nationals currently holding TPS, according to official US Citizenship and Immigration Services data as of August 2025. They have until 17 March before their status expires. Anonymous immigration sources cited higher figures to Fox News of about 2,471 current beneficiaries and another 1,383 applications.

TPS is granted by the Department of Homeland Security to foreign nationals who cannot safely return to their home countries due to armed conflict, natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances. The protection allows individuals to live and work legally in the US until conditions improve in their homeland.

The securebordersuk account posted a 20-second clip showing a sequence of doors being smashed in by armoured officers, people being led from workplaces in handcuffs and planes taking off, all set to a soaring soundtrack and on-screen text trumpeting an increase in raids and deportations.

IMMIGRATION WORRIES HAVE COST GOVERNMENT IN POLLS

The effort to portray a hardline stance on immigration is one of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's moves to win back public support after 18 months in power which have seen his Labour Party fall far behind Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party.

A spokesperson for Starmer said the channel would help reach a wider audience, tackle false narratives online and directly reach migrants considering coming to Britain.

Many European governments are also taking a tougher line on migration.

Polling consistently puts immigration as a top concern for British voters, and Ipsos polling from 2025 showed Reform was ranked as the most trusted party on the issue.

The government said since it took power in July 2024, arrests of illegal workers and raids have reached the highest level in British history, with raids up 77% and arrests up 83%, at businesses such as nail bars, car washes and barbers.

The black economy is frequently cited as one of the pull factors drawing tens of thousands of migrants to enter Britain illegally in small boats from France.

ILLEGAL MIGRATION A KEY BATTLEGROUND

Set against a backdrop of public service cuts and higher taxes that is squeezing many voters, illegal arrivals by boat have become a focal point. More than 40,000 arrived in 2025.

Illegal arrivals accounted for only a small portion of overall net immigration to Britain, which is falling sharply as tighter visa rules take effect.

Tuesday's TikTok video attracted criticism from both sides, such as that the government should do more, or that it was insensitive to the people depicted.

""This government is clearly hooked on the cheap political points it can score by turning the brutality of enforcement raids into click-bait online entertainment,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at charity Freedom from Torture.

On Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution.

The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”

Local officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.

On Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.

“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”

The increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.

The Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.

The administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”

The Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.

The Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12dc-border-minnesota-chvk/12dc-border-minnesota-chvk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:12:43.727327

11:30 a.m. — Minneapolis City Council President shoved by ICE agent

A video captured Minneapolis City Council President Elliott Payne being pushed by an ICE agent during an interaction at a bus stop.

Payne explained the incident on Monday, stating he was legally observing as ICE agents stopped a citizen in front of the co-op.

""If this is how they treat the President of the Minneapolis City Council who is legally observing, just think of what they’re doing to everyone else in our City,"" Payne wrote of the encounter.

11:20 a.m. — ‘ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom’

During a press conference on Tuesday, Minnesota community groups are calling for ""ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom"" to take place on Jan. 23, with plans for a large-scale march in Minneapolis and a day of ""no work, no school, no shopping,"" according to a press release.

Organizers say the response follows ongoing ICE enforcement that’s impacting local families and communities, and also resulted in the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.

11 a.m. - Lawmakers moving to impeach Kristi Noem

Illinois congresswoman Robin Kelly on the House floor said she is planning to impeach Kristi Noem. This comes as U.S. Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minnesota) and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) have also called on her to resign or be impeached in the wake of ICE's operations in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States.

10 a.m. - Student walk-outs

Students at several metro area schools are planning walkouts to protest ICE operations in Minnesota.

Several dozen students walked out of Park Central High School in Brooklyn Park on Tuesday morning as a way to express concern about the impact ICE is having on families and communities.

9 a.m. - Temporary protected status ending for Somalis

FOX News reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration will not extend temporary protected status for Somalis, which is set to expire on March 17. The ending of temporary protected status affects only about 500 to 600 of the approximately 37,000 Somali-born people living in Minnesota.

Temporary protected status was first granted to Somalis in 1991 and was last extended under the Biden administration in September 2024. President Trump announced the termination in November, with Homeland Security still reviewing the decision.

Lawsuit over ICE operations in Minnesota

The backstory:

Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with the mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis, filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration in attempt to end the surge of ICE agents. The lawsuit alleges the federal government is targeting Minnesota as a way to punish political opponents in Democratic-led states.

Ellison says the number of ICE agents currently operating in the Twin Cities is estimated to be over 2,000, surpassing the combined number of police officers in Minneapolis and St. Paul.

State and city leaders say the scope of the enforcement activities are having a negative impact on local businesses and schools. Several Twin Cities restaurants have temporarily closed or kept their doors locked due to immigration enforcement raids, citing employee fears and customer safety concerns. Some schools have also canceled classes, while others are providing e-learning options for students.

The other side:

In response, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem calls the lawsuit an ""illegal action"" by corrupt and activist politicians.

The case will make its way through the courts, but there’s no clear timeline on how long it could take a judge to issue a ruling.

President Trump also defended the ICE operations on social media Tuesday, writing in part, ""Fear not great people of Minnesota, the day of reckoning and retribution is coming.""

More ICE agents coming to MN amid protests

Local perspective:

Despite the legal challenge, local leaders say even more federal agents may be headed to Minnesota. Last week, FOX News reported an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents were coming to the state. Then, over the weekend, Sec. Kristi Noem said hundreds more officers were headed to Minnesota to keep federal law enforcement officers safe.

Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez urged residents to remain cautious while running errands and seek community help if needed.

The Whipple Federal Building, which serves as the base for ICE operations, has become a focal point for anti-ICE protests. Over the past 24 hours, the complex has been surrounded by barricades.

A subsidiary of Oneida ESC Group, a corporation owned by the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, cancelled a US $3.8 million contract with ICE for engineering and inspection of federal facilities after the Oneida government became aware of and condemned the contract. The Oneida government also replaced the subsidiary's board of managers.

Oneida Nation of Wisconsin’s Chairman Tahassi Hill, in an email to CBC Indigenous, wrote that every nation should have the power to determine its own vision and values.

""When issues arise that conflict with our laws, policies and core values, we must remain steadfast in acting immediately,"" the statement said.

Last month, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas announced it had cancelled a US $29.9 million contract for planning, research and concept designs for secure structures that its corporation had with ICE, and had fired senior members of the corporation's leadership.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centres. We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war,” said Prairie Band Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick, in a statement on YouTube.

“We must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

Becky Webster, an enrolled citizen of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and former senior staff attorney for the tribe, said tribal corporations operate independently from nations, so they can more nimbly expand into different economic ventures. It also protects the nation from certain legal liabilities.

Corporate boards provide oversight of daily operations rather than the nation, though there is regular reporting.

Webster said she was shocked when she learned her nation held a contract with ICE.

“The nature of the contracts runs counter to who I thought we were as a people and the values that we hold,” she said.

Matthew L. M. Fletcher, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and a professor of law and American culture at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the contracts are examples of affirmative action programs dating back to the 1960s and 1970s that favoured historically disadvantaged, minority-owned businesses.

Tribally owned corporations, Alaska Native corporations (created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971), Native Hawaiian organizations and businesses that are 51 per cent tribally owned are eligible for preferences in contracting under the federal section 8(a) program.

8(a) is a contracting and business development program for small business owners who are socially and economically disadvantaged.

“Congress created what they called set asides to make sure that at least a portion of defence contracting and other federal government contracting went to minority-owned businesses,” Fletcher said.

He said around the 2000s provisions were expanded, removing a cap for Indigenous-owned businesses, eliminating some paperwork still required by other minorities and authorizing no-bid awards to tribally owned or Alaska Native corporations.

While other affirmative action programs have been ended by the current administration, 8(a) was not affected.

“The weird thing is that the Trump people would never go in with Indigenous peoples as a matter of principle given their political stance against what they call DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion],” Fletcher said in an email.

“But the legal position these tribes are in makes this kind of contracting very attractive to them.”

Fletcher said tribes are not publicly traded corporations, so they don't have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and ""generally don't have to share information in terms of public accountability to anybody.""

And for matters of national security, public requests for information can be ignored, he said.

Pass-through entities

Akima, a business portfolio of NANA Regional Corporation, which is owned by 11 Iñupiaq villages in Northwest Alaska, holds multi-million dollar contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, including in relation to detention services at the Guantanamo Bay naval base.

NANA and Akima did not respond to requests for comment by time of publishing.

An April 10, 2025 statement on NANA's website said "" Since 2013, NANA and our affiliated companies have secured federal contracts in support of U.S. government-owned detention facilities. We have robust internal policies and compliance programs in place to ensure operations align with legal and ethical expectations.""

In the statement, board chair Piquk Linda Lee was quoted, “NANA does not deviate from our Iñupiat Iḷitqusiat values in the pursuit of contracts. Our values are fundamental to who we are as people and as professionals. They guide everything we do at NANA – upholding the dignity and wellbeing of every person.

“While we are limited in what we can share publicly about specific customers and contracts, we remain committed to transparency for our shareholders and accountability in all that we do.”

Fletcher said other Alaska Native corporations, the Mississippi Choctaw, Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw and some tribes in Oklahoma also do logistics work for the federal government, Fletcher said.

He said often these tribal corporations operate as pass-through or ""strawman"" entities.

“They will never do any of the work. They just happen to have that legal advantage of being eligible for no-bid contracting with no monetary cap on it,” Fletcher said.

Writer and environmentalist Winona LaDuke from White Earth Reservation in Minnesota said the situation today reminds her of the early '80s.

""They were trying to peddle nuclear waste and like 16 of the 20 recipients of the initial grants were Indian tribes,” she said.

“That was because there was a lot of money involved — no-strings money — and poor people with a lot of pressure on them.”

She said turning Indigenous people into corporations is a colonization process.

""Then you make them dependent upon the destruction of the world that they value,"" she said.

LaDuke said she thinks some of the contracts taken by some Alaska Native corporations are ""morally reprehensible.”

She said tribes like the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Oneida Nation of Wisconsin should pay more attention to their business operations in the future because if their citizens had not ""sparked an outrage,"" they might still have the ICE contracts.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.7583196,1768246754613/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%2834%2C0%2C1210%2C680%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-13 12:58:47.635219

It’s deep in her roots and where she came from.” President Trump remains far less popular than Hochul in his home state.
He’s tried to kill Manhattan’s congestion pricing toll program, withheld funding for infrastructure projects like the Gateway tunnel and cut off billions of dollars in child care reimbursement funds to blue states.
Yet she’s publicly expressed exasperation with his administration and cheered lawsuits meant to claw back money, including the child care funds.
“If you ask me, ‘Is he going to come after New York state because we’re a progressive state that tries to do all the right things?’” said influential Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger.","The governor will propose protecting student loan borrowers — a reaction to Trump’s effort to overhaul repayment rules. She wants to bolster farmers whose businesses have been disrupted by Trump’s tariffs and plans to propose $30 million in direct payments to agricultural producers.

Hochul is also pushing a muscular proposal to boost free child care statewide, a signature policy for her and New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Some Democrats see her agenda of countering Trump, framed around protecting New Yorker’s bottomline, as a replicable strategy for blue states nationally as the party struggles to adapt to the Republican president’s whipsaw policies.

“We have an obligation to set the pace and the tone for what the rest of the country is doing,” said Brooklyn Assemblymember Brian Cunningham, a Democrat and potential Hochul running mate. “Given New York’s reputation, we’re the Empire State, we’re the natural cultural setter. Just having that kind of bravado in film, Broadway and sports, we apply that to our politics.”

Hochul holds large polling advantages over her Democratic primary rival, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, as well as likely Republican nominee, Trump-endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman. But the stakes for the governor go beyond her own reelection bid. Democrats are counting on her to mount a robust campaign at the top of the ticket this year to support down-ballot candidates running in crucial House races that may determine control of the chamber next year — and the course of Trump’s presidency.

“Unfortunately for New Yorkers, Gov. Hochul wants illegal criminals on the streets, unreliable and unaffordable green energy sources to drive up prices for families and businesses, and hard-earned taxpayer dollars wasted on fraud,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “It’s a shame that governors in blue states refuse to implement President Trump’s commonsense agenda that is making America safer and more affordable.”

The governor’s policies will also set the tone for the next four years in New York City, a financial powerhouse for the country where voters elected Mamdani, an inexperienced democratic socialist who ran a campaign focused on bringing down the cost of living.

At the federal level, the temperamental Trump’s maximalist view of power underscores his desire to control Democratic-led states — withholding cash for child care and infrastructure projects while dramatically reducing health care funding.

As she rolls out her agenda and campaigns for reelection, Hochul is walking a narrow line between two polarizing figures who command zealous support. She must navigate the tricky politics of Trump’s immigration enforcement as Empire State Democrats push to broaden so-called sanctuary protections for undocumented residents. At the same time, the governor is also resisting a push to boost taxes on rich people — a red line that’s angered Mamdani supporters. Hiking taxes would open her up to criticism from the right, and Blakeman has already knocked her for presiding over a high-tax state.

Taken together, Hochul has little room for error when it comes to alienating the untested mayor, an unpredictable president and her own state’s voters — especially among suburbanites, with whom she’s struggled to gain traction.

“If she goes too far to the left on ICE, or anything really, there will be two people cheering her on, Zohran Mamdani and Bruce Blakeman,” said Republican former city Councilmember Joe Borelli. “But for vastly different reasons.”

Hochul, a reserved 67-year-old Democrat, has tried a menu of affordability measures — suspending state gasoline taxes, reducing a controversial Manhattan toll from $15 to $9, and sending rebate checks to taxpayers. Her favorability rating among New Yorkers has risen slightly over the last year and stands at 43 percent. A similar slice of voters, 44 percent, believe the state is heading in the right direction, a Siena University poll found last month.

Few voters appear to link Hochul with some of her more popular policies, like middle-income tax cuts and a push to expand home building in order to drive down stubbornly high housing costs.

“Affordability is certainly at the forefront right now, but that has been what she’s focused on since she first took office,” New York Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs said. “There are budget policies and initiatives that back that up, this isn’t new to her. She didn’t read a poll and decide to do this. It’s deep in her roots and where she came from.”

President Trump remains far less popular than Hochul in his home state. The same voter survey in December found Trump is viewed unfavorably by 62 percent of voters. Since then, Trump has conducted a risky seizure of Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, withheld child care funds to New York citing a Minnesota fraud scandal and offered his full-throated support to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed a 37-year-old woman.

The events of the last several weeks have emboldened New York Democrats to take a more assertive approach with the federal government, even as they pledge to address the cost-of-living problems facing New Yorkers.

The top Democrat in the state Senate, Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, kicked off the legislative session in Albany last week with a call to approve a bill that would prevent local and state law enforcement officials from working with federal immigration agents. Lawmakers are also weighing bills intended to guarantee legal representation for people facing deportation proceedings and prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks while on duty.

Hochul has typically walked a cautious line around immigration, which is seen as a third rail for Democrats. As a local official in western New York, she opposed allowing undocumented immigrants to access driver’s licenses — a position she later reversed. Yet in the wake of Renee Good’s shooting in Minneapolis, the governor is embracing a measure that would enable New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court when they’re accused of violating their constitutional rights.

Hochul also signaled that she’s arm-in-arm with Mamdani on opposing ICE expanding its efforts in New York.

“The mayor and I will stand together and reject any efforts to try and militarize our streets, but they never should have been in Minneapolis in the first place,” Hochul told MSNOW last week. “That’s the catalyst for this.”

Underscoring the multi-dimensional challenge for Hochul is Trump’s predilection for punishing Democratic-led states. He’s tried to kill Manhattan’s congestion pricing toll program, withheld funding for infrastructure projects like the Gateway tunnel and cut off billions of dollars in child care reimbursement funds to blue states.

Hochul has managed up with the often difficult president and frequently speaks with him on the phone. She’s met twice with him in the Oval Office to discuss energy projects and the Manhattan tolls. Yet she’s publicly expressed exasperation with his administration and cheered lawsuits meant to claw back money, including the child care funds.

The governor this month rallied with construction union members to blast the Trump administration’s decision to yank approval for offshore wind projects around the country, including one off the Long Island coast. Hochul struck a populist note with the workers — playing up her own blue collar roots in a historically hardscrabble part of the state.

“My uncles are longshoremen, carpenters, plumbers,” she said. “They help build the economy where I come from, a steel town, a tough, gritty place. That actually prepares you very well for the rough and tumble of politics.”

New York Democrats, though, will likely pressure Hochul to go further against Trump in the courts and in their own legislation — testing the governor’s mettle against a powerful political foe.

Hours after the murder of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, ICE agents unleashed tear gas and violence at a public school two blocks from the shooting, detaining two school staff who were following protocols to protect students.

The raids have incited fear and panic about the condition of loved ones who have been detained and attacked; lives and routines have been disrupted and thrown into turmoil. Educators have been horrified to see their students being “disappeared” from school grounds and see the negative impact of these injustices every day in the classroom.

We demand that our leaders prioritize the safety, dignity, and civil rights of our communities. No matter where you live, you can take action to end ICE's presence in every community across this country now.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison likened the deployment of ICE agents to a “federal invasion.”

Attorney General Keith Ellison: “Deployment of thousands of armed, masked DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop. DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area and in cities across the state of Minnesota.”

The lawsuit was filed Monday, five days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, sparking nationwide protests. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried the actions of the federal agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement. We are not asking ICE not to do ICE things. We are asking this federal government to stop the unconstitutional conduct that is invading our streets each and every day. You’ve seen the videos. At times, there are as many as 50 agents arresting one person. The scale is wildly disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe.”

The state of Illinois has also sued the Trump administration over use of federal forces in the state.

On Monday, residents of the Twin Cities continued to protest the deployment of ICE agents in their neighborhoods. Agents responded by firing tear gas, pepper spray and other chemical agents. In one incident, agents rammed the car of a Latino man in south Minneapolis and then questioned his immigration status. Christian Molina said he was pulled over and only let go after he told agents he was a U.S. citizen.

Christian Molina: “It’s not safe out here. It’s not safe, you know? People aren’t safe. So, just, I mean, I’m glad they didn’t shoot me or something, because, you know, what if they start shooting me? You know what I mean? They have guns.”

In another incident, masked, armed federal immigration agents broke down the door of a home in north Minneapolis on Sunday without a warrant. The agents used a battering ram to get inside the house in an attempt to arrest a Liberian man. Occupants inside the home included the man’s wife and 9-year-old daughter.

Iran says it is prepared for war but ready to negotiate, as the Trump administration considers attacking Iran over Tehran’s crackdown on the recent mass protests. Trump is expected to be briefed today on options including launching strikes inside Iran and offensive cyberattacks. On Monday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that conduct business with Iran, including China, India, Turkey and Pakistan.

The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights says at least 648 protesters have been killed over the past two weeks. An Iranian official also reported today the number of dead could be as high as 2,000. We will have more on Iran later in the show.

In other news from Gaza, a headstone has finally been placed on the grave of Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer, more than two years after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on December 6, 2023. His body wasn’t recovered until 10 months ago. Inscribed on the headstone are the closing lines of his most famous poem: “If I must die, / Let it bring hope; / Let it be a tale.”

A bipartisan group of former Treasury secretaries and other top economic officials has blasted the Trump administration for launching a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The probe was set in motion after Powell refused Trump’s demands to lower interest rates. The former officials described the investigation as an “unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine” the independence of the Federal Reserve. Signatories to the letter include former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. The Wall Street Journal reports Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately warned Trump the move to investigate Powell could backfire.

The House Oversight Committee is facing growing criticism for voting to subpoena the prominent investigative journalist Seth Harp after he posted publicly available information about a Delta Force commander who reportedly played a role in the recent U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Harp is the author of the book “The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces.” On Monday, 20 press freedom and First Amendment groups, including the ACLU and Reporters Without Borders, called on the House committee to rescind the subpoena, saying Harp’s reporting is “fully and squarely within the protections of the First Amendment.” This is Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights and Dissent.

Chip Gibbons: “The subpoena against Seth Harp has few parallels in recent memory. We have to remember Seth Harp has done some of the most important investigative reporting on U.S. foreign policy. It’s been critical reporting. The House knows full well the dangers to press freedom that subpoenaing a journalist poses. That’s why in 2024 they actually passed legislation to prevent executive branch subpoenas against journalists about their news gathering.”

The New York Times is reporting the Pentagon may have committed a war crime by using a secret aircraft painted to look like a civilian plane to attack a boat in the Caribbean in September. Eleven people died in the attack. The Trump administration claimed, without offering proof, that the boat was carrying drugs. Under international law, it is a war crime to commit what’s known as “perfidy” — disguising military equipment as civilian.

Russia launched another massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, launching nearly 300 drones, as well as 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles. The attack targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving thousands more without heat. Four people were killed in Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, a U.N. monitoring group says about 2,500 Ukrainian civilians were killed last year, making it the deadliest year yet for civilians since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.

In Sudan, the UAE-backed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a drone strike on a Sudanese army base in the southeastern city of Sinjah on Monday. Twenty-seven people were reportedly killed. The attack came a day after Sudan’s military-led government returned to the country’s capital Khartoum after operating in the eastern city of Port Sudan for nearly three years. The government’s return comes nearly a year after the military recaptured Khartoum from the RSF.

In labor news, nearly 15,000 nurses have launched the largest nursing strike in New York City history. Striking nurses have accused management at six private New York hospitals of refusing to negotiate fair contracts that improve safe staffing, fully fund health benefits and protect them from workplace violence. Striking nurses picketed outside NewYork-Presbyterian and other hospitals on Monday.

Striking NYC Nurse: “I am fighting for my healthcare insurance. I don’t know how I can be here working at a hospital that will not give me health insurance. It is so important for me to have health insurance. It’s so important to take care of the community. I love being a nurse. I want to take care of patients. I want to be at bedside. And it’s so important for us to strike, because we are fighting for patient safety.”

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined the striking nurses on Monday and praised their work.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani: “New Yorkers have a right to quality healthcare, as do the nurses who provide that care. My job as mayor is to protect both of those rights.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/55/80555/full_hd/hd3-Renee-Good-CREDIT.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 12:58:52.248557

“I made it clear that Farm Bureau policy supports trade, not tariffs,” Duvall said.","Democrat senator says she’s found common ground with Republicans in House

While immigration remains as polarizing an issue as ever, several national lawmakers say it may the right moment to reform laws affecting foreign agricultural workers.

Speaking to the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation, several leaders from Congressional agriculture committees said labor shortages are making the status quo intolerable.

“The time has come to get this done,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. “Sometimes, when things are the worst, you find an opening, and we’ve got to find that opening now.”

Klobuchar said she was recently able to find “common ground” on the issue during a meeting with several “very conservative House members,” as there are strong economic incentives to change immigration law.

“That is the case to make, about how we want to feed the world. We want to have strong businesses, and to do that, we need a smart immigration system that allows for workers. We cannot equate all the time border policy — which must be secure — with the economic needs of our farmers and ranchers.”

To that end, Republican lawmakers speaking on the Jan.11 panel in Anaheim, Calf., said the Trump administration is successfully halting the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S., making a conversation about reform possible.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, border crossings were down 93% during the first year of the Trump administration’s return to office.

The border had long been controlled by “the cartels,” but “today, it’s under control of the United States of America, and so that excuse is gone,” said Sen. GT Thompson, R-Penn.

Thompson said that he recently heard from a farmer who credited the H-2A foreign guest worker program with saving his operation a decade ago — but now, it’s threatening to put him out of business.

“It’s just not working,” he said.

Thompson didn’t delve into specific problems with H-2A, but the Farm Bureau has complained the required wages under the program are unreasonably high and other regulations are too onerous.

Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., said the Trump administration’s stance on immigration enforcement has exacerbated labor shortages, citing the example of employees who were deterred from showing up at a dairy farm due to the presence of federal agents nearby.

“Whether they were legal immigrants or not, they don’t want to come to work because they fear in this environment right now,” she said.

Though border security is a necessity, the U.S. is a “nation of immigrants,” with newcomers who want to contribute to the country economically, Craig said.

“My concern is that this administration, at times, does not act like they actually want immigrant labor here in the United States of America, and we all know that we need them in this sector of the economy and many, many others,” she said.

President is on board

However, Zippy Duvall, the Farm Bureau’s president, said he’s confident that President Donald Trump is on board with increasing the availability of immigrant workers for agriculture.

Duvall said he was “surprised” by Trump’s extensive knowledge about the issue and believes the president recognizes the impact that labor shortages have on the economy.

“I really do think this president, unlike any other president, really, in my lifetime — well, other than maybe Reagan — really wants to fix that problem,” Duvall said. “He realizes how much labor is needed not just for agriculture, but small businesses and the jobs he’s bringing back to America.”

Given the “level of undocumented workers that are out there in agriculture,” Duvall said that “farmers want to do the right thing,” but that they ultimately need a workforce to avoid the type of food shortages seen in the COVID era.

“There’s crops and animals that have to be taken care of, and we got to have the people to help us do that,” he said. “Americans have proved it over and over and over again, by not answering the call and advertisements, that they are not going to do that work regardless of what you’re willing to pay them.”

Duvall said he also broached he subject of the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on foreign imports, which has raised the price of crop inputs while provoking retaliatory trade measures that have lowered crop values domestically.

Farmers are appreciative of the federal government’s recent $12 billion “bridge payment” to farmers suffering from trade disruptions, but that amount “does not go anywhere near fulfilling the need that our farmers have,” he said.

“I made it clear that Farm Bureau policy supports trade, not tariffs,” Duvall said.

While it’s “not very comfortable to sit across the Resolute Desk with the President United States and tell you don’t agree with him,” Duvall said it’s “my job to do that.”

Trump responded with assurances that current trade measures are necessary to “bring people to the table” and fix problems for agriculture, he said. “My comment him was, we pray to God that you’re right.”

In light of low commodity crop prices and high costs for fertilizer, labor and other farm expenses, farmers need a “modernized” safety net that reflects current agricultural economics and technology, Duvall said.

“Truly, this is the most expensive crop we’ve ever put in the ground and it’s been a difficult time,” he said.

The necessity of a new Farm Bill was repeatedly emphasized during the convention, as the previous version was passed in 2018 and has repeatedly been extended since it was originally set to expire in 2023.

Rollins blames Democrats

At the convention, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins lay the blame on “Congressional Democrats” and the Biden administration for focusing too much on “other things like DEI and Green New Deals and climate change hoaxes” instead of nuts-and-bolts agricultural legislation.

“Because of this, you, our farmers were left with heavier debt loads and fewer tools to mitigate those risks,” she said.

Rollins also attributed rising expenses for fuel, fertilizer and labor to “Bidenomics,” which added to the burdens caused by the previous administration’s “crushing” regulations.

However, she assured farmers the Trump administration had already put “serious points on the board” and would make further progress in reducing the agricultural trade deficit and improving conditions for growers.

“We want to give your children every opportunity to thrive in rural America,” Rollins said.

The Trump administration is also fighting against harmful state regulations, such as California’s confinement regulations for egg-laying hens, which is an example of a “rogue” policy that has raised prices for consumers while making life difficult for farmers, she said.

Last year, the federal government challenged the constitutionality of those rules in a lawsuit, which California has asked a judge to dismiss, arguing the state regulation is not pre-empted by federal law. The litigation was suspended during the government shutdown but has since resumed, with a hearing on the matter scheduled for Feb. 23.

“It is one thing if California passes laws that affect only its own state, but it is another when those laws affect other states in violation of our United States Constitution,” Rollins said. “Thankfully, the Trump administration is standing up against this overreach.”

Rollins also vowed to oppose “anti-competitive behavior,” especially by “foreign-controlled corporations” that jeopardize agriculture through price-fixing and other practices affecting “meat processing, seed, fertilizer, and equipment.”

“If we don’t have an affordable and secure food supply, then we do not have national security,” she said.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2026/01/amy-klobuchar-copy.jpg?w=640,N,,2026-01-13 16:58:18.268835

In some states, lawmakers are pushing anti-ICE bills in response to the violence.

The number of “ICE Out” protests had been slowly growing in the run-up to the weekend of Jan. 10-11 but skyrocketed after agents fired into the Honda SUV driven by Good. She was hit in the head and killed. In her honor, the demonstrations were rebranded “ICE Out for Good.”

One group sponsoring the protests, United We Dream, put the death toll from ICE agents and their raids at 32 nationally since the Trump administration unleashed ICE agents nationwide.

ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is conducting mass roundups, many of them violent, of people they profile as Latino, Somali in the case of Minnesota, along with whomever else they wish, according to groups opposing their actions. U.S. citizens have reportedly been among those detained in some cases and are now, with the shooting of Good, on the list of those killed.

In the course of their operations, ICE agents have also targeted bystanders, observers, business owners, and journalists, going beyond those they racially profile. Good, for instance, was white, as was her spouse, who was on the scene but uninjured. The family dog was in the back seat, and the glove compartment was full of stuffed animals they intended for local children.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also complained that when ICE grabs people out of cars, it has left them sometimes still running but in park, in the middle of the street, endangering everyone around. He reported that at least one pet dog left in a car necessitated a call to Animal Control by police to take care of the animal.

ICE’s “Operation Metro Surge” flooded the Twin Cities with 2,000 agents, and Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, said in the wake of protests that she’d send many more. The government has added as many as 1,000 agents since last week and has stepped up the raids since the killing of Good. Besides Minneapolis, big roundups and, concurrently, demonstrations, have taken place in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, New York City, Memphis, and even in small towns and on rural farms.

Speakers at many of the protests labelled Good’s killing “murder,” while Trump administration officials hit back accusing Good of being “a domestic terrorist.”

Two prominent workers’ groups, the National Day Laborers Organizing Network (NDLON) and Workers Circle, were part of the sponsoring coalition for the protests held this weekend. Other sponsors included Democracy Forward, Indivisible, MoveOn, the ACLU, Public Citizen, United We Dream, Voto Latino, and 50501. The number of demonstrations may even be well above the reported 1,000 because even in a small state like Connecticut, there are reported to have been at least 24 demonstrations.

In Minneapolis, Somalia residents have begun attending the demonstrations in force and taking action to defend one another from ICE agents, including one group who surrounded two agents trying to detain someone and chased them away, shouting “Out!” Fear of ICE agents has been particularly high in those communities with the barrage of Trump attacks on them recently. Some told MS-NOW reporters that they felt a particular responsibility to show solidarity with everyone else in their city.

“We honor the memory of Renee Nicole Good,” said NDLON co-Executive Director Pablo Alvaradi. “We stand in solidarity with her family and the people of Minneapolis who are mourning her senseless and tragic death. She was shot by ICE agents who should never have been there – killed by masked gunmen who continually are disturbing the peace in that beautiful, peaceful city with acts of aggression, hostility, and violence.

“As we honor Renee Nicole Good, we call upon others to do the same by recommitting ourselves to peace, nonviolence, and justice. And as we grieve for Renee, we grieve for the countless others this administration has attacked and injured, chased and tormented in custody. And we say to ICE: Get out. Leave our cities. Put away your weapons. Leave us in peace.

“The White House is working to inflame outrage and provoke more violence with lies and false accusations. We must not take their bait.”

The ICE agent killed Good, “a U.S. citizen exercising her fundamental rights,” said Workers Circle CEO Ann Toback. “It is a stark warning to all of us about where unchecked power leads. This administration’s expanding use of force against our neighbors erodes the very rights and safety that define who we are as a nation.”

“As a Jewish organization, we know what unchecked power has done in the past,” said Toback, whose group was founded to help refugees who fled Czarist-sponsored Russian pogroms (massacres) more than a century ago, before the Russian Revolution in 1917. “We must not let that take root here, today.

“Now, more than ever, we must demand transparency, accountability, and policies that protect human life, human dignity, and civil liberties for everyone. Allowing federal forces to act without independent oversight undermines justice and threatens the safety of us all.”

Cameron Kritikos, a Minneapolis grocery worker, told National Public Radio he’s worried ICE will increase its violence. “If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there’s very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I’m nervous that there’s going to be more violence,” he said. “I’m nervous there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day, I think that’s not what anyone wants.”

ICE complained that “noisy people” were demonstrating, chanting, and banging pots and pans outside Twin Cities hotels that housed its agents. It also claimed one agent was hit by a thrown snowball. That prompted Mayor Frey, who had denounced Trump’s characterizations of the murder of Good as “b—s—,” to respond on social media that the city would arrest anyone who causes property damage or endangers others. “Except,” he said, “they aren’t. We are standing up to Donald Trump’s chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,” Frey wrote on social media.

The street protests weren’t the only reaction against ICE. State legislators are drafting measures to ban or evict ICE. Illinois State Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, who is running for an open congressional seat in Illinois, filed legislation that would bar anyone hired by ICE under Trump from obtaining employment in state or local law enforcement.

Chicago, a city Fine hopes to represent, was the site of ICE’s enormous “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has been shut down, though possibly only for the winter. The suffering in Chicago continues, nevertheless. There are reports that people, rather than face harassment and danger, have self-deported, leaving behind friends, neighbors, and family in deep shock about their fate and saddened about the holes left in their own lives now.

“Praying for them is good but not enough,” a pastor of a church attended by one such family said. “We must do everything we can to stop this attack on the people of God,” he said. “The demonstrations must continue to grow across this country.” In one case, a husband and wife with two young children, one of whom was born in the U.S. and therefore a U.S. citizen, left the country and returned to the home country of their parents.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signaled she’ll support legislation to allow residents to bring civil lawsuits against federal immigration officials for constitutional violations. And sources told People’s World that Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, is considering legislation to ban local law enforcement officials from cooperating.

New Jersey State Sen. Britney Timberlake, D-East Orange, wants to write state restrictions on cooperation with ICE into law. Gubernatorial orders “now limit state and local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, bar the government and hospitals from collecting immigration information and set up guidelines on how health care facilities, schools and other institutions should respond to federal immigration authorities,” Politico reports.

“Anyone who is a descendant of a Holocaust survivor will tell you this is how it starts,” Timberlake said in a committee hearing the day after ICE killed Good. “If you don’t believe me, just ask the children of Good.” A Trump regime Homeland Security spokeswoman objected. Timberlake shot back, “If you want to stop comparisons to the Gestapo and Nazi Germany, stop behaving that way.”

It’s not only in blue states that legislators are taking action. Tennessee State Rep. Gabby Salinas, D-Memphis, filed legislation to ban ICE enforcement on school and church property. Memphis is the scene of another big ICE operation, which the red state’s governor and legislature welcome—and it impacts a city with a majority of people of color. Salinas, however, admits it may not get far in the heavily Republican and heavily gerrymandered state legislature.

The Department of Homeland Security is claiming that its attacks on the streets of Minneapolis are its “biggest ever immigration enforcement operation” and brushes off the murder of Good as an “act of self-defense” by a driver who “weaponized her vehicle to attack officers.” With multiple videos possibly disputing that narrative, the Trump administration has declared that only the FBI control is allowed to investigate, with all local authorities frozen out of the probe.

People on the streets in Minneapolis see things as being vastly different from what the Trump administration is claiming. Protester Connor Maloney told AP that he was demonstrating to support his community because he is angry about what ICE is doing. “Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that this is happening all around us.”

The protesters in Minneapolis are contending with subfreezing temperatures, accumulated snow and ice, and some were seen some carrying signs saying “De-ICE Minnesota” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

The huge protests in Minnesota did not stop ICE from continuing its harassment of people in the city, however. An AP photographer witnessed, a few miles from where protests were going on, a group of heavily armed ICE agents approach a person they said was following them. Two agents pulled out long guns and pointed them at him and ordered him to stop following them. They said, “This is your first and final warning.” They drove off after that.

At another location in the area, the AP reported that agents pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away, as they detained someone coming out of a home improvement store.

Elected officials are also not left off the list of people mistreated by ICE. Three House members from the state of Minnesota made an attempt to tour the ICE headquarters in the state’s federal building. Ten minutes after entering, they were forced to leave, they told viewers on MS-NOW Sunday.

Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kell Morrison, and Angie Craig were the three denied their right to inspect the facility. They were told there is a “new policy” requiring lawmakers to give seven-day notice if they wish to inspect an immigration facility. That “policy” is a violation of the law that allows members of Congress to conduct their oversight responsibility at any time.

The second Trump administration has sought to end most TPS programs, which were dramatically expanded under former President Joe Biden.
But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature.","The U.S. government is revoking the legal status of several thousand immigrants from Somalia, raising the specter of deportation for a community often assailed by President Trump.

A Department of Homeland Security official said the Trump administration had decided to terminate Somalia's Temporary Protected Status program, which allows beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation.

Nationals of Somalia enrolled in the TPS program are now set to lose their legal status and work permits on March 17. The DHS official said roughly 2,500 Somali immigrants with TPS are expected to be affected by the termination.

The Trump administration has urged TPS holders whose status will lapse to self-deport, warning that they will be found, arrested and deported if they fail to do so.

""Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. ""Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.""

The move had been previewed last year by Mr. Trump, who has focused intensely on members of the Somali community, often describing them in derogatory terms. In a Cabinet meeting in December, Mr. Trump referred to people from Somalia as ""garbage,"" claiming they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

Mr. Trump and his aides have focused particularly on Minnesota, home to the largest community of Somali immigrants and Somali-Americans. Citing a massive fraud scandal in the state implicating members of the Somali community, the administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area.

The federal deployment has sparked clashes and protests, especially after the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

TPS dates back to 1990, when Congress created the policy to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from countries facing an armed conflict, environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.

The second Trump administration has sought to end most TPS programs, which were dramatically expanded under former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump's administration has moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.

Pro-immigrant advocates have strongly denounced the administration's actions, saying they punish people from crisis-stricken countries who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and, in some cases, decades.

But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature. It has also argued conditions in some of the affected countries have improved or that it's not in the national interest to renew protections for their nationals, criticizing TPS as a magnet for illegal immigration.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/13/a1c570e0-658e-48c0-9d4b-02116d491e1a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/019d0d6383ff5feffedddb1d32f6f7fd/gettyimages-2254503618.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:59:27.784141

She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.
In downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration’s mass deportations.
Protesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.
Atwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City jail to provide more details about Friday’s incident.","A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.

Jeri Rees said her 21-year-old nephew underwent six hours of surgery and that doctors found shards of plastic, glass and metal embedded in his eyes and around his face, including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from a carotid artery.

“That could have cost him his life,” Rees said.

“But now, for the next six weeks, he can’t sneeze or cough because it could do a lot of damage.”

She said doctors did not want to remove the shrapnel near the artery out of fear that it could kill him. She said her nephew, who is transitioning and goes by the pronoun he, also suffered a fractured skull around his eyes and nose and that doctors said he had permanently lost the vision in his left eye. She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.

Several videos of Friday’s incident were shared on social media. One video shows demonstrators, who were protesting the fatal shooting in Minnesota of Renee Good, throwing orange safety cones at the agents, who were standing guard outside the Santa Ana federal building.

The video cuts to three agents approaching the group before one agent tries to take a young person into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. The person taken into custody was identified by friends as Skye Jones.

In the video, at least one agent appears to fire nonlethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg before aiming and striking a protester in the face.

The video shows that person dropping to the ground after being shot, holding their face as the crowd retreats. The same agent then drags the protester by the hood of their jacket; they appear to be choking, grasping at the jacket binding their neck as blood pours from their left eye.

Another video shows the protester inside the building, lying on the ground bleeding while agents fire what appear to be pepper balls at the back of the head and neck of a man trying to record the incident with his cellphone.

Rees said her nephew told her that the agents pressed his face against the pool of blood and did not immediately call paramedics.

“The other officers were mocking him, saying, ‘You’re going to lose your eye,’” she said, recalling what her nephew told her.

Friday’s violent clash occurred just two days after a federal immigration agent fatally shot Good, a Minnesota mother of three. The slaying sparked public outcry, nationwide protests and scrutiny of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who said the agent was acting in self-defense.

Friday’s incident is the latest in a number of confrontations around the country in which agents have used deadly or what experts say is excessive force.

“This constitutes as deadly force as far as the law is concerned,” said Ed Obayashi of the video. The Modoc County sheriff’s deputy and legal advisor to police agencies, who has testified in similar cases, said that “all the training manuals and [legal] cases say you don’t aim at the face because these projectiles can cause serious injury [or] death.”

Obayashi said, based on law enforcement use-of-force standards, an officer can deploy deadly force if they feel their life is in imminent danger, or that they are in danger of great bodily harm.

“I just don’t see that here,” he said.

In downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration’s mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality as well. Protesters marched around the downtown area, chanting “ICE out of O.C.” and holding signs that read “No more raids, keep families together.”

An earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, said member Connor Atwood. Some members reconvened just before 6:30 p.m. for a demonstration outside the federal building put together by another organization, he said.

Atwood, who was present during the incident, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled. A group of protesters are seen in a video standing near a staircase away from the building’s entrance.

Homeland Security agents stepped out of the building various times throughout the night, firing nonlethal rounds toward protesters, Atwood said.

Protesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.

A portion of the crowd eventually dispersed, but leaders of Dare to Struggle encouraged some protesters to stand their ground to “say we’re not going to be intimidated away from expressing what we feel right now and delivering our message,” Atwood said.

Some protesters then began burning an American flag. At some point after 8:30 p.m., Jones, a leader of Dare to Struggle’s Orange County chapter, was arrested, Atwood said. The other protester was then hit in the eye.

“It wasn’t just completely out of nowhere, but it was very sudden,” Atwood said, adding that agents “had come out of the building several times before that, but they had not tried to arrest anyone or grab anyone.”

In an email response to The Times, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said a “mob of 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers outside of the federal building.”

“Two officers were injured. Two violent rioters were arrested and were charged with assault on federal officers and disorderly conduct,” she wrote. “This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields.”

McLaughlin did not respond to questions about protocols agents must follow when using less-lethal devices.

A spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only violence they were aware of that night were demonstrators tossing orange cones at the agents.

Atwood said he didn’t witness bottles or rocks being thrown toward agents. Some firecrackers were set off near the sidewalk but away from the building entrance, he said.

Both Homeland Security agents and Santa Ana police were seen standing outside the federal building just after 10:30 p.m., according to video footage reviewed by The Times. Fire paramedics can be seen taking Rees’ nephew in a gurney.

Atwood said Jones had an initial hearing Monday. Rees said Jones had been released and was at the hospital with her nephew as of Monday night.

Atwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City jail to provide more details about Friday’s incident. The group is also raising money through GoFundMe to help with the protester’s medical expenses.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d369450/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4514x2370+0+320/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2Fc4%2F6ccbea1f465d93bdeada38010208%2Fgettyimages-2218860235.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:57:53.357100

And the Democrats' letter noted that other pardoned riot defendants or members of the crowd on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 have already joined the administration.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.
At least one Capitol riot defendant has secured a high-ranking post in the Justice Department: Jared Wise, who is serving as an agency adviser.
Raskin is seeking information about any hiring of people pardoned by Mr. Trump by Jan. 26.","Nearly one year after the mass pardon of more than 1,500 Trump-supporting Capitol riot defendants, members of a House committee are investigating whether any of the pardoned rioters are now working for President Trump's administration in the fast-growing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

In a three-page letter sent Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi and obtained by CBS News, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee has requested all ""records, documents, memos, and internal communications regarding the solicitation and hiring of anyone charged or investigated for actions in connection to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.""

The committee's Democrats also said it remains unclear how many January 6 defendants ""have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security agents and officers.""

It's also not clear if ICE has hired any Jan. 6 defendants. But the agency is engaging in a rapid hiring spree, funded by a $75 billion funding boost passed by Congress last year that could allow ICE to add thousands of agents.

And the Democrats' letter noted that other pardoned riot defendants or members of the crowd on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 have already joined the administration.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and the judiciary panel's ranking member, said it is possible riot defendants would go unrecognized while serving as immigration agents.

""Unique among all law enforcement agencies and all branches of the armed services, ICE agents conceal their identities, wearing masks and removing names from their uniforms,"" wrote Raskin, who previously served on the House's Jan. 6 select committee.

Raskin's inquiry said, ""Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6th and were convicted of their offenses?""

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.

Mr. Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters have triggered an outcry among victims of the Capitol insurrection and Democratic members of Congress, who argue Mr. Trump has incentivized violence in his name by giving clemency to supporters who committed violence.

Mr. Trump has defended the pardons, claiming many of the defendants were ""absolutely innocent,"" were guilty of ""minor"" infractions or were given unfairly harsh sentences.

In testimony at a congressional hearing last week, Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who also served on the House's Jan. 6 committee, said the mass clemency has emboldened the rioters.

""The greatest threat to democracy comes from those in positions of power who are willing to subvert the rule of law. That is exactly what this Administration is trying to engineer,"" he said.

The inquiry into ICE hiring comes amid a roiling controversy over the deployment of federal agents into U.S. communities and confrontations between agents and protesters.

Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who helped repel the rioting mob at the Capitol, told CBS News: ""Given the pardons and appointments of people into this administration, lawlessness is not frowned upon but rewarded.""

At least one Capitol riot defendant has secured a high-ranking post in the Justice Department: Jared Wise, who is serving as an agency adviser.

Raskin's letter to the Justice Department alleged that Wise now has contributed to the administration's efforts ""to fire, demote, and harass the dedicated career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support personnel who did their professional and civic duty holding to account the persons who committed crimes on January 6th.""

Wise, a former FBI employee, was pardoned on charges of civil disorder and assaulting or resisting law enforcement. The Justice Department alleged in 2023 that Wise told D.C. police officers, ""You guys are disgusting. I'm former—I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it.""

Wise's trial was underway when Mr. Trump issued the January 20, 2025 pardons. His case was dismissed hours later.

'Domestic terrorism' The Trump administration has framed groups that monitor and track ICE as improperly keeping the agency from completing immigration removals.
Not everyone is comfortable filming ICE agents or pleading with people being arrested to provide contact information for their families.","At 5 a.m. most days, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement watch group fires up its Signal chat for another day of tracking arrests and raids in south Minneapolis.

A homemade checkpoint made of blue recycling bins is already in place near Powderhorn Park. Residents check license plates and flag vehicles they don't recognize or think might carry ICE agents. Those vehicles are the ones that usually blow right past the volunteers waving at them to slow down, said Andrew Fahlstrom, 44, one of the organizers.

At school drop-offs, parents and neighbors arm themselves with whistles, ready to blow if they see immigration authorities. Later, they'll drop groceries off for neighbors who are afraid to leave their homes and take others to doctor's appointments.

This is the neighborhood where Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot and killed by an ICE agent Jan. 7.

It has been the target of some of the heaviest immigration enforcement actions in the past six weeks and, like many of Minneapolis' communities, is home to a coalition of people who decided they needed to stand up for their neighbors when ICE arrived.

Good, like others in her community, stopped at the scene of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action near her Minneapolis home. Videos suggest she was pulling away from the scene as she was shot, though Vice President JD Vance and Department of Homeland Security officials accused her of using her vehicle as a weapon, leading the agent to fire in self-defense. Vance reposted a video taken by the agent to further the administration's position.

Her death sparked protests and vigils in large and small cities across the country that drew tens of thousands of Americans and reignited arguments over tactics used by community groups to monitor ICE's enforcement actions.

In recent days, Trump administration officials have called Good and others who track ICE and warn neighbors ""domestic terrorists.""

They call themselves neighbors, and they aren't backing down, Fahlstrom said.

""I don't see anyone deterred. What I see is more people clear-eyed,"" Fahlstrom told USA TODAY. ""The murder of Renee Good made it clear to everyone in the city just how dangerous and unhinged this group of armed agents actually is.""

He lives six blocks from where Good was killed. He was manning the checkpoint when he heard the sirens and the Signal chat lit up.

For weeks now, people have walked up and down Lake Street before work and on lunch breaks, educating neighbors at grocery stores and bus stops about what their rights are if ICE stops them, Fahlstrom said. The morning after Good's death, he watched four arrests and spotted 12 ICE vehicles in two hours on Lake Street alone, he added.

When suspected ICE vehicles arrive, a cacophony of car horns and whistle shrieks follows them wherever they go, and a mad-dash text chain sends word of their location. A crowd quickly gathers, filming and at times jeering at the agents.

When ICE makes an arrest, neighbors call out asking for the arrestee's name and a number they should call. They comb through the cars left behind for identifying information that helps them contact the family of the person taken.

ICE Watch trains neighbors to monitor and record

Since the first year of Trump's first term, immigration advocates have braced for a time when communities would need an alert and support system. They have embraced nonviolent ""cop watch"" tactics popularized during the Civil Rights Movement that include monitoring and recording police activity, generating multiple accounts of events, to supplement the official one, said Jill Garvey, codirector of States at the Core, which holds virtual “ICE Watch and Community Defense” training programs.

A year ago, before enforcement tactics ramped up, local organizers asked for some kind of training on what to do when the moment came, and ICE Watch began, she said.

The States at the Core training focuses on monitoring ICE activity and helping the arrested person by getting their name and contact information. The training also provides information about the rights an observer has and what can get them into trouble, such as interfering with an arrest and touching officers, and how to deescalate a confrontation.

It is legal to monitor or film federal agents in the course of their duty.

Garvey said more than 10,000 Americans spanning big cities to rural communities have taken the ICE Watch training since Trump was inaugurated last year, but how they implement it looks different in each community.

And communities have learned from one another. When ICE arrived in force last year in other Democrat-controlled cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, whistles quickly became the soundtrack of ICE arrest videos. Then honking while following agents' vehicles became popular.

More than 1,000 Minneapolis residents signed up for Community Defense and ICE Watch training the day after Good died, according to States at the Core.

'Domestic terrorism'

The Trump administration has framed groups that monitor and track ICE as improperly keeping the agency from completing immigration removals.

Good’s spouse was part of the Powderhorn/Phillips neighborhood chat, Fahlstrom disclosed, adding that he didn't know how involved the two were.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in several interviews Jan. 11, accused Good of ""domestic terrorism.""

On Jan. 12, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Good was a ""lunatic who was a part of an organized group to interject into and impede law enforcement operations.""

Days earlier, Leavitt said President Donald Trump stands behind ICE, and the ""deadly incident … occurred as a result of a larger, sinister left-wing movement that has spread across our country where our brave men and women of federal law enforcement are under organized attack.""

Texas Republican Rep. Roger Williams told the conservative station NewsMax that clashes would continue as long as protesters keep challenging immigration officials.

""We need to see some improvement in the fact that people need to quit demonstrating, quit yelling at law enforcement, challenging law enforcement, and begin to get civil,"" he said. ""And until we do that, I guess we’re going to have it this way, and the people that are staying in their homes are doing the right thing, need to be protected.""

But University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said the heavy-handed tactics being used, including plans to send hundreds more ICE agents into Minneapolis, are eroding the support the president had from people who wanted increased immigration enforcement and tighter borders.

""It kind of seems to confirm what the protesters are saying to the point where you have Middle America Minnesota saying, 'Wait, this is not right,'"" he said.

'I see my neighbors coming together in ways they have never done before'

Fahlstrom said there are as many neighbors delivering meals, helping with shopping and getting kids to school as there are recording ICE.

He works with Defend the 612, which helps connect people in the Minneapolis area code with the hundreds of small neighborhood groups involved in rapid response, school protection patrols and community aid planning.

""I see my neighbors coming together in ways that they have never done before,"" Fahlstrom said. ""I can't tell you how many people have responded to these raids after the moment and took on work that they never would have imagined themselves doing; like figuring out where kids should go, going through someone's car after they've been abducted … and trying to find the next point of contact and closest relatives.""

What involvement looks like differs by person, he said. Not everyone is comfortable filming ICE agents or pleading with people being arrested to provide contact information for their families.

Flannery Clark, 42, a parent in Powderhorn, said there are parents and community members outside pretty much every school in the Twin Cities at drop-off and pickup to watch for ICE and contact the administration inside.

They even stand guard at schools their children don't attend. Clark, who has an elementary schooler, said she was pepper-sprayed at Roosevelt High School when ICE arrived hours after Good's death.

Parents and community members coordinate rides to school, dropping off groceries and raising rent money for people too afraid to go to work, she said.

""It's amazing that thousands of ordinary people are doing this organizing. There's not some magic outside group doing it. It's just Minnesotans saying: 'These are our neighbors. We're going to take care of them,'"" she said.

Good's death hasn't changed her willingness to be involved.

""We all are extremely aware of the risks, but this is one of those moments where I really believe you have to do what's right and go into that knowing what the risk is.""

On the streets

Venus de Mars and her wife, Lynette Reini-Grandell, are ICE observers who live on the same Minneapolis block where Good died. They recorded the aftermath.

The couple frequently walk around the surrounding areas with their phones and 3D-printed pink whistles. Their neighborhood's group chat on Signal, which has buzzed constantly since ICE arrived six weeks ago, is busier than ever.

The couple said they are more anxious than scared, respectfully acknowledging that ""our immigrant neighbors are terrified,"" de Mars said.

""We might feel a bit more protected because we’re White,"" Reini-Grandell said.

""That’s not even guaranteed,"" de Mars countered, shaking her head no. ""Especially after they killed her.""

The Trump administration has described the legal action as ""baseless"".
The administration has said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and that further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.
""The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,"" Ellison said.
He accused the Trump administration of ""persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views"".","The US state of Minnesota has sued the Trump administration in an attempt to block a surge of federal immigration agents into the state.

The lawsuit argues the deployment amounts to an unconstitutional ""federal invasion"". Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said immigration operations had upended life for millions and caused ""chaos and violence"".

It comes after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.

The lawsuit asks a federal court to declare the deployment illegal. The Trump administration has described the legal action as ""baseless"". It has also pledged to significantly increase its deployment in the area.

The administration has said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and that further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.

In a news conference announcing the legal challenge on Monday, Ellison said the deployment violated the state's ""sovereign authority to protect the health and wellbeing of every single person who lives within our borders"".

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey alleged that agents were illegally targeting people who they assumed to be immigrants based on racial profiling. He said their actions had led to an increase in calls to 911, and forced city police to work overtime to investigate incidents involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,"" Ellison said.

He accused the Trump administration of ""persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views"". Democrats currently hold the governorship and control the state legislature.

""Keith Ellison made it abundantly clear today he is prioritising politics over public safety,"" Tricia McLaughlin from the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

""This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.""

During the news conference, prosecutors said they would attempt to get a court to issue a temporary restraining order to block the deployment as early as Tuesday.

It comes as the US Department of Homeland Security says it plans to send more agents into the state as part of its Operation Metro Surge.

The department says the deployment is necessary to combat illegal immigration and crime. According to recent estimates, around 2,000 agents have been deployed to Minnesota.

Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that ""hundreds more"" immigration agents would be sent to the area ""in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely"".

CNN reported that as many as about 1,000 agents from US Customs and Border Protection agents were being deployed to Minneapolis, citing two federal law enforcement sources.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3b89/live/f8f57460-efff-11f0-85ce-21b695a729bd.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 09:57:23.566534

Protesters continued to take to the streets Sunday, demanding federal immigration officers be removed from their communities following the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good.","President Donald Trump just defended ICE agents on the ground in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” whose only motivation is to remove criminal undocumented immigrants from the community.

In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump attacked familiar political rivals and said Minnesota Democrats “love the unrest that anarchists and professional agitators are causing because it gets the spotlight off of the 19 Billion Dollars that was stolen by really bad and deranged people,” referring to fraud allegations in the state. He also said a “reckoning” was coming, as around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week’s shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead.

Remember: Minnesota and Illinois are suing the Trump administration over the immigration tactics used their states, which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said have “terrorized our communities” and violated the Constitution.

“Every place we go, crime comes down. In Chicago, despite a weak and incompetent Governor and Mayor fighting us all the way, a big improvement was made. Thousands of Criminals were removed!” Trump said.

Trump did not mention in his post Renee Good, the US citizen and mother of three who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. On Air Force One Sunday, Trump called Good a “very violent” and “radical” person.

The Department of Homeland Security said today it is ending a form of humanitarian relief for Somali nationals living in the United States.

The Trump administration has stripped deportation protections from multiple nationalities in the US that were allowed to temporarily live in the country, arguing that conditions at home no longer justified those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, has prompted legal challenges nationwide and has been blocked by federal judges in some instances.

Tuesday’s announcement comes as protections for Somalis were set to expire on March 17. During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas extended the program for the community. The department is required to decide whether to extend or terminate TPS at least 60 days prior to the designation’s expiration.

In November, President Donald Trump indicated that he intended to terminate protections for Somali immigrants residing in the US, claiming, “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”

Somalis, particularly in Minnesota, have faced harassment and threats amid a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the community. Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority – 87% – are naturalized US citizens.

TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore so the protections are limited to people already in the United States.

Past Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections, though some Republicans have argued the relief shouldn’t have been extended multiple times.

Although Minnesota’s new lawsuit asking a judge to declare the latest surge of immigration enforcement in the state “unconstitutional and unlawful,” Attorney General Keith Ellison says the purpose is not to kick agents out entirely.

“We’re not saying that ICE cannot have a presence in Minnesota,” Ellison told CNN’s Sara Sidner on Tuesday morning. “We’re saying the dramatic escalation, which is unwarranted and politically motivated, is harming our state and our cities.”

The morning after the lawsuit was filed, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

“Well, if he’s threatening retribution, I believe that he means that,” Ellison told CNN. “He’s known for vengeance.”

The lawsuit by Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul that argues the Trump administration’s widespread immigration enforcement operation is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities” is not meant to stop federal agents from working within their legal limits, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her told CNN on Tuesday.

“This is to hold them accountable. They are terrorizing our neighborhoods and our communities, and (for) that they have to be held accountable,” Her told Kate Bolduan, adding the plaintiffs believe the Trump administration is neither complying with the Constitution and federal policies nor respecting states’ rights.

This “will be the precedent-setting case,” the Democratic mayor said when asked how this suit might align with prior legal claims.

“This is unprecedented time. There wouldn’t be any kind of case that exists already because this is the first this is happening,” Her said. “Never in any other administration has any president had this type of overreach into local jurisdictions.”

While they may contain strong claims, the lawsuits filed by Illinois and Minnesota are “really political diatribes masquerading as lawsuits,” CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said.

“If you look at what both states are asking the courts to do, it’s to kick ICE out of those states and cities and to bar ICE from carrying on federal law enforcement in Illinois and Minnesota,” he told Kate Bolduan on CNN News Central Tuesday morning.

But “there is zero precedent for that,” Honig said. “There is no way a judge can say, ‘You, federal law enforcement agency: You are not allowed to execute federal law in a certain state or city.’”

The most that Illinois and Minnesota could get out of their efforts – if they get sympathetic judges – “is a judge who’s going to ask questions of ICE, who’s going to hold hearings, who’s going to demand questions about how they’re training, how they’re carrying out their policy,” Honig said.

“But I don’t give them much of a chance of achieving the legal thing that they’re asking for in the courts.”

In its new lawsuit seeking an order to effectively shut down enhanced Customs and Border Protection activity in Illinois, the state is asking for the case to be heard by a familiar face.

The plaintiffs say the new case should be heard by Illinois federal judge Sara Ellis – an Obama appointee – who was previously assigned to a case challenging immigration agents’ response to protesters and journalists in the Chicago area last year.

In that case, Ellis ordered agents to avoid using pepper balls and tear gas unless directly engaged by protesters and only after giving a clear verbal warning.

Ellis expressed frustration with Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino – the leader of Operation Midway Blitz – in her order, saying he “admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.”

That case is still technically pending, but the plaintiffs have asked for it to be dismissed because Operation Midway Blitz ended in November.

Cases are typically assigned to judges within a federal district at random, but Illinois argues their new lawsuit is “related” to the previous suit on protesters, giving Ellis authority to take it. Ellis has not yet decided whether the case should be moved to her court.

Around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week’s shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead, according to two federal law enforcement sources.

The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, one of the sources said, coming on top of the deployment of about 2,000 federal agents to the area that CNN reported early last week.

CBP Commander Gregory Bovino has already been on the ground with hundreds of agents and has been conducting targeted operations, including door knocks, one of the sources said. Documents provided to those who receive door knocks are either administrative warrants – signed by an immigration officer but without the same legal weight as a judicial warrant – or copies of their final orders of removal.

Minnesota’s lawsuit against the Trump administration, asking a federal judge to end Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities, is not intended to cripple the ability of ICE to carry out its duties, Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday.

“Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN’s Laura Coates last night. “They’re doing far more than that … by harassing people, by using excessive force on a routine basis.”

Administration officials initially cited investigations of fraud connected to billions of dollars of federal funds centered on the area’s Somali community in announcing the surge, but Ellison argues the issues aren’t connected.

“What we need is accountants, you know. We don’t need armed paramiltaries harassing students at Roosevelt High School,” he said. “We don’t need them going to grocery stores, Target stores, and throwing people to the ground.”

Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was killed when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot into her vehicle during an encounter last week.

Good crossed paths with a 10-year ICE officer and Iraq War veteran named Jonathan Ross, who was dragged about 100 yards six months prior by a driver during an immigration operation in a Minneapolis suburb.

Good and Ross — whose brief confrontation ended with him firing his weapon at least three times as she attempted to drive away — are now at the center of furious debate over President Donald Trump’s administration’s building immigration crackdown, each side angrily assigning blame to the other.

Videos of the incident are still emerging, and there’s more to be learned.

Federal officials, including Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly accused Good of trying to use her vehicle to kill or harm ICE agents. She called it an “act of domestic terrorism.”

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state officials pushed back, blasting the actions of the officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable.”

The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, arguing the widespread federal immigration operation in the state is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities,” according to a lawsuit filed yesterday.

The suit is seeking a court order halting the operations, arguing the federal government is unlawfully commandeering state resources and violating Minnesota law and city ordinances.

The lawsuit also claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but rather a retaliation effort against Democratic-led Minnesota, citing the president’s disparaging comments toward local officials.

It is the latest development in the monthslong spat between Minnesota officials and the federal government after President Donald Trump first ramped up immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area in December.

More on the immigration operation: The federal government initially launched Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, to target undocumented Somali immigrants but it has also led to the arrests of immigrants from other nations.

“DHS law enforcement have made over 2,000 arrests since Operation Metro Surge began,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.

Nationwide outcry over the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week spilled into the streets of cities across the US over the weekend, with protesters demanding the removal of federal immigration authorities from their communities and justice for the slain Renee Good.

In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good’s name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities’ tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Similar protests unfolded across the US — from Los Angeles and New York to Washington, DC, El Paso and Boston. More than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the country this weekend by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.

“The response to ICE’s horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities.

Protesters continued to take to the streets Sunday, demanding federal immigration officers be removed from their communities following the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

The plan was never to become an ICE agent.

The plan, when I went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Career Expo in Texas last August, was to learn what it was like to apply to be an ICE agent. Who wouldn’t be curious? The event promised on-the-spot hiring for would-be deportation officers: Walk in unemployed, walk out with a sweet $50k signing bonus, a retirement account, and a license to brutalize the country’s most vulnerable residents without consequence—all while wrapped in the warm glow of patriotism.

At first glance, my résumé has enough to tantalize a recruiter for America’s Gestapo-in-waiting: I enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 82nd Airborne Division. After I got out, I spent a few years doing civilian analyst work. With a carefully arranged, skills-based résumé—one which omitted my current occupation—I figured I could maybe get through an initial interview.

The catch, however, is that there’s only one “Laura Jedeed” with an internet presence, and it takes about five seconds of Googling to figure out how I feel about ICE, the Trump administration, and the country’s general right-wing project. My social media pops up immediately, usually with a preview of my latest posts condemning Trump’s unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab. Scroll down and you’ll find articles with titles like “What I Saw in LA Wasn’t an Insurrection; It Was a Police Riot” and “Inside Mike Johnson’s Ties to a Far-Right Movement to Gut the Constitution.” Keep going for long enough and you might even find my dossier on AntifaWatch, a right-wing website that lists alleged members of the supposed domestic terror organization. I am, to put it mildly, a less-than-ideal recruit.

In short, I figured—at least back then—that my military background would be enough to get me in the door for a good look around ICE’s application process, and then even the most cursory background check would get me shown that same door with great haste.

The ICE Expo in Dallas, where my application journey began, required attendees to register for a specific time slot, presumably to prevent throngs of eager patriots from flooding the event and overwhelming the recruiters. But when I showed up at 9 a.m., the flood was notably absent: there was no line to check in and no line to go through security. I walked down nearly empty hallways, past a nearly empty drug testing station, and into the event proper, where a man directed me to a line to wait in for an interview. I took my spot at the end; there were only six people ahead of me.

While I waited, I looked around the ESports Stadium Arlington—an enormous blacked-out event space optimized for video game tournaments that has a capacity of 2,500. During my visit, there couldn’t have been more than 150 people there.

Hopeful hires stood in tiny groups or found seats in the endless rows of cheap folding chairs that faced a stage ripped straight from Tron. Everything was bright-blue and lit-up and sci-fi-future angular. Above the monolithic platform hung three large monitors. The side monitors displayed static propaganda posters that urged the viewer to DEFEND THE HOMELAND and JOIN ICE TODAY, while the large central monitor played two short videos on loop: about 10 minutes of propaganda footage, again and again and again.

After about 15 minutes of waiting, an extraordinarily normal-looking middle-aged woman waved me forward. I sat across the black folding table from her on one of the uncomfortable black chairs. She asked for my name and date of birth, then whether I am over 40 (I am 38). Did I have law enforcement experience? No. Military experience? Yes. Did I retire from the military at 20+ years, or leave once my enlistment was up? The latter, I told her, then repeated my carefully rehearsed, completely true explanation for why the résumé I’d submitted had a large gap. “I had a little bit of a quarter-life crisis. Ended up going to college for part of that time, and since then I’ve been kind of—gig economy stuff.”

She was spectacularly uninterested: “OK. And what location is your preference?”

After some dithering, I settled on my home state of New York. That was the last question; the entire process took less than six minutes. The woman took my résumé and placed the form she’d been filling out on top. “They are prioritizing current law enforcement first. They’re going to adjudicate your résumé,” she told me. If my application passed muster, I’d receive an email about next steps, which could arrive in the next few hours but would likely take a few days. I left, thanked her for her time, and prepared to hear back never.

The Expo event was part of ICE’s massive recruitment campaign for the foot soldiers it needs to execute the administration’s dream of a deportation campaign large enough to shift America’s demographic balance back whiteward. You’ve probably seen evidence of it yourself: ICE’s “Defend the homeland” propaganda is ubiquitous enough to be the Uncle Sam “I Want You” poster of our day, though somewhere in there our nation lost the plot about the correct posture toward Nazis.

When Donald Trump took office, ICE numbered approximately 10,000. Despite this event’s lackluster attendance, their recruitment push is reportedly going well; the agency reported 12,000 new recruits in 2025, which means the agency has more new recruits than old hands. That’s the kind of growth that changes the culture of an agency.

Many of ICE’s critics worry that the agency is hoovering up pro-Trump thugs—Jan. 6 insurrections, white nationalists, etc.—for a domestic security force loyal to the president. The truth, my experience suggests, is perhaps even scarier: ICE’s recruitment push is so sloppy that the administration effectively has no idea who’s joining the agency’s ranks. We’re all, collectively, in the dark about whom the state is arming, tasking with the most sensitive of law enforcement work, and then sending into America’s streets.

And we are all, collectively, discovering just how deadly of an arrangement that really is.

At the end of my brief interview, the recruiter mentioned I could talk to a current deportation officer about what the job would be like. There was no line to talk to a deportation officer (did I mention how empty the place was?) and so I walked up, introduced myself to one of them, and asked about day-to-day duties.

I shouldn’t expect to hit the streets right away, the agent told me. Odds were good I’d get a support position first—something like the Criminal Alien Program office. “Let’s say a local police officer arrests someone out in the field for a DUI. Extremely common. Or beating their wife or whatever—all the typical crimes they commit,” he said. (The “they” here being “undocumented immigrants,” and while it’s extremely difficult to measure, evidence suggests that “they” actually commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S.-born citizens.)

If the cops suspect they’re dealing with an immigrant who doesn’t have permanent legal status, they alert ICE, whose agents conduct interviews and run record checks.

If this preliminary investigation suggests that status, the person ends up in the Criminal Alien Program office for processing—which is where I would come in. “What you see on TV, with us arresting people and doing all kinds of crazy things, that’s maybe 10 percent. The other 90 percent is essentially doing a bunch of paperwork,” the agent said. “It takes a lot to remove somebody from the United States. Some people are subject to due process.”

The officer ran down other departments I might end up in: Prosecutions, Removal Coordination Unit, or Detention. The point being that I should not expect to be a badass street officer on Day 1. “I have so many guys that come over to me, they’re like, ‘I’m gonna put cuffs on somebody. I’m gonna arrest somebody.’ Well, you need to master this first and then we’ll see about getting you on the field.”

I told him that I was fine with office work—with my analyst background, it seemed like a better fit for my skill set anyway. His attitude shift was subtle, but instant and unmistakable; this was the wrong attitude and the wrong answer. “Just to be upfront, the goal is to put as many guns and badges out in the field as possible,” he said.

The agent then told me a bit about his own background. Like me, he enlisted straight out of high school, then got out and vowed to get as far away from the violence of the military as possible. Like a lot of veterans, he had trouble assimilating into the civilian world. “After about six months, I was like, ‘These people aren’t like me. I want to be around like-minded people.’ ” He found his way into law enforcement. That was well over a decade ago—he’s on his way to a very comfortable retirement, and he enjoys the work. “I like that instant gratification of Hey, that guy committed this crime, these X, Y, and Z, he’s not even supposed to be here,” he said.

I do not agree with his framing, but have no trouble understanding the appeal. Hell, it’s why I enlisted in the first place. Thankfully, Afghanistan beat it out of me. If I believed what he believed, I would surely do the same thing he’s doing.

I thanked him for the information and time, shook his hand, and took a seat on one of those uncomfortable folding chairs. I had a few hours before my flight back to New York City, and it made more sense to hang out than to flee the building and get good and airport drunk, regardless of how desperately I would have preferred the latter. Instead, I settled in to do what everyone does at the DMV: check my phone and people-watch. The aspiring officers fall broadly into three categories: thick-necked law enforcement types who look like they do steroids but don’t know how to work out, bearded spec-ops wannabes who look like they take steroids and do know how to work out, and dorks. Pencil-necked misfits. I couldn’t tell whether there were more white or Hispanic people waiting for their email, but it was close. A few Black applicants rounded out the overwhelmingly male group.

I’d been sitting around for about an hour when the video suddenly stopped and a bearded man in a black suit stepped onto the stage. He did not introduce himself—we were, I gathered, supposed to already know who he was—but it became clear he’s a senior agent of some sort. “I figured it would be best if I break up the same video you’ve been watching for the last four hours,” he said, and offered to answer any questions we might have.

One person asked about work/life balance, which the agent said is possible but not the route he’s chosen. Someone else wanted to know about travel opportunities and he talked about the many places he’s gone as part of the job.

Every other question during the 45 minutes the agent stood onstage pertained to the hiring process or what we could expect in training. Law enforcement types seemed especially concerned about the painful parts: Would they have to get pepper sprayed again? Would they have to get shot with a taser if they’d already qualified? Yes and probably not, respectively. The agent took the opportunity to gush about ICE’s new state-of-the-art semi-automatic tasers and brand-new pepper-ball guns. “It’s mostly very liberal cities—San Francisco, Los Angeles—where groups will come and try to stop ICE officers from arresting somebody. They’re like, ‘We’re going to form a human wall against you,’ ” he said. “When they do that, you can just pop ‘em up. Let them disperse and cry about it.”

When, during a moment of protracted silence, the agent threatened to put the video back on if no one had questions, I asked about harassment and doxing. “We will prosecute people to the fullest extent of the law,” he assured me, “and then people like myself will go on TV and publicly talk about how that person is now in prison to dissuade other people from doing it.”

As empty as the place had been when I’d arrived, it was even emptier by the time the senior agent ended the Q&A. Somebody vastly overestimated the number of Americans willing to take a job brutalizing and disappearing hard-working men and women—even with a potential $50K bonus, even in this economy.

That may have something to do with what happened to me next.

I completely missed the email when it came. I’d kept an eye on my inbox for the next few days, but I’d grown lax when nothing came through. But then, on Sept. 3, it popped up.

“Please note that this is a TENTATIVE offer only, therefore do not end your current employment,” the email instructed me. It then listed a series of steps I’d need to quickly take. I had 48 hours to log onto USAJobs and fill out my Declaration for Federal Employment, then five additional days to return the forms attached to the email. Among these forms: driver’s license information, an affidavit that I’ve never received a domestic violence conviction, and consent for a background check. And it said: “If you are declining the position, it is not necessary to complete the action items listed below.”

As I mentioned, I’d missed the email, so I did exactly none of these things.

And that might have been where this all ended—an unread message sinking to the bottom of my inbox—if not for an email LabCorp sent three weeks later. “Thank you for confirming that you wish to continue with the hiring process,” it read. (To be clear, I had confirmed no such thing.) “Please complete your required pre-employment drug test.”

The timing was unfortunate. Cannabis is legal in the state of New York, and I had partaken six days before my scheduled test. Then again, I hadn’t smoked much; perhaps with hydration I could get to the next stage. Worst-case scenario, I’d waste a small piece of ICE’s gargantuan budget. I traveled to my local LabCorp, peed in a cup, and waited for a call telling me I’d failed.

Nine days later, impatience got the best of me. For the first time, I logged into USAJobs and checked my application to see if my drug test had come through. What I actually saw was so implausible, so impossible, that at first I did not understand what I was looking at.

Somehow, despite never submitting any of the paperwork they sent me—not the background check or identification info, not the domestic violence affidavit, none of it—ICE had apparently offered me a job.

According to the application portal, my pre-employment activities remained pending. And yet, it also showed that I had accepted a final job offer and that my onboarding status was “EOD”—Entered On Duty, the start of an enlistment period. I moused over the exclamation mark next to “Onboarding” and a helpful pop-up appeared. “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

I clicked through to my application tracking page. They’d sent my final offer on Sept. 30, it said, and I had allegedly accepted. “Welcome to Ice. … Your duty location is New York, New York. Your EOD was on Tuesday, September 30th, 2025.”

By all appearances, I was a deportation officer. Without a single signature on agency paperwork, ICE had officially hired me.

Perhaps, if I’d accepted, they would have demanded my pre-employment paperwork, done a basic screening, realized their mistake, and fired me immediately. And yet, the pending and upcoming tasks list suggested a very different outcome. My physical fitness test had been initiated on Oct. 6, it said: three days in the future. My medical check had apparently been completed on Oct. 6.

The portal also listed my background check as completed on Oct. 6. Had I preemptively passed? Was ICE seriously going to let me start training without finding out the first thing about me? I reached out to ICE for an explanation, but never heard back.

The only thing left for me to do was press the green “Accept” button on the home page. And maybe I should have. Maybe no one would have ever checked my name and I could have written the story of a lifetime. Or maybe the agency infamous for brutalizing and disappearing people with no regard for the law or basic human rights would have figured out exactly who I am while I was in one of their facilities with no way to escape. I’m not actually a domestic terrorist sent straight from Antifa headquarters, but to a paranoid fascist regime increasingly high on their own supply, I sure look like one on paper. Self-preservation won out.

I hit “Decline,” closed my browser, and took a long, deep breath.

What are we to make of all this? To be clear, I barely applied to ICE. I skipped the steps of the application process that would have clued the agency in on my lack of fitness for the position. I made no effort to hide my public loathing of the agency, what it stands for, and the administration that runs it. And they offered me the job anyway.

It’s possible that I’m an aberration—perhaps I experienced some kind of computer glitch that affected my application and no one else’s. But given all of the above, it seems far more likely that ICE is running an extremely leaky ship when it comes to recruitment.

With no oversight and with ICE concealing its agents’ identities, it’ll be extremely difficult for us to know.

There’s a temptation to take some comfort in ICE’s sloppiness. There’s a real argument here that an agency so inept in its recruitment will also be inept at training people and carrying out its mission. We’re seeing some very sloppy police work from ICE, including an inability to do basic things like throw someone down and cuff them. On some level, all of this is a reminder that their takeover is neither total nor inevitable.

But if they missed the fact that I was an anti-ICE journalist who didn’t fill out her paperwork, what else might they be missing? How many convicted domestic abusers are being given guns and sent into other people’s homes? How many people with ties to white supremacist organizations are indiscriminately targeting minorities on principle, regardless of immigration status? How many rapists and pedophiles are working in ICE detention centers with direct and unsupervised access to a population that will be neither believed nor missed? How are we to trust ICE’s allegedly thorough investigations of the people they detain and deport when they can’t even keep their HR paperwork straight?

And if they’re not going to screen me out, what hope is there of figuring out which recruit might one day turn into a trigger-happy agent who would forget that law enforcement officers are trained not to stand in front of vehicles, get jumpy, and shoot a 37-year-old woman to death on the streets of Minneapolis?

That’s exactly what happened last week, and why Renee Good will never have a 38th birthday, and why her children will never again be hugged by their mother.

By all appearances, the only thing ICE is screening for is a desire to work for ICE: a very specific kind of person perfectly suited for the kind of mission creep we are currently seeing. Good’s murder is not an isolated incident; the American Civil Liberties Union reports a nationwide trend of ICE pointing guns at, brutalizing, and even detaining citizens who stop to film them. A Minneapolis pastor who protested ICE by chanting “We are not afraid” was detained at gunpoint by an agent who reportedly asked him: “Are you afraid now?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

Ms. Menin said that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to work and remain in the United States until October 2026.
“He, in fact, signed an attestation in January at the City Council that he’s never been arrested,” said Ms. Menin, a Democrat elected to lead the Council last week.

The employee, a data analyst whom Ms. Menin did not publicly identify, is the first City Council staff member to be detained by Trump immigration officials, Ms. Menin said during a hastily convened news conference at City Hall on Monday evening.

Ms. Menin said that the employee, who had worked for the Council for about a year, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials during a routine immigration appointment on Long Island.

Ms. Menin and ICE officials offered conflicting information about the staff member’s immigration status and criminal history.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, identified the employee as Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, whom she said had entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2017 that required him to leave by October 2017.

Ms. McLaughlin said Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had “an arrest for assault,” though it was not clear if he had been charged or arrested. “He had no legal right to be in the United States,” Ms. McLaughlin said in a statement issued late Monday.

Ms. Menin said that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to work and remain in the United States until October 2026. Her office later specified that he had work authorization because he had qualified for Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian program that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. extended to Venezuelans but President Trump has since revoked.

Ms. Menin also said that he did not appear to have a criminal record.

“He, in fact, signed an attestation in January at the City Council that he’s never been arrested,” said Ms. Menin, a Democrat elected to lead the Council last week. “This man chose to work for the Council on behalf of the public, on behalf of New Yorkers, and despite every indication that he was doing everything the right way, he still found himself a victim of egregious government overreach.”

Ms. Menin said that she spoke with the deputy director of the ICE field office in New York, who she said confirmed that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had been arrested without providing a reason.

Ms. Menin said that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez was being held at a Lower Manhattan facility on Varick Street, the site of an immigration courthouse.

The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first.

Democratic officials in New York City, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani, joined Ms. Menin in denouncing the detention.

“This is an assault on our democracy, on our city and our values,” Mr. Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, said. “I am calling for his immediate release and will continue to monitor the situation.”

The Trump administration has arrested thousands of immigrants showing up for check-ins at ICE offices and routine hearings at immigration courthouses. The tactic has been used heavily in New York, where masked ICE agents have arrested migrants at courthouses on a nearly daily basis, turning the courts into flash points.

Many of the migrants being detained were allowed into the United States by the Biden administration, under legal pathways and humanitarian programs that the Trump administration has sought to revoke.

In recent weeks, immigration lawyers said that they had noticed an uptick in the arrest of migrants showing up at ICE offices for check-ins in New York.

Immigrants summoned for check-ins are typically undocumented, have tenuous legal status or are facing deportation but have been allowed to remain in the United States at the federal government’s discretion, so long as they regularly appear at an ICE office.

“They are going after the easiest prey they can find, and that is the people who are going to court and going to their check-ins,” Representative Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, said during the City Hall news conference.

Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana over whether oil and gas companies can move a lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for damage to the Louisiana coast to federal court.
They contend that the oil and gas companies, whose predecessors produced crude oil along the coast during World War II, violated the law and damaged the coast, and the parishes sought to have the companies pay damages.
Monday’s proceedings centered on the companies’ efforts to transfer the case from state to federal court under the federal officer removal statute.
It concluded that the parishes’ lawsuits focus on the companies’ exploration for, and production of, crude oil, while the companies entered into contracts with the government during the war to produce aviation gasoline, known as avgas, which required them to refine crude oil.
“By assisting the federal government in obtaining a critical wartime product under federal supervision,” Roper said, the companies “acted under a federal officer in refining avgas.","The Supreme Court on Monday morning grappled with a dispute in Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana over whether oil and gas companies can move a lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for damage to the Louisiana coast to federal court. A lawyer for the companies told the justices that they should be allowed to do so under a federal law, known as the federal officer removal statute, that gives federal courts the power to hear state court cases filed against “any officer (or any person acting under that officer) or the United States or of an agency thereof, in an official or individual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such office.” Paul Clement argued that the conduct at the center of the case “effectively amounted to a joint venture during World War II to get as much oil out of the ground, transport it to the refineries that the government was helping to finance to expand, all in an effort to get petroleum products and in particular” aviation gasoline “onto the war front.”

Several justices, however, expressed concern about the potential reach of the companies’ position. That concern, combined with the dearth of questions for Louisiana Solicitor General J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, who represented the challengers, and the absence of Justice Samuel Alito (who did not participate in the case because he has a financial interest in a parent company of one of the defendants), made it difficult to predict who will ultimately prevail.

The dispute before the court on Monday is one of 42 that a group of Louisiana coastal parishes (along with state officials) filed under state law more than a decade ago. They contend that the oil and gas companies, whose predecessors produced crude oil along the coast during World War II, violated the law and damaged the coast, and the parishes sought to have the companies pay damages.

Monday’s proceedings centered on the companies’ efforts to transfer the case from state to federal court under the federal officer removal statute. A federal appeals court in New Orleans rejected the companies’ plea. It concluded that the parishes’ lawsuits focus on the companies’ exploration for, and production of, crude oil, while the companies entered into contracts with the government during the war to produce aviation gasoline, known as avgas, which required them to refine crude oil. And in particular, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit emphasized, the companies’ contracts with the government did not require them to produce crude oil at all; instead, they could have bought it on the open market.

The companies then came to the Supreme Court, which agreed last year to weigh in.

Representing the companies on Monday, Clement emphasized that the phrase “relating to” in the federal officer removal statute was a “capacious” one, intended to have “substantial breadth.” Indeed, he suggested, the parishes effectively do not defend the lower court’s conclusion but instead shift their focus to a different part of the statute, dealing with who can move a case to federal court. “That effort to change the subject does not work,” Clement argued.

There is little doubt, Clement said, “that the refining of avgas under federal contract satisfies” the removal statute’s “acting under” requirement; the only question, he indicated, is whether the companies’ refining activities are “connected to or associated with the production activities assailed in these lawsuits.” And the answer is “yes,” he insisted, because crude oil was an “indispensable component” of avgas.

Aaron Roper, an assistant to the U.S. solicitor general who argued on behalf of the federal government in support of the companies, echoed Clement’s argument. “By assisting the federal government in obtaining a critical wartime product under federal supervision,” Roper said, the companies “acted under a federal officer in refining avgas. That refining is an act under color of federal office that can support removal. And these suits relate to that act because they target the production of the crude oil that was the key ingredient in avgas and that the federal government linked to that refining by both contract and regulation.”

But some justices were skeptical. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson countered that the addition of the phrase “relating to” was intended to be merely a “conforming amendment” that did not substantively change the statute’s meaning.

For his part, Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Clement and later Roper about the scope of the companies’ proposed rule. Roberts asked Clement “how far upstream” a company could go and still have a product “relate to” the subject of a federal contract. For example, Roberts asked, if a vertically integrated company sells products to the government, would products “10 steps above that, where they’re buying the materials,” “relat[e] to” a government act?

Later Roberts told Roper that the phrase “relating to” is “very broad.” Where, he asked, do you draw the line? Roberts worried aloud that adopting a broad interpretation of the phrase would have a “butterfly effect.” “You know,” Roberts said, “the butterfly flaps its wings and it has the end result halfway around the world?”

Justice Neil Gorsuch also indicated that the phrase “relating to” was expansive. He quipped to Roper, “The Big Bang is related to you being here today, counsel.”

Clement argued that this case was “relatively straightforward” because of the central role for crude oil in producing avgas. And he offered a possible test to provide guidance for courts interpreting the rule: the key question, he said, is whether stopping the activity in which the defendants engaged “would have a direct negative effect on the government” – which, in this case, he said, it would.

Clement later offered another possible limit on his rule, telling the justices that “if you recognize that the kind of regulation here is distinct in the World War II context,” the court could reverse the lower court’s decision and rule for the companies without opening the floodgates to a mass movement of cases from state to federal court under the law at the center of the case.

Roper also sought to quell the chief justice’s concerns, telling him that the court didn’t necessarily need to resolve all of the line-drawing issues in this case.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett wondered aloud how the court should dispose of the case if it agreed with Clement that the lower court had applied the wrong rule. Should it send the case back to the 5th Circuit for it to take another look under the new rule, she queried, or should it go ahead and hold that the case can be moved?

Clement urged the justices to apply the new test themselves, rather than returning the case to the lower court.

Justice Elena Kagan asked Clement to address what she characterized as an “apparent anomaly” created by the companies’ position: a vertically integrated company that had the capacity to both produce crude oil and refine it could rely on the removal law and end up in federal court, while a non-integrated company without a refining capacity could not. “Why isn’t that just a bizarre outcome?,” she asked.

Clement conceded that there was a “surface anomaly.” But he urged the court to think about this question in terms of the “acting under” prong of the removal law. When you do that, he suggested, “it makes sense that” companies that had contracts directly with the federal government – the vertically integrated companies that had refining contracts with the government but also produced crude oil – “get to remove and those that are not don’t get to remove.”

During his time at the lectern, Aguiñaga called the dispute before the justices an “easy case,” as he emphasized that the oil companies “do not dispute that they dumped billions of gallons of” waste water “from oil wells directly into our marsh.” And in particular, he added, the companies had “abandoned below any argument that they were acting under a federal officer in committing the acts charged in our complaints” – which would mean that they could not transfer their case to federal court.

Aguiñaga also emphasized what he characterized as a “fundamental disconnect between this refinery theory” – the companies’ reliance on their contracts to produce avgas, which required them to refine crude oil – and the conduct that the parishes and state were targeting in their complaints, which was based on the exploration for and production of crude oil. “I think this Court has never seen and” the oil companies “have not identified for you any case where this Court has basically mixed and matched the ‘acting under’ conduct that satisfies prong 1 with whatever the conduct is that satisfies prong 2 [‘for or relating to any act under color of such office’].”

Aguiñaga spoke at length without interruption – whether this was because the justices largely agreed with him or instead because they had already made up their minds remains to be seen.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2199126048.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:58:04.544576

Why it matters: Unlike during Trump's first term, it's not just progressives taking up the ""defund ICE"" banner.
""We've got a level of funding that makes ICE bigger than a lot of militaries around the world.""
""We need funding reductions ... policy is not enough,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), who stressed that ""'defund' and 'abolish' are two different things.""
The other side: Some centrist Democrats — while signaling they would support policy changes — drew a clear line in the sand against defunding ICE.","Last week's shootings in Minneapolis and Portland has supercharged a push by Democrats in Congress to use an upcoming government funding deadline to try to slash funding to ICE.

Why it matters: Unlike during Trump's first term, it's not just progressives taking up the ""defund ICE"" banner. The idea is proliferating even among the more moderate and establishment wings of the party.

""What we've seen in Minneapolis and in Portland is what happens when we militarize against our own people,"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.). ""We've got a level of funding that makes ICE bigger than a lot of militaries around the world.""

Peters, a leading member of the center-left New Democrat Coalition, said he is ""totally open"" to trying to reduce ICE's funding and quipped: ""Consider me a progressive.""

Rep. John Mannion (D-N.Y.), a swing-district centrist, noted that the Big, Beautiful Bill nearly tripled ICE's funding: ""I would support reducing that funding back to fiscal year 2024 levels if I could.""

State of play: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) is proposing a set of reforms to the agency that he wants to tie to the Jan. 31 fiscal cliff, but some progressives say policy riders are insufficient.

""We need funding reductions ... policy is not enough,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), who stressed that ""'defund' and 'abolish' are two different things.""

""Some of us are at the 'abolish 'place, proudly. And I think moderates can start thinking about what does 'defund' mean,"" Ramirez told Axios.

Ramirez said she will ""have legislation very soon that will have language people can live with"" which would ""reprioritize funding that should have never have gone to kill people into housing and health care.""

Said Progressive Caucus chair Greg Casar (D-Texas): ""There has been a huge increase in money that has provided no increase in safety. ... [Trump] is burning taxpayer money only to make people less safe.""

The other side: Some centrist Democrats — while signaling they would support policy changes — drew a clear line in the sand against defunding ICE.

""I don't know if we need to defund ICE,"" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), who said the agency has been ""overly funded"" but that ""we don't have the votes for that anyway.""

Said Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine): ""I think it is not politically viable and I don't believe in it substantively ... I don't believe in defunding an entire law enforcement agency over the actions of a few of them.""

Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) said there ""are mechanisms in which we should be able to get the administration's attention where our powers can't be ignored,"" but that he is ""not interested in going anywhere near"" defunding ICE.

Between the lines: After a week of indicating that extending Affordable Care Act tax credits were his priority in the government funding fight, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) waded into the ICE funding debate during a press conference on Monday.

""It's important to understand that a lot of the funding for ICE that is currently being unleashed on the American people ... was provided not through the traditional appropriations process, but in connection with the one big, ugly bill,"" he said.

Beyond that, the Democratic leader was characteristically cryptic, telling reporters: ""That's something we will collectively be working on as our discussions continue.""

The bottom line: Republicans control Congress, and even progressives on the House Appropriations Committee acknowledged to Axios that any bill funding the Department of Homeland Security likely won't contain cuts for ICE.

Some lawmakers are also reticent to take up Murphy's threat to oppose a government funding bill if it fails to contain sufficient policy riders to rein in ICE.

Mannion said he tries ""not to let one thing in a budget"" keep him from voting for it, telling us, ""I've got to be thoughtful about that.""

Said Golden: ""It's on Chris Murphy to decide what he wants to do in the Senate, but I'm not for shutting down the government.""",https://images.axios.com/_w-H1WT0hDeF-oy7vzCFGQatcn4=/1366x768/smart/2025/03/13/201402-1741896842756.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:58:39.294749

A system once strained by volume is now destabilized by design – and that is a far greater public safety risk.","Immigration enforcement in the United States has drifted away from its core purpose. What began as a public safety function – focused on serious threats and guided by professional judgment – has become something far more volatile: politicized, disconnected from local realities and increasingly dangerous for everyone involved.

The recent tragedy in Minnesota should force a reckoning. Not because it is unique, but because it is the inevitable outcome of where we are – and where we are headed – if we refuse to change course.

I’ve spent two decades inside the national security and homeland security system. I’ve worked alongside agents who take their oath seriously and understand the weight of the authority they carry. We also all know how fragile public trust is, and how quickly it can be shattered when enforcement loses its grounding in common sense and accountability.

What we are witnessing now is not enforcement designed to protect Americans. It is enforcement untethered from public safety, driven by optics, speed, daily arrest quotas and political pressure rather than judgment. And that makes everyone less safe.

ICE's tactics are dangerous for public safety – and law enforcement

First, this approach is dangerous for law enforcement officers themselves.

When federal agents are pushed into fast-moving, high-visibility operations without clear prioritization or coordination with local partners, risk skyrockets, and officers are placed in volatile encounters with little margin for error. Split-second decisions carry life-or-death consequences – for both civilians and for agents.

Second, this model undermines public safety instead of advancing it.

Public safety is not measured by arrest numbers or viral footage. It is measured by whether communities are safer tomorrow than they were yesterday. When immigration enforcement prioritizes volume over threat, resources are diverted away from the work that actually protects people – investigating violent crime, dismantling trafficking networks and disrupting transnational criminal organizations.

Every hour spent arresting noncriminal students, workers, parents, older people and decade-long leaders in our communities – people chosen for visibility, not threat – is an hour stolen from real public safety work. That tradeoff is rarely acknowledged, but it is real. And it compounds quickly. Investigations stall. Intelligence dries up. The system grows weaker even as it looks tougher.

Third, this approach destroys trust – the most critical currency in law enforcement. Trust between federal agencies and local law enforcement. Trust between officers and the communities they serve. Trust that the law is being enforced fairly, rationally and with common sense.

You cannot police effectively in an environment of fear

When federal enforcement operates without transparency or coordination, local partners pull back. When communities see enforcement as arbitrary or performative, cooperation evaporates. Witnesses stop coming forward. Tips disappear. Fear replaces dialogue.

You cannot police effectively in an environment of fear. You cannot protect communities that do not trust you. And once that trust is broken, rebuilding it takes years – if it can be rebuilt at all.

Fourth, this moment exposes the cost of leadership failure.

America’s immigration system is broken. That is not a controversial statement. What is controversial is pretending that aggressive enforcement alone can fix it.

For decades, leaders have avoided the hard work of reform – updating laws, creating legal pathways that reflect economic reality, investing in immigration judges and other adjudication capacity and legislating clear enforcement priorities rooted in public safety. Instead, they’ve leaned on executive action and enforcement surges as a substitute for governance.

That long-standing avoidance has real consequences. When enforcement becomes a blunt tool for political frustration, agents are left to execute missions that policy never clearly defined. They are placed in situations that stretch beyond their training, authority and resources, increasing risk for officers, agencies and the communities they serve.

That is how we arrive at moments like Minnesota – not as anomalies, but as symptoms.

If this trajectory continues, the damage will not be linear. It will be exponential.

More dangerous encounters. More mistrust. More disengagement from local partners. More pressure on officers caught between their oath and political demands. More communities are convinced that federal law enforcement is something to fear rather than rely upon.

What we are seeing now is not a tougher or smarter phase of immigration enforcement. It is a failure of focus. The system has shifted away from identifying and neutralizing real criminal threats and toward producing images, metrics and moments that play well on cable news and social media. Enforcement decisions are increasingly shaped by what can be filmed, posted and amplified – not by what actually reduces harm or encourages compliance with our law.

This is enforcement optimized for narrative, not safety.

This is political signaling, not dealing with real risks

This moment is being framed as a correction to past failures at the border. But the problems created by a system under strain are not solved by shifting enforcement inward toward people who pose little or no public safety threat. Border breakdowns reflect failures of capacity, coordination and policy. Redirecting enforcement power away from real risks and toward political signaling does not fix those failures – it creates new ones, increasing danger for officers, communities and the integrity of the system itself.

For years, the administration claimed it needed sweeping enforcement powers to protect Americans from criminal migrants. That narrative justified extreme rhetoric and broad promises. But it was never supported by the facts. There were not enough serious noncitizen criminals to sustain it. What existed then – and still exists now – is a broken immigration system.

Instead of fixing it, today’s strategy relies on quotas and optics to manufacture threat. The result is more dangerous: enforcement untethered from purpose, increased risk on city streets and harm to Americans as well as migrants. A system once strained by volume is now destabilized by design – and that is a far greater public safety risk.

Minnesota should be understood in that context – not as a single failure, but as a warning about what path we are on as a nation. When enforcement is driven by messaging instead of mission, when optics outweigh judgment and when leadership substitutes spectacle for strategy, the risk to officers, civilians and public safety increases exponentially.

This is not inevitable. But reversing it requires leadership willing to reject the performance model and recommit to targeted, disciplined and grounded enforcement. It requires acknowledging that immigration enforcement cannot substitute for a functioning immigration system – and that no amount of theater can compensate for the absence of law, accountability and reform.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/10/USAT/88119995007-20260110-t-185135-z-1-lwd-578710012026-rp-1-rtrwnev-d-5787-usatrumpminneapolisiceconfrontationmp-400-00-39-17-still-001.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 08:57:30.602189

Under ECOA and Regulation B, creditors may consider relevant factors linked to creditworthiness and to the protection of creditor rights and remedies, which can include a borrower’s immigration or citizenship status.

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said: “This administration is restoring alignment with established federal civil rights law rather than continuing the prior administration’s ideologically-driven departures.”

The agencies said they believe withdrawal is appropriate to avoid any confusion that lenders may legitimately consider immigration status under several circumstances, including when necessary to avoid financial risks and to comply with other laws.

In a statement on the withdrawal, the agencies said they believe withdrawal is “appropriate to avoid any unnecessary burdens” from new or increased compliance efforts.

Russell Vought, the acting director at the CFPB, said: “For decades, ECOA regulations have permitted lenders to consider a borrower’s lawful residence status and other information necessary to protect their rights and remedies with respect to repayment.

President Trump said yesterday that he is imposing a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran. This is the president's latest move to turn up the pressure on the country as it deals with growing unrest. Trump says he continues to receive hourly reports of violence against protesters. According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, over 600 Iranians have died in the violence. Trump previously warned that the U.S. was ""locked and loaded"" and would rescue the protesters if the killings continued.

🎧 Trump isn't known for human rights initiatives, NPR's Franco Ordoñez tells Up First. During Trump's first administration, he ordered military strikes on Syrian targets in response to chemical attacks by the Assad regime. However, the president really wants a deal that permanently prevents Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Matthew Kroenig, who worked on the Iranian file at the Pentagon, says the Iranian supreme leader may agree to a zero enrichment deal if he thinks it helps the regime to survive.

Minnesota officials are suing the Trump administration in an attempt to end its immigration crackdown across the state. The lawsuit comes less than a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good, who was in her car. Protests across the U.S. have grown over the past week. NPR station photographers and freelance photographer Evan Frost documented the action on the ground.

🎧 State officials are accusing federal agents of arresting peaceful bystanders, detaining U.S. citizens and firing irritants at protesters. The lawsuit also claims agents have racially profiled people — an allegation the administration denies. Joel Keleekai, a permanent U.S. resident, tells NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán that he had to show agents proof that he was a resident while charging his electric vehicle in a parking lot. Martínez-Beltrán says it is unclear why agents decided to question Keleekai and others in that lot. They are all people of color and showed documentation that they are in the U.S. legally.

The Supreme Court hears arguments today in two cases that test laws banning transgender girls and women from participating in women's sports at publicly funded schools. To date, 27 states have enacted laws barring transgender athletes from participating in sports.

🎧 Transgender issues now play a large role in public debate, likely fueled by Trump's rhetoric around the topic in his 2024 presidential campaign, NPR's Nina Totenberg says. Supporters of the bans say the laws ensure fair competition by preventing those assigned male at birth from gaining an advantage in women's sports. Opponents of the laws say they discriminate based on sex, violating federal statutes and the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

The massive deployment of federal officers to both cities has roiled the Midwest in recent weeks, following a series of high-profile and violent incidents involving immigration agents. The lawsuits come just days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis.

“This has to stop,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference Monday announcing the state’s lawsuit. “We allege that the obvious targeting of Minnesota for our diversity, for our democracy and our differences of opinion with the federal government is a violation of the Constitution and of federal law.”

“This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities,” Ellison continued, arguing that DHS’ presence in Minnesota has “done our state serious harm.”

Illinois also announced Monday evening that it had filed a similar lawsuit, along with the city of Chicago, against the Trump administration and DHS for its “organized bombardment” that has created “a climate of fear” for residents of the Windy City.

In the more than 100-page lawsuit, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul said the administration’s deployment of federal law enforcement to the state “is intended to coerce Plaintiffs to abandon their policies, which value and respect the State’s immigrants, and devote their resources to further the immigration policies of the current administration. Illinois and Chicago have refused to do so.”

Since the start of what the administration has dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” last fall, federal immigration officials in the state have arrested more than 3,000 individuals, many lacking a criminal record.

“Border Patrol’s incursion into Illinois and its unlawful, unauthorized, violent, and arbitrary conduct is intended to intimidate and frighten Plaintiffs’ residents by disregarding their privacy, ignoring the security of their homes and property, and threatening their freedom and physical well-being,” the lawsuit stated.

Both Illinois’ and Minnesota’s lawsuits claim that the federal deployments violated state sovereignty under the Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

DHS has reportedly dispatched 2,000 federal agents to Minnesota, one of the largest mobilizations in DHS history.

The state has attracted scrutiny from the Trump administration following a welfare fraud scandal in which more than 50 individuals, many of them Somali nationals, are accused of stealing $1 billion in taxpayer funds distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic for social programs.

President Donald Trump has latched onto the scandal, calling Somalis “garbage” and increasing attacks against the state’s lone Somali lawmaker, Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Minnesota officials, however, said the deployment of federal officers, called “Operation Metro Surge” by the administration, has done nothing to stop similar cases of fraud and instead inflamed tensions and created fear.

“We work with the federal government all the time, and if the federal government wants to help us with forensic accountants, we’re open to that conversation, but these ICE agents, who are engaging in the behavior they are engaged in, are not helping public safety at all,” Ellison said in response to the fraud allegations.

The attorney general said since DHS began its presence in the state, local law enforcement has responded to at least 20 reports detailing controversial and potentially illegal tactics, including the use of unmarked vehicles and masked agents apprehending people off the street.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Monday’s lawsuit is necessary considering the extreme tactics being utilized by DHS.

“The scale is widely disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe,” Frey said at the press conference.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/5cf04b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1969+0+182/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2F87%2F8423e82942d683a1829187d688ea%2Fap25240137541120.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:13:00.456535

The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration over Operation Metro Surge, calling the expanded immigration crackdown a “federal invasion.”

It comes after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed while driving her SUV toward an ICE officer working enforcement in Minnesota. Her death has prompted protests, vigils, and demonstrations across the country condemning the Trump administration’s immigration tactics.

While defending the lawsuit, Frey questioned why Minnesota was targeted, saying, “If the goal was immigration enforcement, if the goal was to look for people who are undocumented, there are countless other people who are undocumented in Florida and in Texas and Utah.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded on X, saying it has a presence in every state but does not need to surge resources to Florida, Texas, or Utah. ICE said those states work with federal authorities to detain and deport what it described as criminal illegal aliens, unlike Minnesota.

Under the federal 287(g) program, multiple Utah county sheriff’s offices partner with ICE, including Beaver, Kane, Sanpete, Tooele, Utah, Washington, and Weber counties. The Utah Department of Corrections also participates, along with Riverton Police.

The program allows trained local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions in cooperation with ICE, a point federal officials have cited when responding to questions about where enforcement resources are deployed.

Frey’s mention of Utah comes as new data shows the state has become a major destination for migrants. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Associated Press in October 2025, Salt Lake City ranked third in the nation per capita for migrant arrivals during a recent 20-month period.

Between May 2023 and January 2025, nearly 2.5 million people who crossed the border and were released with humanitarian protections or notices to appear in immigration court reported where they planned to live. Salt Lake City recorded about 1,685 arrivals per 100,000 residents, trailing only Miami and Fort Myers, Florida, and edging out Denver and New York.

The data reflects intended destinations rather than permanent settlement but highlights a shift in migration patterns, with cities like Salt Lake City absorbing more newcomers as traditional gateways see slower growth.

Last year, Governor Cox said it was possible the Utah National Guard could assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by providing federally funded administrative and clerical support, not arrests, freeing up ICE agents for field work, with troops handling tasks like processing paperwork and transporting individuals.

Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.
Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans.
Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester.
Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.","In late December, The Washington Post reported that Merrimack is one of 23 sites across the United States where the Trump administration plans to build a new ICE detention facility as part of its aggressive deportation campaign, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security. The local response over the ensuing weeks has been intense.

“I’m almost 70 years old,” Mike Tranchemontagne, of nearby Nashua, said. “I never thought I’d be living in a police state, and that’s what we’re turning into.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, is seeking contractors to help convert industrial warehouses into a network of detention centers across the country to hold immigrants the federal government wants to deport, the Post reported. Under the plan, seven new facilities would hold 5,000 to 10,000 people each and 16 new smaller feeder facilities would hold up to 1,500 people each. Detainees would be booked and held at the smaller facilities for a few weeks before being transferred to one of the large facilities. The administration plans to put one of the smaller facilities in Merrimack, according to the newspaper’s reporting.

Gov. Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.

“This whole discussion about it, to me, is, at this point, a speculative discussion,” Ayotte said. “I would expect, if this were a real plan, which I don’t know yet because it’s been media speculation at this point, that there would be a process in which members of the local community would have an opportunity to weigh in, as, I would think, at some point the state would be consulted. But none of that’s happened yet.”

Ayotte also questioned who would staff a Merrimack facility given the fact there is already an ongoing staffing shortage in New Hampshire state prisons.

Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans. While the demonstration began as a reaction to the news of a potential detention center in Merrimack, it grew to become a protest about ICE action across the country and the Trump administration’s actions writ large. The protest came one day after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, and many protesters held signs referencing the shooting or wore stickers bearing Good’s name.

“I love my country and I disagree with just about everything that’s happened in the last year,” Tranchemontagne said. “Just total lack of concern about law and order, the Constitution, due process, on and on and on. I mean, it’s unfathomable.”

State Rep. Wendy Thomas, a Merrimack Democrat, believes such a facility would be both a moral and practical issue.

“ICE is a lawless, thug-ridden agency that is not following procedure,” Thomas told the Bulletin. “They’re not following laws. They’re terrorizing people around the United States. We don’t need people like that in our town. They violate human rights on a regular basis.”

Thomas argued “building this facility would make Merrimack complicit in those abuses.”

However, she also pointed to planning and zoning concerns.

“Even if you set aside the moral crisis, and we shouldn’t, this proposal is still a terrible deal for our town,” she said. “Detention centers are often exempt from local property taxes or generate far less revenue than traditional commercial development. That means lost property-tax income for Merrimack, while the costs fall squarely on our residents, our fire department, police and emergency medical services would be expected to respond to a high-risk facility.”

She also worries about the traffic a facility could add to the Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack’s main artery.

Max Goddard grew up in Merrimack. He worries the former Anheuser-Busch plant — which the multinational beer company announced would close sometime in early 2026 — would be the chosen site for a detention center. (The Trump administration has not publicly specified where any detention center might be located or publicly confirmed or denied the Post’s reporting.)

“I took prom pictures at the Anheuser-Busch plant,” Goddard said during the protest, “which might be the site of this future concentration camp. And I think it would be a tragedy to take what is formerly an icon of this town, and a thing that everyone goes to, and to turn it into something so sickeningly horrible.”

Merrimack Town Hall closed early Thursday in anticipation that more people would show up than it could handle, and Merrimack Police Department officers and Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies were on scene. Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester. Other towns identified in the Post’s reporting, such as Roxbury, New Jersey, and Jefferson, Georgia, also saw resistance and demonstrations.

Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.

Top Republicans marked the start of the new legislative session with the announcement during an early morning news conference, brandishing bright red posters with “We support ICE” printed on them in capital letters and bracketing Pinal County Attorney Brad Miller — who came up with the proposal — as he praised federal immigration officials and criticized “agitators.”

Miller has sought to build a reputation as a border hawk and Trump loyalist, entering his office into a federal partnership with ICE last year without permission from the county’s board of supervisors, volunteering to prosecute a Phoenix Democratic senator who shared alerts about ICE activity on her social media, and most recently speaking out in defense of the agent who shot Good in the face and called her a “f*cking b*tch” immediately after he killed her.

But just as the news conference was about to begin, a crowd of outraged protestors descended on Miller and the handful of GOP lawmakers preparing to give remarks about the new legislation just outside of the state Senate. One man played a tuba, another played a trombone and still another shook a plastic container filled with coins in accompaniment. Protestors waved signs reading “ICE OUT OF AZ” and “say her name: Renee Good,” while chanting “ICE kills moms!” and “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here!”

The shouting drowned out Miller as he attempted to speak to reporters, prompting the news conference to come to an abrupt halt. The group eventually retreated to a Senate hearing room, followed closely by protestors, who continued chanting and held their signs up against the glass doors of the chamber’s lobby.

Inside the Senate building, Miller touted his proposal as a solution for what supporters of federal immigration officials claim is an increasingly hostile working environment.

“ICE face escalating dangers from doing their jobs,” he said. “Assaults on federal officers have skyrocketed.”

The Trump administration has routinely inflated assault statistics and failed to provide any evidence. An investigation by the Los Angeles Times into thousands of pages of court records found the claims from the federal government to be misleading, with the majority of alleged attacks against ICE agents resulting in no injuries.

Miller pointed to the December raid of Taco Giro restaurants in Tucson as proof that protests have gotten out of control and endangered federal agents. At least two agents were hurt by activists, he claimed, suffering a bicep rupture and an injured knee. That same raid prompted criticism after U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was pepper-sprayed by federal agents and nearly struck with a pepper-ball. A Tucson Sentinel reporter who was also pepper sprayed wrote that he witnessed at least one federal agent trip and fall down.

The proposal, which has yet to be introduced as legislation, would expand the legal definition of obstructing governmental operations to include threatening or intimidating a law enforcement officer while making an arrest. Currently, a person obstructs governmental operations when they knowingly hinder the activity of a public servant acting under their official role or impede the enforcement of a law being implemented by a police officer. Doing either could result in a class 1 misdemeanor, which carries with it thousands of dollars in fines and up to six months in jail.

Miller said the change in state law wouldn’t infringe on the First Amendment right to protest, but instead act as a buffer for law enforcement officials attempting to take people into custody — including ICE agents, whose arrest methods have recently faced rising public disapproval.

“This bill draws a constitutional line,” Miller said. “Observe, record, question but do not physically obstruct (or) threaten in ways to heighten danger or interfere with a lawful arrest.”

Senate President Warren Petersen lauded the proposal, saying he would work to support it. The Republican from Gilbert has spent his political career pushing for stricter immigration legislation, and with the 2026 midterms on the horizon that’s likely to be the case again, especially as he works to convince voters to make him the state attorney general.

Petersen, who is running for attorney general in this year’s election, obliquely mentioned the shooting of Good in Minneapolis by framing the legislation as a way to prevent similar incidents in the future.

“We’ve seen some tragedies recently — tragedies that could be avoided if people would simply just follow the law,” he said.

“ICE are sworn law enforcement officers and you shall not resist. Follow the law — comply, don’t die,” echoed Rep. John Gillette, R-Kingman, who said he would be sponsoring the bill.

Gillette is a former sheriff’s deputy in Illinois who resigned after amassing 42 complaints in his 13-year career, a number of which were for using excessive force. He was also the subject of multiple lawsuits stemming from his treatment of suspects and victims.

Last year, he made national news when he said that a Democratic congresswoman from Washington state should be executed for encouraging protests against Trump. That happened a few weeks after he called American Muslims “f*cking savages” who should be deported to the “sh*t hole” places they came from.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brad-miller-ice-protest-presser-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 08:57:42.988849

Ron DeSantis and the Republican-dominated state House and Senate.

Here are some of the bills to keep an eye on.

SB 1380/HB 1307

Sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Martin and Rep. Berny Jacques, these bills represent the largest immigration package filed so far for this session.

The provisions include:

Fines for employers who ignore their workers’ documentation status.

Criminal charges for hiring more than 50 undocumented immigrants.

Rebuttable presumption that undocumented out-of-state drivers are at-fault in car accidents.

Denying undocumented immigrants bank loans.

Requires law enforcement investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.

Bans translators or interpreters in licensing procedures.

Creates penalties for failing to use E-Verify ahead of submitting worker compensation claims.

SB 1542

Very similar to Martin’s and Jacques’ legislation, this bill was filed Friday by Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent. His bill would create fines for employers who fail to use E-Verify at all — not just those who don’t do so in filing workers’ compensation claims.

It would also require law enforcement to use E-Verify to investigate a detained person’s immigration status, and bans businesses that have violated the bill from ever receiving any public contract in the future with any public agency in this state.

SB 1052

Filed by Sen. Erin Grall, this bill instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”

It would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.”

HB 197/SB 1278

Proposed by Rep. Berny Jacques and Sen. Jonathan Martin, these bills require every business to use E-Verify, a federal database verifying a worker’s immigration status.

This expands a 2023 law that mandated E-Verify for public employers and businesses with at least 25 employees. Now, all businesses regardless of private/public status or number of employees must use the database, the bill says.

HB 991

Sponsored by Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Rep. Dana Trabulsy, this bill would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship.

The measure also:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Mandates that the Florida Department of State review existing voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters.

Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.

Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), and jury coordinators.

Creates a new post-election audit process.

Makes changes to the recount process.

Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals

HB 985

Filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, this bill is very similar to Persons-Mulicka’s bill.

The measure:

Requires election supervisors to verify citizenship status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements or “SAVE” program administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Mandates election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” to refer the application to the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security.

Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”

Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.

Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.

Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.

Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.

Florida IDs and driver licenses issued to non-citizens must be marked “NC” on the front.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5753-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 06:58:19.374966

The challenges align with parts of Trump's agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants' privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit's intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

""This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,"" Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees' association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of ""a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process"" if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump's agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump's agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president's social media post.

That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution's 14th Amendment says ""the whole number of persons in each state"" should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau's defense in both cases, despite the intervenors' concerns.

No end in sight for immigration enforcement The states say more harm to their residents is sure to come as there is no end in sight for immigration enforcement.","Minnesota and Illinois separately filed lawsuits Monday against the Trump administration, arguing the president’s immigration crackdown is terrorizing their communities and violating the Constitution.

“We have watched in horror as unchecked federal agents have aggressively assaulted and terrorized our communities and neighborhoods in Illinois, undermining Constitutional rights and threatening public safety,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

Chicago, as well as Minneapolis and Saint Paul, were also part of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

The federal government has stepped up operations in Chicago and the Twin Cities, both Democratic strongholds, during the fall and local officials have criticized them for sowing chaos and confusion. An ICE-involved shooting last week in Minneapolis left a mother of three dead and kickstarted a series of nationwide protests.

Both Minnesota and Illinois are asking for an injunction to halt the immigration operations in their states.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said that the state’s lawsuit aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.

“Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN’s Laura Coates Monday night. “They’re doing far more than that … by harassing people, by using excessive force on a routine basis.”

The suits were filed against the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as reporting agencies, including ICE, US Customs and Border Protection and US Border Patrol.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Constitution was on the administration’s side. The surge of federal officers, she said in a statement Monday in response to the lawsuits, was needed because “sanctuary politicians” in Illinois and Minnesota were not protecting their citizens.

Here are the key claims from both lawsuits:

Suits claim unprecedented immigration operations violated 10th Amendment

Both lawsuits invoke the 10th Amendment to defend their states’ rights, alleging the Trump administration has commandeered local resources for its crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and Illinois.

The “unlawful and violent tactics, have disrupted the lives and undermined the liberties and property rights of the people,” and have prevented Illinois and Chicago from enacting the policy their citizens want, their lawsuit said.

Minnesota’s suit specifically emphasized strains on local police resources. The complaint asserts that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

The deployment of “armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents” is a federal invasion, Ellison said Monday.

CNN reported early last week about 2,000 federal agents were being deployed to Minneapolis. That number, Minnesota’s lawsuit said, “greatly exceeds the number of sworn police officers that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have, combined.”

Minneapolis police officers have worked thousands of combined overtime hours as a direct result of federal agents’ presence, the suit said, costing the city over $2 million in overtime pay.

Political retaliation by Trump motivated immigration crackdown, states say

Minnesota’s lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge, the immigration crackdown effort in the Twin Cities, is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but the result of a desire to “retaliate” against the Democratic-led state.

The complaint details disparaging statements about the state that President Donald Trump has made, saying it shows a clear intention to punish political opponents and jurisdictions with sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the federal government during immigration efforts.

Illinois’s lawsuit made a similar claim, saying Trump and his administration “have long directed threatening and derogatory statements towards jurisdictions that do not invest in enforcing federal immigration law.”

“President Trump’s job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,” McLaughlin said Monday in response to the lawsuits.

Both states said they have had funds, such as those for social services programs, withheld because the administration says they haven’t complied with immigration policies.

“Defendants have repeatedly made statements that reflect their true intent—to punish Minnesota’s elected officials and residents for their perceived political leanings, to target so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, to create false political narratives of lawlessness in Minnesota, and to incite flashpoints between Minnesota residents and immigration agents,” the Minnesota lawsuit says.

Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon previously told CNN the funding was revoked because “Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch” and they were ensuring “these states are following the law.”

Federal agents ‘unlawfully terrorized’ communities, Minnesota suit says

Both lawsuits allege tactics used by federal agents during their operations are detrimental to the community and terrorizing everyone who lives there.

Illinois and Chicago said in their lawsuit DHS had “cast aside longstanding policies” which they argued was not only illegal but “arbitrary and capricious.”

The lawsuit is asking the court to stop the agencies from using tactics like “roving patrol, biometric scanning, warrantless arrest,” among other methods. The suit also alleges agents regularly trespassed on private property and used riot weapons, like tear gas, on people who weren’t resisting.

The tactics have left residents fearing for their safety as “uniformed, military-trained personnel, carrying semi-automatic firearms and military-grade weaponry, armed with semi-automatic rifles” roam the city, they said.

The complaint from Minnesota says DHS agents would “unlawfully terrorize” communities in the Twin Cities with continued aggression just hours after Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE agent.

“DHS agents were met with unsurprising protests after the fatal shooting two hours earlier but used pepper spray and rammed vehicles when leaving,” it says.

Minnesota’s suit also asserts that federal agents have engaged in widespread racial profiling, particularly against Somali and Hispanic communities, as they conduct immigration operations in the Twin Cities.

“On December 10, 2025, two masked DHS agents tackled and arrested Mubashir, a Somali American man … despite Mubashir repeatedly asking that he be allowed to show them his legal identification,” the complaint says. “DHS agents then detained Mubashir for two hours for no apparent reason other than his perceived national origin.”

The complaint offered several other incidents of citizens being detained or questioned – including young workers at Target, Minneapolis Public Works employees or people on their way to work – it says, because of their perceived ethnicity.

The states have experienced immigration enforcement for decades – but this is different

Illinois and Minnesota have long complied with immigration enforcement under different administrations, they said in their respective lawsuits. But the tactics and intensity now make these specific operations more like a war zone, they said.

“For decades, federal immigration agents enforced immigration laws in the Chicago area by targeting and arresting individuals subject to removal without significant impact on public order and safety in Illinois or Chicago,” the Illinois lawsuit said. But now, the way agents conduct themselves is acting more like “occupiers rather than officers of the law.”

“This has left many Illinois and Chicago residents, regardless of immigration status, frightened to avail themselves of public services, or even venture outside to engage in normal daily activity,” the suit said.

Aside from the unprecedented size and force of the operation, Minnesota and Illinois’ lawsuits allege DHS has also abandoned its longstanding practice of avoiding conducting immigration operations in “sensitive” public places.

The policy, the complaints claim, was revoked to make way for the operations.

“Thousands of armed and masked DHS agents have stormed the Twin Cities to conduct militarized raids and carry out dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional stops and arrests in sensitive public places, including schools and hospitals—all under the guise of lawful immigration enforcement,” Minnesota’s complaint says.

No end in sight for immigration enforcement

The states say more harm to their residents is sure to come as there is no end in sight for immigration enforcement.

Illinois has had an increased federal law enforcement presence since September, and officials have repeatedly said they aren’t planning on leaving.

“If you think we’re done with Chicago, you’d better check yourself before you wreck yourself. Don’t call it a comeback; we’re going to be here for years,” CBP Commander Gregory Bovino said last month.

Minnesota’s complaint also says the federal government appears poised to continue operations in the state, despite weeks of escalation and public outcry.

In a social media post last week cited in Minnesota’s suit, DHS wrote: “We’re not leaving until the problem is solved.”

As CNN has reported, around 1,000 additional Border Patrol agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis, according to two federal law enforcement sources, in addition to the previous deployment of federal agents.
