A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina.
Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.
“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement.
She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola.","The federal immigration enforcement agency was in West Maui reportedly searching for a non-resident.

Members of Maui’s large immigrant population were on edge this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen knocking on doors in Lahaina, including at the largest temporary housing development for survivors of the deadly 2023 wildfires.

ICE officers approached residents on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, according to nonprofit leaders, government officials and others in the community.

Kevin Block, a longtime immigration lawyer based in Wailuku, said several of his clients who had been impacted by the fire were now afraid to leave their houses. Others were debating whether to send their children to school because for fear ICE agents might pull them from class to ask about family members’ immigration status.

A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina. It grouped them with areas including churches, courthouses and hospitals that should be protected from some enforcement actions.

That directive was repealed shortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, and ICE officials were instead instructed to make “case-by-case determinations regarding whether, where and when to conduct an immigration enforcement action in or near a protected area.”

ICE officers were seen knocking on doors this week in the neighborhood near Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena Elementary School and at the state’s interim housing community for fire survivors, Ka La‘i Ola, in addition to other locations in west and central Maui, Block and Lahaina residents said.

Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.

“They came to look for a non-resident who may have been visiting a resident,” he said. “They presented a judicial warrant.”

Ka La‘i Ola maintains a policy of not releasing information about its residents to anyone unless there is a signed and verified judicial warrant or higher documentation presented, he said.

ICE notified the Maui Police Department that they were present on the island, according to a statement Tuesday from Gregg Okamoto, assistant chief of the department’s support services division.

“But we are not given details and are not involved with their operations,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, including ICE, does not “comment on pending or ongoing enforcement operations,” according to a statement issued by the agency. For operational security reasons, it also “does not disclose the locations or activities of its personnel.”

Consisting of 450 modular homes spaced out across 57 acres of state-owned land overlooking downtown Lahaina, Ka La‘i Ola was built for residents displaced by the Lahaina fire who don’t meet income or background qualifications for Federal Emergency Management Agency housing. It is home to nearly 900 people and has the capacity to house up to 600 more, according to its website.

Gov. Josh Green and Maui Mayor Richard Bissen joined community leaders and families Wednesday morning to mark the project’s completion. The site is expected to be handed over to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by 2029 for Native Hawaiian beneficiaries.

Community advocates informed county officials earlier this week that locals were concerned about ICE activity at Ka La‘i Ola, according to a statement provided Wednesday evening by Maui County spokeswoman Laksmi Abraham.

“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement. “Our community has faced extraordinary challenges, and these recovery sites are meant to serve as havens of stability and healing for all who need them.”

More than 2,200 structures were destroyed by the Lahaina wildfire, and approximately 12,000 people were displaced. As of Wednesday, roughly 60 homes had been rebuilt, according to the county’s recovery website.

‘Still Terrified’

Some residents are only recently returning to live in Lahaina after bouncing among emergency shelters and other accommodations during the past two years.

“They literally just moved in and are starting to feel safe and not traumatized anymore,” Block said. “And now ICE is driving around in the neighborhood and knocking on people’s doors. Even if they’re not looking for my clients, they’re still terrified.”

Some immigrants in the community have been missing work or avoiding returning to their homes because they were worried that ICE might be able to track them down, said Veronica Mendoza, the co-founder and executive director of the local immigrant advocacy group Roots Reborn.

She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola. She expressed gratitude for the housing, but said members of the immigrant community do not feel safe there right now.

Block, the immigration attorney, said the Department of Homeland Security’s shift in stance to allow enforcement actions near disaster-relief areas damages the community’s well-being.

“Because if people who need help aren’t going to the hospital, and if people who need to go to school aren’t going to school, people who want to participate in their spiritual life aren’t going to church because those places are no longer safe,” he said, “then all of us are losing our freedom and our rights.”

At least one Lahaina wildfire was previously taken into custody by ICE, according to a Honolulu Star-Advertiser story, and a GoFundMe fundraiser was set up to support his family. Sergio Haro lived with his family in Lahaina, and he owned a local janitorial service, the newspaper reported.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2025/09/24171854/IMG_1925-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 06:57:44.107411

Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, emphasized the urgent need for international oversight amid growing concerns over the treatment of immigrants and their families.

Background of Immigration Sweeps

Recent immigration enforcement operations have targeted multiple communities across the country, prompting the detention and deportation of several individuals. Advocates argue that these sweeps often disproportionately affect marginalized communities, raising questions about due process, family separation, and access to legal resources. Huerta’s request to the UN highlights these ongoing debates and seeks a global perspective on domestic enforcement practices.

Huerta’s Statement

In a public statement, Huerta condemned the actions of immigration authorities, calling the operations “unjust and harmful to vulnerable communities.” She urged international authorities to review the policies and practices employed during these sweeps, emphasizing that accountability and transparency are essential to uphold human rights standards.

Key Points Table

Response from Authorities

U.S. immigration officials have not formally responded to Huerta’s request but have previously defended enforcement operations as legal and necessary for public safety. The contrasting views highlight the tension between human rights advocates and law enforcement authorities, and the debate may gain international attention if the UN decides to investigate.

Public and Community Reactions

The call for a UN investigation has sparked discussions among advocacy groups, legal experts, and community members. Many support Huerta’s stance, arguing that independent oversight is crucial to ensure immigrant protections. Others believe domestic legal and policy mechanisms are sufficient to address concerns. Social media reactions reflect both strong support for immigrant rights and debates about the appropriate role of international organizations in U.S. affairs.

Dolores Huerta’s appeal to the United Nations underscores the growing concern over the treatment of immigrants during enforcement operations.

One of the people said the gunman was 29. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the gunman had opened fire from a nearby rooftop, describing him as a “sniper” who shot “indiscriminately,” hitting three detainees who were inside a transport van.

The identities of the victims have not been released, but one of the injured is a Mexican national, according to Mexico’s foreign ministry. Homeland Security officials previously said in the statement that two detainees had been killed and one wounded, but corrected the tolls in a later statement.

Officials suggested that it was a targeted attack. Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, posted an image of the ammunition on social media, saying that an initial review of the evidence indicated an ideological motive.

The New York Times has not independently verified Mr. Patel’s description of the gunman or his motives.

The shooting comes two weeks after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a political activist whose death prompted President Trump to threaten to silence what he described as left-wing extremists.

Mr. Trump struck a similar tone after Wednesday’s shooting, vowing on social media to crack down on “Deranged Radical Leftists.” He wrote that he would sign an executive order to “dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks” and called on Democrats to “STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE.”

Here’s what else to know:

The suspect: Mr. Jahn left a long record of himself online but apparently little indication that he was politically active. On social media, he talked extensively about video games, cars and marijuana. Records show that he voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas and was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where he voted in 2024. Read more ›

Witness accounts: Two people who were waiting outside the facility for relatives who were going through immigration proceedings described the frantic moments of the shooting, hearing gunfire and taking cover until officers escorted them inside. “It was one shot after another after another after another,” one witness said.

Previous violence: The shooting was the second at a federal immigration facility in Texas in recent months. A police officer was shot in July outside an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas. Read more ›

On the other side of a tense national immigration debate, some Democratic members of Congress in Texas and leaders with several of the top national immigrant and civil rights organizations did not disagree: the harmful rhetoric needs to stop — against law enforcement officers, and against immigrants.

The F.B.I. said the gunman in Dallas died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and left behind ammunition that bore the phrase “ANTI-ICE” in blue writing. But The New York Times has not independently verified federal officials’ assertion that the shooter was targeting ICE.

In some social media feeds and activist circles, agents have been called “Nazis” and “fascists” while elsewhere, prominent critics have used pointed, if less inflammatory language. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California this week said that masked agents grabbing immigrants off the streets were “authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government.”

Opponents of the administration’s crackdown have said that the belligerent, incendiary tone had been set at the top by President Trump, who has referred to undocumented immigrants as “monsters” and pledged to wage war on American cities that did not bend to his administration’s hard-line immigration agenda.

“My concern is that this anti-immigrant rhetoric has led us to this point,” said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy organization.

Along with the man killed, two other immigrant detainees were wounded in the shooting. No law enforcement officers were hit by the gunfire.

Battles over immigrant rights have been escalating on the streets and in the courts for months. Trump administration officials have sought to characterize many actions of immigrant rights lawyers and activists — including protests and know-your-rights presentations — as enabling illegal immigration and threatening to national security.

Law enforcement officers and federal immigration agents have faced off with activists and concerned residents who have sought to film their actions. In some of the most heated outbursts, some have yelled or cursed at agents and sought to physically block them from apprehending immigrants.

On Wednesday, Democrats and immigrant rights leaders who have heavily criticized ICE in recent months condemned the violence and urged people to lower the temperature of the immigration debate.

Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from San Antonio, called for Americans to “reject extremism in our politics.”

Others also took sharp, if measured, jabs at the administration. Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat of Dallas, also denounced the shooting but observed that “rhetoric used to dehumanize and demonize immigrants in this country has led to increased hate crime incidents.”

Juan Proaño, chief executive of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, said in an interview that the shooting — and the administration’s response — would make it more difficult to hold ICE accountable. But he added it would not deter his group from continuing to challenge its immigration actions in court.

“Our community is literally under attack — and ICE cannot escape its responsibility to keep people in detention safe,” he said. “We will not be silenced, and we will not stop demanding accountability.”

J. David Goodman contributed reporting.

Federal authorities said that the shooter had opened fire from the roof of a nearby building, firing “indiscriminately,” and hitting several victims. The gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials said.

Vice President JD Vance labeled the shooter as a “violent left-wing extremist” at a speaking event in North Carolina. He said that information not yet made public proved “this person was politically motivated,” without elaborating on what evidence the government had.

The Times, in interviews with authorities and others about the shooting, has not independently verified Mr. Vance’s description of the shooter or a motive; Mr. Jahn, who had an extensive online profile, had voted in a Democratic primary in 2020 in Texas, but showed little obvious interest in politics.

Mr. Vance also engaged in a high-profile clash about the Dallas shooting with Jon Favreau, a prominent progressive podcast host, as well as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who Mr. Vance suggested had helped foster a dangerous environment with anti-ICE rhetoric. President Trump also suggested liberals were to blame for the violence.

The reaction to the shooting is indicative of a now-common playbook in an age of violent attacks, often punctuated by hasty conclusions and righteous anger.

The online skirmish between Mr. Vance and Mr. Favreau began in the hours after the shooting in Dallas, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced shortly after the attack that “our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” adding that a motive for the shooting had not been established.

Mr. Vance reposted Ms. Noem’s message, and included his own comment, saying that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

That post from Mr. Vance drew the ire of Mr. Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and a host of “Pod Save America,” the popular politics podcast.

Mr. Favreau said that “the vice president is not a reliable source of information,” and said that Mr. Vance had previously erred several times by voicing “a political take” only to be contradicted by law enforcement.

In the case of the assassination of Mr. Kirk, messages written on bullets found at the scene of the crime led to a great deal of conjecture after the fact, with numerous assumptions being made about what could be derived about the shooter’s motivation.

On Wednesday, Mr. Vance and others leaned on a post by F.B.I. Director Kash Patel that showed a clip of rifle-caliber ammunition, with one casing having a message on it that read “ANTI-ICE” in what appeared to be blue writing. The actual motivation behind the messages written on the bullets in both Mr. Kirk’s assassination and Wednesday’s killing are still not known, and The Times has not confirmed details shedding light on the ammunition casing in Dallas.

Still, the fight between Mr. Favreau and the vice president — which devolved into Mr. Vance calling the podcaster a profanity — was just one front in a quickly evolving battle between the right and left.

By late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump had also begun to attack Democrats, posting on Truth Social that he was “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!” and decrying “the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country.”

“The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped,” Mr. Trump wrote.

In a statement later released by Homeland Security, Ms. Noem said that the “far-left” needed to moderate its rhetoric. “Comparing ICE Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” she said.

Mr. Vance was even more outspoken, attacking Mr. Newsom in his North Carolina speech, accusing the Democrat of demonizing ICE as “part of an authoritarian government” during an interview on Tuesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“If your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell and you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America,” Mr. Vance said.

Mr. Newsom — who, like Mr. Vance, is considered a possible presidential candidate in 2028 — had said in his interview with Mr. Colbert that “the ICE issue is alarming beyond words,” and expressed concern at federal agents’ tactics, including using masks and unmarked cars.

“These are not just authoritarian tendencies, these are authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government,” Mr. Newsom said, adding, “This can’t be normalized.”

Mr. Newsom also responded on X to Mr. Vance’s remarks on Wednesday, posting: “No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today.”

“Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there,” the governor wrote.

In recent months, demonstrations outside ICE facilities in Los Angeles, Illinois and New York led to confrontations with law enforcement officers and arrests. This month, an ICE officer fatally shot a man in the Chicago area whom immigration agents had tried to pull over. The Department of Homeland Security said that the man was resisting arrest during the stop and that he dragged the officer as he fled in his vehicle.

Department officials have blamed such episodes on “hateful rhetoric,” calling in a statement last week for the “media, leftist groups and sanctuary politicians” to end the “demonization” of immigration enforcement officers.

“We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in the statement. “This violence must end.”

On Wednesday, a detainee was fatally shot when a gunman opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas, injuring two others, investigators said. The authorities suggested that the gunman — who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound — was targeting immigration enforcement agents.

The shooting was the culmination of months of rising tensions over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, as federal officers use increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics to bring in detainees and reach arrest targets.

Anger in some cities has mounted as immigration authorities have conducted large-scale operations across the country, with Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, saying this year the administration would strive to hit 3,000 arrests a day. ICE officers have arrested immigrants at immigration court hearings. Federal agents have swept through parking lots of big-box stores in the Los Angeles region. Videos of homeland security agents and officers breaking windows of cars belonging to targets have proliferated on social media.

Protesters, including faith leaders, community groups and liberal organizations, have held vigils, sit-ins and peaceful rallies at detention centers — though some demonstrations have turned volatile. Federal officials also report a sharp rise in threats against officers.

ICE has alleged a “more than 1,000 percent increase” in assaults against its officers this year, though the agency has not released detailed data of the episodes and it has not specified what it defines as assault. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately provide more specific information on Wednesday.

But the agency has repeatedly highlighted examples of threats it says its officers have received, such as a menacing letter with a white substance sent to a New York field office in August and pictures of injuries it says its officers have sustained while conducting arrests.

It has also sought to impose stiffer penalties. In a social media post, the agency warned last week that anyone who assaults an ICE officer would face federal felony assault charges and “prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.”

“We’re being compared to the Gestapo, to the Nazis, and that’s just not true and it’s dangerous rhetoric that puts us in situations like this,” ICE’s deputy director, Madison Sheahan, said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday.

As the federal government’s deportation campaign has accelerated and federal agents have homed in on liberal cities with policies aimed at protecting undocumented residents, protests have at times turned tense, leading to clashes with law enforcement officers.

In June, a federal building in downtown Los Angeles used by ICE to process immigrants became a central part of the protests that roiled the city, leading to instances of vandalism and the arrests of hundreds of protesters.

Last week, more than a dozen local Democratic officials were arrested at a federal building in Manhattan used by ICE after they blocked the garage doors and tried to get into the holding cells. The officials cast their actions as urgent displays of civil disobedience. ICE denounced them as obstructionist and dangerous, not just for the safety of its agents, but also for detained migrants. The agency also said the building had to go into lockdown after someone called in a bomb threat after the arrests.

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who was among those arrested, said on social media at the time that officials were demanding access to the ICE field office because “NYers refuse to stand by while ICE abducts our neighbors.”

On Wednesday, after the shooting, Mr. Lander said on social media that “surging political violence threatens all of us.”

“Whatever motivated the shooter, this act is heinous, and should be condemned by people regardless of ideology,” he said, adding, “The tradition of non-violence, which we practiced last week, is key to restoring our humanity, and making democratic co-existence possible.”

In May, the mayor of Newark was arrested outside a new detention facility in New Jersey and briefly charged with trespassing, after a protest at the facility that also entangled three members of Congress.

The wearing of masks by ICE officers, which was not the norm before this year, has become a flashpoint among those opposed to President Trump’s deportation campaign, prompting lawmakers in a handful of Democratic-led states to push for legislation banning the use of masks.

On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill that would prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state. The move came after videos had spread online showing masked immigration agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California. Democrats and immigration activists have argued that officers have acted with impunity knowing that their faces were shielded.

Homeland Security Department officials condemned the state law and called it unconstitutional, adding that their officers would not comply with the legislation. Federal officials have defended ICE officers’ use of masks, which they say protects them and their families from harassment or worse. Federal officials have said that officers carry badges and credentials and identify themselves when required.

Pooja Salhotra and Hamed Aleaziz contributed reporting.

“My fear is that the immigrants are the ones being targeted,” Ms. Duarte said as she sat in her car near the site of the shooting.

For weeks, Ms. Duarte has been visiting the site, which is not technically a detention center but an ICE office, for prayer vigils. She said she had heard about deplorable conditions there — dozens of detainees, men and women, crammed into what was described as a conference room, for days at time.

“They have all these people in one room, without beds, without food, without restrooms,” she said. “They have 30, 40, 60 people in one room.”

Jennifer Canadell, 34, was standing near the ICE facility Wednesday afternoon, hoping to hear from her husband, Rony Arroyo, 34, who was detained on Tuesday after an immigration appointment.

“I’m worried,” she said, holding their two-year-old. “I came down when I heard about the shooting.”

The couple, from Venezuela, showed up together for an annual check-in with immigration officials, but only he was detained, Ms. Canadell said.

“Everyone who is in there is in danger,” she said.

Other Latino leaders feared that the partisan rhetoric may only inflame tensions.

“We reject violence in any form, and we call on leaders at every level to act responsibly and stop inflaming tensions,” said Ray Mancera, the league’s vice president for the Southwest region. “Our communities deserve peace, not fear.”

Noemi Rios, co-founder of Vecinos Unidos DFW, United Neighbors, an immigration advocacy program, said that groups like hers have pressed for humane treatment of immigrants and have shunned violence.

“We don’t want to live in a world with so much violence and hatred,” Ms. Rios said. “We don’t wish violence on anyone.”

President Trump condemned “Deranged Radical Leftists” in a social media post about the shooting, linking the attack to the assassination of the political activist Charlie Kirk. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis,’” he wrote.

D.H.S. officials said the suspect was targeting the ICE office from a nearby building. One detainee died in the shooting, and two others were critically wounded, officials said.

Mr. Jahn, who according to records voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas, had an extensive online profile. But he showed little obvious interest in politics based on what has been uncovered so far. He has at least two Reddit accounts, where he talked about video games, cars, “South Park” and marijuana.

He was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where his parents own property in Durant, Okla., north of Dallas, and where he voted once, in the 2024 general election.

Public records indicate that Mr. Jahn had at least a few minor scrapes with the law, including a charge for selling marijuana in 2015. He was released from court supervision for that charge a few years later, and the proceedings were dismissed.

Mr. Jahn was raised with a brother and a sister in a far north suburb of Dallas. His father retired in 2020 after spending 36 years in engineering roles at an elevator and escalator company, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Mr. Jahn lived with his parents in Texas at least as recently as a few months ago, according to public records. Their house is on a cul-de-sac in a rural area north of Dallas and Fort Worth that is rapidly developing as the metropolitan area expands. The house is a short drive from an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, where a shooter killed eight people in 2023.

Before noon on Wednesday, a blue truck drove quickly down the residential street leading to Mr. Jahn’s house. A man and woman got out of the car, quickly went into the house and did not answer the door.

Aric Toler, Stuart Thompson and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

According to a criminal complaint filed in the case, that shooting took place after a group of 10 to 12 people set off fireworks outside the Prairieland Detention Center that night. Not long after, one or two people from the group broke off and began spray-painting graffiti on nearby vehicles and a guard structure, scrawling the words “Ice pig” and “traitor” on a pair of cars, the complaint said.

The officer arrived at the scene around 11 p.m. After he stepped out of his car, the complaint said, two shooters opened fire from a wooded area next to the detention facility, firing numerous rounds and wounding the officer in the neck. He was flown to a hospital, where he was treated and discharged.

Investigators said later that they found spent ammunition where the shooters had been standing, of a type typically used in AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles.

A detective with the Johnson County sheriff’s office pulled over a van that had been seen leaving the scene, and the driver told the authorities about having transported several people to the detention center to “make some noise,” according to charging documents. The authorities reported finding a handgun, two AR-15-style rifles, two Kevlar ballistic-style vests and a ballistic helmet in the van.

Prosecutors have charged more than a dozen people in connection with the shooting in Alvarado, and have said that the fireworks, vandalism and shooting were part of a coordinated plan to ambush local and federal law enforcement officers. An organization that represents relatives and friends of people who were arrested over the episode disputes that characterization, saying that many of the people who were present that night believed they were attending a nonviolent protest.

A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 30.

In a separate incident three days after the Alvarado shooting, a gunman opened fire at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station in McAllen, injuring a Border Patrol employee and two officers. The gunman was fatally shot by law enforcement officers.

There have been numerous protests and demonstrations at federal facilities across the country over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Some protests, including ones in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, have involved vandalism and scuffles with law enforcement officers, who have sometimes deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades against demonstrators.

In contrast with the July attack in Alvarado, the shooting victims in Dallas on Wednesday were detainees, hit by indiscriminate fire, the authorities said. No law enforcement officers were shot, they added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/24/multimedia/24ice-shooting-promo-830pm-cphm/24ice-shooting-promo-830pm-cphm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 03:56:50.123384

The Busan District Court said the head of the Gimhae Airport Immigration Office must cancel the decision not to process the man’s application for refugee status.

The plaintiff, who is in his 30s, reportedly applied for refugee status after arriving at Gimhae Airport in Busan on April 27. The Justice Ministry, however, decided not to refer his case for examination.

In response, the man refused to return to his home country and has since remained in a temporary holding area in the airport for those denied entry.

The man claimed refugee status, saying he fled political persecution in Guinea after participating in protests against the military dictatorship.

But the ministry did not move ahead with the refugee screening process as it found the plaintiff’s statements lacked credibility.

The man filed a lawsuit against the airport’s immigration office with assistance from local human rights organizations.

“Although we won in the first trial, we need to wait and see whether the Justice Ministry will file an appeal,” the plaintiff’s legal representative was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency.

Local human rights groups have also raised concerns about the man’s treatment at the airport, claiming a clear human rights violation.

According to the organizations, including the Joint Committee for Migrant Rights and Human Rights, the plaintiff received a burger for every meal. They say the Refugee Act states that basic food, clothing and shelter shall be provided to applicants in the airport’s holding area.

The human rights group also raised the concern that the plaintiff is expected to remain in the airport's holding area until the final ruling is made in a higher court.

Refugee applicants at Incheon Airport whose cases are not referred are reportedly transferred to a waiting facility outside the airport if they appeal and win their cases in the first trial. Gimhae Airport has no such designated facility.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”.
The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.
Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”.
While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","A gunman fired at a Dallas immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Here’s what we know about the attack so far:

One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.

The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.

Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.

The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.

Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”

The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d62192946c0cbd53a0731275f5decef220f32a/311_0_2084_1667/master/2084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893c2eef7d36ea5dc789662a1305b49d",N,,2025-09-25 03:57:11.239407

Judges are weighing ecological effects, zoning laws, and the U.S. Constitution to shape whether President Donald Trump’s administration can deliver on his promise of mass deportations.

Here’s a look at some prominent cases:

CoreCivic v. New Jersey

In 2021, New Jersey passed a law that prevents state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention. CoreCivic, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

CoreCivic argued that New Jersey’s law shouldn’t apply to it because the company is effectively serving as an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Constitution blocks state laws from regulating the federal government or its agencies.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch decided partly in favor of CoreCivic. Although New Jersey could prevent state and local entities from entering into contracts with ICE, he ruled, it could not prevent CoreCivic or another private entity from doing so. Calling the law a “dagger aimed at the heart of the federal government’s immigration enforcement mission and operations,” Kirsch reasoned that allowing the full law to stand could encourage neighboring states to pass similar laws. That, he wrote, “would result in nothing short of chaos.”

A federal appeals court upheld Kirsch’s decision in July.

Newark v. GEO

In late February, GEO announced ICE had awarded it a 15-year contract, worth roughly $1 billion, to reopen Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility in Newark, New Jersey. Delaney opened May 1 after months of what city officials called “irresponsible construction practices.”

In an April complaint, the city alleged Delaney Hall put detained people and staff in danger because GEO wouldn’t allow city inspectors to review the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. Newark also alleged that GEO failed to file for a certificate of continued occupancy — a form required whenever there is a change in tenant or ownership of a property. The city asked for a court order to stop Delaney’s operation while the case proceeds.

GEO called the lawsuit politically motivated and adopted a similar argument to the one CoreCivic made, saying Newark couldn’t use local codes to interfere with the federal government’s business: detaining immigrants.

Newark didn’t get the injunction it sought, so Delaney Hall remains open as the case proceeds.

City of Leavenworth v. CoreCivic

CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas under a new contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 immigrants. The company had used the building from 1992 through 2021, primarily to hold people awaiting trial on federal charges.

The city argues the company must obtain a special use permit to operate the facility as a detention center. When the city passed a 2012 zoning law that would have required such a permit, CoreCivic was exempt because the facility already operated as a prison. But because the facility has now been idle for several years, the city maintains CoreCivic must now apply for the permit.

CoreCivic insists it doesn’t need the permit because it never abandoned the building. As it did in New Jersey, it also argues that local ordinances can’t interfere with the company when it’s doing work for the federal government.

The city’s argument won over a local judge, who issued a temporary order barring the reopening. CoreCivic has asked the judge to reconsider while the battle plays out.

Friends of the Everglades v. Noem

In late May, two environmental advocacy groups sued several federal and Florida agencies over a sprawling new immigration detention center in the Everglades. Commonly called “Alligator Alcatraz” — a term coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — the facility was constructed in a matter of days on an airfield in the heart of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Ltd, based on information that reasonably indicates forced labor use.

Effective immediately, CBP will detain bicycles, bicycle parts, and accessories manufactured in Taiwan by Giant. This WRO, the third issued in 2025 and the fourth in Fiscal Year 2025, was issued due to violations of 19 U.S.C. § 1307, the law prohibiting goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S.

“CBP has a proven track record of cracking down on companies that use forced labor to the detriment of law-abiding U.S. businesses,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney S. Scott.

CBP identified the following International Labour Organization forced labor indicators during its investigation of Giant:

abuse of vulnerability,

abusive working and living conditions,

debt bondage,

withholding of wages, and

excessive overtime.

Giant profited by imposing such abuse, resulting in goods produced below market value and undercutting American businesses by millions of dollars in unjustly earned profits. The International Labour Organization estimates that nearly 28 million workers are under conditions of forced labor worldwide.

“Importers have a responsibility to do their due diligence and know their supply chains,” said Acting Executive Assistant Commissioner of CBP’s Office of Trade Susan S. Thomas. “CBP will continue to investigate allegations of forced labor and take action when we find it in U.S. supply chains.”

The WRO against Giant is the latest action CBP has taken to address forced labor. With this WRO issuance, CBP currently oversees and enforces 53 WROs and nine Findings under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.

When CBP has evidence indicating that imported goods are made by forced labor, the agency issues orders to detain those shipments. Importers of detained shipments may seek to destroy or export their shipments or seek to demonstrate that the merchandise is admissible.

CBP receives allegations of forced labor from a variety of sources including government agencies, media, non-government organizations, and members of the public. Any person or organization that has reason to believe merchandise produced with forced labor is being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States can report detailed allegations by contacting CBP through the e-Allegations Online Trade Violation Reporting System or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT.",,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:28.529309

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.
According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.
In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting.","A gunman armed with a rifle opened fire on a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life, authorities said.

Officials reported that the shooter left behind ammunition marked with the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written in blue. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of targeted violence. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed that the suspect identified was a man named Joshua Jahn.

The shooting comes at a time when ICE has emerged as the sword arm of US President Donald Trump’s attempts to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also legal migrants seen as critical of his administration’s priorities – including for opposing Israel’s war on Gaza.

The attack on the ICE facility also comes two weeks after the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, an event that led Trump to vow action against what he called left-wing extremists.

Here is what you need to know:

What happened and when?

Police said they got a call about a shooting about 6:40am local time (11:40 GMT) on Wednesday, September 24.

Four people were shot. One detainee died, and two others were taken to hospital in critical condition.

The gunman – authorities described him as a “sniper” – died from a self-inflicted gunshot. Officials said he fired indiscriminately at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop. The victims were either inside a van near the entrance to the building or nearby.

Authorities “found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility”, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan said.

No police officers were hurt, according to FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. Still, FBI director Kash Patel described the attack as “politically motivated”.

“These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off,” Patel said in a social media post.

“We are only miles from Prairieland, Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers.” On July 4, ICE said nearly a dozen individuals armed with tactical gear and weapons attacked its Prairieland facility, injuring an officer, who survived.

What is ICE?

ICE, or US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that enforces immigration laws – including arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants – and investigates crimes such as human trafficking, drug smuggling and financial fraud.

In recent years, the agency has frequently clashed with protesters, particularly over detention conditions and deportation policies.

“The Department of Homeland Security reports assaults against its officers have risen eightfold since Trump began his mass deportations,” Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro reported from Washington.

Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his presidency, with large-scale deportations and high-profile crackdowns.

“Now, the agency is deploying more security to its offices – while leaders warn that the US is headed in a dangerous direction if the political violence continues,” she added.

Where did the shooting happen?

The shooting took place at ICE’s field office in Dallas, which covers Texas and all of Oklahoma.

The ICE facility sits along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a major airport for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and only a few blocks from hotels that serve travellers.

This is not the first attack on the facility.

Last month, 36-year-old US citizen Bratton Dean Wilkinson was arrested after arriving at the facility and claiming he had a bomb in his backpack, showing officers what he said was a detonator on his wrist.

What do we know about the suspect?

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.

Jahn had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.

Court records show Jahn was arrested in 2015 for delivering marijuana to buyers. In 2016, he admitted to delivering between a quarter-ounce (7g) and five pounds (2.3kg). He was given five years of probation and a $500 fine.

Under Texas law, the charge is considered a “state jail felony”, which is the lowest level of felony offence in the state.

As Jahn’s name began circulating online, his older brother, Noah Jahn, spoke with a Reuters reporter. Noah, 30, who lives in McKinney, Texas – about 48km (30 miles) north of Dallas – said he was unaware of his brother having any negative feelings towards ICE.

“I didn’t know he had any political intent at all,” Noah said.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Ryan Sanderson, who met him in 2017, told The Associated Press news agency.

“I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

What do we know about the victims?

Authorities have not released the identities of the victims. They said the three detainees who were shot were in the country without proper documentation and had been taken into custody and were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility.

According to Mexico’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, one of the injured detainees is a Mexican national. The ministry said the individual is hospitalised with serious injuries, and that the Mexican consulate has contacted the family to provide support and legal assistance.

What have been the reactions?

In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting. He described the attacker as “deranged”, referred to the “Anti-ICE” message allegedly found on the shell casings and called that “despicable”.

Trump did not mention the victims, but instead urged, “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!”

Vice President JD Vance, without offering evidence, said the attack was politically motivated.

At an event in North Carolina, he said that California Governor Gavin Newsom and others didn’t need to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies, but “if your political rhetoric incites violence against law enforcement, you can go straight to hell”.

Newsom quickly responded.

“No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today,” Newsom said. “Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there.”

Texas Senator Ted Cruz appealed for calm.

“This has very real consequences,” Cruz said.

“Look, in America, we disagree. That’s fine. That’s the democratic process, but your political opponents are not Nazis. We need to learn to work together without demonising each other, without attacking each other,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267683160528-1758754927.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:32.816268

“For her asylum claim, Zapet contends that the BIA incorrectly affirmed the IJ’s determination that she failed to present extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant consideration of her untimely application. The government counters that we lack jurisdiction to review the agency’s determination. We agree with the government. …

“We next address the BIA’s denial of Zapet’s application for withholding of removal. Zapet contends that the evidence she presented compelled the BIA to find that she suffered past persecution and would more likely than not suffer future persecution. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that Zapet failed to demonstrate past persecution. Zapet’s testimony regarding the threats at the core of her claim lacked specificity. …

“We similarly conclude that the BIA’s rejection of Zapet’s claim that she would more likely than not be faced with future persecution was supported by substantial evidence. Because, as already discussed, the BIA made a supportable determination that the threats themselves do not constitute persecution, Zapet’s only remaining argument is that the circumstances in Guatemala are so dangerous that she should not be required to return. In support of this contention, Zapet submitted information about country conditions in Guatemala.

“Substantial evidence supports the finding that Zapet did not show any individual circumstances that make it likely that she will face persecution were she to return to Guatemala. The country conditions reports identify difficult aspects of life in Guatemala, but the record lacks evidence showing how these difficulties apply to Zapet. …

“Additionally, the record evidence does not compel a finding that Zapet would face danger if she relocated within Guatemala from the area where she previously lived. …

“The BIA’s determination again is supported by substantial evidence. Zapet says that she was threatened with forced conscription and the risk of her children’s kidnapping. But, as we have already noted, the threats Zapet experienced did not manifest in actions against her or her children despite her refusal to comply with her perpetrators demands, and she has shown no reason to expect more severe treatment were she to return. … Moreover, Zapet’s reliance on generalized facts from country conditions reports is insufficient to establish that she would be subject to torture with the consent or acquiescence of the government. …

President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.","DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and wounding two others in a transport van before taking his own life, authorities said.

The suspect was identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S., coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety, and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that shots were fired “indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,” a secure and gated entryway.

The wounded detainees were in critical condition at a hospital, said DHS, which previously said two detainees were killed and one was wounded before issuing a correction.

No ICE agents were injured.

By the evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by DHS on the social platform X.

‘Targeted violence’

At a midday news conference, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. and determined that someone had opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathan E. Maner said via email.

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

“I was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God, no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Who was Joshua Jahn?

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a suburban Dallas home that public records link to Jahn.

It sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a Fairview police vehicle, but officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

Martyna Kowalczyk, CEO of Texas-based Solartime USA, said in a statement that Jahn worked for her company for less than a few months “many years ago.”

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, according to Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told AP. “I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

Sanderson said he tried to keep Jahn longer because he “felt bad for him.”

Calls for an end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called the shooting not just an attack on law enforcement and the victims but “an attack on our community and on our nation’s heritage of civil and democratic discourse.”

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

“Violence must never be allowed to define how we respond to migration,” said Anna Gallagher, the group’s executive director.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside the Dallas ICE facility every Monday said: “Violence doesn’t heal anything.”

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and report for check-ins.

Sipe said she has noticed in recent months that people who enter are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4 attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him.

And in suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center. Sixteen people have been arrested outside, according to authorities who called the activists “rioters.”

Attacks, escapes concern at some ICE offices

Dozens of field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some located in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

Some, like Dallas, have exposed loading areas for buses, which pose risks for escape and outside attack, Torres said. Other vulnerabilities are nearby vantage points for snipers and long lines forming outside without protection.

“I would assure you that ICE, after today, is going to be a taking a hard look at physical security assessments for all of their facilities,” said Torres, currently head of security and technology consulting at Guidepost Solutions.

The Trump administration argues those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody.
Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to ""sanctuary"" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants — a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to ""sanctuary"" cities and states.

U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of ""holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage"" unless they assist immigration agents.

The decision is likely to be appealed.

The states that sued — which include California, New York and Illinois — took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must ""honor requests for cooperation"" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are ""sanctuary"" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.

The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.

The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.

The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement ""halfhearted and incomplete,"" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.

In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy ""both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.""

""Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,"" Smith wrote.

The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish ""sanctuary"" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Trump administration argues those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But ""sanctuary"" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.

CBS News has reached out to DHS, FEMA and the White House for comment.

Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions ""do not receive access to Federal funds.""

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government is considering making the $1 million Trump Gold Card the only pathway to a U.S. green card—but immigration experts tell Forbes that it doesn’t pass the legal sniff test.

Key Facts

What Is The Status Of The Trump Gold Card?

The Trump administration has hyped the Gold Card but “I don't think it's happening,” Gelatt told Forbes, pointing to recent remarks by Joseph Edlow, the newly confirmed director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), that appeared to indicate the government does not yet have its ducks in a row. “We at the department will ensure that if a Gold Card does come to fruition, that there will be sufficient vetting and screening for any applicant that comes through the process,” Edlow told the Center for Immigration Studies last week. Multiple immigration experts told Forbes that creating a new visa must go through the legislative branch. “Unless Congress acts, there will never be a Trump Gold Card because it’s not consistent with current law, and it's not going to survive the invariable legal challenges,” Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, told Forbes. Writing in the National Law Review on Wednesday, attorneys at Ogletree Deakins, one of the country’s largest labor and employment law firms, concluded, “At this time, it is unclear whether the EB-1 and EB-2 immigrant visa programs for people of 'exceptional value' may be replaced, with the potential to eliminate or replace other immigrant visa programs in the future.” It’s strange and perhaps telling, note experts, that the Trump Gold Card is being managed by the Commerce Department and not Homeland Security. “Maybe that's an indication of how things have played out internally,” Loweree speculated. “Maybe there's been some level of pushback at DHS or USCIS in terms of the underlying legal prospects of being able to do this.”

What Is The Difference Between The Eb-5 Visa And The Trump Gold Card?

The biggest difference is who benefits from the applicant’s visa fee. The EB-5 visa is an investment immigration program that “was passed by Congress, has been on the books for many years and requires a level of investment between $800,000 and just over $1 million dollars,” Loweree told Forbes. “That money isn’t just a gift the US government. Applicants are required to invest those funds in a commercial enterprise in the U.S., and there's an important job creation component Congress instituted to create greater benefits for businesses and workers already in the U.S.” In comparison, the Trump Gold Card would require applicants to make a flat $1 million donation to the Treasury, which is a far less appealing proposition, according to Nuri Katz, founder of Apex Capital Partners, who has provided investment immigration guidance to ultra-high-net-worth clients around the world for 35 years. “Now what the government is saying is ‘we don't care about you business people. We don't care about job creation. We just want the money put into the Treasury,’” Katz told Forbes, adding the Trump administration is “basically destroying private businesses that were trying to get off the ground by raising funds from EB-5 investors. These are important projects, from hotels to hospitals, around the country that were creating thousands of jobs. By cutting off funding, many will fail, leaving half-built properties and bankrupt American businesses. It is pretty scary, actually.”

Chief Critic

Loweree scoffed at the administration’s claim that the Gold Card was designed to drive down the federal debt. “The idea that they’re concerned about the debt when they just championed and pushed through the Big, Beautiful Bill Act that's projected to increase the debt by over $3 trillion is ridiculous. This is an effort to create a new pay-to-play scheme and reorient our immigration system into something that simply favors the rich and moves away from the historical priorities of family reunification and focusing on skills and critical labor that's critical to the U.S. economy.”

Crucial Quote

“Instead of creating policies that help American businesses and families, President Trump is rolling out the welcome mat for Russian oligarchs and cartel bosses,” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.

“Today, the Court ruled that the Trump Administration cannot bully states into taking part in their fear-driven, inhumane immigration agenda by withholding congressionally appropriated funds,” said AG Campbell. “I applaud the Court’s decision, which will protect billions of dollars to help states ensure public safety and prepare for, protect against, and respond to catastrophic natural disasters. We will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable when it violates our laws and puts our residents at risk.”

In their lawsuit against FEMA, the coalition of attorneys general argued that the new terms and conditions placed on federal grant funding were unconstitutional and beyond the Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority. They argued that Congress had appropriated the funding to protect and support public safety, not for immigration enforcement. In today’s judgment, the Court agreed with the states that the safety and well-being of every American could be put at risk if states were forced to forfeit the billions in federal funding for emergency preparedness and response for failing to comply with the federal government's cruel and unlawful immigration enforcement policies.

Last year, Massachusetts alone received more than five million dollars in federal funding from FEMA, for a sum total of over 23 million dollars received over the last four years. AG Campbell and the coalition argued that using federal funding to bully states into submission would cause irreparable harm to the delicate bond and carefully built trust between law enforcement and the very communities they vow to serve and protect.

The provider, Home Care Staffing, filed the first lawsuits of this kind that 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has seen, one in Ramsey County District Court and the other in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota weeks after CEO Twyla Martin received a letter from DHS at the beginning of August, which served as notice the state agency was suspending HSS reimbursements to the provider.

Martin is asking the courts for a temporary injunction that would require DHS to resume payments while officials continue their investigation into alleged “credible allegation of fraud.”

“I felt like it was a huge injustice. It was unfair. And not only that, people’s lives are being impacted,” Martin said on Tuesday, when asked why she turned to legal action.

She said the payment suspension forced Home Care Staffing to lay off staff and suspend HSS-related services for more than 500 clients.

“I wasn’t able to pay my staff. I had to lay off 35 people,” Martin said.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS met with Martin and client Jessica Cronquist on Tuesday at a home she said she was able to get into with the help of Home Care Staffing.

“They help us so much. They really do. And I feel lost without them, because they’ve been a good support system,” Cronquist said.

Cronquist was mentioned in the August Notice of Payment Withhold from DHS. The letter said that Home Care Staffing overbilled for her services, citing that as a “credible allegation of fraud.”

Cronquist signed a letter days later, saying the billing was “true, accurate, and a full reflection of the services I actually received.”

Renée Cooper: “You don’t believe that home care staffing has over-billed on your behalf?”

Cronquist: “Nope.”

Cooper: “And you’ve seen it all?”

Cronquist: “Yes.”

Cooper, turning to Martin: “And I’ll just ask you directly, has Home Care Staffing overbilled on any clients?”

Martin: “No, not at all.”

Martin said she appealed the payment suspension, but it was denied.

Martin: “It pretty much just said, based upon what their findings were, from the first letter, it still remains.”

Cooper: “Until they can complete their investigation?”

Martin: “Correct.”

A recent change to state policy allows payments to be stopped when there’s a credible allegation of fraud, amid growing fraud investigations across several DHS programs.

Asked on Tuesday, DHS said it has suspended payments to 115 HSS providers, 55 have appealed, and DHS has not resumed payments to any as of this report.

Asked if she supports the policy changes, including DHS’s ability to stop payments quicker, Martin said, “I do support it if there’s a credible allegation of fraud that’s been backed by some sort of evidence that they are doing their due process correctly by making sure it really is fraud.”

“And I don’t think it’s DHS’s intention to hurt, but someone has to stand up to say, ‘Hey, I know you’re trying to be helpful and stop fraud, as you should, but you are missing a step that is hurting a lot of people.'”

Martin said 20-30 other HSS providers were also considering legal action.

DHS has made motions to dismiss the district court and federal lawsuits filed by Home Care Staffing.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in a press release at least one detainee was shot and others may be in critical condition. It's unclear if more were killed in the shooting. The department previously stated two detainees were killed and one was in critical condition but updated their release online.

However, DHS issued a statement Wednesday afternoon announcing the correction. No one from law enforcement was injured in the shooting, DHS said.

The shooter's motives and targets are unclear, but Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI field office, said at a press conference Wednesday morning the agency is investigating the shooting as ""an act of targeted violence."" Investigators found bullet casings they said contained anti-ICE messages.

The fatal shooting comes amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns since taking office in January and the nationwide responses to his measures, including protests across the country.

It also comes after a year of high-profile, political incidents involving gun violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk exactly two weeks ago and the killings of two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers in June.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointed out Wednesday’s shooting is the third in Texas involving ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection and called on political violence to end.

""To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP, stop,"" Cruz told reporters. ""To every politician demanding that ICE agents be doxxed and calling for people to go after their families, stop.""

But U.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, was more direct in blaming the uptick in political violence on ""anti-law enforcement rhetoric from the radical left.""

“Texans back our men and women in blue. ANY attack on an officer WILL BE investigated & prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Cornyn wrote in a post on X. ""We must stop this dangerous rhetoric & break this disturbing trend of political violence.”

This isn’t the first incident at the ICE field office in recent months. The building, which sees detainees as well as people with ongoing immigration cases checking in with officers, received a bomb threat last month.

In a statement, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said it shouldn't be a partisan issue, calling on the public to pray for the victims and their families and condemn political violence.

""Dallas did not deserve what transpired this morning,"" the statement reads. ""We are better than this craven act of violence. In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.""

Dallas City Council Member Adam Bazaldua expressed his sorrow over the shooting in a statement Wednesday, saying the country's immigrants are ""bearing the brunt"" of hate and violence spreading within the United States. Bazaldua also condemned any politicization of the incident.

""At a time when our communities are desperate for healing, leadership, and real solutions, we are instead met with more division and finger-pointing,"" Bazaldua said. ""We cannot continue down this path of hate and violence. Our country and all of its people deserve better.”

Alvarado ICE detention center shooting

Seventeen people have been arrested over the course of two months in connection with a July 4 shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 30 miles south of Fort Worth. About a dozen people arrived outside the detention center that night, setting off fireworks outside the facility, according to court documents.

ICE correctional officers called Alvarado police. When an officer arrived, several people started fleeing on foot and ignored verbal commands, court documents show. Then a person in the woods began shooting, hitting an Alvarado officer who has since recovered, according to court documents.

The initial complaint by the U.S. Justice Department said two people — one wearing a black mask, another wearing a green one — shot at correctional officers and the Alvarado officer 20-to-30 times.

But a more recent complaint obtained by KERA News states new evidence suggests there was only one shooter and 11 shell casings recovered from the scene.

The defendants allegedly had cans of spray paint and wrote “ICE Pig” and “Traitor” on cars in the parking lot. Police found firearms, magazines with ammunition, body armor and flyers that said “fight ICE terror with class war” and “free all political prisoners” on the suspects and their cars.

Ten people were arrested the night of the shooting and seven more have been arrested since on charges including attempted murder, aggravated assault and terrorism. That includes former Marine Corps reservist Benjamin Song, who was arrested after more than a week after a police and FBI manhunt.

Federal authorities have called the incident a coordinated attack against law enforcement. Some arrestees and their attorneys have said the incident was only intended to be a protest, and the alleged shooter acted alone.

Political scientists told KERA News the incident is indicative of an uptick in political violence on both sides of the political aisle.

Fourteen defendants made their first appearances in Fort Worth federal court Monday and Tuesday for their federal charges. Several will be back in court next Tuesday for hearings to determine probable cause in their charges and whether they should be kept in detention.

The arrestees had been held in the Johnson County Jail on million-dollar bonds, but they’ve now been moved to the Wichita County Jail as of Wednesday morning, jail records show.

Dario Sanchez, a Dallas teacher who was arrested for removing some of the defendants and their texts from a Discord group chat — then bonded out — was rearrested this week after law enforcement monitoring his devices said he made “explosive construction internet queries” in violation of his bond conditions. He and his attorney say his searches related to batteries and melting plastic were research for his hobbies: making anime figurines, building a remote-controlled car and fixing his Game Boy.

He’s scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon for a bond hearing.

July 7 McAllen shooting

Days after the Alvarado shooting, a man fired dozens of rounds at federal agents with an assault rifle at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

Authorities identified the gunman as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, a Michigan man around 27 years old, who was shooting at agents leaving the building.

According to an incident report obtained by ValleyCentral, Mosqueda’s father reported his son as a missing person hours before the shooting and told authorities his son was armed.

Mosqueda’s brother told TV station WOOD that Mosqueda had been dealing with mental health issues, and the attack came “out of the blue.”

Sept. 12 Chicago shooting

An ICE agent fatally shot a suspect who tried to evade arrest in a suburb of Chicago by driving at officers and dragging one of them, the Associated Press reported. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer was trying to arrest a man with a history of reckless driving who had entered the country illegally, but he refused orders and drove his car at officers.

ICE identified Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez as the suspect who later died in the hospital.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.","The U.S. Department of Justice is backing CoreCivic in its legal battle with the city of Leavenworth as the company seeks to reopen a shuttered prison it owns there as an immigrant detention center over the objection of local officials.

The DOJ filed a statement of interest in federal court on Tuesday, characterizing the city’s resistance as an illegal effort to undermine the federal government’s immigration enforcement.

“The United States submits this Statement of Interest to address an aggressive and unlawful effort by the City of Leavenworth, Kansas … to interfere with federal immigration enforcement,” begins the eight-page filing, signed by Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general over the DOJ’s Civil Division.

The DOJ filing was also signed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign and Anthony Nicastro, acting director of the Office of Immigration Litigation.

The show of support for CoreCivic comes as the private prison company has suffered a string of legal defeats in Kansas state court in recent months.

Leavenworth District Court Judge John J. Bryant issued and upheld a temporary restraining order blocking CoreCivic from accepting detainees at the 1,033-bed facility under a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the lawsuit plays out.

The case landed in Bryant’s courtroom after CoreCivic successfully argued that Leavenworth’s initial lawsuit in federal court lacked jurisdictional standing. But the company later filed its own claim in federal court against the city, alleging that local officials were unlawfully interfering with the federal government’s prerogative to control immigration policy.

The DOJ built off of that argument in its own filing, invoking the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which places federal laws above conflicting state and local laws.

“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the filing states, referring to the address of CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility. “Under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, the Constitution ‘prohibit[s] States from interfering with or controlling the operations of the Federal Government.’

“This foundational principle means that Defendants cannot regulate the United States’ contracts for private detention facilities,” the filing adds.

ICE prison lawsuit

In court filings and hearings, the city has argued that to maintain legitimacy, it must be allowed to enforce its own laws, including a 2012 ordinance that requires jail and prison operators to secure a special use permit before opening.

CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit, but withdrew its application in March, saying it could operate the ICE detention center by right.

The facility at 100 Highway Terrace was previously operated as a private prison under contract with the U.S. Marshals Service through 2021, but a Joe Biden executive order barred the DOJ from renewing contracts with private prison companies.

Several previous efforts by CoreCivic to reactivate the prison in the years after its closure — including under an earlier proposed agreement with ICE — faced pushback from community members, in part because of the facility’s history of chronic violence, rampant drug use and dangerously low staffing levels.

CoreCivic attorney Taylor Concannon Hausmann argued during an August hearing that the local government’s adversarial stance toward CoreCivic reopening without a permit is “fueled by political discourse and polarization” over whether immigrant detainees should be brought to Leavenworth.

City officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.

“CoreCivic appreciates the Department of Justice’s support as we continue to pursue all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Todd said.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/vjccst/picture301410574/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_LeavenworthICEdetention%20(2),N,,2025-09-24 19:57:59.278244

Only three of those sent to Togo are Togolese. The nationalities of the others has not been disclosed.

He described the development as a breach of legal protections, noting that at least eight of the deportees previously held U.S. court orders shielding them from removal to their home countries due to risks of torture and persecution.

The group included four Nigerians, three Togolese, two Malians, one Liberian and one Gambian.

Ghana’s uneasy role in US deportation policy

Ghana’s President John Dramani Mahama recently confirmed that his government had agreed to receive deportees from across West Africa under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Officials in Accra have stressed that Ghana is not endorsing Washington’s policy and has not received compensation for hosting these deportees.

Still, the move has made Ghana a frontline state in the U.S. strategy of outsourcing deportations to African partners.

While Ghana has accepted returnees, other African governments have taken a more defiant stance.

Nigeria has publicly rejected U.S. attempts to offload non-Nigerian deportees on its territory, insisting it will only receive its own citizens. Similar hesitancy has been expressed in Kenya and South Africa, where concerns about security and integration remain high.

The mixed response further reflects how U.S. immigration policies are straining relations with African nations, many of whom see the returnees as victims of a politicised crackdown rather than simply failed migrants.

Human rights concerns linger

Barker-Vormawor’s failed court bid highlights the limits of legal protections for deportees once they are transferred from U.S. custody to African soil.

He argued that the new expulsions “are precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” adding that the case he filed was now moot since the deportees had already been forced out.

Rights advocates warn that deporting people with established protection orders violates international law and could expose them to torture, imprisonment, or persecution in their home countries.

The City of Eureka is among a group of plaintiffs that prevailed over the Trump administration in federal court Tuesday.

The plaintiffs, a group of local organizations and governments that receive millions of dollars of federal grant money, accused the Trump administration of imposing “unauthorized and vague conditions” on their grant funding. Yesterday, a federal judge agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction that bars the administration from making grants conditional upon fulfilling Trump’s policy goals.

The president’s administration was trying to force grantees to comply with a series of recent executive orders that prohibit recipients from promoting “woke” beliefs and practices, such as DEI, “gender ideology” and elective abortion, while requiring them to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The City of Eureka is among many jurisdictions to have passed a sanctuary ordinance prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The plaintiffs in this suit, led by the City of Fresno, challenged the actions on constitutional grounds, arguing that they violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment.

The City of Eureka joined the lawsuit last month. City Manager Miles Slattery told the Outpost via phone that while the city has not yet received any grants that would have been contingent on those new conditions, it regularly received Community Development Block Grants and federal transportation grants.

“We’re looking at a $5 million grant for transportation [currently],” he said.

With yesterday’s ruling, which follows a temporary restraining order granted last month, Judge Richard Seeborg found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. Only Congress has the authority to impose conditions on federal grant funding, he noted. And he found that the administration’s grant conditions likely violate the Separation of Powers; they’re unrelated to the expertise of the granting agencies; and the vagueness of the conditions would encourage “arbitrary and discriminatory” enforcement, among other issues.

The order applies to these federal agencies:

The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.","The sudden detention of Carmen Herrera, a longtime San Antonio resident, has drawn widespread attention after video of her being detained by federal immigration agents went viral on social media.

Herrera, a mother of six U.S. citizen children and married to a U.S. citizen, appeared at San Antonio’s Immigration Court earlier this year seeking relief in her case. Instead, she was met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who detained her immediately after her hearing. She was later deported to her native Mexico.

Witnesses captured the moment on cell phones, and the footage spread rapidly online, sparking outrage from immigrant-rights advocates.

Supporters say Herrera had lived in the United States for years, held steady employment, and had no criminal record.

ICE officials defended the arrest, stating Herrera had a final order of removal and that the agency was acting within its authority. “Individuals subject to deportation orders are priorities for enforcement,” an ICE spokesperson said.

The viral video has reignited debate over courthouse arrests and the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which critics say targets families and longtime residents without due process.

Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines series recently released an episode titled “Crackdown,” which tells the story of Herrera and the impact her detainment and deportation has had on her family. It also examines the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including court arrests and deportations conducted without full due process.

According to the documentary, Herrera had long lived in the U.S. and was pursuing legal relief but was unexpectedly handcuffed and shoved into an ICE van after being called into court.

Her attorneys say she had multiple paths to legal status; her arrest and removal came as families across the country report similar takedowns at courthouses.

More broadly, ""Crackdown"" frames Herrera’s case as part of a sweeping deportation campaign under Trump. The documentary underscores how the administration has used measures such as in-court ICE arrests, redefinition of enforcement zones, and transfers of migrants to foreign penal facilities.

One of the most controversial elements exposed is the mass deportation of migrants, including those with no U.S. criminal convictions, to El Salvador’s new Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a maximum-security prison built for gang detainees.

The administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in March 2025 to justify shipping about 238 Venezuelan migrants from Texas to CECOT, despite internal records showing many lacked criminal records. The U.S. Supreme Court later found that this was a misuse of the Alien Enemies Act and was unlawfully applied.

Supporters of the administration argue that the policy is aimed at removing dangerous gang actors and closing legal loopholes exploited by criminals. They assert that broad powers are necessary to prevent criminal networks from exploiting sympathetic rulings or delays in the immigration system.

Critics counter that the campaign overshoots its intent: thousands of nonviolent immigrants, asylum seekers, and individuals with no criminal records risk being lumped in, deprived of due process, and sent to foreign prisons. The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.

At least three people were shot, two of whom were killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and two of them have died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

Authorities say Jahn fired on the facility from a nearby rooftop, striking both the van and other parts of the ICE facility.

We are only miles from Prarieland Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers. It has to end and the FBI and our partners will lead the these investigative efforts to see to it that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice,"" FBI director Kash Patel wrote on X.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a ""prescheduled visit"" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the ""incident command location"" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were ""multiple fatalities.""

""There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility,"" Noem wrote on X. ""Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

""While we don’t know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,"" she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

She reiterated calls for critics of ICE to tone down their rhetoric after the attack.

Associated Press

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — As President Donald Trump’s administration imposes new restrictions on the legal immigration system, U.S. adults are more likely than they were a year ago to think these immigrants benefit the country, according to a new poll.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Americans are more likely than they were in March 2024 to say it’s a “major benefit” that people who come to the U.S. legally contribute to economic growth and help American companies get the expertise of skilled workers. The survey also shows that Americans are less likely than they were in January to say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced. Slightly fewer than half of Americans say the number should remain the same, a similar percentage from earlier this year.

At the same time, perceptions of illegal immigration haven’t shifted meaningfully. Americans continue to see fewer benefits from people who come to the U.S. illegally, and they’re more likely to see major risks from these immigrants, including the concern that they’ll commit crimes while in the U.S.

Trump, a Republican, has focused much of his attention on arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, but new screenings, vetting and increased costs are also impacting people who want to come to the U.S. legally to work or study. On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation to overhaul the H-1B visa program, one of the most common pathways for highly skilled foreign workers, requiring now a $100,000 fee for applications. The Trump administration is also subjecting green card applicants to “anti-Americanism” screening, and students applying for visas now need to adhere to social media vetting.

Even Republicans are less likely to say legal immigration should be reduced than they were earlier this year and more likely to say it should remain as is.

Philip Steers, of St. Petersburg, Florida, is a Republican and feels the U.S. makes it too difficult for people to migrate legally. His nephew married a woman from Cambodia, and they have been trying for months to secure a spouse visa.

“If you are pushing all those people who are illegal out, why not make it easier for people who want to come here legally?” said Steers, 76. “We need to speed up the process for those who want to come here to benefit our country.”

Republicans less likely to want to reduce legal immigration

While slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants should stay as it is, about one-quarter say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced “a lot” or “a little.” That marks a decrease from January, when about one-third said this.

The drop is largely driven by Republicans. About 3 in 10 Republicans now say that legal immigration should be reduced, down from 45% in January.

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be increased “a lot” or “a little,” up slightly from January, when 24% of Americans wanted an increase in legal immigration.

“If you don’t have immigration as a culture, the culture will stagnate. You have to have that balance,” Steers said.

More see benefits from immigrants for economic growth and companies

Americans are more likely to see “major” benefits from people who come to the U.S. legally and less likely to see “major” risks, compared with an AP-NORC poll conducted early last year.

About 6 in 10 U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of immigrants in the country legally is that they contribute to economic growth, which went up from about 4 in 10 in March 2024. Similarly, 51% of U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of legal immigration is that American companies get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology, compared with 41% in March 2024.

Carlos Gonzalez, who was born in the U.S. to Panamanian parents, said immigrants “provide a lot to the economy of the United States.”

“They bring different ideas that help the economy,” said Gonzalez, 53, a Democrat from Waterbury, Connecticut, adding his mother served as a military nurse in Vietnam. “A lot of people don’t realize that when they do come over here, they try to enrich the country and not take away from it.”

Some of the perceived benefits are economic, but some are cultural, with about 46% saying a “major” benefit of legal immigrants is that they enrich American culture and values, up from 38% in the previous poll.

Shifting views don’t extend to immigrants in the country illegally

Jeff Witoszczak, of El Paso, Texas, identifies as a moderate Republican and supports Trump’s efforts to conduct large-scale deportations of people in the country illegally, saying he does not think the focus needs to be on those who have committed violent crimes. Witoszczak is married to a woman from Mexico who came to the U.S. legally when she was a child.

“Coming here illegally, that’s a crime in and of itself,” Witoszczak said. “They didn’t follow due process coming in. They don’t need due process going out.”

Americans tend to see greater risks — and smaller benefits — from immigrants who are in the country illegally, and these views largely haven’t shifted since last year.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults now say it’s a major benefit that immigrants in the country illegally will take jobs Americans don’t want, up from about one-third last year. And 42% say that immigrants in the country illegally contribute to economic growth, and 32% believe that they enrich American culture and values. Those findings have remained steady since last year.

About half of U.S. adults say it’s a major risk that immigrants in the country illegally will burden welfare and safety net programs. Studies have shown that immigrants who work in the country illegally pay local, state and federal taxes and generally do not qualify for federal benefits.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,183 adults was conducted Sept. 11-15, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25262782616454-scaled-e1758748260116.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:57:11.944846

Sen. Ossoff is spearheading a new inquiry into numerous Federal courts’ reported failures to uphold Americans’ civil rights as they await a full trial.

According to a recent studyThis is an external link, in numerous Federal courts across the country, judges jail defendants without lawyers at initial appearance hearings, in violation of their civil rights.

“Ensuring that every person is afforded legal counsel at their first appearance before a federal judge is not only a statutory requirement—it is a foundational protection for our adversarial legal system,” wrote Sen. Ossoff. “Given the gravity of these findings, I urge the Judicial Conference to prioritize this issue as a matter of urgent concern and bring the offending district courts into compliance with federal law immediately to ensure that no individual is jailed without the benefit of legal representation at the outset of their case.”

According to the study, proceeding unrepresented at an initial appearance severely disadvantages defendants, leading to increased pretrial detention rates.

Sen. Ossoff continues working to ensure civil and human rights are safeguarded.

In May, Sens. Ossoff and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the bipartisan Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Reauthorization Act to help secure justice for civil rights cold case victims and their families.

In 2024, President Biden signed into law Sen. Ossoff’s bipartisan Federal Prison Oversight Act, prison reform legislation to overhaul independent oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prison’s 122 facilities nationwide.

If so, then the reclassification of the visa petition would be unlawful, with the consequence that the son would be entitled to a much speedier resolution of whether he is entitled to a visa than if the reclassification were to remain in place.
We then address whether, as the plaintiffs allege, the reclassification of the visa petition is unlawful.
… The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult.
Appealed from a decision by O’Toole, J., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.","Where a complaint was filed in U.S. District Court alleging that the reclassification of a parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son has unlawfully delayed the visa process, it was error to dismiss the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability.

Reversed and remanded.

“In this appeal, we confront a challenge to a judgment of dismissal in a suit against the U.S. Secretary of State and the Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs are a naturalized U.S. citizen and his noncitizen son. They are challenging the reclassification of the parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son. They allege that this reclassification has unlawfully delayed the visa process in their case.

“The merits of the claims hinge on whether the son, despite turning 21 years old during the visa process, must be treated as under ‘21 years of age’ and, therefore, a ‘child’ for purposes of the visa petition classification under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), Pub. L. No. 107-208, 116 Stat. 927 (2002). If so, then the reclassification of the visa petition would be unlawful, with the consequence that the son would be entitled to a much speedier resolution of whether he is entitled to a visa than if the reclassification were to remain in place.

“The District Court did not address whether the reclassification was lawful because it dismissed the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. We first conclude that the District Court erred in doing so, at least given the arguments that the appellees have advanced, both below and to our Court, for concluding that the doctrine applies. We then address whether, as the plaintiffs allege, the reclassification of the visa petition is unlawful. We conclude that it is. We thus reverse the claims’ dismissal and remand for further consideration consistent with this decision. …

“The plaintiffs are Eduardo Teles de Menezes and his son, Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes. …

“… The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prohibits ‘judicial review of a consular officer’s denial of a visa.’ …

“If the appellees are right that the doctrine precludes review in this case, then our analysis is at an end. The appellants contend, however, that the doctrine has no application here for either of two reasons. First, they contend that their claims do not allege that a consular officer’s denial of a visa even occurred, let alone that any such denial was wrongful. Second, they contend that, in any event, their claims concern only the proper interpretation of the CSPA and therefore ‘do[] not implicate the independent judgment of [a] consular officer[].’ For the reasons we will explain, we agree with the appellants’ first contention and so do not address the second. …

“There remains to address whether appellants are right that the reclassification of the visa petition into the F1 category (adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens) was unlawful. In their view, rather than reclassifying the petition into the F1 category, it should have been reclassified, upon Eduardo’s naturalization, into the ‘immediate relatives’ category (children of U.S. citizens). They contend that is so because Eduardo had become a U.S citizen and, under the CSPA, Carlos had to be treated as if he were under 21 years of age, notwithstanding that he had turned 21 during the visa process.

“Appellants’ contention turns, in the end, on the proper construction of a single phrase in 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2) — the provision of the CSPA that addresses the conversion of an F2A petition into an ‘immediate relatives’ petition. That phrase instructs that the determination of whether the noncitizen beneficiary satisfies the age requirement to be reclassified as an immediate relative ‘shall be made using the age of the alien on the date of the parent’s naturalization.’

“Appellants contend that ‘age,’ as used in §1151(f)(2), refers not to the beneficiary’s ‘biological age.’ Instead, they argue, ‘age’ refers to the ‘age’ of the noncitizen as determined by a formula that applies to all F2A beneficiaries, as set forth in §1153(h)(1). They contend that is so because §1153(h)(1), in setting out a formula to calculate the age of an F2A applicant, must be understood to interact with §1151(f)(2), which concerns potentially reclassifying an F2A applicant (based on their age) into an immediate relative applicant.

“The District Court did not address this issue given its reliance on the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to dismiss the claims. Nevertheless, the issue presents a question that ‘is purely a matter of statutory interpretation, and therefore, a question of law, which we can review in the first instance.’ … The parties have also fully briefed and argued this question. We thus proceed to address it. As we will explain, we agree with the appellants and so construe ‘age’ in §1151(f)(2) just as the only two circuits to have construed that term in §1151(f)(2) have. …

“In sum, we conclude that, ‘[i]n the case of a petition … initially filed’ in the F2A category, and ‘later converted, due to the naturalization of the parent, to a[n] [immediate relatives] petition,’ the ‘age of the [beneficiary] on the date of the parent’s naturalization,’ 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2), is the beneficiary’s ‘statutory age’ as provided in §1153(h)(1). Based on the allegations in the complaint, Carlos was a ‘child’ on the date of Eduardo’s naturalization because his statutory age was frozen at twenty. … The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult. We leave it to the District Court to determine the proper remedy on remand. …

“The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Smith permanently blocked enforcement of the grant conditions, granting summary judgment to a coalition of states including Illinois, California, and New York.

The states sued in May, alleging the new strings attached to emergency-preparedness funds were illegal. The administration wanted grant recipients to certify they don’t “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration” and promise to “honor requests for cooperation” in immigration enforcement.

The conditions were imposed to comply with an executive order calling for cutting funds to so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

But in court, the administration “made no attempt to claim that it examined the relevant data or articulated a fact-based reason for its actions,” and gave no “actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” Smith wrote, finding the conditions “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and unconstitutional under the spending clause.

The states risked losing billions in essential public-safety funding if they didn’t comply with “hopelessly vague” conditions that were unlawfully coercive, Smith wrote.

“Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed,” he wrote.

CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.
“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus.
For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role.
We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""","WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-05) introduced a War Powers Resolution to terminate unauthorized U.S military hostilities against Venezuela and transnational criminal organizations that the Trump administration has unilaterally designated as foreign terrorist organizations. The resolution follows the administration’s repeated strikes on vessels in the southern Caribbean carried out without congressional authorization or clear legal justification.

Omar, who serves as Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus and Chair of its Peace & Security Taskforce, was joined by CPC Chair Rep. Greg Casar (TX-35) and CPC Whip Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04). CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.

“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It was not self-defense or authorized by Congress. That is why I am introducing a resolution to terminate hostilities against Venezuela, and against the transnational criminal organizations that the Administration has designated as terrorists this year. All of us should agree that the separation of powers is crucial to our democracy, and that only Congress has the power to declare war.”

“Donald Trump cannot be allowed to drag the United States into another endless war with his reckless actions,” said Rep. Greg Casar, Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It is illegal for the president to take the country to war without consulting the people's representatives, and Congress must vote now to stop Trump from putting us at further risk.”

“The extrajudicial strike against a vessel in the Caribbean Sea is only the most recent of Trump’s reckless, deadly, and illegal military actions. Now, he’s lawlessly threatening a region already profoundly impacted by the destabilization of U.S. actions,” said Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, the Whip of the Progressive Caucus. “With this War Powers Resolution, we emphasize the total illegality of his action, and—consistent with overwhelming public opposition to forever war—reclaim Congress’ sole power to authorize military action.”

“The people that I represent are sick and tired of this country being dragged into one endless war after another,” said Rep. Jim McGovern. “Trump’s reckless, unlawful, and extrajudicial strikes were in flagrant violation of both international and U.S. law. And his military escalation in the Caribbean—a region already destabilized by decades of U.S. intervention—threatens to release even more chaos and violence at our doorstep. Only Congress has the power to declare war, and we must stand up for the constitutional separation of powers before it is too late.”

The War Powers Resolution directs the President to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities against Venezuela and against transnational criminal organizations unless explicitly authorized by Congress. It makes clear that the President retains the ability to respond to sudden attacks or imminent threats, but stresses that the trafficking of illegal drugs does not itself constitute an armed attack.

For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role. Rep. Omar’s resolution reasserts Article I authority, making clear that neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force provide legal cover for new conflicts in Latin America. It underscores that a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation, as defined by U.S. law, does not authorize the use of military force, contrary to recent claims from the Trump Administration and some Members of Congress.

""The Trump administration has appointed itself judge, jury, and executioner, in a series of blatantly illegal strikes,"" said Sara Haghdoosti, Executive Director of Win Without War. ""People struggling through the overdose crisis need healthcare, not warfare. We're proud to support Representative Omar's resolution to stop these strikes and we urge her colleagues to join her.""

""We abhor the recent unlawful strikes on Venezuelan boats, which have killed more than a dozen people,"" said Lauren Brownlee, the Friends Committee on National Legislation's Deputy General Secretary. ""As Quakers, we share the conviction that all creation has worth and dignity. Those suspected of crimes deserve due process, not summary execution. We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""

""It could not be more clear that Americans across the political spectrum do not want to fight and fund another war,"" said Dylan Williams, Vice President of Center for International Policy Advocacy. ""Trump's illegal, extra-judicial killings off the coast of Venezuela are an unauthorized and unconstitutional use of military force that put our servicemembers at risk. Lawmakers have a duty to stand up for their voters and their prerogatives to prevent another unnecessary and costly war of choice.""

""The President is claiming the authority to kill people outside of armed conflict and without due process,"" said Annie Shiel, US Director for the Center for Civilians in Conflict. ""The recent airstrikes in the Caribbean are unlawful executions during peacetime, not war. Rep. Omar's leadership in forcing an end to these unlawful strikes is sorely needed. Everyone else in the House should join her.""

""The Trump administration appears intent on dragging the United States into war with Venezuela. Between the extrajudicial killings of Venezuelan citizens, the threat of drone strikes on Venezuelan soil, and the amassing of military equipment in the region, Trump has given lie to his claims of being 'anti-war' and aligned himself decisively with the neoconservative camp,"" said Alex Main, Director of International Policy at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""This follows years of efforts to enact regime change in Venezuela by other means, including through broad economic sanctions that have devastated the Venezuelan economy and fueled a humanitarian crisis, triggering the migration of millions of Venezuelans. We must be clear: a war with Venezuela would be catastrophic for both the people of Venezuela and the United States, while doing nothing to solve the drug crisis in our nation.""

“The American people, across the political spectrum, don’t want their tax dollars funding unauthorized regime change wars overseas,” said Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy. “Americans are grateful to Rep. Omar and others in Congress who insist on upholding the Constitution — war must be authorized by Congress after a debate and vote, not unilaterally dictated by the same neocon zealots responsible for peddling one disastrous regime change after another.”

On September 12, Louisiana-based immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled that foreign-born activist-agitator Mahmoud Khalil can be removed to either Algeria or Syria due to material omissions on his green card application. Although the decision will be appealed – further dragging out what should be a simple and quick process – the immigration judge’s ruling is consistent with America’s national interests, national security, and the law.

Khalil, of Palestinian origin, was born in Syria and raised between there and Lebanon. He also holds Algerian citizenship. In 2024, as a graduate student at Columbia University, he became a leading organizer of pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel protests and campus encampments that followed the October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks. This, according to DHS, created a climate of harassment and intimidation toward Jewish students at Columbia.

Originally arriving in the U.S. on a student visa in 2022 and obtaining a green card in 2024, Khalil was taken into custody by ICE in March at his apartment. The arrest was, as DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin explained, “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism” because Khalil had “led activities aligned [with] Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”

On March 10, referring to Khalil and others, President Trump warned in a Truth Social post that “[i]f you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.” The president was referring to Section 237(a)(1)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which states that “[a]n alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” From the moment of his arrest, however, anti-borders activists turned Khalil into a martyr and a symbol of an alleged attack against free speech.

The pro-Palestinian activist spent about three months in ICE custody in Louisiana until federal district judge Michael Farbiarz ordered his release on bail on June 20. But the litigation was far from over, with Judge Comans’ being the most recent chapter in the saga.

Rejecting three motions from Khalil’s lawyer, Judge Comans ruled that the activist intentionally committed fraud in his green card application by omitting important information about his political associations, thus rendering him deportable. Khalil specifically left out his work for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). As FAIR pointed out previously: “By its own admission, UNRWA employees participated in the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 and that the terror group used UNRWA facilities in Gaza to hold hostages who were taken captive in those attacks. CUAD was one of the leading groups behind the violent takeover of Hamilton Hall on Columbia’s campus last year as well as engaging in activities that denied Jewish students access to parts of the campus.”

“The evidence shows the Respondent knew of the potential immigration consequences for his involvement in protests organized by varying organizations on campus, including CUAD,” emphasized Judge Comans. Moreover, “[t]he waiver [requested by Khalil’s legal team] was not designed to reward a lack of candor by applicants admitted as immigrant visa holders who then intentionally engage in dishonesty by misrepresenting facts in the application process to adjust status, post entry.”

She further emphasized the foreign policy argument as well, stating that “[a]s previously found by this Court, the Immigration Judge lacks authority to question foreign policy determinations made by the U.S. Secretary of State,” but “[t]he Court finds this factor alone outweighs the positive equities in the Respondent’s case [such as Khalil having a young child], and the Court denies the waiver as a matter of discretion on that basis.” Other negative factors working against Khalil included in Judge Comans’ ruling were the fact that he holds no property or business interests in the U.S. and had held no other employment other than internships.

Khalil was thus ordered deported to Syria, where he emigrated from in 2022, or to Algeria, where he also holds citizenship due to his mother’s descent from anti-French revolutionaries in that country. The law (INA Section 241) makes it clear that the U.S. government has many options when it comes to removing deportable aliens, who cannot only be sent back to countries in which they hold citizenship or have previously resided but also to other nations willing to accept them.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/iStock-691789288.jpg.webp?itok=hRgeex2A,N,,2025-09-24 16:58:08.090278

As of September 15, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) confirmed that no individuals remain detained in provincial correctional facilities. Ontario had historically held the largest number of immigration detainees in provincial jails, drawing intensified scrutiny after a 2023 coroner’s inquest into the 2015 death of Abdurahman Hassan revealed concerning conditions within these facilities.

Human rights advocates welcomed the decision as a major victory. Samer Muscati, Disability Rights Deputy Director at Human Rights Watch, emphasized that Ontario’s move upholds the dignity and rights of people seeking safety in Canada and increases pressure on the federal government to end the broader system of rights-violating immigration detention. Similarly, Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section, noted that migrants deserve respect and safety, not incarceration, as they build new lives in Canada.

British Columbia had been the first province to end its immigration detention contract with the CBSA, setting an example for other provinces. The #WelcomeToCanada campaign, launched by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada in October 2021, alongside advocates, legal experts, healthcare providers, faith leaders, and people with lived experience, has consistently pushed for the closure of immigration detention facilities in provincial jails. More than 30,000 Canadians have written directly to authorities in support of this cause.

The practice of using provincial jails for immigration detention has been widely criticized for violating international human rights standards and harming mental health. Reports have highlighted that racialized individuals, particularly Black men, face harsher conditions and longer confinement periods, while people with disabilities experience systemic discrimination throughout the detention process. In recent years, UN bodies including the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have called on Canada to end immigration detention entirely and respect the rights of detainees.

Despite provincial progress, the federal government has moved in the opposite direction, opening a temporary designated immigrant detention facility in a federal prison at Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, in July 2025. Advocates urge Ottawa to follow the provinces’ lead by abolishing immigration detention, halting its expansion into federal prisons, and scaling up humane, community-based alternatives that respect human rights and Canada’s international obligations.",https://news.fundsforngos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:36.402718

Trump administration fires immigration judges, even as it seeks to hire more of them

The Trump administration fired nearly 20 immigration judges this month, following the dismissal of more than 80 judges earlier this year.

The dismissals come as the administration is seeking to add immigration judges by filling jobs with up to 600 military attorneys. The current backlog in the courts is nearly 4 million cases, NPR reports in its article on the latest firings.

Matt Biggs, the president of the union that represents immigration judges, said in a statement to NPR the dismissal of more judges “is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts.”

“At a time when the backlog has reached historic levels and the administration has made immigration enforcement a central issue, the removal of experienced judges is hypocritical, undermines the law, wastes taxpayer dollars and further delays justice for citizens and immigrants alike,” said Biggs, who is the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

The number of departing immigration judges swells when the dismissals are combined with voluntary resignations. The loss was more than 125 immigration judges in the last nine months, down from 700 judges at the start of the year, according to NPR.

In San Francisco, seven immigration judges have been fired as of Sept. 11, amounting to about one-third of the judges there, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Immigration judges preside in courts overseen by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. They decide whether noncitizens accused of violating immigration laws should be removed or granted protection from removal.

San Francisco immigration courts grant relief to immigrants in 71% of the cases, one of the highest rates among the nation’s largest courts, the article says.

Five of the seven judges fired in San Francisco grant relief at higher rates than their colleagues. One fired judge had the lowest rate of granting relief in the court.

Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, said in an August memo “statistically improbable outcome metrics” could indicate bias or failure to adhere to the law, warranting “close examination and potential action.”

Executive Office for Immigration Review leadership has also criticized judges for failing to manage their caseloads efficiently, according to NPR.

The suspect has been identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. The head of the FBI, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet found at the scene with the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release about the Dallas shooting.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

No ICE agents were injured.

‘Targeted violence’

At a news conference earlier in the day, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to travelers.

Officials call for end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside of the Dallas ICE facility every Monday, called the shooting heartbreaking.

“Violence doesn’t heal anything,” Sipe, a pastor in Lewisville near Dallas, told AP.

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and to report for check-ins.

Over the past couple of months, Sipe said she has noticed that people who walk into the building are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire July 4 outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside Mosqueda’s car.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions recently flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center.

Sixteen people have been arrested outside the center, according to federal authorities who characterized the activists as “rioters.”

The report by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology is based on data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in February. The data came from forms that immigration agents fill out when they send genetic information to an F.B.I. database of convicted criminals, missing persons and evidence from crime scenes.

The report’s authors argued that border agents were exceeding their authority with the collections, accusing them of violating U.S. citizens’ rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.

The report analyzed data from October 2020 to December 2024, a period covering a few months of the first Trump administration and most of the Biden administration. The researchers found that of the 2,000 Americans subjected to cheek swabs agents from Customs and Border Protection, more than 800 were not arrested or charged with a crime at the time.

Law enforcement officers in the United States are allowed to collect DNA from citizens arrested in connection with serious crimes.

The Georgetown report said that federal agents sending genetic information to the F.B.I. had provided “legally questionable, nonsensical, or altogether absent” justifications for collecting DNA samples.

Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection nor the F.B.I. responded to requests for comment overnight.

A February directive from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that federal agencies are required to collect DNA samples from Americans who were under arrest, facing charges or convicted, and from noncitizens in U.S. detention. The directive said that DNA collection by agency was a “routine booking measure parallel to fingerprinting.”

The authors of the Georgetown report said that data on DNA collection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during Mr. Trump’s second term was not yet available. They said they expected it to “reveal an even broader and more reckless approach” because of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/24/multimedia/24xp-dna-kfzc/24xp-dna-kfzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:15.352095

What is the H-1B visa?
Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.
The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.
H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts.","President Donald Trump announced that his administration will impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions. The new fee went into effect as of September 21, 2025, and will greatly impact employers’ ability to secure the highly educated foreign workers who come to the United States on the H-1B visa.

Employers will now be required to pay a one-time $100,000 fee per new petition. Previously, it cost employers between $2,000 to $5,000 per petition, depending on the size of the employer.

What is the H-1B visa?

The H-1B visa category allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to temporarily work in “specialty occupations.” These jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent and include positions like civil engineers, software developers, and researchers. Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.

Since creating the visa program in 1990, Congress has limited the number of H-1Bs made available each year. The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.

Who are H-1B workers?

H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts. The majority, however, (nearly 65%) had computer-related jobs as of 2023 data.

Over 70% of H-1B visa holders are Indian citizens. Though the move could lead to issues for U.S. businesses with Indian ties, the impact extends beyond the financial.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a response to President Trump’s new fee, stating that the measure will likely have “humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families.” The statement went on to say that the Indian government “hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the U.S. authorities.”

In the immediate aftermath of the fee announcement, families were left behind as H-1B visa holders scrambled to reach the United States before the fee went into effect, fearing they would be locked out of the country. Though the White House later clarified that the fee would not apply to existing visa holders, confusion had already gripped visa holders, their families, and the companies that employ them.

Some have canceled their plans to return to their home countries, believing that even a vacation is too risky right now.

How will U.S companies be impacted?

Some of the largest tech companies and top banks in the U.S. will be hit particularly hard by the change.

Amazon was the biggest sponsor of H-1B workers for fiscal year 2025, employing over 10,000 people with the visa, followed by other household names like Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Google, Cognizant Technology Solutions, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart.

Economists are already sounding the alarm that the astronomical fee will likely hurt the U.S. economy, resulting in a “brain drain” of qualified workers moving to other countries and slower economic growth overall.

Do H-1B workers take jobs from Americans?

No, they do not take jobs from U.S. workers. Before an employer can file a petition with USCIS, they must take specific steps to ensure that hiring an H-1B worker will not harm U.S. workers.

Employers first must attest, on a labor condition application certified by the Department of Labor, that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. They also must provide existing workers with notice that they plan to hire an H-1B worker.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-h1b-fee.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:56:55.855090

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson thanked the Dallas Police Department for its quick response to the shooting and urged people to “exercise a little bit of restraint” as authorities continued their investigation.

“Let’s be patient, let’s remain calm and let’s let our law enforcement partners, our police department do their job,” he said, adding there were “lots of unanswered questions” in the active investigation.

Here’s the latest on what we know.

Where and when did the Dallas shooting happen?

The Dallas Police Department responded to a call to assist an officer at the facility at about 6:40 a.m. local time, according to a social media post.

The preliminary investigation showed that a person had opened fire “from an adjacent building,” the post said. DHS later said a sniper “fired indiscriminately” from a nearby rooftop toward the ICE building, including at a van in a secured entryway where the victims were shot.

It is not yet clear if the suspect had an intended target.

Live news footage of the scene showed a phalanx of emergency vehicles around the facility, which sits alongside Interstate 35 East and is surrounded by restaurants and hotels.

What do we know about the suspect?

Authorities didn’t provide details about the suspect in Wednesday morning’s briefing and law enforcement is still working to isolate a motive for the shooting.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on X that he said were the unused bullet casings recovered at the scene. “ANTI-ICE” can be seen in blue writing on one of the casings in the photo.

“While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an idealogical [sic] motive behind this attack,” wrote Patel, who previously faced criticism for how he provided updates to the ongoing investigation into the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.

Authorities did not provide additional details about the weapon used in the attack.

With no motive yet determined, officials claim attack was fueled by hatred of ICE

Before Wednesday’s briefing on the shooting, Noem took to social media to acknowledge that details were still emerging, adding “we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them.”

Noem claimed in a later statement without providing evidence that this “vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE.”

The shooting in Dallas, she added, ought to be a “wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.”

Vice President JD Vance echoed the homeland security secretary’s sentiments.

“The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop,” Vance wrote on X. “I’m praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also called for a stop to rhetoric “demonizing ICE” and other immigration enforcement agencies.

“Violence is wrong,” the senator said. “Politically motivated violence is wrong.”

The Justice Department's attorneys described Abrego Garcia's claims as ""procedurally barred and meritless – even unserious.""

Abrego Garcia, who sued the government in Maryland in August to prevent his deportation to Uganda, now faces potential removal to Eswatini. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to pursue this course of action.

emphasized that immigration law restricts district court judges' authority to review deportation decisions.

Abrego Garcia is part of a nationwide class action certified in Massachusetts, where a preliminary injunction was granted to halt deportations to third countries.

Although the Supreme Court stayed this injunction, it maintained an order requiring DHS to offer class members a chance to seek protection under the Convention Against Torture.

Abrego Garcia has accused the government of violating the law by not honoring his request to be deported to Costa Rica, a country initially offered by the Trump administration in exchange for a guilty plea in his human smuggling case in Tennessee. He has expressed fear of torture or persecution in over 20 countries where the U.S. might deport him. The DOJ claims this indicates ""gamesmanship"" on his part.

The Trump administration argues that Abrego Garcia did not designate Costa Rica as his preferred destination in a timely manner, allowing the government to disregard his choice. Abrego Garcia's attorneys announced his intention to seek asylum in the U.S., although a previous asylum petition was denied due to his extended stay in the country.

Despite a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia remained in the U.S. due to a withholding granted by an immigration judge, barring deportation to El Salvador because of gang violence threats. He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, where he claimed torture in CECOT prison, before being returned to the U.S. to face federal charges related to a migrant smuggling scheme. He has pleaded not guilty.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia's removal in August, will hear the government's motion for dismissal. Xinis has criticized the Trump administration's handling of the case but acknowledged her jurisdictional limits over immigration matters.

In Tennessee, Abrego Garcia's attorneys have requested the dismissal of criminal charges against him, citing vindictive prosecution.

The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot. Three detainees were shot. Two are deceased, and the other is in critical condition. The gunman was found with a self-inflicted gun wound.

“Our prayers are with the families of those killed and our ICE law enforcement. This vile attack was motivated by hatred for ICE,” said Secretary Noem. “For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences.

Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.
In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes.
Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.
In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.","A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.

Roughly $530 million of the $1.19 billion allocated to Northwest tribal nations in fiscal year 2024 — used to fulfill the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Native American and Alaska Native tribes — is at risk of being cut. The congressionally allocated funds serve myriad functions for tribes in the Northwest, including providing clean drinking water, affordable housing, schools, transit and land management. Funding is decided by Congress on a yearly basis and can be disbursed over a period of time that exceeds the calendar year it is allocated.

“All across the board tribes are worried about the funding cuts that are happening right now,” said Serina Fast Horse, who is Lakota and Blackfeet and serves as the co-director of the Northwest Environmental Justice Center, which provides grant application assistance and advising to Indigenous communities in the Northwest.

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education. The report warns of vulnerabilities to programs and grants that tribes rely on for resilience in the face of climate change, like improving home weatherization, managing forestland and renovating aging homes. Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.

The Portland State report found millions in Clean Air Act funding could also go away — the Environmental Protection Agency earmarked nearly $2 million in 2024 for Northwest tribes in a series of grants for monitoring air quality and pollution. Much of the congressionally allocated funding has yet to be distributed to tribes and is now at risk of being cut altogether.

The report demonstrates how proposed major reductions across the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, could reverberate across Indian Country.

Tribal officials shared concerns that drastic cuts could cause the federal government to fall short of trust and treaty obligations that mandate the federal government support tribal services, uphold tribal sovereignty and protect tribal treaty resources — responsibilities that courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld.

“All the funding reductions addressing clean water, air and dealing with climate change have impacts on the Tribes’ culture and treaty protected resources,” said William E. Ray Jr., chair of the Klamath Tribes.

Researchers declined to disclose specific projects at risk of elimination for fear of retaliation, and a number of tribes and tribal organizations declined to comment to InvestigateWest, citing similar concerns.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans are wreaking havoc on Tribal communities with their ‘Big, Ugly BETRAYAL’ of a law that arbitrarily cuts many programs supporting folks in Indian Country, where chronic underfunding is already impacting services and exacerbating disparities,” said Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat.

He added that the federal government plays an outsized role in funding essential services to tribal communities, including health care, education and public safety, and that the Inflation Reduction Act took important steps in advancing funding for water infrastructure and environmental programs for tribes.

In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Tulalip Tribes are some of the Native American nations set to receive research grants for improving air quality and pollution monitoring. Among 12 tribes selected for funding, several of them focus on minimizing exposure to poor air quality and harmful pollutants to their elderly and medically vulnerable residents. Other tribes intend to study impacts of pollutants on important first foods — culturally significant staple foods consumed before colonization — that officials say are critical to improving health outcomes for their citizens.

Researchers at PSU examined 469 programs impacted by President Trump’s reversal of former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which sought to address climate change and created a number of environmental justice initiatives. Sixty of the programs identified by researchers were specifically named in the Republican-led spending bill for cuts, and 17 of those provided funding directly to tribes. The programs accounted for roughly 35% of all federal investments in tribes in 2024. The report says not all of the funding will be cut, but a significant portion of it could be.

The cuts come at a time when Native Americans and Alaska Natives already have limited access to federal services and funds, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog. It found when tribes had to compete with other entities for federal funding, they may receive a small portion of the total amount, and that limited access to federal services and funds contributes to known disparities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives compared to other Americans.

Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.

Other programs at risk of being cut include the EPA’s embattled Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program, which funded initiatives by states, tribes and local governments to support activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health impacts.

Under that program, in 2023, the EPA awarded the Tulalip Tribes $977,000 to work in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation to create a tool to detect which homes are at greatest risk from wildfire smoke infiltration and dangerously hot weather, which are growing issues affecting both communities.

While the federal government has repeatedly affirmed its obligations to tribes, actual allocations remain disproportionately small compared to population figures. In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.

Between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the bounds of Idaho, Washington and Oregon received roughly $2.81 billion in federal investments in energy and environmental infrastructure, which represents roughly 14% of the $20 billion in allocations made to tribes nationwide.

The researchers determined that programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 climate, health and tax law, are at particular risk of being eliminated. The funding allocated to tribes under the IRA represented a historic investment in infrastructure in Indian Country, more than doubling energy and infrastructure investment from $1.51 billion nationwide to $3.94 billion in 2024, around .04% of total federal grant spending obligations for 2024.

“When you put them in the context of how much money the federal government actually spends on certain things, it’s pennies on the dollar,” said Sophie Lalande, a co-author of the PSU report.

Soon after taking office and without consulting Congress, the Trump administration suspended some grants that tribal communities used heavily, such as community change grants, distributed by the EPA's Offices of Environmental Justice and of External Civil Rights Compliance during the Biden administration, to support climate resilience and clean energy. Distributed as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the grants were suspended as part of the Trump administration's anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

The grants helped tribal communities in the Northwest tremendously, according to Fast Horse.

“They were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities for infrastructure improvements, like access to clean drinking water and climate resilience hubs, just really essential pieces of community development for health and safety of communities,” she said.

The report stresses a multiplier effect from investments made in tribal communities. Infrastructure dollars invested on tribal lands often serve as anchors for broader local development, since tribal lands often share regional infrastructure like power grids, roads or water systems with non-Native communities, with the power of dollars rippling outward into surrounding rural towns and cities.

Bobby Cochran, a researcher with Portland State University and senior project manager at the National Policy Consensus Center, co-authored the report.

Following his Tuesday speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump declared that Ukraine could regain land lost to Russia, suggesting that Moscow was actually a “paper tiger.” The shift in perspective surprised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and drew ire from Russia.

The permit limits the number of detainees Ice can hold at the facility each day to fewer than 15, and the duration for which they can be held, to less than 12 hours.
A small group of Portland residents have protested outside the Ice facility for more than 100 consecutive days, and an online petition calling on the city to revoke a permit has garnered nearly 18,000 signatures since February.
According to Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, the city opened a preliminary investigation in July after it received multiple formal complaints about potential violations at the facility.
In August 2011, a hearings officer initially denied the local conditional use credential needed for Ice to operate its facility.","Portland authorities are in a standoff with Donald Trump’s administration over an Ice detention facility in the Oregon city, after an investigation found the administration is using the facility for overnight detentions, in violation of its city-issued permits.

The standoff comes amid threats from Donald Trump to dispatch troops to the city, and residents protesting nightly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in question.

The city office that oversees land use and zoning notified the owner of the building that Ice leases on 18 September that the federal agency had violated a conditional use permit approved in 2011. The permit limits the number of detainees Ice can hold at the facility each day to fewer than 15, and the duration for which they can be held, to less than 12 hours. The permit also bars the agency from “housing” anyone overnight.

But Ice data the city obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, included in the official notice, shows 25 instances since January in which Ice held a person for more than 12 hours. On 26 January alone, agents held 16 people – listed as citizens of Venezuela, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and other countries – for over 27 hours before transferring them, according to public records obtained by Street Roots and the Guardian.

The city’s notice also said the building was illegally altered when exterior windows were boarded up without proper approval. An Ice spokesperson did not respond to a question asking when the wood was installed, but photos and video taken at protests and posted on social media show the boarded up windows first appeared around 16 June.

The field office in southwest Portland sits two blocks from the Willamette river, across the street from an affordable housing complex and next door to a K-8 school that moved in August, citing the dangers of federal agents’ response to protests with teargas and pepper balls as the reason for the move.

A small group of Portland residents have protested outside the Ice facility for more than 100 consecutive days, and an online petition calling on the city to revoke a permit has garnered nearly 18,000 signatures since February.

According to Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, the city opened a preliminary investigation in July after it received multiple formal complaints about potential violations at the facility. The city sent official notice after substantiating those complaints.

Wilson said in a video statement last week that Ice has the opportunity to remedy the infractions before penalties are imposed, but placed the responsibility squarely at the feet of the federal government.

“We must remember this review was triggered by the federal government breaking promises to our community regarding the detention of human beings,” Wilson said.

The building’s landlord has 30 days to correct the violations, but if it fails to comply, the city will assess a monthly fee. Ice is allowed to continue operations as the process continues.

While the city cannot simply revoke any permit outright, the notice of violation is the first step in a process that could provide some level of accountability for the federal government’s operations in Portland.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said the mayor’s claim was based solely on records obtained by the city without an effort to verify facts with Ice, and claimed without evidence that the mayor is preventing Ice agents from removing criminals.

“Another day, another sanctuary politician attempting to prevent the brave men and women of ICE from removing the worst of the worst, including rapists, murderers, pedophiles, and gang members from the U.S.,” McLaughlin said in an email. “Mayor Wilson’s claims of substandard conditions at ICE facilities are categorically FALSE. All detainees receive proper meals, medical care, and access to family and legal counsel.”

DHS declined to offer evidence to substantiate McLaughlin’s claims.

Federal immigration data made available by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac) shows that, as of 7 September, over 70% of Ice detainees have no criminal conviction, and many who do were convicted of minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The Portland mayor’s office declined to respond to McLaughlin’s comments.

In August 2011, a hearings officer initially denied the local conditional use credential needed for Ice to operate its facility. But the city council adjudicated the matter on appeal, and unanimously approved it despite concerns raised in public testimony during the initial hearing. Local residents worried about the possibility that immigration-related protests could occur in the neighborhood, and that the safety plan – including how many and for how long people can be detained – might not be enforceable.

The local land use investigation is not the first time Portland has clashed with the second Trump administration, and at times Wilson has uneasily acceded to Trump’s demands.

In July, Wilson issued an executive order directing city employees to align with Trump’s executive order revoking federal diversity, equity and inclusion policies, preserving $380m in federal funding that could have been at risk if city policy did not align with Trump’s new reading of federal anti-discrimination laws.

Portland was among dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions – including the state of Oregon – that received letters from the US justice department in August, threatening federal action if it did not alter its sanctuary policies.

Earlier this month, Trump told reporters he was considering sending the national guard to Portland, citing a TV news report which mixed images from the city’s mass protests in 2020 with images from the current small protests at the local Ice facility.

“Like other mayors across the country, I have not asked for – and do not need – federal intervention,” Wilson said in response to Trump’s threat. “Portland will continue to rise to the moment as a proud sanctuary city, taking legal action to stand up for our community and our rights.”

Last week, Trump doubled down on his threat to send troops to Portland.

A recovered, unspent shell casing was engraved with the phrase ""ANTI ICE"", said FBI director Kash Patel.

Multiple rounds were fired just before 7am local time, Mr Patel said.

An initial review of evidence shows an ""ideological motive behind this attack"", he added, describing the assault as ""despicable"".

The ""whole of government"" will respond, Mr Rothrock said.

""There will be no resource not utilised to bring all those individuals who are responsible to justice and to hold them accountable.""

No police officers had been hurt, Mr Rothrock added.

The victims were being led into the building to be processed and repatriated, Fox News reported, citing Dallas police Department sources.

Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said the shooting would ""NOT slow our arrest, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants"".

He added: ""We will work with ICE and the Dallas Police Department to get to the bottom of the assassin's motive.""

Go deeper: Multiple injured in shooting at Dallas ICE facility","Top Trump administration officials and MAGA world personalities quickly blamed Wednesday's shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on anti-law enforcement rhetoric.

The big picture: The rush to point fingers before local police confirmed a motive or the identity of the victims mirrors the rush to assign blame following Charlie Kirk's death, and reflects the fears of rising political violence in America.

What they're saying: ""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X.

Vice President JD Vance reposted Noem's message, adding, ""the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.""

The White House singled out Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) for recently comparing ICE to ""slave patrols"" in a post on X Wednesday afternoon.

""It's rhetoric like this that leads to violence — and it MUST STOP,"" the White House wrote. Crockett's office did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

Of note: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott characterized the shooter as an ""assassin"" in a post on X.

""This assassination will NOT slow our arrest, detention, & deportation of illegal immigrants,"" he added.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said his office will continue to ""combat the alarming increase of targeted attacks against ICE and all law enforcement by evil, twisted individuals.""

The other side: Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote on X that he was ""immensely grateful"" for the first responders.

""I'm praying for the victims and their families. This kind of violence has no place in our democracy,"" he wrote.

Driving the news: Preliminary information indicates that a sniper fired shots into the ""secure detainee location"" of the facility, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told CNN early Wednesday.

Law enforcement confirmed in a midday press conference that multiple people were shot, and two, including the shooter, are dead.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that the people shot were ICE detainees, and that no officers were involved in the shooting.

The intrigue: The Department of Homeland Security slammed the ""media, leftist groups and sanctuary politicians"" for ""hateful rhetoric"" in a press release last week.

The release referenced two DHS agents who were assaulted in the line of duty in recent months, and encouraged the country to ""turn down the temperature before someone else is killed.""

Zoom in: Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson urged the public to hold off on drawing any conclusions about the shooter and their motive in a press conference on Wednesday morning.

""There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and I want to encourage all of you to exercise a little bit of restraint and allow them to do their job to help make sure this continues to be a safe city,"" Johnson said.

Later in the conference, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) added that the violence ""needs to stop"" and warned that America's ""divisive rhetoric"" has ""real consequences.""

Zoom out: Some prominent MAGA figures more directly blamed Democrats for the shooting.

In a post on X, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) questioned if the shooter was a member of ""antifa,"" or ""another psycho that has been brainwashed"" by Democrats and the media.

Conservative podcaster Benny Johnson blamed leftists for violence, citing celebrations of Charlie Kirk's death, people vandalizing a memorial for Kirk and the August shooting at a Minneapolis church that killed two and injured 18.

The president has said his “blitz” on Chicago is meant to make the city safer for its residents.

But the rush of federal immigration agents into the area has stoked fears and upended routines — and the results haven’t decisively proven the federal government’s claim that it’s arresting “the worst of the worst” criminals.

After a chaotic few weeks, here’s more on what has happened so far, where things stand and what could come next.

How long will this immigration operation last?

President Donald Trump’s administration has not said how long it plans to continue its deportation campaign in the Chicago area.

The Chicago Sun-Times has reported the operation could last at least through the end of September. But the federal government’s plans have constantly changed. And Trump’s continued on-and-off threats to deploy National Guard troops to the city have left those plans unclear.

How many people have been arrested?

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said this week that 550 people have been taken into custody in the Chicago area during the September operation.

But that figure can’t be verified because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials haven’t released comprehensive arrest data since January. Other groups that obtain and publish immigration enforcement records only have data through the end of July.

ICE has said that it’s arresting “the worst of the worst” in its Chicago-area campaign and named dozens of immigrants who have been taken into custody. Some of those arrested here have violent criminal histories, including a man convicted of murder who served decades in jail and another who sexually abused a child. Others were previously deported from the country.

But a Sun-Times analysis found some were arrested in other states, and about half of the names and alleged charges released by Homeland Security couldn’t be definitively matched to court records.

How and where have arrests happened?

Largely following a playbook they first used in Los Angeles earlier this year, federal immigration authorities have increasingly used more aggressive tactics in the Chicago area over the past few weeks, both during arrests and in response to protests.

ICE officers started the deportation campaign this month by arresting a small number of people in public places, such as a flower vendor in a parking lot on the Southwest Side.

Then ICE started conducting traffic stops in the city and suburbs — one of which saw a federal agent shoot and kill a man in Northwest Suburban Franklin Park. Videos obtained by the Sun-Times have since revealed new details that depart from the DHS narrative after that shooting.

They’ve also gone after immigrants at their workplaces, and public spaces such as outside Home Depot stores where people are waiting for manual labor jobs.

In a major escalation led by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Mexican Independence Day, Border Patrol agents in a militarized vehicle and fatigues busted into an Elgin house in the early morning hours. They arrested four men and briefly detained two more, including one who was a U.S. citizen.

What are the impacts?

The federal operations have caused widespread fear in city and suburban immigrant communities.

People have changed their habits in some cases, such as staying home from work or skipping doctor appointments.

Some parents have had their older children or neighbors walk younger siblings to and from school because ICE sightings have been reported at school pickup and dropoff times.

The service industry has helped mitigate risk, too. Some barbershops have started giving haircuts at people’s private residences and grocery stores have offered home deliveries.

Immigration advocacy organizations that run a legal hotline are receiving 250-400 calls per day in September, according to a spokesman for the The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. That’s the highest call volume this year and has led the groups to hire more operators.

The operation, meanwhile, has created opportunities for the Trump administration to demonstrate the aggressiveness of its operation to the president’s political base. Trump and the DHS have posted social media videos styled after action movies showing raids and arrests throughout the Chicago area.

What have protests been like?

There have been plenty of demonstrations in downtown Chicago and some suburbs, most of which have remained peaceful.

People have also gathered outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, where immigration authorities take immigrants who have been arrested.

That’s where confrontations have increased in intensity. Protesters have tried to block an entrance to a parking lot to disrupt ICE operations.

In return, ICE and Border Patrol agents have started using tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, some of whom have been struck by pepper balls or exposed to gas without warning. Agents have also shoved protesters, including a congressional candidate. Some protesters have thrown objects or slashed tires on ICE vehicles.

What do we know about the conditions in ICE facilities?

Federal authorities haven’t let out much information about their immigration facilities — even to elected officials — so the full picture of the conditions inside is unclear.

But people who were detained in the Broadview facility have described troubling conditions.

Gladis Yolanda Chavez Pineda, a Honduran woman detained in June, said she stayed in “inhumane” conditions at the facility for four days and was one of 30 women held in a room with no beds, no blankets and little food.

Rosalio Pelayo Salgado, a Mexican man arrested in September, said he was kept in a room with 150 people, where they were called slurs and only given food and water for good behavior. He was at Broadview for at least a week.

One way to learn more about conditions in a detention center would be through inspection records published by ICE. But that doesn’t include the Broadview facility because it’s technically not a detention center.

It’s supposed to only be a place where people are processed into detention after they’re arrested. An Illinois law prohibits the feds from operating immigration detention facilities in the state, so ICE isn’t supposed to keep people at Broadview for long.

The Sun-Times and WBEZ continue to ask for more information from officials and families of those who are detained.

How have politicians reacted?

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have forcefully slammed Trump’s immigration enforcement as a scare tactic targeting immigrant communities. They’ve said his National Guard threats are unconstitutional and have threatened legal action. Johnson recently accused Trump of “auditioning to become a dictator,” while Pritzker compared Trump’s policies to the “early days of Nazi Germany.”

Other Democrats in federal, state and local office have condemned Trump, too. And some, including many running for Congress, have shown up to protests outside ICE’s Broadview facility.

The three Republican members of the Illinois congressional delegation, meanwhile, have all voiced support for Trump’s efforts, especially Rep. Mary Miller, who has been an outspoken critic of Pritzker and the state’s sanctuary policies.

Have there been legal challenges?

There have been mixed results on the legal front.

A federal judge in Chicago this summer tossed a lawsuit brought by Trump’s Justice Department seeking to invalidate sanctuary laws in Chicago and Illinois that help protect immigrants.

Pritzker and Johnson have said they will sue, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom did, if Trump sends the National Guard troops to Chicago. But while a lower-court judge has sided with Newsom, appellate judges in California have been deferential to Trump.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed federal agents to continue stopping people based on race, language and other factors in California amid the same immigration campaign that expanded into Chicago, called “Operation At Large.”

In Chicago, there have been individual lawsuits filed by people who have been detained since these operations began. But litigation aimed at the broader campaign has yet to materialize.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c514b2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+215/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F06%2Faf%2F808b476d47beb78df48fa4508a22%2Fbroadview-092325-14.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 12:57:35.800825

On August 6, journalists from Fox News embedded with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents for the now infamous “Trojan Horse” raid on a Home Depot in Los Angeles. Their exclusive report opens from inside a Penske truck (rented against company policy) as agents burst out and detain 16 undocumented immigrants lured there by the offer of work.

Two days later, a different set of journalists were injured and arrested by Los Angeles law enforcement officers while reporting on protests against that and other immigration raids in the area.

The contrast illustrates the dilemma media organizations face as the Trump administration escalates its crackdown on a free press: get safe access to events as they’re happening but run the risk of compromising basic standards of journalistic integrity, or do the challenging work of reporting—potentially putting one’s body on the line.

More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook

The report from Fox follows a trend. Journalists from that network, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, the New York Post, and Newsmax have all embedded with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP operations over the past nine months under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), giving the operations a publicity boost while leaving key claims about DHS enforcement policies unquestioned.

At the same time, the government has violently cracked down on journalists covering ICE raids and protests against DHS operations, with federal agents and local law enforcement officers seriously injuring reporters in Los Angeles as the Trump administration has pursued a broad-based immigration and civil liberties assault in and around the city. In mid-July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that videotaping ICE officers doing their work is an act of “violence,” and in August a spokesperson for DHS told the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) that making videos of ICE agents at work and posting them online is “doxing” and will be prosecuted.

Using embedded reporters has allowed DHS to shape its own narrative about what it wants Americans to hear—that the department is only targeting the “worst of the worst” immigrants who have committed violent crimes, even though they rarely provide supporting evidence.

Among recent examples of embedded reporting on ICE by these major news outlets:

On September 9, Fox News reporters embedded with an ICE raid in Chicago called “Midway Blitz.” The footage shows ICE agents piling on top of a Mexican man who Fox reported had been charged with assault and felony re-entry to the U.S. At the end of May, Fox News reporter Bill Melugin joined ICE agents in Boston as they made a broad sweep in which they touted the arrest of a Salvadoran immigrant who allegedly was convicted of child rape, along with a fugitive allegedly wanted for murder and kidnapping. Fox reporters also rode along with ICE agents in Maryland last December (before Trump took office), in Boston in January, in Colorado in April, in Florida in May, and in Connecticut in August. In its reporting on each operation, Fox dutifully reinforces DHS messaging that ICE is only rounding up “egregious criminal alien offenders” who endanger American citizens.

In December 2024, NBC reporter Gabe Gutierrez rode along with now-acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, who at the time was the agency’s assistant director of field operations. The report voluntarily blurred ICE agents’ faces, and granted anonymity to two ICE officials who claimed that the agency was facing a $230 million shortfall, an amount that NBC did not appear to independently verify. Gutierrez did not challenge or ask follow-up questions when Lyons claimed that sanctuary states and cities put ICE agents at risk.

Rachel Scott from ABC embedded with ICE agents and Secretary Noem in March as they raided a home in Virginia to arrest an immigrant who had allegedly been charged with sexual battery and who had re-entered the U.S. illegally after being deported twice. They also detained another undocumented relative in the house who was ordered to report to ICE in 48 hours after he had placed two minor children who are American citizens with other family members.

In July, CBS’s Camilo Montoya-Galvez tagged along with ICE agents in Maryland, where ICE arrested an Ethiopian man who had purportedly been prosecuted for second-degree rape. CBS repeated a DHS claim that there had been an 800 percent increase in violence against ICE officers. A few days later, a DHS spokesperson told CMD that that number had risen to “1,000 percent” but refused to provide any data to support that claim. CBS host Tony Dokoupil reported in the segment that “people on the far left think that everyone should be able to stay,” without providing any corroborating evidence for that misleading generalization.

Reporters for The New York Times’ popular podcast The Daily embedded with an ICE raid in early June. While the podcast raised major concerns and questions about the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, it is unclear whether reporters independently verified that the prime target of the operation, an immigrant named Jerlien Iswola Rivera, had actually committed sexual battery on a minor.

In January, reporters from the New York Post joined a team of ICE agents in Chicago to “arrest criminal illegal migrants,” as they put it, but arrested only two Venezuelan nationals despite the efforts of roughly 100 agents to round up more deportees. The Post article blames a “left-wing ecosystem” of “local activists, legislators and school administrators” for helping immigrants evade ICE. It also rehashes the DHS narrative that its agents are the victims of this resistance in a city it vilifies as a sanctuary space.

None of these news organizations responded to questions from CMD about whether they independently verified DHS claims about the people who were detained in these operations, nor can CMD find evidence of follow-up reporting about the specific individuals affected by the operations.

Kelly McBride, senior vice president and chair of the Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, said that embedded journalism raises concerns, especially if statements made by government officials go unchallenged or uninvestigated.

“There’s no way you get a full and accurate picture of what ICE is doing in an embed. There’s just no way,” McBride said. “The question is: What’s the journalistic purpose of the story you’re trying to tell? And what is the value of the material you get out of the embed?”

Footage is a major motivator for broadcast news organizations, McBride argued. “For TV it’s to get footage, but that can be very irresponsible. That footage is very powerful and can misrepresent the totality of the picture.”

McBride placed particular emphasis on the need for news organizations to verify claims made by government officials.

“Any information that law enforcement provides needs to be verified,” she said. “If they say they arrested this person, where are the records of that arrest? If they say this person has a prior charge, where are those charges documented? Who can you talk to … to find out more information about that crime?”

McBride explains that embeds must be placed in the context of being able to develop a more complete picture of law enforcement operations as a whole—that the embed itself shouldn’t constitute the entire story. “I’m not going to say never ever go on an embed,” she added, pointing out that “you might be able to develop relationships with ICE officers.” As a former police reporter, she says she “used to go on ride-alongs all the time, but it was to [find and develop new] sources.”

“Not telling the [full] story is not an option,” McBride concluded. “As a journalist you do not want to be a mouthpiece for the government. Whatever you portray the government saying, you have to be able to [substantiate it]—to tell your audience that we believe this is true, or we believe this is a distortion, or we believe this is not true.”

While ICE has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of a 1,000 percent increase in violence against its officers, there is extensive documentation of government officials using violence against immigrant detainees. Earlier in August, a report from U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) found 510 credible reports of human rights violations in immigration detentions since Trump retook office on January 20, 2025.

The administration has repeatedly misled the public about prior claims of detaining only “the worst of the worst” migrants charged with criminal behavior. When 238 ICE detainees were deported to an infamous supermax prison in El Salvador in March, officials claimed they were mostly gang members, murderers, and rapists. But a review by Bloomberg News found that 90 percent of the men deported without due process had no criminal record other than minor traffic or immigration offenses. NPR found that one-third of the 177 Venezuelans who were initially held at the U.S.’s notorious Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba and then flown back to Venezuela in February had no criminal record. And an analysis by FactCheck.org concluded that more than a third of the 600,000 immigrants border czar Tom Homan claimed were violent criminals only had histories of traffic or immigration offenses.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23575/download/Cunningham-Cook-DHS%20embeds%20092425%20teaser.png?cb=2519ce382741f7a422e81032a21c4dfb&w=923,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:41.777692

How The New Immigration Rule Changes The H-1B Lottery Under the current system, U.S.
Although the proposed rule retains a lottery, it differs significantly from the current system.
He disputes the central premise of the proposed rule, that higher wage levels in the DOL system equate to higher skill and greater economic value.
However, under the proposed rule, someone at Level I would see their selection chances drop to only 15.29%.","The Trump administration has proposed a new immigration rule to change the H-1B selection process to favor people in senior positions. The new method uses “weighting” to fulfill a longstanding goal of Trump officials to hinder or prevent recent international students from gaining H-1B status. The proposed rule, which is subject to a 30-day comment period, is likely to be challenged in court on the grounds that U.S. immigration law does not permit selecting H-1B petitions based on salary or seniority.

The changes, if implemented, will take the U.S. immigration system further away from the goal expressed by Donald Trump in 2024, when he said international students should stay and work in the United States after graduating from U.S. universities. Analysts say this indicates that Trump is not closely involved in immigration policy, and White House and agency staff are pursuing their own agendas.

The latest move follows a presidential proclamation that imposed a $100,000 fee on the entry of H-1B visa holders. During the Oval Office signing ceremony, staff assured Trump that U.S. companies favored the $100,000 fee. However, interviews with attorneys did not find major companies that communicated prior support for the policy. Instead, many companies scrambled to bring employees back to the United States so they would not be barred from the country or subject to the fee.

H-1B temporary visas are important because they are typically the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work long term in the United States and later gain permanent residence (a green card). The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with a 20,000 exemption for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. university. At U.S. universities, international students account for 73% of full-time graduate students in electrical and computer engineering. Under U.S. law, in addition to government fees often exceeding $5,000, employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. A large body of research has concluded that H-1B visa holders are paid the same or higher than comparable U.S. professionals (i.e., people with similar degrees and experience).

How The New Immigration Rule Changes The H-1B Lottery

Under the current system, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services conducts a lottery when it receives more H-1B registrations than the 85,000 annual limit. Although the proposed rule retains a lottery, it differs significantly from the current system. Under the current system, all registrants have an equal chance of being selected for an H-1B petition. However, under the proposed rule, USCIS would employ the four Department of Labor salary levels used for prevailing wage determinations to “weight” the lottery in favor of individuals holding positions that require more experience.

The proposed rule would give registrants who are offered a position that corresponds to a Level IV salary four chances to be selected, a Level III registrant three chances, a Level II registrant two chances and a Level I registrant one chance. (A July 21, 2025, Forbes article discussed the likelihood the rule would use “weighting” based on the DOL system.)

“The method chosen to rank H-1B petitions does not measure skill level, as the proposed rule implies, but is a Department of Labor tool to divide job classifications based on the experience and related factors needed to perform in the position,” according to a new National Foundation for American Policy analysis of the proposed rule.

Immigration attorneys agree that the DOL’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics is a bad fit for the H-1B selection process. “The Department of Labor’s OEWS wage levels are designed as a job classification tool that reflects the amount of experience, supervision and responsibility required for a position, not an assessment of whether the worker is ‘highly skilled’ or ‘less skilled,’” said Vic Goel of Goel & Anderson in an interview. “A Level I role is simply an entry-level version of the occupation, while Level IV is a senior-level position requiring greater judgment and independence.”

Goel said USCIS used these DOL levels for purposes they were never intended. He disputes the central premise of the proposed rule, that higher wage levels in the DOL system equate to higher skill and greater economic value. “USCIS used its framing to justify weighting the lottery in favor of Level III and IV beneficiaries. Wage levels don’t correspond to skill in the way USCIS suggests, and instead they correspond to how DOL has structured job progression for prevailing wage purposes.”

According to Goel, the two systems are incompatible because the DOL wage levels are only focused on ensuring that employer pay for foreign nationals is fair relative to the job requirements. “USCIS lottery weighting attempts to twist those same levels into a proxy for ‘skill’ and ‘best and brightest,’” he said.

The New Immigration Rule Produces Significantly Different H-1B Lottery Outcomes

Critics point out a significant shortcoming of the weighting system in the proposed rule is that it establishes, for H-1B selection purposes, that foreign nationals paid a Level IV wage are four times more valuable to the United States than people paid a Level I wage, or twice as beneficial as someone paid at a Level II wage, without evidence in the proposed rule to support this contention. Employers and attorneys argue that the four DOL wage levels primarily consider an individual's current level of experience in the labor market, not their talent or potential contributions. DOL lists employees at Level IV as people who “generally have management and/or supervisory responsibilities.”

As a practical matter, the proposed rule makes it much more likely that a U.S. company could hire foreign-born senior managers on H-1B petitions than promising recent international students graduating from U.S. universities with degrees in a field such as artificial intelligence. Analysts say shifting the H-1B selection using a Department of Labor salary scale that identifies the amount of experience to fill a position changes the country’s talent acquisition policy toward mid-career professionals rather than encouraging companies to foster more innovation within the United States.

As the NFAP analysis notes, the percentage change in the probability of being selected in the H-1B lottery may be the best indicator of the rule’s impact. Under the proposed rule, the probability of USCIS selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B petition would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. The probability of USCIS selecting an H-1B petition would increase by 55% for individuals at Level III and by 3% for individuals at Level II.

Another way to compare the current and proposed systems: Currently, individuals at all four salary levels have a 29.59% chance of being selected for an H-1B petition, according to USCIS. However, under the proposed rule, someone at Level I would see their selection chances drop to only 15.29%. In comparison, individuals at Level IV would see the probability of being selected surge to 61.16%. Individuals at Level III would see their opportunity of being selected increase to 45.87% under the proposed rule, and H-1B registrants at Level II would experience a slight increase to 30.58%.

The National Foundation for American Policy discovered an error in calculations in Tables 13 and 14 of the proposed rule that resulted in USCIS understating the negative impact of the new system on individuals at Level I and the benefit the proposed rule provides to individuals at Level III and Level IV. (Table 13, line F was incorrectly calculated.) After correcting for the USCIS error, NFAP found that, compared to the current system, individuals at Level I would receive 11,518 fewer H-1B selections, while people at Level IV would gain 4,426 more, Level III would receive 5,528 more H-1B selections and Level II would get an additional 1,564.

The more USCIS gears H-1B selection against Level I, the fewer international students are likely to gain H-1B status. An examination of data on 170 F-1 students from the law firm Curran, Berger & Kludt, provided to NFAP, found 53% of international students were paid at level I and 37% were paid at Level II (i.e., 90% combined) in applications for H-1B cap selection from FY 2018 through FY 2021. A survey of international graduate students at U.S. universities conducted by the Institute for Progress and NAFSA: Association of International Educators found “53% of respondents said they would not have enrolled in the first place if access to H-1B was determined by Wage Levels.”

Legal Challenges Expected To The Immigration Rule

The proposed rule to change the H-1B lottery, like many other Trump administration policies, is expected to be challenged in court. The Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to finalize a similar rule in 2021. Comments made to that rule, which used a different mechanism to shift H-1B selection toward individuals paid at Level III and Level IV, asserted that it violated U.S. immigration law.

“Congress spoke directly and clearly by stating that H-1B petitions were subject to a numerical limit and would be considered not by order of skill or wage levels, by relative value to the U.S. economy, or by any other prioritizing criterion other than filing order,” according to a comment signed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association and other organizations. “This is unambiguous in the statute where the INA establishes that consideration for an H-1B visa or status ‘shall’ be ‘in the order in which petitions are filed.’” The Compete America Coalition, FWD.us, NAFSA, National Immigration Forum, TechNet, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others also signed the comment.

In January 2019, DHS established by regulation the H-1B registration system. When a commenter suggested the Trump administration prioritize H-1B petitions based on salary or other criteria, officials responded that it would be unlawful under U.S. immigration law: “DHS believes, however, that prioritization of selection on other bases such as those suggested by the commenters would require statutory changes.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b9e6a6c908553e9aa5344b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-24 12:57:39.824299

Three weeks ago, federal and state agents conducted an immigration raid at a multi-billion-dollar Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Georgia and detained some 475 workers. About 300 of these workers were South Korean citizens. 14 were from China, Japan, and Indonesia. Another 145 were from Mexico and other Latin American countries.

As has become common in such ICE operations, the raid involved masked men and firearms in an aggressive show of force. In South Korea, the public has been outraged at the site of shackled workers “perp walked” before cameras and held in prison-like conditions. The South Korean government chartered a plane that transported 316 Koreans and 14 others from the various Asian countries to Seoul and has commenced a human rights investigation to assess ICE treatment of its citizens.

Some observers initially saw this as a purposeful strategy to target several groups at once, including undocumented immigrants, the electric vehicle sector, and potentially political opponents like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (who refused to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results in his state).

Subsequent developments suggest that the Trump administration actually sees the operation as a mistake, an “own goal” that inadvertently undermines the administration’s stated efforts to revive American manufacturing. Christopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state, even expressed deep regret over the detainment of Korean citizens. Although ICE officials have framed this as an instance of companies breaking the law and giving away jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, it seems as though the Korean workers were here temporarily to help install equipment at the battery plant and train American workers and that the project is creating American jobs. Many workers reportedly entered the US on B-1 or ESTA visa waivers, which prohibit most work activity but include exceptions such as for specialized workers engaged in equipment installation. ICE has not specified how these workers violated the terms of their visas and its warrant only included limited information about 4 Hispanic individuals – with no reference to the more than 400 other people they eventually detained.

There is no easily obtainable visa category for the types of expert workers needed to support these foreign investments. H1-B visas would more clearly cover the range of expertise needed, but these are capped at 85,000 a year and issued via lottery. There is simply no way companies can be certain of obtaining such visas on the timelines needed for these investment projects. Trump himself posted on Truth Social about the dynamic, recognizing that foreign investors will need to bring in their own experts to establish facilities and train US workers. Georgia Governor Kemp has said the raid should be a catalyst for visa reform.

Green Investment and American Jobs

The ICE raid raises serious concerns about the treatment of a major economic partner, given Georgia’s significant investment in attracting foreign direct investment. The battery plant is part of Hyundai’s $5 billion Metaplant investment, which includes an EV assembly facility that began to produce Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EV models in late 2024. It is the largest economic development project in Georgia history, and is expected to generate 8,500 jobs by 2031. There are apparently contractual clawback provisions that require Hyundai to pay back government subsidies if 80% of that figure is not met. Hyundai’s overall investment in Georgia has since expanded to US$12.6 billion and includes another battery manufacturing facility in partnership with SK On in Bartow County. One estimate suggests that the plant could create 38,000 indirect jobs in Georgia over the next decade. The groundbreaking for the facility back in 2023 was a bipartisan affair including Republic governor Kemp and Democratic Senators Warnock and Ossoff. This is seemingly the type of investment that Republicans (including Trump) and Democrats alike can all support.

The case here is strong evidence of the potential for green development in the US, but it also serves as a clarion call to reform laws that hinder such development. First, the Hyundai investment was driven by anticipated demand for EVs in the United States and its business case was only helped by Inflation Reduction Act incentives that Republicans have now rolled back. The project here merely reminds us of a fact that we have known for a few years now. Green industrial policy has been a boon for Republican states, even more so than Democratic states. Despite that effort by Democrats to share the wealth produced by the policy, most Republicans have turned against this opportunity, whether due to anti-environmental ideology or the special interest lobbying of the fossil fuel industry or American car companies who have largely had trouble producing competitive EVs. Although bipartisanship seems to be dead these days, major job-creating, tax dollar-generating projects like this should be something both parties can get behind.

Second, if we are interested in promoting green development of all sorts, we are going to have to figure out a way to harness various kinds of law and policy – tax, trade, national security, environmental regulation, and immigration law – in ways that support our broader economic and social goals. The Hyundai-LG plant raid highlights a problem in our visa system – the lack of temporary visas to fill jobs that Americans can’t easily assume; here, expert workers to help stand up manufacturing facilities and train American workers. If we like what these projects bring to the US, then we need to design accompanying policies that facilitate more investment and development.

Instead, the ICE raid has antagonized an important trade partner in South Korea, added cost and delay to a major value-creating investment from Hyundai and others, and created a less hospitable environment for future foreign investments in American manufacturing. We can certainly do better than this.

At the same time, the Hyundai project also shows us the bipartisan appeal in a decidedly un-bipartisan age of clean transportation and energy investments that bring jobs and new capabilities to parts of the US in need of greater development.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Drain-Sept-3.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:59:23.965114

Thompson said he did not observe egregious conditions on Monday, but he noted that his visit was planned in advance.
Until recently, the sixth-floor cells at the Sansome Street ICE office were intended for temporary custody while immigrants awaited transfer or processing for release, according to the lawsuit.
“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false,” she wrote.
“In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.","A Bay Area congressperson said he remains deeply concerned over possible mistreatment of detained immigrants after a visit to an immigration holding facility in San Francisco on Monday.

Rep. Mike Thompson, a North Bay Democrat, said he scheduled the visit to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office at 630 Sansome St. in San Francisco after getting reports that detainees were mistreated there.

His inspection comes on the heels of a class action lawsuit, filed last week, that alleged conditions at the facility are so inhumane they violate the U.S. Constitution. The suit accused ICE of turning 12-hour holding cells in the downtown office building into a jail where people are detained for days with no beds, hygiene or medical care.

Thompson said he did not observe egregious conditions on Monday, but he noted that his visit was planned in advance. It was not a response to the lawsuit.

“While the conditions shown to me appeared orderly and maintained, leadership at the facility was given prior notice of my visit,” he told KQED in a statement. “I will continue to closely monitor reports of undue detainments and improper conditions at the immigration facilities near our community.”

Under federal law, members of Congress have the right to conduct inspections of immigration detention facilities without providing advance notice. However, in recent months, ICE has repeatedly blocked members of Congress from entering detention facilities. In July, a dozen lawmakers who were denied access sued the Trump administration.

Until recently, the sixth-floor cells at the Sansome Street ICE office were intended for temporary custody while immigrants awaited transfer or processing for release, according to the lawsuit. But in January, ICE rescinded a national policy that limited the use of such temporary “hold rooms” to a maximum of 12 hours.

Since then, people arrested at Northern California immigration courts, at ICE check-in appointments and elsewhere have been locked up overnight — some as long as six days — and have nowhere to sleep but a metal bench or the floor, with the lights on around the clock, the suit alleged. They must share a toilet with no privacy, have nowhere to bathe and are denied soap and toothpaste, according to the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of several people who were held there.

“Defendants do not conduct a medical intake or use a medical questionnaire to identify the needs of people being detained in the hold rooms,” the suit said. “Defendants routinely fail to provide for the proper administration of prescription medications, and they do not allow detained people to make arrangements to access their prescription medications or keep medication with them.”

ICE spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied the charges in a statement to KQED.

“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false,” she wrote. “In fact, ICE has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

The lawsuit, which also challenged ICE’s recent practice of arresting people at immigration courthouses, was brought by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central American Resource Center of San Francisco and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, as well as attorneys with the firm Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass.

In her statement, ICE’s McLaughlin wrote: “The ACLU should just change its name. It’s clear they only care about illegal aliens—not Americans.”

Thompson said he would continue to work with immigrant service organizations “to ensure members of our immigrant community know their rights and are treated with dignity.”

He urged anyone in his 4th Congressional District who has faced inhumane treatment in ICE custody to contact his office.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/09/MikeThompson_ICE-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 11:58:23.683740

Abbott, and vice-president JD Vance, have been quick to frame the shooting as an attack on Ice, even though the DHS has already confirmed that no federal agents were wounded and the only confirmed victims have been detainees.

We’ll learn more of the facts in the press conference due to begin shortly.

The case for a trusted form of digital ID, which can help us access digital public services and prove who we are online, has shifted.
The extent of these risks and the opportunities of a digital ID system entirely depend on the policy choices the government makes.

Technological advancements mean that digital ID systems pose an even greater risk to privacy than they did when last proposed in the 2000s.","Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of Tony Blair’s Identity Cards Act. The scheme was hotly debated for almost a decade, cost over £250 million, and was promptly abandoned by the following government. The conversation surrounding Blair’s scheme would look eerily familiar to anyone who has read the papers in the last year. The ID cards of the 2000s were a policy silver bullet, championed in the various battles against terrorism, welfare fraud, and immigration depending on the issue of the day. The scheme proposed to retain biometric data and track every use of the ID in a central database. It collapsed under the weight of its expense and controversy.

Liberty was a key member of the NO2ID Coalition that led the fight against Blair’s ID scheme. As Labour reportedly readies itself to announce another ID scheme, Liberty must consider what has changed and what has not. The world has transformed since the 2000s. Much more of our lives now takes place online. Huge swathes of the state are digitised, including our health service, housing, and welfare access. In a world of online shopping, banking, and streaming, proving who we are in a safe and secure way has become a vital need. The case for a trusted form of digital ID, which can help us access digital public services and prove who we are online, has shifted.

However, the human rights concerns associated with such a scheme have not. The extent of these risks and the opportunities of a digital ID system entirely depend on the policy choices the government makes.

Liberty has long opposed the introduction of compulsory identity cards. A compulsory system would fundamentally change the relationship between individual and state. It would also exclude the most vulnerable members of our society. Government research ahead of introducing voter ID requirements found more than 2 million UK voters lacked appropriate photo identification.1 This would be compounded by digital exclusion in the case of digital ID. Four per cent of Britons, 2.1 million people, are offline according to a report by the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee.2 3Poverty is a key predictor of digital exclusion, as is old age. We must always retain the right to verify our identity offline to limit the harms of this digital exclusion.

Technological advancements mean that digital ID systems pose an even greater risk to privacy than they did when last proposed in the 2000s. A single and unique ‘digital identity’ and centralising databases would remove much of the individual’s agency in managing their data. This information could be used to profile individuals across multiple datasets and would pose particular risks to marginalised communities (such as those unknowingly included in police databases).4

A digital ID system designed to reduce irregular migration would be plagued by the above human rights and discriminatory problems. It would likely be mandatory, give the Home Office huge surveillance powers over our lives (including our interactions with our employers, landlords, and public services), and would make migrants lives even more difficult and dangerous. There are many countries that have mandatory ID systems, and it’s been shown there is no clear correlation between irregular migrant population, underground economies and ID policies. Before doubling down on this cruel and ineffective approach, the government should analyse how digital ID has worked elsewhere and examine if the supposed benefits in reducing migration stand up to scrutiny before rushing to introduce it here.

David Eaves, a digital government expert, recommends that ‘digital technologies are harnessed by the state to focus on the creation of public good and support individual liberty.’5 Liberty supports a digital identification system that meets these aims. Such a system would need robust human rights safeguards, adhere to the strictest data privacy and security standards, retain minimal user data, establish firewalls around sensitive state databases, be unlinkable (i.e. making it impossible to link different transactions or functions carried out by a user), and be voluntary.

The UK will benefit from not being first movers in this space; we now have examples of technology, policy design, and safeguards from around the world to draw upon – including the EU’s new system.

Liberty awaits the Government’s proposals. We hope that the Government learns from both the mistakes of the 2000s and the good work done in Europe and beyond to research and build rights-respecting ID systems. Digital ID could be an essential tool for every digital citizen, or a nightmarish surveillance system – we’ll be following how Labour takes forward their plans, ready to respond and make the case for a human rights respecting system.",https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/o-CELL-PHONE-facebook-1-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 13:57:49.964266

Police responded to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday at 8101 North Stemmons Freeway in Dallas, off Interstate 35E. Sources told WFAA that responding police were searching for a possible sniper or multiple shooters, and then one shooter was found dead on the roof of a nearby building.

It remains unclear if there were any other shooters involved in the incident.

There is still a massive police presence at the scene. The Texas Department of Transportation cameras in the area showed dozens of police and emergency vehicles along the access road off I-35E.

As a result of the incident, parts of I-35E were shut down in both directions while officials responded to the scene. Both lanes reopened around 8:30 a.m., according to the Texas Department of Transportation.

Dallas police confirmed in a statement that a suspect shot at the facility and one person died at the scene. Two people were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds, according to the statement. The suspect is dead, police confirmed.

The police statement did not include more details, although police and city officials were planning to hold a news conference Wednesday morning at 9.

ICE, a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with enforcing immigration laws and conducting criminal investigations.

Its operations have been the subject of controversy and protests in recent years, particularly since the re-election of President Donald Trump and his subsequent crackdown on migrants and refugees, a cornerstone of his administration’s policies.

Human Rights Watch has previously said ICE detention officers and private contractor guards treat detainees in a “degrading and dehumanizing manner”.

While there have been no confirmed reports of ICE activity in Beardstown or at the JBS plant, fear still lingers.","Beardstown, Illinois, is an example of how immigration crackdowns are impacting Midwestern communities and the nation’s food supply.

In Beardstown, Illinois, the Cuban couple had spent the past year building a life they were proud of.

Their arrival in the U.S. had followed a long and uncertain path: a northbound journey through Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, followed by seven months in Monterrey, Mexico, as they waited for their appointment with Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Aware of the growing hostility toward immigrants in the U.S., they were determined to enter legally.

In Cuba, they barely made ends meet — he worked in maintenance, she worked in a clothing store. But in the rural west central Illinois town, life started to feel promising.

They found work last year as forklift operators at DOT Foods, the largest food redistributor in the country. The pay was decent and the benefits generous, and the couple had begun to set aside savings.

Then, in June, they were abruptly let go.

“We were on the right track,” the husband said in Spanish, seated in the living room of their one-bedroom rental. The couple asked Investigate Midwest not to use their names for fear of deportation. “We were comfortable in our jobs, earning a decent salary. And suddenly everything collapsed — the castle crumbled.”

They are among hundreds of immigrants in Beardstown who arrived through humanitarian parole programs that have since been rescinded by the Trump administration, leaving them undocumented and out of work. Many of them were employed at DOT Foods and JBS, the world’s largest meat processor. These workers were part of a workforce that has long sustained both the town’s economy and its key role in the country’s food supply chain.

For decades, Beardstown has been a case study in how immigrants have revitalized once-decaying rural towns, particularly in the Midwest. But the Trump administration’s crackdown on both documented and undocumented immigration threatens the stability of communities that have long relied on foreign-born workers.

The previous administration’s humanitarian parole initiatives — which allowed individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily to seek safety or escape political persecution — significantly increased the pool of authorized workers. That influx helped major food companies fill staffing gaps and keep operations running during pandemic-era labor shortages.

Roughly 2.1 million immigrants power the nation’s food supply chain — planting, harvesting, processing and selling the food that ends up on American tables. So far, there is no evidence that Trump’s immigration agenda has created an “America First” labor market with higher wages to attract U.S.-born workers to slaughterhouses or farm fields. Instead, labor experts say the more likely outcome is an expansion of guestworker programs like H-2A and H-2B — often criticized for enabling exploitation — or a shrinking workforce that leaves remaining workers stretched even thinner.

“We’re not seeing any evidence yet of improved conditions for [domestic] workers,” said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute. “Some employers, especially in certain industries, have been ready to make a push for more H-2A and H-2B visas… They see that the only way they are going to replace that workforce is with these programs.”

In Beardstown, it’s unclear how employers like JBS and DOT Foods will address the labor shortage. Neither company responded to requests for comment.

Investigate Midwest spoke with dozens of workers, local residents, city officials and immigration advocates to examine how tougher immigration policies, including the rollback of parole programs, are impacting not just the local economy, but also the nation’s food system. Many Beardstown residents requested anonymity, fearing that speaking out could put them at risk of deportation.

Just a few steps from the slow-moving waters of the Illinois River, the Western Illinois Dreamers Immigrant Welcome Center sits beside the weathered storefront of a local radio station in downtown Beardstown. Inside, “Know Your Rights” flyers in Spanish line the walls.

A staff of three helps connect newly arrived migrants with legal services, food pantries, clothing banks and other local resources.

Kate Cruz, who co-directs the center, said her office has heard from many of the recently terminated workers at DOT Foods and JBS. Most are scrambling to find legal pathways to stay in the country and return to work. Some are reaching out in fear.

“We have more people coming in or calling who are fearful,” Cruz said. “Or they’re sending family members because they’re afraid that if they leave their homes, they’re going to be deported.”

Many of these workers are from Haiti, another country that, like Cuba, was included in the Biden administration’s humanitarian parole program in response to ongoing political and humanitarian crises.

Starting in 2021, the Biden administration expanded its use of parole authority, a long-standing legal tool that allows individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit.

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have used parole for decades. Under Biden, new programs were set up to grant parole to people fleeing crises in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The administration also extended parole to some migrants who scheduled appointments at the border using the CBP One app and met certain requirements after an interview, allowing them to enter legally through official ports — a strategy aimed at tracking arrivals and reducing illegal crossings.

“Many people fled their home country because it just simply wasn’t safe for them to stay there anymore,” said Sara Dady, an immigration attorney based in Rockford, Illinois.

Haiti, like parts of Central America and Mexico, has also been plagued by gang violence and instability in recent years.

Cruz said that at the beginning of the year, JBS hired hundreds of Haitian immigrants, most of whom have now been terminated. They want to stay in Beardstown, Cruz says, because it still feels safer than home despite their fear of deportation.

But for the terminated workers, finding a way to remain in the U.S. without risking deportation will look different for everyone — and it means navigating a constantly changing immigration system that can be complex, costly and slow.

For example, the Cuban couple hopes to remain in the U.S. under the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1960s law that allows Cuban nationals to apply for permanent residency after one year of physical presence in the country.

They applied with the help of an immigration lawyer they found online. But with both of them out of work, their savings are quickly being depleted by the legal fees, on top of rent and daily expenses.

For Elizabeth Amezcua, 39, an immigrant from Mexico, hiring a lawyer is not an option right now. Without the money for legal help, she is left to navigate the system on her own.

Amezcua was recently let go from the JBS slaughterhouse, where she worked as a cook in the facility’s cafeteria. The income supported her in Beardstown and helped provide for her son back in Mexico.

She entered the U.S. nearly 18 months ago through the CBP One process, like the Cuban couple. She says she was granted parole that allowed her to stay legally for at least one more year.

But after the Trump administration began dismantling parole programs — including converting the CBP One app that had allowed Amezcua to enter the country into a “self-deportation app” — she lost her job in June.

“I don’t have any family here. I don’t have anyone to help me,” Amezcua said in Spanish. “But God is almighty. And I know He’s going to help all of us who were left without jobs.”

On August 1st, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting immigrants who had been paroled into the country.

For nearly two centuries, Beardstown’s economy has been rooted in agriculture, shaped from the start by immigration.

In the early 19th century, Dutch immigrants drained the region’s marshlands, transforming it into farmland. By 1834, Beardstown had become a key river port shipping grain, hogs and provisions to downstate markets. With tens of thousands of hogs slaughtered each spring — more than in Chicago — it earned the nickname “Porkopolis,” home to the most extensive pork trade west of Cincinnati.

Beardstown’s industrial rise continued into the mid-20th century. In 1967, Oscar Mayer opened a large meatpacking plant, employing over 800 workers, most of them white men from the area. Jobs at the plant were stable, unionized and paid well.

The mayor of Beardstown, Tim Harris, remembers graduating from high school and dreaming of working at the Oscar Mayer plant.

“It was fairly difficult to get a job there,” said Harris, sitting in his City Hall office across the street from the town square, where speakers play music and ads in Spanish for jobs at JBS. “Unless you really had an in with somebody, a reference, you usually didn’t get a job there.”

But in the 1980s, industry consolidation, weakened labor unions and automation led to declining wages. By 1990, meatpacking jobs paid 24% less than the average manufacturing wage.

When Oscar Mayer closed its plant in 1987, Beardstown had already lost hundreds of jobs from other factory shutdowns. As families moved away, the town’s future looked bleak.

Cargill eventually bought the facility that same year and reopened it under a new model — cutting wages and benefits. But with the new jobs failing to attract the local population, which had dropped from 6,338 in 1980 to 5,270 in 1990, Cargill had to look elsewhere to build its workforce.

The company turned to immigrant labor, first from Mexico and later from other countries. The shift transformed the plant’s workforce from nearly all-white to one with dozens of nationalities and languages; Beardstown went from a declining town, with shuttered storefronts and an aging population, into a multicultural hub.

But this transformation was not without tension. In 1995, just 45 miles north of Beardstown, the Ku Klux Klan held a rally to protest the hiring of immigrants at the Cargill plant.

Thirty years later, Beardstown’s nearly 6,000 residents make up a far more integrated community, and Mayor Harris welcomes newcomers. “We need workers. The whole country does,” Harris said.

Beardstown’s story mirrors a broader transformation that has swept through the rural Midwest over the past four decades.

Immigration, global corporate consolidation, and the relentless drive for efficiency have reshaped the meat industry and the communities built around it.

The Beardstown slaughterhouse changed hands again in 2015, when it was purchased by JBS, a Brazilian conglomerate that is now the world’s largest meat company. The plant, which processed 7,000 hogs a day during the Oscar Mayer era, now slaughters over 20,000.

According to USDA data, pork production in the U.S. increased by over 75% between 1980 and 2020, now topping 28 billion pounds annually. Over the same period, the number of plants fell and line speeds accelerated. Modern meat processing plants can slaughter over 1,100 hogs per hour.

Industry profits have soared alongside this productivity boom, especially in recent years.

The top meatpacking companies — including JBS and Tyson Foods — more than doubled their profit margins during the pandemic.

However, the industry’s rapid growth and increasing profits have not always translated into improved working conditions for its frontline workers.

Real wages have decreased since the 1980s and injuries remain common today. And now, under a Trump administration that benefited from industry donations, thousands of these workers are at risk of deportation.

JBS subsidiary Pilgrim’s Pride, the second-largest poultry processor in the U.S, made a $5 million donation to Trump’s Inaugural Committee — the largest single contribution, far exceeding the $1 million given by corporations like Meta and Amazon.

Some critics argue that JBS’s political donations and aggressive lobbying helped clear the way for its recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange, despite a controversial track record that includes corruption and bribery scandals in Brazil.

In the U.S., the company’s record has also drawn scrutiny.

During the early months of the pandemic, JBS kept its plants open without proper safety measures, and they quickly became COVID-19 hotspots.

At its Greeley, Colorado, plant, nearly 300 workers were infected and six died. By July 2020, the plant accounted for 65% of all COVID-19 cases in Colorado. Most of the affected workers were older immigrants.

JBS did not respond to requests for an interview or comments on its political contributions, COVID-19 safety protocols, and the recent termination of immigrant workers on humanitarian parole.

Neither JBS nor other major meat companies and industry groups have publicly opposed Trump’s immigration policies. However, the North American Meat Institute, a powerful trade group, has formally urged the administration to expand the H-2A visa program — originally intended for seasonal farmworkers — to include meat and poultry processors.

“You’ve seen some action in Congress and the Appropriations Committee,” said Costa, with the Economic Policy Institute. “There are amendments being considered that would change the rules in the work visa program so that they’d apply for additional industries. So I do think that is going to be the main strategy.”

About 740,000 immigrants on humanitarian parole were part of the U.S workforce between 2021 and 2024, according to FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration advocacy group.

Of those, 30,000 worked in agriculture and 90,000 in manufacturing, including meatpacking and food processing.

The organization projects that eliminating their work authorization, alongside other immigration policy changes, could increase prices for food, beverages and tobacco by 14.5% between 2024 and 2028.

But the economic impact is only part of the story. In places like Beardstown, the new immigration policies have stoked anxiety and discouraged civic life.

The annual celebration for Mexican Independence Day on Sept. 16, which draws hundreds to Beardstown’s town square with music, food and costume contests, has been cancelled. Even residents with visas or green cards say they’re hesitant to leave their homes.

While fears of deportation have increased under the Trump administration, for many immigrants, that fear is nothing new. Many advocates argue the system has been broken for decades: the Obama administration deported more immigrants than any U.S. president, and the largest workplace immigration raid in the country’s history happened under President George W. Bush at a meatpacking plant in Iowa.

Martin Pineda has lived through these shifting policies.

A native of Mexico, Pineda spent years working in strawberry fields in California and later at a Missouri slaughterhouse. When that plant closed, he moved to Beardstown to work at the slaughterhouse there — then owned by Cargill — and stayed for more than a decade.

He left in 2007, after an immigration raid during the Bush administration led to the arrest of 62 undocumented night-shift workers and the company began enforcing stricter documentation checks.

Pineda, who has a wife and three children, is outspoken in support of immigrant rights. In 2023, he traveled to Washington, D.C. to advocate on behalf of undocumented workers.

“We are contributing heavily to the economy and we don’t get any recognition,” Pineda said. “That’s what makes me sad about this country. In my case, I’ve worked more than 30 years, and I don’t have Social Security to retire.”

In recent months, ICE agents have detained dozens of migrants in Chicago — at court appearances, during mandatory check-ins and in a high-profile South Loop operation that swept up at least 10 people.

While there have been no confirmed reports of ICE activity in Beardstown or at the JBS plant, fear still lingers. Some residents are reluctant to go outside, scared by false rumors spreading quickly on Facebook and WhatsApp.

But Pineda refuses to live in the shadows.

Each summer, he organizes a youth soccer tournament that brings together over 280 children from different ethnic backgrounds. It’s become a much-anticipated event, held at the town’s soccer fields — owned by JBS — against a backdrop of cornfields.

Pineda sees the tournament as more than just a game. It’s a show of resilience in a time of fear, and a reminder that immigrants contribute to a community in ways that go far beyond labor.

“It’s a lot of work — but I enjoy it. I like doing something productive,” said Pineda about the tournament. “This is something I wish I could have done in my own country, but I couldn’t. So I’m doing it here, with the children in my community, in this town. Most of them are Latino, but we also have kids from other backgrounds — African, white. And like I said, I enjoy it. I’m a volunteer.”",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BEardstown_main.webp,N,,2025-09-24 13:57:12.447343

One person is dead and two others have been hospitalized with gunshot wounds after a shooting at an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday morning, Dallas police said on X. A suspect also is dead, police said.

“The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building,” Dallas police said. “Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”

At least two detainees were shot in the incident, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident. A suspect is dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities,” Noem’s post read. The motive in the shooting is unknown, she said.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said on CNN earlier Wednesday three people were shot, all of whom were taken to a hospital. He did not specify who the three people were.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Lyons said.

ICE employees, civilians, and immigrant detainees are generally among those at the facility.

No ICE officers were injured in Wednesday’s attack, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News on Wednesday morning.

Wednesday’s shooting marked at least the third instance of an ICE or Customs and Border Protection facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year.

On July 4, a group of assailants targeted the Prairieland Detention Center, near Fort Worth, in what authorities described as a coordinated attack that left a local police officer shot in the neck. The officer survived, and more than a dozen people have been charged for their alleged roles in the attack.

Days later, a 27-year-old man with a rifle and tactical gear was killed by police after he opened fire on a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured, and dozens of rounds were exchanged between the shooter and law enforcement.

And in August, law enforcement arrested a man who authorities said claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at the same Dallas ICE facility that was targeted in Wednesday’s shooting, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Bomb threat at ICE facility in August

The backstory:

An individual was arrested in late August for threatening ICE officers with what the individual claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist in Dallas, Texas.

On Monday, August 25, 2025, the Federal Protective Service reported a bomb threat against an ICE facility in Dallas. The facility houses ICE’s Dallas Field Office as well as Enforcement and Removal Operations.

A male identified as 36-year-old Bratton Dean Wilkinson, arrived at the reporting entrance of the Dallas Field Office and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at approximately 6:37 p.m.

Wilkinson showed the security officer what he claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist, which issued a shelter-in-place for the facility. The officer called 911 and local police responded with a bomb squad.

Wilkinson was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with making terroristic threats.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/good-day-clean-wednesday-2025_09_24-kdfweme001_03__00.21.53.54-e1758716922856.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-24 09:57:11.622201

All of them sparked lawsuits, and the Supreme Court has so far sided with the administration.
The Supreme Court in 1935 found the FTC met the criteria, pointing to its function making reports and recommendations to Congress.
SCOTUS schedules tariff arguments: The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in the battle over Trump’s tariffs for Nov. 5.
Monday The Supreme Court will hold its so-called “long conference” behind closed doors, where the justices will consider the hundreds of petitions that piled up during their summer break.","The president fired a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member, without cause, despite protections enshrined in federal law — spurring a legal challenge that landed at the Supreme Court.

That was in the 1930s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt fired FTC commissioner William Humphrey over policy disagreements tied to his New Deal.

Do you have déjà vu?

The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up another FTC commissioner’s firing at the hands of President Trump.

But as the court reconsiders the 90-year precedent set by the earlier case, it’s a different landscape. The 1935 Supreme Court overruled Roosevelt’s firing, but Trump is betting the current conservative majority will agree the modern FTC wields too much executive power to be shielded from presidential control.

Let’s wind back the tape: Humphrey was nominated to the FTC by former President Herbert Hoover, a Republican, and commissioned for a seven-year term. After Roosevelt, a Democrat, took the White House, he sought Humphrey’s resignation so that the New Deal could be “carried out most effectively” with his own personnel at the FTC.

Humphrey declined to resign, and Roosevelt fired him, prompting the legal challenge. However, Humphrey died before the Supreme Court could decide the case.

Still, the executors of his estate pressed on and won. The court ruled in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States that the FTC’s removal protections were constitutional, so his firing was not allowed.

Fast-forward to today: Trump fired FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter in March. Slaughter was initially nominated to the FTC by Trump in 2018, but former President Biden tapped her for a second term in 2023, which would expire in 2029.

Many court watchers already believed Humphrey’s Executor was at death’s door prior to the Supreme Court’s announcement Monday that it will review Slaughter’s firing.

The court in 2020 struck down removal protections at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in Selia Law LLC v. CFPB. The following year, the court in Collins v. Yellen invalidated similar protections at the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

In both, the conservative majority rooted its reasoning in how a single director leads each agency. It limited the reach of Humphrey’s Executor to only multimember agencies without outright overruling the precedent.

“There certainly has long-been tension between the court’s holding in Selia Law and the existence of independent agencies — there’s been tension between the court’s holding and the continued existence of the civil service,” Julian Davis Mortenson, a University of Michigan law professor, told The Gavel.

“But for the court to eliminate the recognition of the validity of the tenure protections of the FTC would undo not only a case from the 1930s but would undo important elements of quite recent precedent, as well,” he said.

Trump’s second-term firings tee up what’s left. Like the FTC, Trump has attempted to fire officials without cause at the multimember National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Labor Relations Authority, Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, National Credit Union Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission and National Transportation Safety Board.

All of them sparked lawsuits, and the Supreme Court has so far sided with the administration.

Trump’s argument raises Humphrey’s Executor’s other limitation: an agency must exercise “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” power, not executive power, for Congress to shield it from the president’s at-will firing authority.

The Supreme Court in 1935 found the FTC met the criteria, pointing to its function making reports and recommendations to Congress.

Today’s conservative-majority court has cast doubt.

“The Court’s conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not withstood the test of time,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a footnote when deciding Selia Law.

Even if the ruling was sound 90 years ago, the justices will confront whether the federal bureaucracy’s increased power in the intervening years changes the equation.

The Trump administration’s primary argument is that the Supreme Court can keep the logic of Humphrey’s Executor intact and merely hold that it doesn’t cover the FTC.

It would follow a series of cases in which the conservative majority has already taken aim at the rise of the so-called “fourth branch of government.” Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first appointee to the court, explained the view perhaps most succinctly during 2023 argument involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“This is not your grandfather’s SEC, right?” Gorsuch quipped.

IN FOCUS

Another US attorney bites the dust

Erik Siebert, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned Friday amid pressure to prosecute one of Trump’s most prominent adversaries.

Enter Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and former Trump defense attorney, who was tapped by Trump to lead the office on an interim basis — and, it seems, to push ahead with taking on the president’s foes.

“Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directly addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” the president continued. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!”

Halligan assumed the post Monday, according to a post on X by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, another ex-Trump attorney.

It’s the latest installation of a Trump loyalist into the important federal prosecuting offices as the president has vowed to seek legal retribution against his perceived enemies.

Siebert’s resignation came after he resisted pursuing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D). Trump said Friday that he wanted Siebert “out.”

The president said he didn’t approve of Siebert because he had the support of Virginia’s Democratic senators. However, several news outlets reported the pressure campaign and the office’s apparent failure to uncover enough incriminating evidence to support bringing an indictment against New York’s top prosecutor.

James’s civil fraud case against Trump and his business empire made her a focus of his ire. She won a nearly $500 million penalty against him that was recently wiped by an appeals court, though her office’s victory was otherwise kept intact. Both Trump and James’s office have appealed to the state’s highest court.

The allegations against James stem from a Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) criminal referral that suggested she claimed a Virginia home as a primary residence while holding public office in New York and residing there.

The FHFA also lodged mortgage fraud allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook, who Trump attempted to fire over the matter, prompting a legal challenge now pending before the Supreme Court.

Trump has installed his preferred top federal prosecutors without congressional approval at least four other times, in New Jersey, Nevada, Central California and Northern New York.

In New Jersey, Trump selected his former personal lawyer and White House aide Alina Habba to serve as interim U.S. attorney, but when judges declined to extend that status, he circumvented their say by withdrawing her formal nomination to the post and putting her in the role on an acting basis.

Habba still holds that post today, even though a judge last month ruled that she has been unlawfully serving in it after lawyers for two New Jersey criminal defendants argued she did not have the authority to prosecute their case after the 120-day clock on her interim status ran out. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.

A similar maneuver occurred in the Northern District of New York, where judges refused to extend the interim term of Trump’s chief federal prosecutor there, John Sarcone III. Sarcone was made acting U.S. attorney.

Both Sigal Chattah, the U.S. attorney in Nevada, and Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, which covers Los Angeles, saw their titles swapped to “acting” so they could remain in their posts longer without Senate confirmation, as well.

Though Trump’s moves have raised the specter of a politicized Justice Department, the president’s allies insist that the moves should be seen as par for the course.

Mike Davis, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote on X after Siebert’s resignation that DOJ’s chain of command goes straight up to the president and that checks, like judges and jurors, are already built into the system.

“This post-Watergate fiction the duly elected President doesn’t run the executive branch is both unconstitutional and dangerous,” Davis said. “And it seems to only apply to Republican presidents.”

And at a press conference Monday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro rejected the notion that the president’s whims would affect her office.

“Politicization!” Pirro interjected in response to a reporter’s question about the matter. “No, I am not — I am not worried about that at all.”

Kirk killing response fuels free speech debate

The Trump administration’s quest for punishment in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s killing has sparked a debate surrounding free speech.

Attorney General Pam Bondi last week said the administration will go after people for hate speech, and her deputy, Todd Blanche, has suggested that protestors who interrupted Trump’s recent dinner at a seafood restaurant could face racketeering charges.

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr has pressured ABC to suspend late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel after he accused conservatives of trying to score “political points” off Kirk’s assassination.

And on Monday, Trump formally designated antifa as a domestic terror organization.

“The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical-left maniacs who fund, organize, fuel and perpetrate political violence,” Trump said at Kirk’s funeral this past weekend. “And we think we know who many of them are. But law enforcement can only be the beginning of our response to Charlie’s murder.”

Antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” is not a single organization; it’s a decentralized movement, or ideology, whose far-left adherents have often tangled with far-right groups at demonstrations.

Trump’s order pertains only to applicable law — and no one statute targeting domestic terrorism exists. It specifically states that it does not create “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States.”

As many of Trump’s allies voice support, the administration’s pressure on Kimmel’s show has led to push back from some conservatives who’ve long raised alarm about the federal government trampling on free speech.

“I got to say, that’s right out of ‘Goodfellas,’” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on his podcast of the FCC chair’s pressure on Kimmel.

“That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, ‘Nice bar you have here, it would be a shame if something happened to it,’” Cruz continued.

Many Republicans remain behind Trump, but Cruz’s comments were later endorsed by two other GOP senators, Dave McCormick (Pa.) and Mitch McConnell (Ky.), and The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board.

The debate has marked a homecoming moment for Murthy v. Missouri, when the Supreme Court last year declined to rule that the Biden administration’s jawboning of social media platforms to take down certain content violated the First Amendment.

The decision is making the rounds on social media again, but the court merely ruled those plaintiffs had no legal right to sue, known as standing. It didn’t reach the free speech issues.

The true, relevant case is National Rifle Association v. Vullo, which was also decided last year. The justices ruled a New York regulator couldn’t encourage insurers and banks to sever ties with the gun rights group without violating the First Amendment.

“Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the unanimous court.

Kimmel, ABC and its parent company, Disney, haven’t mounted any legal challenges. If one arises, expect Vullo to play a dominant role.

A key hurdle for any lawsuit, however, is that some of the pressure was driven by companies, which unlike the government are not covered by the First Amendment.

Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair, which each own various ABC affiliates and have condemned Kimmel over his recent remarks, announced hours before he was set to return they will not air his show. Nexstar also owns The Hill.

Another key front to watch: Bondi’s suggestion that the government will “absolutely target” hate speech.

She has cleaned up her comments, writing that “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime,” pointing to federal statutes banning threats against public officials.

Hate speech is generally protected under the First Amendment. As recently as 2017, conservative Justice Samuel Alito called it a “bedrock” First Amendment principle that “speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.”

Supreme Court precedent only leaves room for narrow exceptions, like unprotected “true threats.” The court ruled in 2023 the speaker must be aware they are acting recklessly for prosecutors to charge it as a crime.

One source close to the White House told our colleague Brett Samuels that the controversy was the latest instance in which Bondi “overspoke.”

Fight over DOJ’s voter data demands intensifies

The Trump administration’s effort for states to turn over voter data is heating up.

Many Democratic election officials are resisting, and the Justice Department has started to sue.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) and Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar (D) confirmed their offices received a letter from the Justice Department seeking copies of their statewide voter registration lists.

Federal law requires states to make “available for public inspection” certain voter records. But the officials pushed back against the demand as “unprecedented,” a move they framed as another example of executive overreach by the Trump administration.

“These requests from the DOJ are not normal,” Aguilar said during a press briefing held by the nonpartisan States United Democracy Center. “On the surface, it may seem like regular oversight, but it’s not.”

The DOJ’s demands come in response to Trump’s election integrity executive order he signed in March.

Judges have halted some of the more dramatic overhauls concerning documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements and mail-in voting after the Democratic National Committee, blue states and private groups sued.

But another section remains in effect that directs Bondi, the attorney general, to take appropriate action against states that fail to make reasonable efforts to maintain their voter rolls, as required by federal law.

The Justice Department says the voter data is needed for Bondi to determine if the states are complying.

After sending letters over the summer, the Trump administration escalated the fight earlier this month by suing two Democratic-led states that resisted — Oregon and Maine — to force them to turn over the data.

“I reiterate my deep concern with DOJ’s unexplained request for sensitive personal data concerning roughly one million Maine voters – a request that far exceeds what would be necessary for legitimate evaluation of Maine’s compliance with our obligations under law,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) told government lawyers in an Aug. 8 letter recently made public in court filings.

The Justice Department wrote in court filings last week, “Maine has violated three federal statutes and is actively thwarting the Attorney General’s performance of her duties to ensure that States fairly administer Federal Elections.”

Benson, the secretary of state for Michigan, said the effort comes amid other bids by the Trump administration to “change the voting processes” ahead of the 2026 elections.

“That, alongside this power grab, is extremely alarming,” she said, “and we believe should concern all Americans, when the president directs the Justice Department to intimidate state election officials in a way that would pressure us to turn over personal information about registered voters in our state that we are under oath to protect.”

Benson added that pushback has come from election officials from both political parties across the country.

“It’s something that we, as secretaries of state, will not allow and will not stand for,” she said.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

This marks our third week of previewing cases the Supreme Court will consider granting at its “long conference,” when the justices work through the build-up of petitions over the summer.

We’ll have one final list of previews in next week’s edition, but this week, we focus on petitions filed by state officials:

Clean Water Act (Ohio): Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost (R) wants to revive the state’s lawsuit seeking penalties against a natural-gas pipeline in the state for allegedly discharging millions of gallons of diesel-laced fluid into Ohio waters. The case concerns Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. It gives states a role in certifying projects meet water-quality standards, but states waive the power if they don’t act within a year of a certification “request.” The lower courts ruled Ohio waived its claims, but the state wants the justices to review whether the pipeline’s “request” was valid and a second legal question. The case is Ohio ex rel. Yost v. Rover Pipeline.

New Orleans prison (Louisiana): Represented by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill (R), New Orleans’ sheriff hopes to wipe the court-ordered construction of an 89-bed facility for detainees with mental health needs. The order stems from a 2012 lawsuit filed by inmates claiming inadequate housing that violated their constitutional rights. The federal government has long been involved in the case and urged the justices to stay out, noting the facility was already nearly 70-percent complete and would likely be finished, anyways. Louisiana’s appeal concerns thorny questions over if it is entitled to end the court order under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The case is Hutson v. United States.

Qualified immunity (Pennsylvania): Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday (R) requests the Supreme Court grant qualified immunity to John Wetzel, the state’s former top corrections official who was sued by death-row inmate Roy Lee Williams. A convicted murderer with a history of mental illness, Willams says his constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment was violated when he spent 26 years in solitary confinement under a former state policy. Wetzel is entitled to qualified immunity unless he violated Williams’ “clearly established” constitutional right. The courts have now cast doubt on the constitutionality of the old policy, but Pennsylvania it was blessed decades ago by an appeals court. The case is Wetzel v. Williams.

Wiped conviction (Maryland): Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) seeks to reinstate Charles Martin’s attempted murder conviction, which was wiped because prosecutors failed to turn over a computer analysis report before trial. A state appellate court ruled Martin was not entitled to a new trial given the strength of other evidence. The federal courts overruled it, ordering the new trial. Maryland’s appeal points to Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which instructs federal judges to be highly deferential in evaluating state criminal convictions. The case is Klein v. Martin.

Moot death-row case (California Supreme Court justice): California’s chief justice and a lower judge want to wipe a ruling that they violated the due process rights of death-row inmate Stephen Redd by failing for 26 years to appoint postconviction counsel as required by law. In 2023, an appeals panel ruled Redd had presented a plausible claim, but he died two months later, rendering the case moot. The court refused to wipe its decision, and the justice believes it should be tossed because she didn’t get an opportunity to appeal it further. The case is Guerrero v. Redd.

Elections (Pennsylvania legislators): 27 Republican Pennsylvania state legislators want to revive their challenge to voter registration orders by Biden and Gov. Josh Shapiro (D). The lawmakers claimed it usurped their authority under the Constitution’s Elections Clause, which gives state legislatures substantial authority over federal elections. Lower courts ruled the legislators had no legal standing to bring the case. It does not appear the high court is giving this one much attention. The case is Keefer v. Trump.

The shooter is also dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the incident in Dallas, said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The attack unfolded on Wednesday morning at a detention centre for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The incident follows a string of attacks on ICE facilities across the US in recent months.

The motive or targets of the attack are unclear. Fox News quoted officials as saying no law enforcement officers had been injured.

""While we don't know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,"" Noem said. ""It must stop.""

Dallas police said on X: ""The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building.

""Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.""

Preliminary information suggests a sniper carried out the shooting from outside the facility and hit victims in a ""secure detainee location"", Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told CNN.

He said three individuals were ""down"", including the suspected shooter.

""We're not sure on their condition,"" Lyons said.

The ICE field office in Dallas has been targeted by a series of protests this summer.

A justice department official told the BBC's US partner CBS that there was a bomb threat in late August at the facility. A suspect was arrested.

Last month shots were fired at ICE offices in San Antonio, Texas, in what investigators described as a ""targeted attack"" against federal employees.

No injuries were reported in that incident, which ICE blamed on ""political rhetoric"" and ""misinformation"" about the Trump administration's detention policies.

Another shooting occurred on the 4 July public holiday at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas, after a protest escalated into a faceoff with police. An officer was shot in the neck, and survived.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and “stupid people” created the scientific consensus on global warming, President Trump told the U.N. General Assembly yesterday. In a meandering speech, Trump also told the attendees of the summit that their countries “are going to hell,” accused the United Nations of “funding an assault on Western countries and their borders,” and questioned the global body’s purpose. Following his speech, Trump told the U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, that the United States is “behind the United Nations 100%.”Somini Sengupta and Lisa Friedman report for the New York Times; Franco Ordoñez reports for NPR; UN News reports.

Trump yesterday suggested he plans to meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva next week, stating that the two leaders had “excellent chemistry” when they briefly met during the ongoing U.N. summit. The Brazilian presidency has since confirmed the two leaders may meet. Ana Ionova reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said that South Africa is in talks with a U.S. trade representative, seeking to reduce tariffs levied by Trump on the African country. In remarks delivered at the U.N. General Assembly earlier in the day, Ramaphosa said that “trade is now being used as a weapon against a number of countries.” Doyinsola Oladipo reports for Reuters.

The U.S. military’s attacks on drug trafficking vessels are “only for television” and will not stop the world’s drug trade, Colombian President Gustavo Petro had told the Washington Post. The Trump administration should be targeting powerful Mexican and European drug cartels to effectively counter narcotics trafficking, Petro added. Samantha Schmidt reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

In a shift in rhetoric, Trump posted yesterday on social media that Kyiv can “win all of Ukraine back in its original form,” elaborating that “Putin and Russia are in BIG economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.” Earlier on, Trump confirmed in a press conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace. Ruth Comerford and Anthony Zurcher report for BBC News; Eli Stokols reports for POLITICO.

Zelenskyy said yesterday evening that he was surprised by Trump’s social media post but supported the “big shift” in Trump’s position. Zelenskyy said he believed that he and Trump will have a “better relation than before” and suggested that “the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us.” Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times.

A Kremlin spokesperson responded today to Trump’s remarks by stating that Russia’s economy is stable and that the Russian army is advancing in Ukraine. The spokesperson said in an interview that “of course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy’s version of events. And […] this is the reason for the assessment we heard.” Anastasia Lyrchikova and Gleb Stolyarov report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals in the city, is overwhelmed with casualties from Israeli strikes, according to healthcare workers. A medic told BBC News that the hospital staff are operating on severely wounded patients in filthy conditions and with “minimal to hardly no anaesthesia.” Separately, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said that Israeli gunfire also rendered a key oxygen station at the Al-Quds Hospital unusable, and that Israeli military vehicles are preventing anyone inside the hospital from leaving. Jon Donnison and Rushdi Abualouf report; Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report for CNN.

Israeli tanks have moved into multiple neighbourhoods in Gaza City in the past day, according to geolocated images. Journalists working for CNN report heavy shelling and drone presence, explosions, and the sounds of gunfire in the city. Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report.

Starting today, Israel will indefinitely close the only crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan “at the direction of the political leadership,” a spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the crossing said. Reuters report.

A group protesting Israel’s siege of Gaza by sailing to the territory on a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid early today said that it was attacked by drones, had its communications jammed, and that explosions were heard from some boats. The group suggested Israel could be behind the attack. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the incident. Ephrat Livni reports for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said yesterday in his opening speech at the U.N. General Assembly that “the principles of the United Nations that you have established are under siege” as “we have entered an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering.” Guterres addressed the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan, while adding that “the scale of death and destruction [in Gaza] are beyond any other conflict in my years as secretary general.” Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory reported yesterday that the Israeli government has shown clear intent to establish permanent control over Gaza and to annex the entire West Bank. The Israeli mission in Geneva dismissed the report’s findings, stating “Hamas has genocidal intent towards Israel, the report has everything backwards.” Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

The U.S. Special Envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, said yesterday that Syria and Israel are close to agreeing a “de-escalation” deal, wherein Israel will cease attacks on Syria and Syria will agree not to move machinery near the Israeli border. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa yesterday expressed concern that Israel might be stalling talks, saying “we are scared of Israel. We are worried about Israel. It’s not the other way around.” Humeyra Pamuk reports for Reuters.

On 5 October, Syrian electoral colleges selected by regional committees will elect two-thirds of the 210-member People’s Assembly, in the first election since the overthrow of the Assad government earlier this year. The remaining third of the Assembly will be selected by al-Sharaa. Tom Perry, Suleiman al-Khalidi, Timour Azhari, Firas Makdesi, and Orhan Qereman report for Reuters.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced yesterday that China will no longer seek new special treatment for developing countries in World Trade Organization negotiations. Qiang presented the decision as coming from “a responsible major developing country,” signalling that Beijing will continue to claim status as a developing nation. The Wall Street Journal reports.

U.S. TECH DEVELOPMENTS

OpenAI announced yesterday that it will work with Oracle and SoftBank to open five new data centers in the United States as part of the Stargate Project. The announcement makes up 80% of the $500 billion that the companies pledged to spend on AI building facilities under a plan they unveiled in January at the White House. Cade Metz reports for the New York Times; Megan Morrone reports for Axios.

Chinese tech company Alibaba announced today that it is integrating Nvidia’s AI tools for so-called physical AI into its Cloud Intelligence software platform. Alibaba’s announcement came after its CEO Eddie Wu revealed plans to increase Alibaba’s investment in AI infrastructure in excess of the $50 billion pledged in February. Luz Ding reports for Bloomberg; Tracy Qu and Sherry Qin report for the Wall Street Journal.

Alphabet’s subsidiary, YouTube, said yesterday that it will allow accounts previously banned for spreading Covid-19 and election-related misinformation to apply for reinstatement, overriding its previous policy of treating the violations as permanent. Alphabet’s lawyer Daniel Donovan wrote to the House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) yesterday, stating that the Biden administration had sought to influence the actions of platforms like YouTube and that “it is unacceptable and wrong when any government […] attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content.” Zach Vallese reports for CNBC.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Secret Service yesterday announced that it had seized and dismantled a cache of sophisticated equipment that was capable of shutting down the cellular network in the New York region. Officials said the network included more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers and could be used for encrypted communication or to interfere with emergency response services. That there was no specific information that it posed a threat to the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, the officials said, adding that initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as to criminals known to U.S. law enforcement. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

A Florida jury yesterday found Ryan Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump, assaulting a Secret Service agent, and three federal gun charges in connection with an incident on a golf course last year. Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was handed down, and was restrained by court bailiffs. He is set to be sentenced in December. Juliette Arcodia, Carmen Gonzalez, and Corky Siemaszko report for NBC News.

Former FBI agent Peter Strzok yesterday lost a long-running lawsuit in which he alleged the first Trump administration violated his First Amendment rights by dismissing him over text messages critical of Trump. In her ruling, the judge overseeing the case said that the evidence in the case had failed to prove his constitutional rights were violated. The judge stressed that she was not ruling on whether Strzok’s firing “was the appropriate sanction” for his conduct. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

FBI agents found documents marked as classified while executing a search warrant at former national security adviser John Bolton’s office last month, according to a court filing released yesterday. The filing suggests the documents included materials that referenced weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. mission to the U.N., and records related to the federal government’s strategic communications. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has disbanded the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a long-standing committee that provided recommendations concerning women serving in the military. A Pentagon spokesperson said Hegseth decided to terminate the advisory panel as it “focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness.” Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Chief of Staff, Chad Mizelle, is set to leave the Department of Justice, Axios reports. He currently oversees the DOJ’s Civil Division and Civil Rights Division. Mizelle said that he would continue “exposing the left-wing groups responsible for violence” across the United States and supporting the Trump administration’s work. Mike Allen reports.

The General Services Administration is seeking to rehire hundreds of federal employees responsible for managing government workspaces who were fired during Elon Musk’s downsizing effort earlier this year, according to an internal memo obtained by AP News. Joshua Goodman and Ryan J. Foley report.

The Trump administration has launched an internal investigation into FEMA employees who signed a letter to Congress warning that FEMA’s present leadership threatens effective emergency management and endangers the public. According to internal emails seen by CNN, FEMA has ordered the employees to sign non-disclosure agreements and schedule interviews with investigators as part of the probe. The disaster relief agency has placed several of the staffers who signed the letter on paid administrative leave in August. Gabe Cohen reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Government officials in Eswatini and Jamaica said this week that a Jamaican citizen who was deported from the United States to a prison in Eswatini, a country to which he has no ties, has now been repatriated to Jamaica. Orville Etoria’s deportation to a prison in Eswatini generated alarm among rights groups, who argued that he had been unlawfully detained as he faced no criminal charges. John Eligon reports for the New York Times.

14 immigration judges were fired last Friday, adding to over 80 judges already let go by the Trump administration this year, sources told NPR. “The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts,” Matt Biggs, the president of a union that represents immigration judges, said. Ximeno Bustillo reports.

Trump was inaccurate about a wide variety of subjects. They included inflation in the US, climate policies both in the US and abroad, immigration, his role in settling international conflicts, and his standing in opinion polls. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks.

Trump’s accomplishments and popularity

Trump and wars: The president claimed, “I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda — a vicious, violent war that was — Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.”

But Egypt and Ethiopia were not actually at war during Trump’s time in the White House. They have a long-running and unresolved dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but this is not a war, so Trump couldn’t have ended one there. Similarly, while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren’t in an actual war either during Trump’s current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump’s administration in 2020.

In addition, Trump hasn’t actually ended the conflict involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration and signed by the DRC and Rwanda in June did not involve the rebel coalition, allegedly backed by Rwanda, that has seized territory in the eastern DRC, and CNN reported from the ground this week: “The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump’s claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.”

Trump’s importance and success in addressing the other four conflicts he mentioned can be debated. Notably, while Pakistan has heaped praise upon Trump for playing a critical role in brokering its May ceasefire with India, India has rejected the claim that he did so and said it resolved the conflict directly with Pakistan.

Trump’s poll numbers: The president claimed, “I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I’ve ever had. Part of it is because of what we’ve done on the border. I guess the other part is what we’ve done on the economy.” It’s theoretically possible Trump saw some private polling that gave him dramatically better numbers than public polling has produced, but his standing in public polling is nowhere near his highest ever — in fact, it’s down substantially from the beginning of this year.

A New York Times polling average put Trump’s approval rating at about 43% as of Tuesday (with 54% disapproval), down from 52% approval in the first week of his second term in January (with 43% disapproval).

Similarly, a polling average produced by data journalist G. Elliott Morris put Trump’s approval rating at about 42% as of Tuesday (with about 54% disapproval), down from about 51% approval in the first days of his second term (with about 39% disapproval). And a polling average produced by data journalist Nate Silver put Trump’s approval rating at about 44% as of Tuesday (with about 53% disapproval), down from about 52% approval in the first days of the term (with about 40% disapproval).

CNN’s Poll of Polls average had Trump at 41% approval as of Tuesday (with 57% disapproval), down from 48% approval in our first average of this term in early February (with 49% disapproval). And Trump’s average ratings for his handling of immigration and the economy have both fallen from positive territory to negative territory since the beginning of the term, the averages from Morris and Silver show.

Inflation and the economy

Inflation: Trump baselessly claimed that “inflation has been defeated” under his leadership. This is vaguer than his frequent false claim that there is now “no inflation,” but there’s no basis even for the vaguer version. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April. It was about 2.9% in August, up from about 2.7% in July; the August figure was nearly identical to the 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration Trump said left him an “economic calamity.”

Grocery prices: Trump also claimed that under his leadership, “grocery prices are down.” False. Average grocery prices have increased during Trump’s presidency, though the prices of some individual items have fallen; Consumer Price Index figures show that average grocery prices were about 1% higher in August than they were in January, when Trump returned to the White House. And while we should be careful not to read too much into any single month of data, the increase in grocery prices from July to August was about 0.6%, which was the highest month-to-month jump since late 2022.

Electricity bills: Trump said electricity in Europe is much more expensive than in China or the US, which is generally correct. But then he added, “And our bills are coming way down.” In fact, US electricity prices are spiking, rising more than twice as fast as overall prices; Consumer Price Index figures show they were about 6.2% higher in August than they were a year prior and about 4.9% higher in August than they were in January.

Foreign investment: Trump, talking about “new investment into the United States,” claimed, “In just eight months since I took office, we have secured commitments and money already paid for $17 trillion.” This figure is unproved at best. Just a day ago, Trump’s own White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, used a much lower figure, saying Trump “has secured nearly $9 trillion in US investment.” She did say “we expect that number to be upwards of $15 trillion very soon,” but Trump didn’t explain how an additional $8 trillion supposedly materialized in a day — and even Leavitt’s $9 trillion figure should be treated with skepticism, since it is heavily based on vague semi-commitments from foreign countries that may never materialize.

Environment and energy

Global warming and climate change: Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and he also referred to “the global warming hoax.” He didn’t precisely explain what he was calling the con job or hoax, but global warming is a demonstrated fact. Trump also baselessly suggested that scientists now use the phrase “climate change” instead of “global warming” so that they can’t be accused of getting things wrong if the world ends up cooling; in reality, climate scientists use both phrases, often saying “global warming” when referring to the long-term trend of increasing global temperature and “climate change” when referring to the numerous effects the world is experiencing because of that trend.

NASA says on its website: “‘Climate change’ encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.”

For example, a 2023 report from the UN’s climate change panel, titled “Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report,” said this: “Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020.” In a section titled “Future Climate Change,” the report also said this: “Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence).”

China and wind power: Trump repeated his false claim that although China is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, “they have very few wind farms” themselves. He added, “So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know, they use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don’t like wind. But they sure as hell like selling the windmills.” In reality, China is the world leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore; it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US.

Coal and renewables: Trump referred to coal as “clean, beautiful coal,” as he usually does, but coal is just not clean; its use as a power source creates polluting emissions that harm humans and the environment, even with technological improvements that can reduce the emissions levels. Trump also wrongly said renewable energy sources “don’t work,” saying that “they’re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great” and that “the wind doesn’t blow.” But energy generated by wind is still a useful power source when the wind isn’t blowing, just as solar energy is still a useful power source when the sun isn’t shining — since the energy can be stored in industrial batteries or using other methods, allowing it to be deployed as part of a power mix along with energy from traditional fossil fuels.

The Paris climate accord: Trump repeated some false claims about the Paris climate accord from which he has withdrawn the US during each of his presidencies.

At one point, he wrongly said the US was “supposed to pay like $1 trillion” under the accord. It wasn’t. The US has never spent or committed anywhere close to $1 trillion in connection to the accord; Biden pledged upon taking office to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing, but Congress appropriated less than even that.

Trump also said, “China didn’t have to pay until 2030.” This was confusing, but it appeared to be a reference to his previous false claim that the accord gave China more time than the US to hit its targets for reducing carbon emissions. In reality, the accord came into effect for all participating countries at the same time, November 2016, but allowed each country to set its own voluntary targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year it planned to meet its primary targets while the US picked 2025, but this was simply a choice of each country.

Immigration

Biden and migrants: Touting his efforts to secure the southern border, Trump said, “Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million all together over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration.” The “25 million” figure is fictional; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a wild exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to what Trump has said.

Biden and migrant children: Trump repeated his misleading claim that “the previous administration also lost nearly 300,000 children,” then quickly said it was “more than 300,000 children.” He continued to say that many of these children “have been raped, exploited and abused and sold,” while others are dead.

He appeared to be referring to a 2024 report from the Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General, which said Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.

There are two key things to note here. First, the period covered by the report includes two years and four months under the first Trump administration. Second, while the report said immigration authorities have “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor,” it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited or had been killed.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN last summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn’t mean they’re missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn’t bring them or they are teenagers who didn’t want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn’t filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-23t150419z-431107609-rc2rxgafv1i8-rtrmadp-3-un-assembly-trump.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-24 09:56:52.404126

“Current immigration detention sites, including the GEO detention facility in Aurora, are already notorious for their inhumane conditions, including persistent medical negligence, inadequate nutrition, and routine rights violations,” Macdonald has said.

The Colorado Springs Migrant Detention Facility in Colorado Springs.","The ACLU of Colorado filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seeking records on the government’s plans for expanding its detention capacity in the state.

“Already, our previous requests and subsequent lawsuit have revealed how ICE may spend some of its record $45 billion budget intended for immigration detention,” said Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado legal director, in a statement.

The complaint follows ICE’s July release of more than 100 pages of records, which came only after the ACLU sued the agency for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

The July documents included proposals from private companies — among them The GEO Group, which operates the Aurora Detention Center — seeking a government contract. Those documents were heavily redacted, including portions describing the housing units for detainees.

Last year, the minor children of a Nicaraguan asylum seeker who died in the Aurora Detention Center in 2022 filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the for-profit company and its medical director.

“Current immigration detention sites, including the GEO detention facility in Aurora, are already notorious for their inhumane conditions, including persistent medical negligence, inadequate nutrition, and routine rights violations,” Macdonald has said. “It is unconscionable to go on to expand this cruel, for-profit detention machine.”

The ACLU of Colorado identified at least two other deaths at the facility since 2012 in a 2019 report titled “Cashing in on Cruelty.” The ACLU found multiple incidents reflecting a lack of care or competence.

The GEO Group operates 18 facilities that are under contract to provide services for ICE across the country, including the Cheyenne Mountain Center, a 700-bed facility in Colorado Springs originally designed as a reentry facility for the state until closing in 2020.

Headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, the GEO Group operates private for-profit prisons and mental health facilities in seven U.S. states.

In August, the ACLU filed another FOIA request, this time requesting ICE documents that show the agency’s “ramp-up plans for adding detention capacity” in Colorado and Wyoming.

According to the lawsuit filed Tuesday, ICE has not yet responded.

After an inquiry seeking comment on the lawsuit Tuesday, an ICE spokesperson told The Denver Gazette that the agency does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation.

ICE owns five detention facilities, but relies on private prison companies to hold the majority of those in its custody.

The Trump administration told Colorado’s congressional delegation in August that it plans to reopen the shuttered Hudson Correctional Facility as an immigration detention center.

Located about 30 miles northeast of Denver in Weld County, the Hudson Correctional Facility was a medium-security prison built in 2009. The facility had held inmates from Alaska until 2014, when it closed.

Owned by a real estate investment firm, the prison is operated by The GEO Group.

With space for 1,250 inmates, the prison could house about three-quarters of Hudson’s 1,651 residents.

The ACLU has noted that many of the proposed sites — including Hudson — have not been operational for years.

Among the facilities identified:

Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg.

Cheyenne Mountain Center in Colorado Springs.

The Baptiste Migrant Detention Facility in La Junta.

The Colorado Springs Migrant Detention Facility in Colorado Springs.

One of the most charming aspects of the United States of America is the immense diversity. There is a unique culture behind every individual and family, and the U.S. is a place where those cultures get the opportunity to connect.

Our country was founded on a notion of giving people the chance to find better opportunities, so why are we throwing that aim away now?

Growing up, I was taught that the most essential principles of the U.S. Constitution were the amendments that guarantee our freedom, liberty and individuality. However, it appears the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies are moving the U.S. farther and farther away from those principles. It is heartbreaking to realize Hispanic families like mine are being treated as if we are unwanted in the country we call home.

This reality hit even harder when the Supreme Court decided to lift restrictions on immigration enforcement’s practices in June, combatting a ruling made in a lawsuit filed after three men were unreasonably arrested near a Pasadena bus stop.

According to the lawsuit, The arrests were targeted — the men complied with officers and confirmed their citizenship but were profiled as immigrants and detained regardless. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled in favor of the men in July, determining that stops and searches in Southern California could no longer be based on race or language and required reasonable suspicion.

Despite this, Trump’s administration filed an emergency request that put a hold on the ruling and allowed the case to go to the Supreme Court. In early September, the initial decisions were overruled with little explanation. Federal officers were once again allowed to racially profile in Southern California, and the ruling makes it easier for other states to follow suit.

Communities like mine know all too well what these practices look like: discrimination disguised as law enforcement.

I have always been proud to say my immigrant parents built a stable life for me and my siblings by sacrificing much of themselves during their journey. I have never hesitated to celebrate my cultural traditions or raise my voice when needed. But with this Supreme Court decision, my confidence has begun to waver. Expressing my cultural identity feels less like a celebration and more like a risk.

The ruling, combined with the Trump administration’s ever-increasing federal pressure to deliver on deportation quotas, has shot fear through every immigrant community in America, but especially my own Hispanic community. Detention means silence, no communication with your loved ones and even uncertainty of your survival. Many are dragged through the unknown and forced to abandon everything they have ever built — families are torn apart, uncertain if they will ever reunite.

If the Supreme Court can ignore the freedoms of thousands, what will stop it from ignoring yours?

Though ICE is allegedly targeting immigrants with criminal records, everyday people are being caught in the crossfire. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee every individual protection against unreasonable searches and the right to equal protection under the law. Today, anyone walking the streets of Los Angeles risks unreasonable detention for nothing more than their skin color or the language they are speaking on the phone.

The U.S. has always been a cultural melting pot. This country was founded on the hopes of achieving big dreams, and was pioneered by those seeking a better future. This freedom means little if it can be stripped away at any moment, and that is the reality we are currently living in.

Transnational repression in the UK

Seventh Report of Session 2024–25 HC 681 / HL Paper 160

[…]

4 INTERPOL and visa applications

The International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL)

64. INTERPOL's Notice [126] and Diffusion [127] mechanisms are vital tools for global safety. [128] Yet, despite INTERPOL's constitutional prohibition on politically motivated Notices, these mechanisms are being systematically exploited by authoritarian states as TNR tools. [129] Red Notices [130] are routinely used to pursue political opponents, human rights defenders, and journalists beyond national borders. [131] We heard Red Notices likened to ""the sniper rifle of autocrats… long-distance, targeted, and highly effective"". [132] States also often coordinate their efforts, with multiple countries supporting each other's abusive requests. [133] Currently there is no requirement or mechanism for INTERPOL or the Home Office to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Red Notice being issued against them. [134]

65. Politically motivated Red Notices have a profound and far-reaching impact on the individuals targeted. [135] Such Notices may severely restrict a person's ability to travel, access financial services or maintain legal residency abroad. Rhys Davies, Barrister, Temple Garden Chambers, told us that a Red Notice:

Can ruin your life… You will be in constant fear that, if you were to go on holiday to Spain, an overzealous passport control officer might think they have an international super-criminal… and will detain you. There is no aspect of your life that this will not touch upon. [136]

There is often no way for an individual to know whether they are subject to a Red Notice. Individuals are often required to make direct enquiries to INTERPOL to determine whether they are subject to a Red Notice, a process that can take several months. This lack of transparency can leave individuals uncertain as to whether they can travel safely without risking detention. [137]

66. The Committee received evidence on the conduct of individual member states alleged to have engaged in systematic misuse of INTERPOL mechanisms. We were told that misuse of INTERPOL Notices was widespread, but that China, Russia, and Turkey were the most prolific abusers of INTERPOL's Notice system. [138] China was said to employ a distinct strategy, using INTERPOL Notices to locate individuals and then applying coercive pressure, through threats to family members, to compel their return. The Committee also heard that Turkey had begun to misuse Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database by falsely reporting documents as stolen, thereby facilitating the return of targeted individuals.

67. In recent years, INTERPOL has undertaken a number of measures to strengthen the integrity of its systems. Despite confidence by the organisation that these measures work, [139] attempted Red Notice abuse continues. In 2016, a dedicated Notices & Diffusions Task Force (NDTF) was created within INTERPOL's General Secretariat, with responsibility for conducting a robust quality and legal compliance review for all incoming Notices and Diffusions prior to their publication. The Government has also seconded two individuals to the NDTF. [140] A Home Office official told us that this is ""an effective way of helping to ensure that Interpol's processes and safeguards are properly adhered to"". [141] However, we were told that despite the creation of the NDTF very few Red Notices (around 6%) are refused in the first instance. [142]

68. INTERPOL has also set up a Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), an independent body which is responsible for deciding on a request for deletion and/or correction of data related to an INTERPOL Notice. However, the CCF has been ""experiencing delays in meeting its deadlines due to increases in [its workload]"". In addition to managing this increase, the CCF faces the task of clearing its backlog of cases. [143] We were told that this means it can take ""years"" for politically motivated Red Notices to be removed, [144] during which time these individuals face severe restrictions on travel and are at risk of detention. [145]

69. The Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) often work closely together on lobbying and diplomatic engagement. However, we were unable to establish in any detail how coordination is conducted on INTERPOL related issues and no details were given on how individuals who have been subject to a politically motivated Red Notice might be supported by the Government. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we were told that there may be some circumstances where the Government should consider making exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure. Rhys Davies told us:

There must be a way to devise appropriate checks and balances—such as enabling a judge to scrutinise which Red Notices are extant against British nationals and say whether those could be disclosed. [146]

70. International human rights lawyers Ben Keith and Rhys Davies told us that the UK could help prevent abuse of INTERPOL mechanisms by engaging more proactively with INTERPOL and advocating for reform. [147] While the UK has previously demonstrated its diplomatic influence and lobbying ability, working alongside its 'Five Eyes' partners [148] to block the election of controversial candidates to the role of INTERPOL President, witnesses expressed concern that the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction remains limited. [149] Rhys Davies told us that when it comes to international leadership on INTERPOL, often ""the ship is being steered by others', with the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction appearing limited. [150]

71. CONCLUSION

We are deeply concerned by the misuse of INTERPOL Red Notices by certain member states. Refusal by the INTERPOL secretariat to acknowledge that there is a problem and to take remedial action poses a significant threat to the rights and freedoms of individuals targeted by authoritarian regimes and sends a message that this behaviour is acceptable.

72. RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Government works with 'Five Eyes' and other partners to track and expose malicious, vexatious, and politically motivated use of Red Notices by member states. In doing so, the Government should advocate for greater transparency and accountability within INTERPOL's procedures and advocate for the use of corrective measures and suspensions for systematic abusers of INTERPOL mechanisms.

73. CONCLUSION

Currently there is no requirement for INTERPOL to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Notice being issued against them. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in cases where individuals face credible risk of TNR, effectively restricting their ability to travel freely. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we see a need for greater support for those whose lives are impacted by attempts to use this system maliciously.

74. RECOMMENDATION

While the option exists for individuals to request access to or removal of their data via INTERPOL's independent oversight body, the Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files, this process is often significantly delayed and may not offer timely protection to those at immediate risk. The Government should undertake a review of existing procedures to consider whether it is possible to introduce a formal mechanism by which the Home Office or the National Crime Agency (NCA) may alert individuals of the existence of a Red Notice or Diffusion where there is a strong basis to believe it has been politically motivated.

75. RECOMMENDATION

In addition, the Government should take proactive steps to protect individuals facing an extradition risk due to a politically motivated Red Notice. A voluntary mechanism should be introduced to allow targeted British Nationals to notify the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of planned travel to high-risk countries. This would give UK missions advance notice and allow them to prepare for early intervention if needed.

Impact on visa applications

76. INTERPOL Red Notices can have a significant impact on immigration and asylum applications. The presence of a politically motivated Red Notice may lead to an automatic presumption of criminality, resulting in the refusal of applications for asylum or citizenship. The Government told the Committee that:

There are clear procedures in place to ensure that INTERPOL notices do not unfairly influence immigration decisions. Where an asylum claim is refused and the Notice comes from the applicant's country of origin, the case may be referred to the National Crime Agency (NCA) or extradition authorities. [151]

77. However, witnesses argued that there was a need for enhanced training for Home Office officials on the use and implications of politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notices in asylum and immigration cases. Ben Keith, Barrister at 5 St Andrew's Hill, said that:

If somebody applies for a visa to come to the United Kingdom with a Red Notice against them, you might assume they were a criminal. It might be from Russia; it might be from another state. They might have been a former politician. There is a significant lack of education [in the Civil Service] about trying to analyse whether a Red Notice is in fact genuine. [152]

Country Policy and Information Notes, used in assessing asylum claims, do not contain specific information on threats related to TNR. [153] We heard that once a Red Notice was in place, it required significant funding, expertise and time to properly to challenge it in relation to an immigration or asylum decision.

78. CONCLUSION

The presence of a politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notice can have serious implications for individuals seeking asylum or applying for visas, often resulting in automatic refusal without due consideration of the underlying political context.

79. RECOMMENDATION

The Home Office should ensure that all relevant immigration staff are adequately trained and informed about the potential misuse of Red Notices. In addition, the Country Policy and Information Notes used in assessing asylum claims should be revised to explicitly address the threat of transnational repression. The Government should update the Committee within six months, outlining what specific steps it has taken to improve training for Home Office staff around politically motivated Red Notices.

The video from last Tuesday shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement.
The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.
However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said.
The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.","A video of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with a 5-year-old autistic girl outside her family home in Leominster, Massachusetts generated alarm after it was published Monday by NBCUniversal's Spanish-language Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra.

While Telemundo first reported that the family accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement of holding the girl in an effort to pressure her father, 22-year-old Edward Hip Mejía, to surrender to ICE, and the agency initially did not respond to a request for comment, the outlet updated the article on Tuesday, including with a comment from a government spokesperson.

The video from last Tuesday shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement. A man can be heard shouting ""Don't touch her!"" and a woman identified as the girl's mother tells one agent that the others took her daughter, who is 5 years old and on the autism spectrum. She also says, ""Give me my daughter back.""

The mother, who did not want her name shared, told Telemundo that her husband called her while driving with their daughter because he thought they were being followed. Her husband ""managed to run back into the parking lot of my house,"" she said, and her daughter was left with the agents. The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.

According to NBC Boston, ""Leominster police arrived at the scene, recovered the child, and returned her to the family.""

The couple has two children who were born in the United States. Neither parent was taken into custody that day. However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said. He is now being held at a detention center in Plymouth.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Homeland Security, responded to NBC News' English version of the initial reporting, calling it ""a disgusting smear."" She claimed that Hip Mejia ""ignored law enforcement emergency lights to pull over and drove back to his house,"" and then ""abandoned his 5-year-old daughter in the car.""

The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.

The initial reporting and footage sparked swift outrage, with critics across the United States and beyond condemning agents' treatment of the family as ""fascism,"" ""truly evil,"" and ""a fucking abomination.""

Joanna Kuebler, chief of programs at the advocacy group America's Voice, said in a Tuesday statement that ""this visceral event is just another frightening example of a broader and deeply disturbing pattern by this administration.""

""The combination of cruelty and impunity in pursuit of a mass deportation crusade is dangerous for America and all of our safety,"" Kuebler added. ""Smashing car windows, ripping families apart, and traumatizing children threatens the public safety of American communities and the stability of our nation.”

“Your countries are going to hell.” In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances.
Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum.
“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.
But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza.","He accused environmentalists of wanting to “kill all the cows.” He personally insulted the Muslim mayor of London. He bashed allies and foes across the globe. He questioned whether the United Nations should even exist.

“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” President Trump asked a gathering of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, in a meandering, 56-minute speech that extended nearly four times as long as his allotted time limit.

“I’m really good at this stuff,” Mr. Trump said. “Your countries are going to hell.”

In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances. Those included but were not limited to: a malfunctioning escalator at the U.N.; his not winning a renovation contract at the United Nations during his time as a real estate developer; windmills; other countries’ immigration policies, which he claimed were leading them to ruin; and the way Brazil is being run.

Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum. In a social media post, he made a stunning pivot on Ukraine, saying the country, with the support of Europe, was “in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

His declaration, a welcome development to European allies, was made shortly after a meeting in New York with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

But what appeared to be a major foreign policy shift in the afternoon came only after a lengthy morning lecture by the American president.

The White House had billed Mr. Trump’s address to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly as a chance for the president to lay out his vision for how America should wield its power abroad.

But Mr. Trump’s day did not start well. An escalator he was riding on broke as he entered the building, and his teleprompter malfunctioned early in his speech. (The White House accused U.N. staff of potentially attempting to sabotage him.) While he appeared to be reading from prepared remarks, he often broke into ad-libs.

There was some policy discussed. He announced a new effort to enforce the biological weapons convention that would use “A.I. verification,” and said he wanted “a cessation of the development of nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Trump also issued a new warning: that the U.S. military would continue to play the role of judge, jury and executioner in killing suspected drug smugglers operating in international waters. “We will blow you out of existence,” he warned anyone moving drugs out of Venezuela.

But he spent nearly a quarter of his speaking time attacking efforts to address climate change.

Mr. Trump undermined the scientific consensus on climate change, saying it was “made by stupid people.” He celebrated the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and “clean, beautiful coal.” He talked about American energy exports and added that “the United States has been taken advantage by much of the world, but not anymore.”

And Mr. Trump called climate change the “greatest con job” ever perpetrated on the world and claimed environmentalists are out to eliminate America’s cows.

“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.

He briefly turned to the topic of religion, falsely claiming that Muslim leaders in the West are planning to institute Shariah law, while proclaiming Christianity to be the “most persecuted religion on the planet.”

According to the White House, Mr. Trump had always planned to target “globalist institutions” in his speech. Since taking office, he has made drastic changes to America’s approach to foreign policy.

He has largely eschewed the use of nonmilitary “soft power,” severely cutting foreign aid and dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development. He has declined to pay for more aid to help Ukraine fight off Russia’s invasion or try to put any limits on Israel’s broadened military campaign in Gaza. And he has told strongmen leaders of other countries that the United States would no longer sit in judgment of them.

Several close U.S. allies issued what amounted to a reprimand this week of his go-it-alone vision, joining most of the U.N. body in recognizing Palestine as a state and risking the ire of the president, who has adamantly opposed such a move.

The president, for his part, has made it clear he wants little to do with much of the U.N. mandate. He has withdrawn the United States from the U.N.’s Human Rights Council, and ordered a review of America’s role in the organization. The Trump administration clawed back $1 billion in funding for the U.N. and informed Congress of its intent to cut another $1 billion, adding to a funding shortfall at the United Nations.

But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza. The president has also shown a willingness to use a quick show of force, as he did when he ordered airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Mr. Trump, who is in open pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize, trumpeted his role in bringing about several peace agreements or cease-fires during his speech, including a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Then he argued he was doing, as a side job, what the U.N. should. “Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them,” he said, adding that “all I got from the United Nations was an escalator on the way up that stopped right in the middle.”

He claimed that all the United Nations does is write “strongly worded letters” and speak in “empty words.”

“It’s sad I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,” he said.

Still, the reaction to Mr. Trump’s bashing of the U.N. and other countries was muted. Long gone were the days when he was openly laughed at in the chamber. His speech was greeted with polite applause. Afterward, world leaders clamored to meet with him one-on-one, a format in which the American president is known to be less bellicose and more accommodating.

In addition to meeting with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump also met with President Javier Milei of Argentina and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. He then attended a joint meeting with the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-lvjb/23dc-trump-lvjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 06:56:57.181695

Jurisdictional Battle: Federal District Courts v. the Court of Federal Claims The COFC—an Article I court created by Congress—is a court of limited jurisdiction that was created as a forum for private parties to sue the federal government for money damages.
The Court stayed the district court’s judgments reinstating individual grant terminations.
The Court of Federal Claims: A Friendly Forum for Funding Challenges What, then, is the COFC, and how can funding recipients take advantage of it?
* * * As you or your organization continue to navigate the federal funding landscape and the Supreme Court’s decision in APHA, consider whether strategic litigation in the Court of Federal Claims may be appropriate.","The Administration’s dramatic cutbacks to federal funding have changed the landscape and presented new and unprecedented challenges for funding recipients across a range of industries.

The Supreme Court’s decision last month in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association (“APHA”) and Massachusetts v. Kennedy, is the Court’s latest word on the evolving landscape for challenging grant terminations.[1] In those cases, the Supreme Court left in place a district court’s order invalidating NIH directives that served as the basis for nearly $1 billion in grant terminations. But the Court stayed the same court’s order vacating the ensuing grant terminations, noting that challenges to terminations likely should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) rather than in district court.

This leaves grant recipients to navigate an increasingly fraught judicial landscape, alongside the executive branch’s ongoing actions to limit, suspend, revoke, and terminate federal funding, which may only be getting started, if Executive Order 14332, Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking—issued last month[2] —is any indication. In this environment, funding recipients are well advised to familiarize themselves with litigation in the COFC as it may help your organization recover funds unlawfully withheld by the government.

Two factors make exploring potential relief at the COFC timely:

First, the Supreme Court’s decision in APHA has made district court challenges to individual grant terminations more difficult and made it more likely that many suits requiring the payment of money by the government will be funneled to the COFC.

Second, some organizations have been reluctant to sue in COFC during a funding pause, with the hope that the flow of money could be restarted before the grant’s period of performance ends. However, the end of the government fiscal year (September 30) is a common deadline for grant renewal. Should grants be non-renewed, strategic considerations may change, shifting the focus instead to recovering non-payment of grant funds.

Due to these twin pressures, organizations should explore whether breach-of-contract actions in the COFC could help them recover any unpaid federal funds.

Jurisdictional Battle: Federal District Courts v. the Court of Federal Claims

The COFC—an Article I court created by Congress—is a court of limited jurisdiction that was created as a forum for private parties to sue the federal government for money damages.[3] Under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), the COFC has jurisdiction over contract claims against the United States, and courts have held that it has exclusive jurisdiction over contract claims seeking more than $10,000 in damages.[4]

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), federal courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges to unlawful agency actions. But when the COFC has exclusive jurisdiction over a contractual claim, litigants cannot pursue relief under the APA in district courts for that claim.[5] This creates a tension between the jurisdiction of district courts under the APA and that of the COFC under the Tucker Act for suits challenging unlawful agency actions that may implicate a contract or agreement with the federal government—an issue that has played a significant role in the dozens of lawsuits challenging adverse federal funding actions taken by the current Administration.

In April, the Supreme Court addressed the line between the APA and the Tucker Act in Department of Education v. California,[6] where it concluded—albeit in a brief, expedited, stay-stage decision—that certain grant-termination claims likely had to be brought in the COFC under the Tucker Act rather than in district court under the APA.[7] That decision created much uncertainty, and various stakeholders in the research community have been waiting for further guidance from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court’s Decision in APHA: Another Roadblock to Challenging Individual Grant Terminations in District Court

Additional guidance has come in the APHA and Massachusetts cases, in which researchers at public universities challenged grant terminations pursuant to a number of agencywide directives targeting research into certain topics. The district court determined that the claims belonged entirely in district court—not the COFC—and, finding that the agency’s actions were arbitrary and capricious under the APA, vacated both the directives and the ensuing grant terminations.[8] The government appealed, and the First Circuit denied a stay pending appeal.[9]

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision with multiple separate writings, granted in part the government’s stay application, which sought to stay the district court’s orders vacating (1) the agencywide directives targeting disfavored research topics and (2) individual grant terminations taken pursuant to those directives.

The Court stayed the district court’s judgments reinstating individual grant terminations. But the Court rejected the stay request as to the agency-wide directives, meaning those directives remain vacated while the case proceeds on appeal.

The Court was divided. Justice Barrett was the only Justice who concurred in the Court’s ultimate bottom line, meaning she was the deciding vote and her opinion effectively controls going forward.[10] In her view, the district court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear the APA challenges to the individual grant terminations because those challenges belong in the COFC under the Tucker Act. She would not stay the judgments as to the agencywide directives, however, because those challenges are more like classic APA claims.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson would have denied the stay in full and allowed the challenges to both the directives and terminations to proceed in district court. Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh would have granted the stay in full, requiring all of the claims to be brought in the COFC.

The decision in APHA tends to confirm what California left uncertain: certain challenges to terminations of individual grants likely must proceed in the COFC, while challenges to agencywide directives remain viable in district courts. APHA and California centered on claims that the terminations were arbitrary and capricious; neither focused on claims that terminations violated governing statutes, regulations, or the Constitution—and thus, guidance from the Supreme Court as to this latter category remains sparse.

The Court of Federal Claims: A Friendly Forum for Funding Challenges

What, then, is the COFC, and how can funding recipients take advantage of it?

The COFC has limited authority: It may hear claims based in either contracts with the US government, or “money-mandating” statutes or constitutional provisions—i.e., laws that require the United States to compensate for harm via money damages.[11] And for litigants with successful claims against the US government, the COFC can grant money damages.

To the extent that federal grants and awards are considered contracts with the US government—an issue that has been litigated to some degree in recent funding challenges—the COFC would have jurisdiction to hear breach-of-contract claims arising out of the terms and conditions of those agreements. And because the COFC’s jurisdiction extends to both express and implied-in-fact contracts, litigants may also have arguments for implied contracts based on the government’s prior conduct.[12]

Accordingly, federal funding recipients may consider bringing claims with respect to frozen or terminated grants, alleging that the government has failed to comply with the terms or conditions of those agreements, which may also incorporate federal regulations governing grant terminations. Litigants may argue, for instance, that the government has failed to follow closeout-cost procedures, has failed to pay for work already performed but not yet paid for, or has failed to pay for expenses legitimately incurred, which could include salaries, costs for wasted materials, rent, or other facilities upkeep that would not have been incurred but for the government’s breach. Broader recovery may also be possible in certain cases, depending on the facts on the ground and legal theories available.

While cases in the COFC proceed against the federal government, the COFC is an impartial, business-driven court, and it rules against the government in contract cases with some regularity—indeed, historically, it has imposed some extremely large judgments.[13]

Key Considerations for Potential Litigation in the Court of Federal Claims

To determine whether the COFC may be a good option for you or your organization to seek damages based on unpaid federal funding, it is important to consider the following as you begin to strategize and weigh your options.

What are your damages and what can you reasonably expect to recover?For federal grants, damages will likely be governed largely by the cost-allowability rules applicable to those grants, but they may include actual losses and costs associated with terminations or suspensions that are otherwise allowable.

For federal grants, damages will likely be governed largely by the cost-allowability rules applicable to those grants, but they may include actual losses and costs associated with terminations or suspensions that are otherwise allowable.

Parties may not be able to obtain the full value of lost grants, though that may depend on factors such as whether there is a money-mandating statute creating a right to those funds—and on the terms of the grants themselves.

Expectation damages might be available in certain scenarios but are not a guarantee.

What litigation timeline is acceptable for you or your organization?

The COFC utilizes a judge-supervised alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process that is held in high regard and works to expedite settlements. But, as with most civil litigation, litigation in the COFC can otherwise be a lengthy process that may last for years before a final judgment.

We anticipate a wave of funding-termination litigation in the COFC in the coming months, so there may be a time advantage to bringing strategic litigation earlier rather than later.

""Every 15 seconds, per line, I've got a dishwasher coming off the line,"" Bill Good, the vice president in charge of the plant, told CBS News.

But back in May, nearly 150 workers, mostly Cuban immigrants, were laid off after the Trump administration abruptly changed their legal immigration status.

The Biden-era parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans from the risk of deportation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to terminate the program back in March. After a lower court temporarily halted the end of the program, the Supreme Court in May allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to terminate the program while the rest of the legal battle plays out.

The Department of Homeland Security in June began delivering notices via email informing recipients living in the U.S. under the CHNV program that their permission to remain in the U.S. had been rescinded. Those who have not secured another lawful immigration status, such as Temporary Protected Status, were told to leave the country.

""We're still short people. We're still training people every day on jobs,"" said Nathaniel Schultz, who works at the GE Appliances plant in Louisville.

Jaelin Carpenter, another worker there, told CBS News, ""They put us on overtime from that point on to the beginning of the year.""

""It's more pressure on everybody,"" Schultz added.

Asked if they felt those immigrants were taking jobs from Americans, Carpenter, Schutlz and another worker, Oliver Smith, all said no.

""They applied like anybody else,"" said Smith.

And Carpenter said they won't be easy to replace.

Schultz added, ""These people were one of the vertebrae in the backbone that is American manufacturing.""

About 200 immigrant employees still work the lines at the plant, according to GE Appliances. Many of them are worried they, too, are one more policy change away from not being considered legal anymore.

Those remaining immigrant workers now live in fear their Temporary Protected Status could be revoked, with some already set to expire in the coming months.

""It's just very hard to predict,"" Good said.

""People have already been killed while this is going on,"" said labor and human rights activist Dolores Huerta.

""We stand for community leaders and for families who despite personal risk are coming forward to share painful accounts,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).

Among those sharing their personal accounts, Cary Lopez Alvarado, a US citizen who was pregnant and near her delivery date when she was taken into immigration custody.

While a federal judge ordered the so-called roving patrols to stop as litigation proceeds, the US Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing them to continue.

""They can appoint human rights violations experts to investigate. They can also send individuals into the countries to investigate to see whether there is abuses of human rights within that country,"" said attorney Michael Carrillo, adding that is what they are calling for.

The group is also calling on the public to show support by signing an online petition.

""I'm 95 years old. I lived through 'Operation Wetback' when they were deporting people at that time, but I never saw any kind of abuse like we're seeing today,"" said Huerta.

Meantime, Lopez Alvarado's husband, the family's financial provider was deported. She set up a GoFundMe account for support.

At the same time, voters remain wary of the Democrats on key issues.

Fully 55% of registered voters disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance with 46% saying that they strongly disapprove. Sixty percent of female voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance while Independent voters (67% disapprove) render an even harsher judgement. Trump receives his highest scores among his base of white non-college voters (60% approve, 40% disapprove).

On Trump’s signature issue of immigration, 55% disapprove including just under two-thirds of Independents (64%). Once again, Trump’s base of non-college white voters back him on immigration (62% approve).

Trump does even more poorly on his handling of the economy (40% approve, 59% disapprove) than he does overall. A decisive 70% of Independent voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.

Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better.

Even on the issue of crime which the Trump administration has focused on in the last several weeks does not generate any good news for the president. A 54% majority disapprove of his job performance on crime while 44% approve. Trump’s job performance on crime does resonate with voters ages 50 to 64 (54% approve, 45% disapprove).

Trump’s job performance numbers clearly indicate that he has been playing to his base among non-college white voters and ignoring the rest of the electorate. For a candidate who ran on the economy, his economic job performance numbers must be worrying. The logical thing for Trump to do would be to pivot from his focus on crime and immigration and focus on the cost of living. While this is the politically smart thing to do, Trump seems unlikely to take this path. Instead, he will continue to focus on his base. This is a real gamble because it is unlikely that there will be enough non-college white voters to enable the GOP to keep the House in Republican hands.

Fifty-three percent of respondents say that in 2026 they would vote to support Democrats to oppose Trump while 42% say they would vote for the GOP to support Trump’s agenda. Fully 59% of Independents say they would vote Democratic for Congress to oppose Trump’s agenda.

All this so far, is exceptionally good news for the Democrats. However, Democrats still have far to go with voters on key issues. On the question of which political party can best handle the economy, 32% prefer the Democrats, 39% the Republicans, and 28% say neither. A 47% plurality of Independents say neither party while 25% say the Democrats and 26% the Republicans.

On the issue of immigration, Republicans have a clear advantage as 42% of voters prefer the GOP while 29% support the Democrats and 28% say neither. Independent voters offer a very mixed picture on the question of which party can handle immigration (20% Democrats, 30% Republicans, and 48% neither).

Thirteen months from the 2026 midterms, Democrats have many things to feel good about in these polling numbers. However, they also face a challenge. Voters do not trust them on immigration and the economy. The Democrats may be able to triumph next year without winning the majority of voters on immigration. It is likely that they will not be able to win without winning voters on both the economy and immigration.

Job No. 1 for the Democrats for the 2026 midterms is to produce an economic message. Given Trump’s poor economic job performance numbers, this would seem an easy task. However, it was something that they failed to do in 2024, and I would argue that it cost them the White House. Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better. If the Democratic Party fails here, they will hand GOP control of Congress for at least two more years.

Read the Bill Here(link is external)

NEW YORK, NY – Congressman Dan Goldman’s (NY-10) No Secret Police Act today reached 100 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, a major show of support from Democrats in Congress for legislation to rein in the Trump administration’s use of masked, anonymous federal agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement. Goldman introduced the bill with Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) in June.

“As Donald Trump continues to send masked, unaccountable ICE agents into our city, I’m proud that the Democratic caucus is united in support for this critical legislation that would put an end to the Trump administration’s use of masked agents to terrorize immigrant communities,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “While Republicans bend the knee to this administration as it establishes a militarized ICE police force, Democrats are standing firm in opposition to these authoritarian tactics.”

The No Secret Police Act would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals. Specifically, the bill would:

Prohibit DHS officers from wearing face coverings or any item that conceals their face during detentions or arrests.

Require that DHS officers identify the specific component they work for (such as ICE or CBP).

Mandate that officers wear or display official insignia or uniforms clearly visible to others.

The bill also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to invest in research and development to ensure visibility of DHS insignia and uniforms under a wide range of conditions, from different locations and times of day to weather circumstances.

Goldman has led the charge against Trump’s escalation of authoritarian immigration enforcement tactics, standing with immigrant communities across New York and the nation who are demanding accountability, transparency, and the basic democratic principle that law enforcement must not operate in secret.

In July, Congressman Goldman and 11 other Members of Congress filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration last month over its continued refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including the 26 Federal Plaza, which is also located in the Congressman’s district.

In August, Congressman Goldman and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led over 50 of their colleagues in demanding an immediate investigation into alarming reports that U.S. citizens are being wrongfully detained and deported by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. In a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal oversight offices, the lawmakers raised urgent concerns about a growing pattern of civil rights violations against U.S. citizens during immigration sweeps.

However, the court did not consider this requirement inconsistent with s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act in general or s. 12.1(5) in particular.
First, the court pointed out that the petitioners ultimately did not assail the validity of s. 5(7) of DEER.
Second, the court saw no explicit conflict between s. 12.1(5) of the Evidence Act and s.5(8)(a) of DEER.
Third, the court noted that proportionality was a primary goal of s. 12.1 and part of a broad purpose to reduce motor vehicle litigation costs.","The woman also claimed that she suffered a concussion, chronic pain, vision problems, cognitive issues, tinnitus, difficulties sleeping, headaches, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms.

The TLABC, a non-profit society of legal professionals, primarily consisted of litigators acting for individuals in BC civil and criminal proceedings.

Both petitioners challenged the validity of s. 5 of the DEER, as amended by Order in Council 628/2023 (B.C. Reg. 241/2023). The provision limited the disbursements a vehicular injury plaintiff could recover to six percent of the total assessed damages.

The petitioners accepted that the amendments in Order in Council 628/2023 tackled the lack of judicial discretion to establish exceptions to this cap, which was the primary concern raised in Le v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2022 BCSC 1146, and British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200.

However, the petitioners argued that the amendments led to new concerns. They alleged that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER:

amounted to an unauthorized or unreasonable exercise of the lieutenant governor in council’s (LGIC) authority under s. 12.1(9) of BC’s Evidence Act, 1996

lacked force and effect under s. 52 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it unjustifiably breached plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights

Provision upheld

The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed the petition upon finding that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER fell within the LGIC’s regulation-making power, aligned with the proportionality goals of s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act, and did not infringe plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights.

The court noted that the parties had resolved the action seeking to recover damages for injuries allegedly arising from the motor vehicle accident after the present petition’s hearing.

The court rejected the petitioners’ argument that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER disproportionately prejudiced plaintiffs by requiring them to make an application before incurring a disbursement and forced them to prematurely disclose their case to the defendant, thus diminishing litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court said the petitioners exaggerated their concerns about disclosing privileged information. The court determined that DEER did not compel plaintiffs to open their litigation files to an extent that seriously eroded litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court explained that s. 5(6) of DEER simply offered plaintiffs the option to apply to exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap and required them to meet the conditions and criteria in ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER if they chose to file such an application.

The court added that the case law interpreting ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER did not support the petitioners’ claims that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER jeopardized litigation or solicitor-client privilege and instead showed the court’s liberal application of the evidentiary requirements and avoidance of interpretations compelling the plaintiffs to open their files or divulge privileged information.

Next, the court ruled that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER did not infringe s. 15 of the Charter. The court said DEER’s pertinent provisions applied equally to all plaintiffs, whether disabled or not, and drew no distinction between those with physical or mental disabilities and those without disabilities.

The court saw no disproportionate impact under part one of the test in Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28. The court listed five points to support this conclusion.

First, the court said the majority in British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200, pointed out that the six-percent limit would be proportionate in most cases.

Second, the court acknowledged that plaintiffs with more severe injuries were more likely to incur disbursements exceeding the six-percent cap. However, the court found no evidence that disabled persons were more likely to exceed the limit.

Third, the court saw no evidence of adverse impacts on persons who needed accessibility services.

Fourth, the court noted that plaintiffs could ask the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia if they could exclude disbursements if they were likely to go over the six-percent limit.

Fifth, the court said requiring plaintiffs to file a s. 5(6) application would not onerously burden them and would generally entitle them to the application costs if they succeeded.

Lastly, the court accepted that s. 5(7) of DEER required a plaintiff seeking to tender the evidence of over three experts and exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap to file the applications together before incurring the disbursement.

However, the court did not consider this requirement inconsistent with s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act in general or s. 12.1(5) in particular. The court went over three points to support this finding.

First, the court pointed out that the petitioners ultimately did not assail the validity of s. 5(7) of DEER.

Second, the court saw no explicit conflict between s. 12.1(5) of the Evidence Act and s.5(8)(a) of DEER.

Third, the court noted that proportionality was a primary goal of s. 12.1 and part of a broad purpose to reduce motor vehicle litigation costs.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39 was pronounced dead Sunday at the Victor Valley Global Medical Center, according to an ICE statement.

Ayala-Uribe is now the 14th detainee to die in immigration detention since January, when federal immigration officials began to carry out President Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

News of his death comes on the day that two Democratic senators from Georgia sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raising concerns about the rise in the number of deaths in ICE custody, in particular two that occurred at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia. NPR was the first to report on the letter.

In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga) released the findings of a probe into alleged human rights violations that have occurred at immigration detention centers, including dozens of reports of physical and sexual abuse, and mistreatment of pregnant women and children. DHS rejected the senator’s allegations in a statement.

In California, the Adelanto Detention Center, one of the largest in the state, has long been the focus of complaints from detainees, attorneys and state and federal inspectors about inadequate medical care, overly restrictive segregation and lax mental health services.

In June, critics — including some staff who work inside — told The Times that conditions inside the detention center were unsafe and unsanitary. The facility, they said, was unprepared to handle the large waves of detainees pouring into the center.

That month, U.S. Rep Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), toured the detention center with four other Democratic members of Congress from California amid concern over the increasing number of detainees and deteriorating conditions inside.

The facility’s manager “has to clearly improve its treatment of these detainees,” Chu said at a news conference after inspecting the facility.

Some of the detainees told lawmakers they were held inside Adelanto for 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear or towels, Chu said. Others said they had been denied access to a telephone to speak to loved ones and lawyers, even after repeatedly filling out forms.

A spokesperson for DHS could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday’s death. But the agency said in its statement about Ayala-Uribe that immigration agencies such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection are committed to ensuring the safety of people who are in their custody.

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay,” the agency’s statement read. “All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care.”

According to the agency statement, Ayala-Uribe, a Mexican national, was being held at a processing center in Adelanto where he had been seen by an on-call medical provider, who prescribed medication to him, although immigration officials did not say why.

But three days later, Ayala-Uribe was sent to the Victor Valley Global Medical Center to further evaluate an “abscess on his buttock” and was scheduled to undergo surgery for it, the statement said.

“Ayala was also hypertensive and displayed abnormal tachycardia,” immigration officials wrote in the statement. “At 1:48 a.m. the [medical center] declared Ayala unresponsive and initiated lifesaving measures. He was declared deceased at 2:32 a.m. by medical staff.”

According to ICE, Ayala-Uribe entered the United States at an unknown date and location. He applied for, and received, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection in 2012. He was sentenced to three years probation after he was convicted of driving while under the influence in 2015, the agency said.

In 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application to renew his DACA status. He was convicted of his second DUI in June 2019 and sentenced to 120 days in jail, plus five years of probation, according to ICE.

Ayala-Uribe was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Aug. 17 and transferred to Adelanto on Aug. 22.

Immigration officials said the cause of death is still under investigation. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill of 2018 requires that ICE make public reports regarding any in-custody deaths within 90 days.

ICE officials said they make official notifications to Congress, nongovernmental organization stakeholders and the media about a detainee’s death and post a news release with relevant details on its website within two business days per the agency’s policy.

Introduction

On September 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation that significantly restructures the H-1B visa program, one of the most widely used pathways for high-skilled foreign professionals to work in the United States. While the H-1B program has long been a lifeline for industries facing talent shortages, the Proclamation introduces a new $100,000 application fee that will make it cost-prohibitive for many employers to utilize it, reshaping the landscape of U.S. immigration and labor markets. This explainer unpacks the key provisions of the Proclamation and what these changes mean for employers, foreign workers, and the broader economy.

Key Provisions of the Presidential Proclamation

The new Presidential Proclamation introduces the most restrictive measures on the H-1B program in decades:

Significant New Fee: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must now pay a $100,000 “visa integrity fee” per application. This represents an unprecedented escalation in costs. After the Proclamation was published, employers expressed confusion over its scope, questioning whether the $100,000 fee applied retroactively to existing H-1B workers and whether the fee had to be paid annually. In the days following its publication, administration officials clarified that the fee applies only to new petitions filed after the effective date. They also clarified that it was a one-time fee, not an annual fee.

Exemptions Based on National Interest: The Proclamation allows DHS to grant case-by-case or industry-wide exemptions to the $100,000 fee if employing H-1B workers is deemed in the U.S. national interest. However, the criteria for these exemptions remain unclear.

Increased Compliance Burdens: Employers face heightened reporting requirements, audits, and penalties for violations. Parallel to the Proclamation, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who rely heavily on the H-1B visa program.

The administration frames these changes as necessary to “protect American workers” and ensure that companies prioritize domestic hiring. Critics argue that the measures will undermine U.S. competitiveness and innovation.

What Industries Benefit from H-1B Visas?

The technology sector is by far the largest beneficiary of the H-1B program. This sector relies on a steady influx of international talent to sustain research, product development, and global competitiveness.

Beyond Silicon Valley, H-1Bs are vital in:

Healthcare: Hospitals and clinics employ foreign doctors, nurses, and medical researchers to address staffing shortages.

Higher Education and Research: Universities sponsor professors and researchers whose expertise strengthens the U.S. academic system.

Finance and Business Services: Banks, consulting firms, and accounting companies hire specialized workers to handle complex global operations.

Engineering and Manufacturing: From aerospace to automotive industries, H-1Bs fill roles where U.S. talent is scarce.

In short, the visa program supports industries at the core of the U.S. economy while bridging persistent labor gaps.

Old vs. New Application Costs

Before the Proclamation, the cost of applying for an H-1B visa included several mandatory fees:

Applicant registration for the H-1B lottery: $215

Filing Fee (Form I-129): $460

American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Fee: $750 or $1,500, depending on company size

Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee: $500

Public Law 114-113 Fee (for H-1B dependent employers only): $4,000

Premium Processing (optional): $2,805

Altogether, most employers spent between $5,000 and $10,000 per H-1B worker.

Under the Proclamation, employers must now pay an additional $100,000 visa integrity fee per petition. This brings the total cost to well over $105,000 per worker, pricing out many small and medium-sized businesses and significantly burdening even large corporations that hire hundreds of H-1B workers annually.

Likelihood of Litigation

The new Proclamation on H-1B visas is almost certain to face legal challenges. Immigration lawyers, business associations, and affected industries have already signaled that the policy is vulnerable in court, and litigation is expected to begin almost immediately.

Several aspects of the Proclamation are likely to be tested in court:

Statutory Authority: The White House relies on sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to justify the $100,000 supplemental fee and related entry restrictions. Critics contend Congress never authorized such high fees or broad restrictions, arguing the Proclamation exceeds presidential powers under the INA.

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): The Proclamation may be challenged for bypassing required notice-and-comment rulemaking. Additionally, the vague criteria for exemptions and the undefined concept of “essential” workers risk arbitrary enforcement, heightening the chances of an APA violation.

Complications for Employers and Workers

The new policy introduces wide-ranging challenges for employers and foreign-born workers who rely on the H-1B program.

For Employers

Cost Barriers: The fee increase will create financial, compliance, and workforce challenges for companies of all sizes, universities, and hospitals that cannot afford to pay $100,000 per application.

Hiring Delays: Stricter labor market tests and compliance checks will slow down hiring processes.

Reduced Global Competitiveness: Companies may relocate operations abroad to access the talent they can no longer bring to the U.S. affordably.

For Foreign Workers

Fewer opportunities for workers: The steep costs make employers less willing to sponsor H-1Bs, narrowing opportunities for talented workers.

Limited availability of H-1B visas for entry-level positions: Parallel to the Proclamation, the administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would lower the chances for international students and entry-level workers to be selected in the H-1B lottery.

Legal and personal strain: Heightened scrutiny and procedural delays increase uncertainty for workers and their families.

The Department of Labor’s “Project Firewall”

In addition to the Proclamation, on September 19, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who utilize the H-1B visa program. According to the agency, the program aims to “protect the rights, wages, and opportunities of U.S. workers,” while strengthening oversight of H-1B hiring practices and cracking down on abuse. The initiative is a parallel development to the Proclamation, signaling that the administration intends to increase both the cost of obtaining H-1B visas and the regulatory scrutiny of companies that use them.

Conclusion

The Proclamation on H-1B visas represents one of the most consequential changes to U.S. immigration policy in decades. By drastically raising costs and imposing new restrictions, the policy threatens to limit the flow of high-skilled talent that has long powered U.S. innovation, scientific discovery, and business growth. While the administration argues that these measures protect American workers, critics warn that they could instead drive investment and talent abroad, undercutting the nation’s competitiveness. For employers, the new Proclamation means higher costs, longer delays, and difficult strategic decisions about whether to utilize the H-1B program and/or relocate jobs overseas. For foreign workers, it means fewer opportunities and greater uncertainty. And for the U.S. economy, it raises pressing questions about whether protectionism can coexist with the nation’s tradition of welcoming global talent to fuel progress.",https://forumtogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/facebook-tag-image.png,N,,2025-09-24 02:57:32.918339

Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government.
Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.
""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.","More than 200,000 Afghans previously eligible to apply for asylum in the United States now find themselves without options or answers from the U.S. government, community advocates said.

On President Trump's first day back in office in January, he ordered a halt to all refugee travel. That included Afghans and their families screened and approved by the State Department to relocate to the United States.

""They're just being abandoned,"" said Jessica Bradley Rushing, who worked as a deputy director in the Department's office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, or CARE.

When the U.S. fought a 20 year war in Afghanistan, thousands of those Afghans fought alongside them. They served as interpreters, engineers, and in other roles - and many now face the threat of retribution from the Taliban.

The U.S. promised to help those Afghans come to America, but many are now caught up in President Trump's immigration crackdown. Thousands are still housed at U.S.-run sites in third-party countries, such as one in Doha, Qatar.

""I know people, literally personally, whose cases were right at the finish line on Jan. 20,"" Bradley Rushing said. ""And now their families are stuck in Afghanistan, and they don't know when or if they'll ever be reunited.""

The January suspension of refugee resettlement was followed by a travel and VISA ban that included Afghanistan and the end of Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. In July, the State Department closed the CARE office. And the White House plans to end Operation Enduring Welcome - the Biden Administration's Afghan resettlement initiative - Sept. 30.

Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government. He immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and is now a U.S. citizen. Living in El Cajon, California, he serves as executive director of nonprofit Afghan Family Services.

He said many of the more than 100,000 Afghans who made it to the U.S. since August 2021 came alone, hoping to bring their spouses, siblings, parents or children later.

""Unfortunately, with this travel ban ... this president killed that hope,"" Rahimi said. ""So now, the majority of these Afghans who came to the United States but left part of their families in Afghanistan — they are hopeless, they are voiceless, and they're unsupported.""

A State Department spokesperson said the functions of the CARE office were assigned to another office, part of a reorganization to make the department ""more efficient and more focused on an America First foreign policy.""

A senior Trump Administration official said Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans are still being processed with hundreds of decisions per week.

""President Trump has a humanitarian heart, and the Trump Administration remains committed to protecting those who supported our mission, while ensuring rigorous security standards,"" the official said in an email. ""These measures make certain that refuge is provided only to those credibly at risk while maintaining broader U.S. national security priorities.""

Shawn VanDiver is president and co-founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that helps Afghans with relocation. During the Biden Administration, he worked with the State Department to craft Operation Enduring Welcome.

""Enduring Welcome is, by miles and miles, the safest, most secure legal immigration program in our country's history,"" VanDiver said. ""We wanted to build this thing to stand the test of time and stand any sort of security scrutiny. And we did.""

VanDiver said the current administration sees Afghanistan as a ""political problem.""

""They want to wipe their hands of it,"" VanDiver said in an interview.

With roughly a quarter-million Afghans somewhere in the relocation pipeline, VanDiver said his organization will continue to press Congress to pass legislation to restart relocation.

Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.

""They are asking me ... how can they go to their appointments, finish the appointment and leave the courthouse safely without being detained?"" Rahimi said. ""We have no answer.""

In San Diego this summer, more than a dozen U.S. military veterans showed began a volunteer effort, showing up in court to support an Afghan at his immigration hearings.

Marine Corps veteran Jonathan Liu served with Afghans as a fire support officer during the war. He said the courthouse effort was a continuation of that service.

""These were people who fought for us — they put their lives on the line,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be turning our backs on them.""

Several major veterans groups are supporting bi-partisan legislation in Congress that would provide a path to permanent residency for many Afghans already in the U.S. It also would expand and extend the opportunities for more Afghans to come here.

The Enduring Welcome Act builds upon several policy goals previously brought before the House under the Afghan Adjustment Act. Together, the bills would provide a legal pathway for former U.S. allies in Afghanistan to relocate to the U.S. and offer those already in the country a legal path toward residency.

""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.

Lowenstein said Trump must realize the ""sheer force of his personality"" will not bring about an end to those conflicts.","In a fiery speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked some of the key principles of the world body, and urged Western countries to adopt MAGA-style policies on migration and climate change.

Trump used the stage of the UN General Assembly to deliver a nearly hour-long address that was short on substance about ending the world's two biggest ongoing wars — in Ukraine and Gaza — but long on critique of two of his favourite targets: immigration and green energy.

The U.S. president slammed what he called the ""globalist migration agenda"" and criticized efforts to tackle what he called ""the global warming hoax."" Near the end of his speech, he called the global push against climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" — a remark that drew gasps from some in the audience.

European leaders ""must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late,"" he said.

""You're destroying your heritage,"" Trump added in arguably the most strongly worded part of his speech. ""Your countries are going to hell.""

Given UN-backed treaties on climate change and the rights of refugees, it would mean a profound shift in the global order if other nations heeded Trump's calls.

The White House had promised a UN speech that would take aim at global institutions. But some observers believe his words struck at the heart of what the UN is supposed to do — namely, make life better for people of all nations.

Dave Harden, founder of Georgetown Strategy Group and a senior adviser on Middle East peace in the Obama administration, told CBC News the speech ""signals the closing of the era of the United States as being a beacon of hope"" to the international community.

'A torrent of falsehood on migration'

While some observers expected Trump to slam UN bureaucracy and spending in his speech, his sharpest critique of the international body focused on immigration.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them,"" Trump said, blaming the UN for fuelling what he called ""the No. 1 political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration.""

The president claimed the UN ""provided food, shelter, transportation and debit cards to illegal aliens"" to gain access to the U.S. via its southern border.

""In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime and deplete our social safety net,"" said Trump.

Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, an advocacy group that doesn't rely on UN or U.S. government funding, called Trump's speech ""a torrent of falsehood on migration"" in a comment posted to X.

Hugh Dugan, who served on the National Security Council in Trump's first term, doesn't think the speech called for ""tearing apart the multilateral order.""

""In fact, he did reiterate that the UN has potential,"" Dugan told CBC. ""I think he went mild on the UN by just sticking with the use of U.S. funds to bring immigrants across our border illegally ... he could have been even harsher about how our dues are being used.""

U.S. withdrawal from UN agencies

While Trump pulled some financial support from the UN and its agencies over the course of his first term as president, he has done so far more quickly in his second.

On the day of his inauguration in January, for example, Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization and pull out of the UN-backed Paris Agreement on climate change.

Two weeks later, Trump signed a sweeping executive order to end U.S. involvement in the UN Human Rights Council and launch a full-fledged review of U.S. funding and participation in all UN bodies and other international organizations. Meanwhile, his administration moved quickly to obliterate the U.S. Agency for International Development, wiping billions of dollars in funding from aid projects worldwide, jeopardizing such programs as HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa.

At Trump's urging, Congress proposed in August to withhold more than $1.4 billion US in funding for UN dues and peacekeeping operations.

The UN is now planning a 15 per cent cut to its core budget, its biggest in decades, including eliminating more than 2,600 posts, roughly one out of every five UN jobs worldwide, as part of a broader reform called UN80.

Tom Weiss, a retired professor emeritus at the City University of New York who has written extensively about the UN, says Trump's funding cuts have already made it harder for the UN to deliver humanitarian assistance

""This administration is very good at destroying things. It's not very good at building anything, so I suspect the downward slide of the [UN] is only going to be accelerated,"" Weiss told CBC News.

'Almost no progress' on Gaza, Ukraine

Trump's decision to focus on migration and green energy while only giving the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts passing mention drew plenty of attention from political observers.

During the speech, the U.S. president reiterated his claim that he has ended several wars — including a diplomatic conflict over water resources that isn't actually a war (Egypt-Ethiopia); a long-running dispute between Kosovo and Serbia in which no peace deal has been signed; and a Rwanda-backed rebel uprising in eastern Congo that hasn't actually stopped.

""I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,"" said Trump. ""No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country, has ever done anything close to that.""

Notably, he said the UN ""did not even try to help"" end the conflicts.

""I was a little bit surprised that he would brag quite so overtly about ending seven wars when the two main wars that he vowed to end — obviously in Gaza and in Ukraine — he's made almost no progress,"" Frank Lowenstein, a former U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, told CBC News Network.

“Gregory Bovino, an official originally diverted from his responsibilities at the border to lead controversial operations in Southern California, announced a second operation in Illinois—'Operation at Large’—on social media.
In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S.","Downers Grove, Illinois – U.S. Congressman Sean Casten, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), and all Democratic members of the Illinois delegation sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem demanding answers about the extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois under “Operation Midway Blitz” and “Operation at Large.” In the letter, the lawmakers reprimanded DHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials for violating due process as they continue to advance President Trump’s mass deportation scheme by targeting immigrants with no criminal convictions.

Citing lack of congressional oversight, indiscriminate arrests of immigrants, and the escalation of tensions during protests at Broadview ICE processing facility (Broadview), the lawmakers called for an immediate end to both Operation Midway Blitz and Operation at Large.

“While this operation [Operation Midway Blitz] supposedly targets ‘criminal illegal aliens,’ our constituents report that DHS officials are arresting individuals in their neighborhoods, at bus stops, and near schools. These enforcement operations do not reduce crime or make our communities safer. As we have seen throughout the implementation of President Trump’s mass deportation scheme, DHS is not focusing on the ‘worst of the worst’ as claimed, but has instead mostly arrested hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions,” the lawmakers began their letter. “DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have skirted or outright violated due process and other constitutional requirements intended to protect individuals in the United States from arbitrary arrests, detention, and deportation.”

“We urge you to end your dangerous operations in Illinois and provide our residents with transparency into these operations, including how they have siphoned resources from other federal law enforcement agencies that combat public safety threats in our communities,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers condemned the secrecy surrounding Operation Midway Blitz, noting that Members of Congress have repeatedly requested access to detention facilities, including Broadview, and been denied by DHS without justification.

“Operation Midway Blitz has been shrouded in secrecy, with little notice to state and local officials as to the nature of the operation, the types of people targeted, where DHS is detaining people, and which agencies are required to detail officers to conduct immigration enforcement. DHS officials have avoided meeting with Members of Congress and have not responded to repeated congressional inquiries about recent enforcement activities. Furthermore, DHS has denied Members of Congress the opportunity to conduct lawful oversight at facilities where noncitizens are being held. DHS has also used military-style tactics and equipment to break down doors in suburban homes, with little transparency into the basis for such raids,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

The lawmakers underscored that the tactics DHS used in Southern California, headed by Gregory Bovino, will not be tolerated in Illinois, especially as DHS faces several lawsuits for its treatment of protesters in California. In Illinois, DHS and ICE masked agents have reportedly escalated tensions at Broadview by indiscriminately deploying tear gas and chemical agents on protestors. Reports have detailed a dangerous lack of communication between local law enforcement and ICE agents that led to injuries and further distrust between federal agencies, local law enforcement, and community members.

“Gregory Bovino, an official originally diverted from his responsibilities at the border to lead controversial operations in Southern California, announced a second operation in Illinois—'Operation at Large’—on social media. This operation will reportedly include indiscriminate raids, including at Home Depots and car washes. Mr. Bovino’s reckless and dangerous tactics in California should not be extended to Illinois, as they are already the subject of multiple lawsuits alleging abuses against citizens and noncitizens alike,” the lawmakers wrote. “Masked officers have arrested and detained U.S. citizens and lawful noncitizens without making attempts to verify—or even ignoring attempts to establish—U.S. citizenship or lawful presence.”

“These tactics are already being utilized by your agents in Illinois. While DHS has yet to provide Congress with current information on arrests in Illinois, your officials are estimating in the media that between 400 and 550 arrests have already occurred. Last Friday, ICE reportedly escalated tensions by indiscriminately using tear gas and chemical agents on peaceful protestors,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

“A spokesperson for the Broadview Police Department (BPD) said that BPD and ICE had an agreement that ICE would inform BPD before the agency used any chemical arms, but ICE did not provide such advance notification. As a result of your officials’ dangerous and reckless tactics, an officer was reportedly exposed to mace and tear gas used by ICE. While your spokesperson claims that ICE officials called local law enforcement multiple times for assistance, BPD says that the agency ‘did not receive ‘multiple calls for assistance’ from the leadership of the ICE detention facility in Broadview. That is false,’” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers exposed the Trump Administration’s failure to uphold due process as ICE agents carry out arbitrary arrests and detentions. Further, the Trump Administration has eliminated a longstanding requirement that ICE officers provide a written justification before targeting individuals for immigration arrests.

“We are already seeing improper arrests of U.S. citizens in Illinois, and are deeply disturbed by these indiscriminate arrests coupled with renewed efforts to gut due process and indefinitely detain people who have spent decades in the United States without committing any crime. While some attempts to fulfill President Trump’s mass deportation scheme have been struck down in courts, these efforts have nonetheless resulted in unlawful arrests, detentions, and, in some cases, deportations before courts can intervene,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers concluded their letter by denouncing the fear and division created by these operations and demanding transparency surrounding immigration enforcement activity in Chicago. Requesting a response by October 7, the lawmakers submitted questions about reports that DHS has brought in social media influencers to promote immigration raids; reports about the use of military weaponry, including drones, during raids; and about the training that federal officials have received on responding to and de-escalating protests.

“Your extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois have already devastated families and torn at the social fabric of our communities,” the lawmakers concluded their letter.

In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL-01), Robin Kelly (D-IL-02), Delia Ramirez (D-IL-03), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-IL-04), Mike Quigley (D-IL-05), Danny Davis (D-IL-07), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL-08), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09), Brad Schneider (D-IL-10), Bill Foster (D-IL-11), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13), Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL-17).

His arrest comes two months after ICE agents in Florida arrested Réginald Boulos, a businessman, doctor and former Haitian presidential hopeful.

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal immigration agents have arrested Dimitri Vorbe, one of Haiti’s most powerful businessmen and the latest elite figure from the troubled Caribbean country to be detained on U.S. soil.

Vorbe was in custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday, according to online records. He was being held at Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Vorbe was arrested or if he faces any charges. A search for court records in Florida on Tuesday showed no formal charges. An ICE spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

His arrest comes two months after ICE agents in Florida arrested Réginald Boulos, a businessman, doctor and former Haitian presidential hopeful. Authorities have accused Boulos of supporting violent gangs in Haiti that the U.S. government has deemed terrorist groups.

“With the arrests of Boulos and Vorbe, you are seeing a strata of Haitian society touched in their places of exile,” said Michael Deibert, author of “Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,” and “Haiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.”

“A message is being sent to the upper echelon of Haiti’s political and economic elite that they’re not untouchable anymore,” he said.

A wealthy scion

Vorbe and his family own Société Générale d’Énergie S.A, a private power company that was one of the biggest suppliers of electricity to Haiti’s state-owned company.

The Vorbe family also was known for securing major government construction projects for the building of roads and other infrastructure under former President René Préval.

“They were getting lots of money from the state,” said Jake Johnston, international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Both Boulos and Dimitri Vorbe were the two members of the elite, the oligarchs that Jovenel went after.”

In 2020, the administration of slain former President Jovenel Moïse seized Vorbe’s power company following accusations of corruption.

“There is not much love lost in Haiti either for Dimitri Vorbe or Réginald Boulos, or many of the elite families,” Johnston said of the arrests. “Many people will cheer it in a country with a broken judicial system as it’s some sliver of accountability, (but) we don’t know what any of this is for. … How does this all fit together into a strategy that actually benefits Haiti?”

A US crackdown

Vorbe was taken into custody a day after the U.S. government designated two former Haitian public officials who were close to the Vorbe family for involvement in “significant corruption” while in office.

The designation against Arnel Belizaire, a former member of Haiti’s Chamber of Deputies, and Antonio Cheramy, a former senator, means that they and their immediate family are “generally ineligible” to enter the U.S.

“The U.S. government will remain relentless in pursuing those supporting terrorist gangs through indictments, arrests, sanctions, arms seizures and other immigration restrictions,” Christopher Landau, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of State, said Monday.

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.

""Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement.

These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said it will defy California's new ""No Secret Police Act,"" which restricts law enforcement officers from masking their identities during operations.

California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Saturday that prohibits local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing ski masks, neck gaiters, or other face coverings while performing official duties. He made the post hours after his press office wrote in an X post that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""is going to have a bad day today.""

""Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release.

She added: ""He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban.""

Why It Matters

ICE has come under increased scrutiny for deploying agents in plain clothes and wearing face coverings during operations, a measure officials say is essential to protect both agents and their families from threats. Under the new legislation, California becomes the first state to prohibit enforcement agents from covering their faces, with limited exceptions for undercover operations and medical masks.

What To Know

Newsom signed a series of legislative bills aimed at curbing ICE's ability to conduct raids in sensitive locations such as schools and churches.

Under state law, schools must notify families when immigration officers are present on campus. Student records and classrooms are protected from access by ICE without a judicial warrant or court order, per the new legislation. Similarly, emergency rooms and other nonpublic areas of hospitals are off-limits to immigration enforcement without court authorization, and information collected by health care providers is treated as protected medical data.

The laws also require that law enforcement and immigration officers be clearly identifiable by name or badge number, with exceptions limited to situations where identification is not possible. The use of masks by officers is restricted to cases where it is absolutely necessary.

Additionally, impersonating a federal agent is explicitly defined as a criminal offense, under the bill.

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli told CBS News in an interview on September 22 that California has no jurisdiction to regulate the federal government. His remarks came in response to the recently signed law, which is set to take effect next year. Essayli's statement reflects the federal government's position that state law cannot override federal operations, and he indicated that federal agents in California would not be bound by the state mask restrictions.

DHS has repeatedly claimed that ICE officers have faced a surge in assaults, including attacks using vehicles, as well as online doxing campaigns targeting officers and their families. However, the agency has refused to release a detailed breakdown of the alleged assaults.

Despite the new restrictions, DHS has said that ICE will continue its immigration enforcement operations in California.

The confrontation highlights growing tensions between federal law enforcement agencies and California's state leadership over President Donald Trump's hardline immigration agenda.

Newsom has repeatedly squared off and gone toe to toe with the Trump administration, particularly over immigration raids and the federal deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles in June, despite objections from state leaders.

What People Are Saying

Newsom said on Saturday: ""It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie—unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we've allowed to happen in this country.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: ""He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Eassayli told CBS News: ""The law has no force or effect on federal agencies. The State of California has no jurisdiction to regulate anything that we do in the federal government and I've instructed our agents to disregard it.""

Jason P. Houser, former chief of staff, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and former CBP counterterrorism official, said in a press release: ""Ensuring that officers are clearly identified, while providing sensible exceptions, helps protect both the public and law enforcement personnel. These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.

Alvaro Mejia Ayala, now 22, was arrested and charged with strangulation Sept. 17, the day he’s accused of choking his baby sister, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Leesburg police are not releasing the child’s identity at the request of the family.

Officers responded to Hancock Place NE in Leesburg around 10 a.m. on Sept. 17 for a call involving an infant in medical distress. Despite extensive efforts from first responders and medical professionals to save her life, the child died just after midnight on Tuesday.

Ayala left the scene before officers arrived, according to Leesburg Police Chief Thea Pirnat, but was found several hours later and will face additional charges, including murder. He is currently being held at the county’s detention center.

“The entire process may take several months and this is considered a very active investigation,” Pirnat said during a news conference Tuesday. “Let me be clear, this was not an accident. A child was murdered in a deliberate act. The Leesburg Police Department and our criminal justice partners are fully committed to ensuring that the person responsible is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

Police did not release additional details about the circumstances of the child’s death.

“We will continue to provide information when it is legally and ethically appropriate to do so, but we will not be prematurely releasing details that could compromise the integrity of this investigation or derail the pursuit of justice,” Pirnat said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also issued an immigration detainer for Ayala, according to Pirnat, which requests the jail to hold him for 48 hours longer than the time he’d be released so ICE can take him into federal custody.

In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security said Ayala entered the U.S. with his family in 2016 from El Salvador and that his immigration case was dismissed in October 2024.

“The death of a child is an unbearable loss, and this one has deeply affected the involved family, our community and every first responder that was called to help,” Pirnat said.

Ayala is expected in court in November.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island.","The ACLU of Maine has joined a class action lawsuit alleging that federal immigration officials are violating the constitutional rights of many individuals caught up in the nationwide crackdown on non-citizens.

The lawsuit focuses on whether non-citizens who are detained far from the border are entitled to bond hearings before an immigration judge. That was the practice for nearly 30 years, according to the national ACLU and their state affiliates in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.

But the class action lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts accuses the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security of illegally reversing that precedent by denying detainees the ability to seek release on bond while their immigration cases play out. The groups contend that the agencies are ""systemically misclassifying people arrested inside the United States"" by treating them the same as individuals who are stopped at the border or at ports of entry — a group who can be held without bond hearings under current law.

""This statute has never been applied to people arrested in the interior of the United States and placed in removal proceedings, and this practice blatantly goes against its plain language,” Max Brooks, an immigration attorney for ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. “However, CBP and ICE have begun indefinitely jailing people who are undergoing civil immigration proceedings that can take months or years. This is a clear violation of the due process rights of immigrants as outlined by federal law.""

The lawsuit is just the latest legal challenge of the Trump administration's detention and mass deportation campaign against non-citizens, including many who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and who have no criminal records. Multiple other lawsuits have been filed across the country against the current practice of holding immigrants in detention facilities while their cases work through the immigration courts.

Earlier this month, the Board of Immigration Appeals within the DOJ issued a decision allowing immigration judges to deny detainees access to a bond hearing even if they were stopped far from the border. In its decision, the board noted that judges cannot hold bond hearings for non-citizens who are detained after presenting themselves at the border or at a port of entry.

The board added that interpreting the Immigration and Nationality Act otherwise ""would require reading the (law) to conclude that Congress intended that aliens unlawfully entering the United States without inspection, particularly those who successfully evaded apprehension for more than 2 years, be rewarded with the opportunity for a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge, whereas aliens who present themselves to officers at a port of entry are ineligible for a bond hearing.

Last week, a federal judge in Maine ruled that Customs and Border Patrol agents likely violated a man's due process rights by denying him a bond hearing after he was arrested near Waterville. The judge then prohibited the federal government from transferring the man to a distant detention facility.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island.

President Donald Trump scolded the European nations during his United Nations address on Tuesday morning, specifically over immigration policies in several countries.

Europe has dealt with a major influx of people coming from Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with critics raising concerns about everything from resources to cultural assimilation.

""The U.N. is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them,"" Trump said.

""You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe. Nobody is doing anything to change it to get them out. It's not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it,"" he added.

Trump compared the situation to the United States’ own border crisis under the Biden administration, which led to millions of people entering the country illegally.

In a lengthy Tuesday social media post, Trump rejected the sit-down the White House had agreed to the day before. It would have been the first time the Republican president met with the Democratic Party’s leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, since his return to the White House.

“I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” Trump wrote in the post.

The president complained the Democrats “are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States” unless the Republicans agree to more funding on healthcare for various groups of people he has criticized. Trump did not close the door on a future sit-down with the Democratic leaders, but he warned of a “long and brutal slog” ahead unless Democrats dropped their demands to salvage healthcare funds.

The stalemate over a funding deal — or even talks between the White House and Congress to strike a compromise — has quickly intensified the risk of federal closures, starting as soon as next week, ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for the start of the government’s new fiscal year.

The Democratic leaders swiftly accused the Republican president of throwing a tantrum and running away from the situation.

“Trump Always Chickens Out,” Jeffries posted on X.

In a post on X directed at Trump, Schumer said Democrats will sit down and discuss healthcare “when you’re finished ranting.”

Schumer said Trump “is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there” and would “rather throw a tantrum than do his job.”

Trump has been unafraid of shutting down the government and, during his first term, was president during the nation’s longest federal closure, during the 2018-19 holiday season, when he was pushing Congress to provide funds for his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The president insisted over the weekend that essential services, including those for veterans, would remain open.

Thursday’s scheduled meeting would have potentially set up a showdown at the White House, reminiscent of the 2018 funding fight when Trump led an explosive public session with Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).

Schumer and Jeffries had been demanding a meeting with Trump to work out a compromise over the healthcare funds, and earlier Tuesday had welcomed plans for this week’s meeting.

But the Republican president has been reluctant to enter talks and instructed GOP leaders on Capitol Hill not to negotiate with the Democrats.

The office of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said that the Democrats are holding government funding “hostage” to their demands for vast amounts of healthcare funding.

Republicans, who have the majority in both the House and the Senate, have been trying to avoid a shutdown. Johnson had led the passage late last week of a temporary funding measure, which would have kept government offices running into November while talks get underway.

That’s the typical way to buy time during funding fights, but the measure failed in the Senate. Democrats refused to support the stopgap bill because it did not include their priorities of healthcare funds. A Democratic proposal, with the healthcare money restored, was defeated by Senate Republicans.

The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted earlier this year.

Republicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.

Congress was sent home amid the logjam, and the House called off next week’s session. But Jeffries, in a letter to colleagues, summoned House Democrats back to work on Monday evening, when senators are also expected to resume their session — days before the funding deadline.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e30cb1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5486x2880+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2Fbe%2Feaf2230e44fe9748a6caabd70d8b%2Fd67c463ecca84fc3a6ec45874cd6f963.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:57:51.119617

A community coalition, armed with more than 17,800 petition signatures, has for months pushed the city to revoke the conditional land use permit that allows ICE to operate the state’s only ICE facility, located at 4310 SW Macadam Avenue.

Last week, the city issued a land use violation notice against ICE over prolonged or overnight detentions that violated the conditions of the land use approval. “U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement.

In July, Fox12 revealed that ICE repeatedly detained people for more than 24 hours, despite the permit stipulating that detainees cannot be held overnight or for more than 12 hours. Federal data showed that ICE had violated its permit at least 25 times, the city says.

In response to Next City’s request for comment, the ICE field office pointed to Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin’s written statement: “Mayor Wilson’s claims of substandard conditions at ICE facilities are categorically FALSE.” McLaughlin also stated, “ICE has taken action to ensure that detainees are not held for more than 12 hours, including by increasing staffing and other resources provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Advocates have long called for the permit, issued in 2011, to be pulled. In addition to alleged permit violations, they’ve cited public safety concerns for nearby residents — including children at the Cottonwood School next door, which moved in August over ICE’s use of chemical sprays against protestors, among other concerns.

But the new data changed the calculus for local lawmakers. “If we allow ICE to continue to operate when they have violated their permits, that means anything becomes permissible moving forward,” city councilor Angelita Morillo said in a July council meeting.

The permit fight and what comes next

With advocates calling on the city to shut down the Southwest Portland ICE facility for months, city administrators submitted a memo to the mayor over the summer outlining processes for any potential code violations, including noise violations and nuisance complaints.

On July 21, following the publication of data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by UCLA researchers, Portland Permitting and Development received a formal complaint alleging that ICE was violating the 12-hour detention limit. To proceed with such a complaint, the city would have to gain access to both the building and ICE records.

The violation notice prompts a process to determine whether the facility’s operation complies with the conditions of its land use permit. ICE has 30 days to correct the alleged violation; otherwise, the city can issue a fine or schedule a hearing to reconsider the approval. Following the results of the hearing, any member of the public would be able to request an appeal with Portland’s city council.

That lengthy process frustrates some on the city council. Councilor Sameer Kanal tells Next City he’d like to see the city pursue other strategies to curb ICE’s local presence, such as banning chemical munitions routinely used against protesters. “They are collective punishment,” he says. “And we could prohibit that.”

Still, for immigration advocates this latest development is a small victory. Susan Anglada Bartley, an original petitioner of revoking the land use permit, tells Next City that “the combination of direct action…the petition, the coalition around the petition, and the amazing work of frontliners…are all components of why the city had to finally admit that the facility is operating in violation of the permit.”

Closing sanctuary loopholes

There’s precedent for this kind of grassroots pressure in Oregon. In 2020, NORCOR, a regional jail in the City of The Dalles, ended its contract with ICE and stopped detaining individuals on civil immigration charges in the face of community opposition and lawsuits alleging violations of the state’s sanctuary law.

On the heels of that decision, Oregon updated its sanctuary state status and passed the Sanctuary Promise Act, banning private immigration detention facilities within the state.

What is a sanctuary policy?

A sanctuary city or state is defined by its commitment to limit or refuse to share information with federal immigration officers regarding its constituents or citizens. It’s a broad term with little legal or universal determination, meaning it can cover a broad array of policies implemented by states, cities, jurisdictions, buildings and other entities to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Read more.

This distinction is important, experts explain. The Portland ICE facility’s building is owned by 4310 Building LLC, a shell company for developer Stuart Lindquist, incorporated by his attorneys at Kell, Alterman & Runstein. (Lindquist made headlines in 2018 after admitting to striking an anti-ICE protester with his car, telling media afterward that he was willing to fight protesters: “I’d be glad to take them on one at a time, bring ‘em on.”) Attorneys representing Lindquist did not respond to Next City’s inquiries.

For use of his building, ICE pays 4310 Building LLC roughly $2.45 million a year on a lease set to expire in 2033. Because ICE operates the site — rather than a private contractor — the facility has avoided running afoul of Oregon’s sanctuary law.

The controversial arrangement has left advocates questioning what it means for Oregon to be a sanctuary state if private individuals are allowed to profit from the surveillance, apprehension and detention of individuals undergoing a civil process.

“Oregon is a sanctuary state by name only,” Susan Anglada Bartley wrote in a message to Next City, “We’ve called out our city and state governments for complicity with ICE for many years. In order to approach being a sanctuary, complicity with ICE & GEO-Group must end!”

Local officials are working on strategies to reduce ICE’s power. Councilor Morillo’s office, for example, is currently developing policies to prevent private security forces from being used to detain immigrants; to reduce federal officials’ ability to use surveillance technology despite Portland’s strict rules on facial recognition and other surveillance technology; and to financially disincentivize landlords from leasing property to ICE or its contractors, due to the increased security and environmental cleanup costs that their operations incur on the city.

Despite local efforts in sanctuary cities and states, ICE’s operations are rapidly expanding nationally. A recent Washington Post investigation found that federal officials are looking to hire more than 10,000 new immigration officers and procure 300 new ICE offices across the country “as fast as possible.”

ICE has made about three times as many arrests between May and July as it did during the same period last year, per government figures obtained by the Deportation Data Project, though about half of detainees have no criminal record and are not facing criminal charges.

The consequences of closure

Meanwhile, some immigration advocates are conflicted about closing ICE’s Southwest Portland field office. The ACLU of Oregon has argued that its removal could make it harder for Oregon-based immigrants to access attorneys while detailed or to be released in the state.

That could lead to detainees being transported to ICE contractor GEO Group’s notorious detention center in Tacoma, Washington. The 1,575-bed facility has been the subject of multiple controversies — including the GEO Group paying a maximum of $1 a day to the detained migrants it had cleaning these facilities.

“If people are being held but can’t say where they are, or they’re being sent straight to Tacoma, that time [for lawyers] to respond and to get people out of detention is just gone,” Natalie Lerner, a board member at Portland Immigrants Rights Coalition, told Street Roots.

But immigration lawyers say release is rare regardless of where a person is detained.

Shizuko Hashimoto, a partner at Immigrant Law Group LLC, says that in her 10 years of experience, once a person is detained on civil immigration charges it is next to impossible to get them out, especially lately.

“I don’t think anybody has been successful at advocating for somebody who [ICE] detained actually being released,” says Shizuko Hashimoto, a partner at Immigrant Law Group LLC.

She describes a common practice under the Trump administration where attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security submit a motion to dismiss the deportation proceedings, only for individuals to find ICE waiting outside the courtroom to deport them through the administration’s expedited removal process.

Legal scholars stress how unusual the U.S. approach is. “There is no similar circumstance where we put people in a carceral space for a civil violation,” says Juliet Stumpf, chair of Lewis and Clark Law School and an expert on immigration law.

For Councilor Kanal, the fight underscores the need to codify Portland’s sanctuary city status and bring transparency to ICE operations in the city. Still, he recognizes the limitations of what local governments can do under Trump’s administration.

“We as Portlanders can’t solve ICE alone,” he says.

President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to conduct what it calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained.

Newsweek has revealed dozens of cases involving green card holders and applicants who were swept up in the ICE raids. Critics say the administration's hard-line stance is aggressive and have accused the agency of racial profiling, ignoring due process rights, and of human rights abuses.

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: I’m a researcher and journalist who covers the far right.
KAT ABUGHAZALEH: — actual voters.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We end today’s show in Chicago, where Juan is. As at least 10 people were arrested in protests outside an ICE facility Friday, with federal immigration agents firing pepper balls and using tear gas on the crowd, Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh was thrown to the ground by ICE agents. People had rallied outside the facility to protest the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has led to the arrest of nearly 550 people in a sweeping crackdown on immigrants in the city.

We are going to Chicago, where we’re joined by Kat Abughazaleh, who is a progressive congressional candidate in Illinois’s 9th District, which includes Chicago.

Kat, welcome to Democracy Now! Describe what happened to you. We’re going to show the video.

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: Yeah, so, this is actually the third time that ICE has thrown me to the ground. I have been at this facility for the last three weeks every Friday morning, and I’ll be back this Friday. I encourage anyone in Illinois to join me, 7 to 9 a.m. at 1930 Beach Street, B-E-A-C-H. This was, as I said, the third time that ICE has done this to me. It was probably the most violent occasion of throwing me to the ground. But, essentially, a car was about to run over a fellow protester, and so I went to check on that person. And that was all the justification an officer needed to pick me up and throw me to the ground despite being half his size.

And what I really want to stress here is that is what these officers are willing to do when there is press and cameras around. The reason we are protesting at this facility is because they are committing human rights abuses within the Broadview processing facility. It is a processing facility, so people are not supposed to be kept there for more than 12 hours at a time, but they are being kept for days or weeks, without beds, without hot meals, with hygienic products. And if they are willing to do that to a congressional candidate on camera in front of press, imagine what they are willing to do to their detainees behind boarded-up windows.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Kat, you say you found two badges there. What did it say on the badges?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: So, I have no idea, the people who have accosted me. I have no idea who they are. I have no idea who these men are. They have had masks and sunglasses and hats, sometimes when the sun is still down. We have seen two badge numbers the entire three weeks that we have been here — four weeks, if we include a vigil earlier in the summer — and they were just numbers. There was no name, and there was no identifying law enforcement agency. I have no idea if these men are actually affiliated with ICE. For all I know, this could just be random men who said, “I’m going to put on a mask and a costume I got from Spirit Halloween to make me feel like I’m in the Army, and go and rough up some protesters today.” We have no idea who these people are.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in terms of what you know about the conditions in the Broadview facility, could you talk about that?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: Yes, this Broadview facility is horrific. We’ve gotten reporting about dozens of people being kept in one cell. And these are our neighbors. These are pregnant women and grandmothers sleeping on concrete floors. I have not been inside the facility. Elected officials that have tried to inspect it have not been allowed inside. But I can attest that two weeks ago, when I saw prisoners being marched into a van, they were in the same clothes they were detained in, and we have no idea how long they’ve been in there, and they were in the same clothes they were detained in. The conditions at this facility are horrendous. They are committing crimes against humanity. And it is so important to remember that all of the treatment that we went through as protesters doesn’t hold a candle to what these detainees are dealing with. I mean, ICE agents shot and killed a man two Fridays ago in the Chicago area. They are able to act with impunity. They are able to hurt whoever they want. Last Friday was the first time they had taken protesters inside the facility.

And while the video of me being thrown to the ground has gone kind of viral, I want to talk about a few other things that happened that day, because they haven’t been covered as much. We had to play tug of war with a man’s body to keep him from being abducted inside the facility. Right before we were tear-gassed, ICE was carrying a van with a protester that had been detained inside of the van. We stood arm in arm. All this is happening on Broadview public property, on public streets. They tried to ram the van through us. A man fell in front of the van, and the van was going to drive over his head, and I helped him up before that happened. But they were totally willing to do that. They shot a man in the face with a pepper ball bullet. They tear-gassed us as they were trying to drive a car through a crowd. And then, after that, they threw a tear gas canister at the press area, very intentionally, after protesters were already dispersing, because, you know, we were coughing and trying to get tear gas out of our eyes.

AMY GOODMAN: Kat Abughazaleh, you are running for Congress, a congressional candidate in Illinois’s 9th District, which includes Chicago. The election is in November of ’26, the ultimate election. Why are you running for Congress?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: I’m a researcher and journalist who covers the far right. I have spent my career deradicalizing and educating people on far-right narratives and misinformation. I have spent my career, just as my colleagues have, trying to get Democrats to put up a resistance to the far right, to understand that the old playbook is gone and that it’s not coming back. And I don’t feel like our leaders are doing that. And so I got sick of waiting around, and I decided to run the type of campaign I think we should.

And that is with unapologetic progressivism, anti-fascism and using our resources to materially improve people’s lives right now. So, we do voter outreach, but our campaign office also doubles as a mutual aid hub. We don’t ask for $500 a plate at an event. For our kickoff event, for instance, we asked people to bring a box of pads or tampons for Chicago’s Period Collective. We are about mobilizing people on the ground right now and making politics as accessible as possible, while also not compromising on basic human rights.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you’re running for the seat to replace Jan Schakowsky, who’s retiring. There are several other candidates running in that field right now. Why do you think that voters would be best choosing you as the candidate?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: You know, Illinois does a lot of things right, and that’s the reason they aren’t dealing with, until very recently, people like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk on a daily basis. I have been. I am the only candidate in my race with a track record of fighting and winning against the far right.

I am the most effective communicator in my race. And I am the only candidate in my race to have the majority of her money come from small-dollar donations. We’ve raised over a million dollars, and our average donation is just 32 bucks. We have over 7,000 volunteers, and that’s not because I’m some force. It’s because people want progressive policies. They want commonsense policies. They want a center that recenters —

Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random.
For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.
Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21.
In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000.","After announcing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, the Trump administration on Tuesday proposed overhauling the visa’s lottery selection process to prioritize higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign employees.

The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers.

The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21.

The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade.

The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random.

The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once.

The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and ""incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.”

It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.”

'A strong signal'

The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields.

The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S.

If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said.

Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.”

For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data.

The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months.

If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.

Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said.

Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies.

“Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote.

Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict.

Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants.

Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000.

Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court.

A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000.

Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250225-h1b-visa-aa-1223-0c502d.jpg",N,,2025-09-23 17:57:39.580541

DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin on Tuesday strongly rejected a report from NBC News alleging that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents used a 5-year-old autistic girl as ""bait"" to arrest her father, an illegal alien from Guatemala, in Massachusetts.

A video obtained by Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra shows the girl sitting beside a law enforcement SUV, holding a bottle, while surrounded by several male officers outside her home in Leominster last Tuesday.

NBC reported that the father, Edwards Hip Mejia, told his wife he believed he was being followed and drove home. Once there, he allegedly ran toward the parking lot, but agents ""grabbed"" their daughter, the wife told Telemundo.

On Saturday California Governor Gavin Newsom gave his assent to a bill forbidding local or federal law enforcement agents to wear ski masks, neck gaiters, or other face coverings while on official business.

Wearing masks is rare in the history of American law enforcement, but has become routine under the Trump administration as agents reportedly racing to fulfill stringent arrest quotas round up thousands of immigrants without criminal records.

""It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie — unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,"" Newsom said as he signed the bill. ""This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we’ve allowed to happen in this country.""

But on Monday DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said her forces would defy the ban, calling it ""a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and P.R. stunt.""

“Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement,"" said McLaughlin in a statement.

""At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000 percent increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections...

""To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom’s unconstitutional ban.""

DHS spokespeople have repeatedly claimed that masks are necessary to protect its agents, giving ever-increasing figures for the rise in assaults from 300 percent in April to 500 percent in June to 1,000 percent today.

But officials have repeatedly refused to release the underlying data, give further details, or clarify what counts as an assault, leading many journalists to question such numbers.

ICE arrests have also doubled or tripled in many states, meaning incidents stemming from arrests would naturally also increase. What little data DHS has released show that the overall number of incidents was quite low, with 79 assaults in the first half of 2025 compared to 10 the previous year.

In response to questions from The Independent, a DHS spokesperson once again declined to give details, saying all immigration agents are clearly marked as law enforcement while on duty.

In an interview with Fox News, Bill Essayli, the Acting U.S. Attorney for Central California, accused Democrats of whipping up a violent fervor against ICE agents simply doing their jobs.

""The left continues to fuel this insanity, [this] hysteria, that the federal government is somehow an illegitimate force and it's okay to oppose ICE.

""So what they do is lay the gasoline and the matches out and they get people spun up and they hope that someone does what they want 'em to do, which is burn the place down because they don't get their way.

""We're not putting up with it, and if you try that here, you'll end up in handcuffs.""

Critics say that routine mask-wearing insulates ICE agents against the consequences of breaking rules or abusing detainees, as well as making it easier for criminals to impersonate law enforcement.

Whether California's ban is constitutional remains unclear. In general, U.S. states can't regulate the federal government but can force federal agents to follow local laws as long as it does not undermine their work.

The U.S. president claimed that scientific predictions made by U.N. bodies were wrong and blasted wind farms and other renewable energy projects.
The U.S. president mentioned that the two leaders briefly spoke as they passed each other on the path to the main speaker podium.","Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has scaled back U.S. support of the U.N. This includes withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council again and pulling funding for some of the body’s key programs, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), an agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees.

Most recently, the Trump administration announced the U.S. wouldn’t participate in a U.N. review of the country’s human rights record.

Early into his nearly hourlong remarks on Tuesday, Trump said the global body is “not even coming close to living up” to its potential.

“All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up,” the president said. “It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war, and wars, is action.”

Trump’s wandering speech had no shortage of false claims and contradictions. He touted peace while telling drug cartels he would blow them “out of existence.” He questioned the purpose of the U.N.’s existence, but later in the morning told the U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres that the U.S. “is behind the United Nations 100%.”

“I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it because the potential for peace at this institution is great,” he said.

Here’s are some highlights from Trump’s U.N. speech:

1. A teleprompter malfunction from the start

Watch the clip in the player above.

While opening his speech, Trump told the room that the teleprompter wasn’t working, saying that whoever was operating it was “in big trouble.” He later mocked the U.N. for having a “bad escalator.”

2. Trump claimed he has “ended seven wars,” while the U.N. offered empty words

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump, who is campaigning for a Nobel Peace Prize, boasted how he — and not the U.N. — has been a key player in settling global conflicts. But Trump’s repeated claims of being a peacemaker are complicated. Some of the conflicts he has cited in the past have not been wars or have yet to end.

3. Trump pushes back on countries who recognized a Palestinian state

Watch the clip in the player above.

This week alone, Britain, Canada, Australia, Portugal and France all formally recognized a Palestinian state, despite opposition from the U.S. and Israel. Trump said this upswell of support for Palestine would “encourage continued conflict” and would be a “reward” for Hamas, which carried out the Oct. 7 attack almost two years ago that set off the war in Gaza.

4. Trump urges Europe to “step it up” against Russia

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump said if Russia does not end its invasion of Ukraine, he is prepared to impose “a strong round of powerful tariffs.” He then told European nations to “step it up” and stop importing Russian oil.

5. Trump tells countries they’re “going to hell” over migration

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump scolded representatives for their countries’ immigration policies, while upholding his mass deportation agenda in the U.S. as the best way to address the “crisis of uncontrolled migration.” This led the president to say, “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.”

6. Trump described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”

Watch the clip in the player above.

The U.S. president claimed that scientific predictions made by U.N. bodies were wrong and blasted wind farms and other renewable energy projects. He instead encouraged countries to buy fossil fuels from the U.S.

7. As tensions between Brazil and U.S. mount, their leaders give contrasting speeches

As is tradition, Brazil led off the first day of speeches.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or Lula as he’s better known, warned that multilateralism, or international cooperation, “is at a new crossroads.”

“Throughout the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms. They worship violence, praise ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,” Lula said, through an interpreter, in his nearly 19-minute speech.

Trump, who delivered his speech right after Lula, levied a 50% tariff on many Brazilian goods largely as a penalty for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who was earlier this month found guilty of a coup plot.

Though Trump criticized Brazil in his remarks, he did at one point strike a softer tone.

Watch the clip in the player above.

The U.S. president mentioned that the two leaders briefly spoke as they passed each other on the path to the main speaker podium.

“I saw him, he saw me, and we embraced,” Trump said. “But he seemed like a very nice man, actually. He liked me, I liked him,” Trump said, prompting chatter and a smattering of applause from global leaders in the room.

“We actually agreed that we would meet next week,” Trump said, though he didn’t provide details on this possible meet-up.

The U.S. president quickly returned to his criticism of Lula’s country, saying, “Brazil is doing poorly.”

In an interview Monday, Lula told PBS News Hour co-anchor Amna Nawaz that people ask him whether he likes Trump.

Watch the segment in the player above.

“It’s not an issue of whether I like him or not,” he said.

“What matters is that he’s the head of state of the United States, and I’m the head of state in Brazil. And as two heads of state, we have to respect each other, because we were elected democratically by the people of our countries, and we need to give support to these people and to govern them the best way possible,” he added.

Her story is part of a disturbing rise in pregnant people suddenly being approached by border patrol officers or plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. As ICE raids have devastated more families in recent months, immigrant and reproductive rights advocates have raised concerns about the impact of the raids on the reproductive health of those arrested, detained, and forcibly separated from their families.

The harms inflicted on immigrants, especially the medical neglect and abuse of pregnant people, are not only an immigration justice crisis, they’re a reproductive justice crisis as well. Reproductive justice — a movement and framework created by Black women and other women of color — is defined as the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children or not have children, and parent children in safe and sustainable communities. The simultaneous withdrawal of abortion access and this country’s long-standing history of injustice against Black and Brown people has created near-dystopian conditions for immigrant communities, where access to both reproductive care and freedom from deportation are increasingly under attack.

In the past six months, Fund Texas Choice, a statewide abortion practical support organization that fills in gaps to accessing essential health care, has seen up close how immigrant justice and reproductive justice go hand in hand. We have supported more than 600 clients — purchasing plane tickets, arranging rides, and making sure folks have enough money to buy food while they travel an average of 1,400 miles to their appointments. Year after year, Texans continue seeking our help in high numbers, and we’ve seen an increase in support requests. We often hear from our clients that they have to decide between buying a plane ticket to access reproductive health care or paying their rent.

Amid the immigration crackdown nationally and in Texas, our clients are facing more barriers than ever before. To leave the Rio Grande Valley and head north, travelers are required to cross a border checkpoint, sometimes more than one. This is also the largest border checkpoint region in the U.S.

Latine people in Texas are living under one of the most restrictive abortion regimes in the country. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, Latine people represent the largest group of people of color impacted by current abortion bans. Texas is home to more than 2.9 million Latine people of childbearing age, and of this number, 1.9 million are economically insecure. The average cost to travel out of state for abortion care can range anywhere from $500 to $1,000, which does not even include the cost of the procedure.

There are factors to consider that logistically put abortion care beyond reach for millions of people — things like child care, transportation, not having access to paid time off, and living in rural areas, to name a few.

For Latine communities, the compounded impact of anti-immigration laws, surveillance, and the threat of deportation, detention, or forced family separation often makes traveling for abortion care impossible.

Criminalization and Cultural Bias in the Shadow of the “Muslim Ban”

As workers for an abortion practical support fund, as well as members of these immigrant communities, we’ve witnessed the acceleration of abortion surveillance and criminalization up close. We’ve had family members, neighbors, and friends face insurmountable obstacles that stand in the way of their reproductive autonomy.

When seeking abortion care, Muslims not only face the abortion access crisis affecting all Texans but also often face increased risks of surveillance and religious-based discrimination. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, 17 states have total abortion bans or restricted access to the first six weeks of pregnancy, rendering abortion inaccessible for at least 824,000 Muslims across the U.S. Between racial profiling and anti-Muslim bias, many Muslims are afraid of interstate travel, especially those with complex immigration statuses. Muslim women face disparities in reproductive health care compared to other groups, especially visibly Muslim women who wear the hijab.

Latine Muslims, who represent 9 percent of the U.S. Muslim population, are on the front lines of navigating an increasingly hostile political landscape. Black Muslim immigrants in the U.S. face heightened state-sanctioned police violence and anti-Black racism, conditions that contribute to some of the worst childbirth outcomes in the country. Texas alone has one of the highest maternal mortality rates, and both Black and Latine mothers are disproportionately affected. Many overlapping obstacles underscore how immigration justice is inseparable from reproductive justice, including Muslim communities that tackle racial, religious, and immigration-based marginalization.

The post-Roe legal landscape has opened the door for law enforcement to exploit virtually any form of data — license plates, phone records, geolocation data — to pursue individuals across state lines. When seeking abortion care, immigrant communities are more likely to have a target on their back.

What Does This All Mean?

HB 7, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this month, is the fourth anti-abortion measure to exist in Texas. This law seeks to cut off access to medication abortion from inside and outside of Texas, and create a chilling effect beyond Texas borders, which is why it’s more important than ever to tap into organizations who’ve been championing abortion rights in the state for over a decade. Supporting your local abortion fund is one of the most direct ways to ensure that the people most harmed by the anti-abortion and anti-immigrant landscape in the South still have options for care.

Bodily autonomy is threatened in clinics, at the borders, at the hands of oppressive laws, and at every checkpoint. As abortion practical support organizers, we understand the strain of layered oppressive systems that work to weaken options for immigrants and other marginalized people. The U.S. immigration system is replete with measures that violently strip immigrants of their reproductive freedom. These conversations must be had in tandem.

How do the new National Defense Areas relate to immigration violations that the government might bring against noncitizens?","In April, the Trump administration began declaring parts of the U.S.-Mexico border region as “National Defense Areas” (NDAs), as if they were restricted-access military bases.

These NDA declarations aim to give the Department of Defense (DOD) new enforcement powers along the border. For immigrant communities, the stakes are especially high: crossing into an NDA now means risking federal trespassing charges in addition to immigration charges. U.S. citizens, too, may face prosecution if they enter poorly marked areas while traveling, hiking, hunting, or working near the border.

The creation of NDAs is part of a broader pattern in President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant strategy and his efforts to push toward an unprecedented deployment of military power throughout the country. Communities are effectively cut off from access to public lands, while states are forced to grapple with heightened enforcement and diminished transparency.

Below we break down what the new “National Defense Areas” are, how they impact our rights, and how they harm our communities.

Where are the new “National Defense Areas”?

Earlier this year, President Trump issued a memorandum transferring control of certain federal public lands along the southern border to the DOD. The secretary of defense can now designate these lands as NDAs, and has already done so in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

When describing the new areas, federal officials have typically sought to minimize their size by focusing on the inclusion of a narrow, 60-foot border buffer zone, known as the “Roosevelt Reservation,” which runs parallel to some sections of the U.S.-Mexico land border. However, in some areas the NDAs extend much farther north, encompassing highways, desert lands, and areas used by local communities.

100 Mile Border Zone

The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects people from random and arbitrary stops and searches. Although the federal government claims...

100 Mile Border Zone. Explore Your Rights.

For example the New Mexico NDA alone encompasses over 400 square miles, according to an analysis by Source New Mexico. The Texas NDA stretches for 63 miles, from El Paso to Fort Hancock. Other NDAs include those in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and in Yuma County, Arizona. Each of them are characterized as military “installations” extending from — and often very far beyond — a specific military base.

The NDAs do not include land managed or owned by federally recognized tribes. Nor do they include non-federal land, such as state parks. However, if a person visits a state park or lives on tribal or privately owned land, and they accidentally cross into an NDA, they risk being stopped, questioned, searched, and wrongly accused of intentionally entering into the restricted area.

What power does the Federal Government assert in the National Defense Areas?

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its Border Patrol agents already surveil the region and have long-standing powers to question and arrest people who enter into the United States unlawfully. Inside NDAs, the government also asserts authority for U.S. troops to question, search and temporarily detain alleged trespassers. This risks blurring the line between civilian law enforcement and military authority.

What are the legal risks of entering a National Defense Area without permission?

Under federal law, entering one of these areas without permission can result in criminal charges for trespassing on military property, including:

18 U.S.C. § 1382 – entering military property without authorization. Punishable by up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine

50 U.S.C. § 797 – willfully violating a security regulation for military property. Punishable by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

In recent months, people apprehended inside NDAs have already been charged under these laws.

How do the new National Defense Areas relate to immigration violations that the government might bring against noncitizens?

This depends on your citizenship status.

If you are a U.S. citizen:

You cannot be charged with unlawful entry (or re-entry) to the United States under 8 U.S.C. 1325 or 1326, but you can still face federal trespass charges;

You risk facing trespass charges if you cross into an NDA, for example when pulling off a highway, or hiking or hunting in desert lands.

If you are not a U.S. citizen:

You face the same potential trespass charges, plus potential immigration charges, such as:

8 U.S.C. § 1325 – unlawful entry.

8 U.S.C. § 1326 – unlawful re-entry after deportation.

That means if a non-citizen is arrested within an NDA and is suspected of unauthorized entry into the U.S., they face the risk of three separate charges – unauthorized entry into a military property, willful violation of a security regulation, and unlawful entry or reentry.

If you are charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 or 50 U.S.C. § 797 for entering a National Defense Area, you have the right to a lawyer and the opportunity to challenge the charges in court. You are entitled to make the government prove its case against you. Anyone facing these charges should speak with an attorney as soon as possible for legal advice.

Are the NDAs clearly marked in order to prevent people from accidentally crossing into them?

No.

The government says it has posted warning signs, but the signs are small, only in English and Spanish, and few and far between. According to court filings, the signs are placed inside the NDAs, set back from the U.S.-Mexico border line, which means that people entering the NDA from Mexico have already crossed into the restricted area before having any opportunity to read the signs. The signs reportedly face south, which means that people entering the NDA from the north are unlikely to see any signs before crossing into the NDA.

A spokesperson for New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich noted that the NDAs have “huge implications for anyone unwittingly driving along Highway 9 who might pull over to stretch their legs and unwittingly trespass on a military base.”

If you are near the southern border, exercise caution and try to avoid accidentally crossing into an NDA. Consulting visual maps may be helpful, but DOD has not published maps of each NDA and the available maps are insufficiently detailed to offer specific demarcations for people in the general vicinity.

Can I take photos or make a video of an NDA or an interaction with an official within an NDA?

Yes, but with caution.

Taking photographs and videos of places, people, and objects that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes the exterior of federal buildings, and police, troops, and other government officials carrying out their duties.

However, under 18 USC § 795, Congress has made it a crime to photograph, sketch, map or draw “certain vital military or naval installations or equipment,” punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to a year, or both. The DOD has posted signs near NDAs, citing this crime, implying that this law applies to these new areas.

The ACLU’s position is that when you are lawfully in a public space — including a public space adjacent to but outside the boundaries of a NDA or military installation — you have the right to photograph and take video of anything that is in plain view.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/nda-southern-border-social.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 15:58:09.903841

Human rights, based on human dignity, neither start nor stop at national borders.
Let there be no more Alcatrazes.","Forty-one years ago, I joined the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department, located in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. As a first-generation college student from a working-class family, I needed money to pay for my undergraduate studies, so I worked in the jail, which today has over 1000 personnel and an average daily population of 3000 inmates in its minimum, medium, and maximum facilities.

For four difficult years I worked in maximum security. While I sometimes dodged—not always successfully—fists, cups of urine, and excrement, I heard some of the foulest insults and swear words also thrown in my direction. I encountered not only hostility but also hopelessness. Some inmates were friendly and kind to me, though. And I was educated through this experience as much as I was by my classes at college, although the latter provided a much-needed respite as well as a source of hope for my future.

On the basis of that real-life education, as well as my education in Catholic theology, I reject the current administration’s plans to incarcerate migrants and refugees in brutal facilities modelled after the notorious maximum-security prison Alcatraz.

Earlier this year, President Donald J. Trump announced on Truth Social, “I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent offenders.” The prison, closed in 1963 by then-U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, has been a popular museum administered by the National Park Service since 1972.

Although reopening the penitentiary seems unlikely, since it is small and doing so would be expensive, other “Alcatrazes” are popping up or planned. In addition to “Alligator Alcatraz,” which a federal appeals court has allowed to resume operations after a lower court ordered a halt to it, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has announced plans to open a similar center, called “Deportation Depot,” near Jacksonville, Florida. Plus, additional facilities to hold immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, often wearing masks, are in the works in South Carolina and other states.

One of the things I learned first-hand when I worked in the jail was how entrenched racism is in the U.S. criminal justice system—in the disproportionate number of persons of color among the incarcerated, as well as in the racist attitudes and actions of some (not all) of my fellow officers. I remember feeling uncomfortable during roll call one night when an officer proudly showed us a thank-you note and flag he received from the government of South Africa for his support of its policy (at the time) of apartheid.

At the same time, though, one of my lieutenants gave me The Gulag Archipelago by Soviet and Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, because he knew I was studying political science, with particular attention to authoritarian regimes and totalitarianism. Occasionally an inmate would compare the jail to a gulag or concentration camp, and I would recoil at the very suggestion. The jail was not even close to resembling a Nazi concentration camp or a Soviet-era gulag, and I couldn’t imagine anything like the internment camps of Japanese Americans happening in the United States again.

Yet here we are. Alligator Alcatraz and these other detention and deportation facilities are neither a jail, where arrested persons who are innocent until proven guilty await trial, nor a prison, where convicted persons are sent after their trial. They are more like a concentration or internment camp where persons are detained due to their nationality or ethnicity—and, regardless of whether they have criminal convictions or, if they do (and not all do), whether these are serious (attempted murder) or minor (traffic violations). Alligator Alcatraz’s tents and cages, especially when exposed to severe weather, must be punishingly brutal for these detainees, unlike for inmates in a temperature-controlled jail or prison.

As for those who are working in these new facilities, I worry about their training and qualifications. The staff at Alligator Alcatraz includes about 70 Florida National Guard troops and private security guards rather than professionally trained correctional officers—although Dynamic Integrated Security Inc., a Coral Springs-based private security firm, advertised for both security and correctional officer positions.

Unlike soldiers and security guards, however, correctional officers in Florida receive 420 hours of academy training (up from the 320 I received in 1984). This includes not only defence techniques, physical fitness, and firearms training, but also training in first aid, communications, and responding to other emergencies such as fires and suicide attempts. I relied on such training, including responding to fires and suicide attempts, numerous times when I was a correctional officer.

Moreover, that training included a unit on professional ethics. Although my coworkers and I did not always live up to them, we were expected to adhere to a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for correctional officers, including respect for an inmate’s right not to be discriminated against for their skin pigmentation, physical appearance, gender or sexual orientation, along with their rights to receive basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, decent living conditions, health care, and pastoral care.

From an ethical standpoint, and moreover from a Catholic moral perspective, the theological basis for Catholic teaching on both detention and deportation is our belief in the fundamental dignity of the human person, who is created in God’s image and likeness (Gen 1:26). This is foundational for Catholics on the sanctity of all human life.

Dignitas Infinita, issued last year by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, begins: “Every human person possesses an infinite dignity, inalienably grounded in his or her very being, which prevails in and beyond every circumstance, state, or situation the person may ever encounter.” Additionally, this “principle, which is fully recognizable even by reason alone, underlies the primacy of the human person and the protection of human rights.” Non-Catholics, too, should be able to recognize and respect human dignity and human rights. Here Dignitas Infinita mentions the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, following the atrocities of the Holocaust. Human rights, based on human dignity, neither start nor stop at national borders.

Accompanying the respect for the inherent dignity of the unborn and of terminally ill persons, Catholics are expected to recognize that of migrants and incarcerated persons. In Caritas in Veritate (Charity in Truth), Pope Benedict XVI wrote that “every migrant is a human person who, as such, possesses fundamental, inalienable rights that must be respected by everyone and in every circumstance.” This moral stance does not call for a policy of open borders, but it does circumscribe policies regarding vetting of migrants and their admission into a nation. It would also reject outright rejection or deportation of migrants.

Similarly, in Evangelium Vitae (On the Inviolability of Human Life), Pope John Paul II claimed, “Not even a murderer loses his personal dignity, and God himself pledges to guarantee this.” On top of this, Pope Francis held that life imprisonment was contrary to human dignity. Although the magisterial viewpoint of these two popes does not mean setting free all who are convicted of committing crimes, including violent ones, it does rule out cruel and dehumanizing punishment and treatment.

To be sure, magisterial teaching—from Gaudium et Spes (Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World) to John Paul II’s Veritatis Splendor (On the Church’s Moral Teaching) to Dignitas Infinita– consistently holds that “whatever insults human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation,” along with “others of their like are infamies indeed.” The words “subhuman” and “arbitrary” are significant, and I would add “indiscriminate” before “deportation” because, after proper vetting and due process, some persons with a record of violence should perhaps be given due process and a fair trial, or maybe extradited to their country of origin for such procedural justice.

These authoritative documents claim these grave moral evils not only “poison human society, but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury.” Although I am not sure whether the moral injury for the guards is more harm than the actual physical and mental harms for the detainees, I am concerned, not only as a theologian but also as a former corrections officer, about the harmful effects for them both. Let there be no more Alcatrazes.

Why It Matters

Democrats are hoping to retake control of the House and Senate in 2026, as the party in the White House historically loses seats during the midterms—and polls have Democrats leading the generic ballot.

But the Supreme Court is considering several cases that could change the legal playbook on a number of areas of election law for the midterms and beyond.

What To Know

There are three cases the Supreme Court is set to rule on, including Louisiana v. Callais, in which a group of white voters sued Louisiana over its current congressional map, which has two majority-Black districts. They argue the map constitutes a racial gerrymander that dilutes the power of white voters.

If a majority of justices on the nation's highest court agree with them, the state's map could return to a similar configuration it had before 2024, when the state had only one majority-Black district around New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

However, some voting rights activists are concerned that the court could issue a broader ruling that would overturn Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering. If the court were to overturn that section more broadly, other Republican-led states could also redraw their congressional lines to erase majority-Black districts that reliably vote for Democrats.

Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University, told Newsweek that if the decision in this case comes early—and the court overturns Section 2—that could give states enough time to redraw their maps. If they don't give a ruling by the spring, however, it would likely be too late to change redistricting plans for the midterms.

""The case could be narrowly focused on just districts in Louisiana or have broader significance in terms of the meaning and enforceability of the Voting Rights Act,"" he said. ""At the very least, there is a serious chance it would lead to undoing of the current plan in Louisiana. Beyond that, depending on what court says, it could lead to more challenges to current districting plans in other states.""

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek that the Supreme Court has been ""steadily chipping away"" at the Voting Rights Act, and that the outcome of the ruling could ""dramatically change the congressional map for the midterms.""

Typically, the Supreme Court has ruled that ""anything goes"" when it comes to gerrymandering, as long as race is not the predominant reason, Rahmani said, noting that the mid-decade redistricting that is taking place in states like Texas and California is not the norm.

""Typically, we'd see this type of gerrymandering after the Census,"" he said. ""Now it's just—the midterms—it's something that historically we haven't seen these types of issues unless it's post-Census. But now it's happening seemingly all the time.""

Another key case that could change the outcome of the midterms is National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission. The case deals with campaign finance and whether limits on coordinated party expenditures violate the First Amendment.

The case was brought by Vice President JD Vance when he was a senator. They asked the court to revisit a previous ruling on the case as it has ""tightened the free speech restrictions on campaign finance regulation.""

Rahmani said the court could continue chipping away at its laws regarding campaign finance, and that this could have an effect on the midterm. The court has generally upheld that ""money is speech when it comes to elections.""

Briffault said he believes that while the court is likely to overturn those restrictions, its impact is unclear as parties have found ways to circumvent restrictions as part of the status quo.

The third case, Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections, deals with a lawsuit filed by Representative Mike Bost, an Illinois Republican, over mail-in voting. His case was tossed by a lower-court judge, who ruled that he did not have standing as a candidate. But the court agreed to pick up the case and decide whether that is true.

The justices won't be ruling on his lawsuit itself—just whether or not candidates have standing to file lawsuits to these election laws. If the court sides with him, it will make it easier for candidates to file challenges, Briffault said.

""If the plaintiffs win, it means there may be more challenges to election laws because it will liberalize the rules of standing and make it easier for candidates and parties to bring challenges,"" he said.

What People Are Saying

Richard Briffault told Newsweek: ""Most academics are really focused on the Louisiana case. It has a wide range of possible outcomes in terms of its impact on the Voting Rights Act.""

Cecillia Wang, national legal director for the ACLU, in a statement in June: ""Before this case ever began, we had already won a hard-fought legal battle, proving that the legislature's initial map, like Louisiana's maps for generations before, illegally diluted Black voters' political power. Thanks to the Supreme Court's order from May 2024, which put the district court's injunction on hold, the fair and legal map the Louisiana Legislature enacted in response to our litigation remains in place while the case continues. We will be back next term to once again defend the new map and the representation Black voters deserve.""

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court: ""Before a political party speaks in support of its candidate, it would naturally seek to get the candidate's input. And for nearly the first 200 years of our Nation's history, a party was free to do so. Yet today, Congress has built a wall of separation between party and candidate, forcing party committees to figure out how to get their candidates elected without hearing from them. That is the campaign 'equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.'""

What Happens Next

Political candidates are likely to spend the next 13 1/2 months campaigning and making their cases to voters about their positions on key issues in hopes of winning in the midterms.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2727578/supreme-court-could-have-major-impact.png,N,,2025-09-23 16:59:35.966059

The agency posted a request for proposals for ""as-is, fully finished and furnished office space"" across more than a dozen cities. The department was only accepting offers during ""a special open period"" from Sept. 11 to Sept. 17.

NPR and the Washington Post, which first reported the story Thursday, Sept. 18, cited unnamed sources and records which suggested the space was needed to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Administration (ICE) officials. GSA is asking for space for 70 desks, private offices, a conference room and a server room.

The listing does not include any language about using office spaces as detention facilities, but one Iowa City activist group is raising concerns that the space could be used as a holding facility for immigrants facing deportation. Escucha Mi Voz, an immigration rights group that has been vocal about the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, are calling these spaces ""ICE black sites"" — a ""secret jail"" disguised as a ""processing facility.""

""Iowa needs housing, health care, and schools, not cages and deportations,"" organization member Maria Ayala said in a news release. ""We call on all Iowans to stand up and resist.”

Asked to respond to activists' concerns, a spokesperson with ICE maintained that ""administrative offices are different from detention facilities.""

“ICE continues to execute the President’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future operational requirements.”

Along with Des Moines, the GSA is looking at space in other Midwest cities — Milwaukee; St. Louis; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Columbus, Ohio. It's also looking for office spaces in southern U.S. states.

Office spaces can range from 11,500 to 18,500 square feet. They should also offer ""adequate sound privacy for confidential discussions,"" the notice said.

Offices would typically be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

In a statement, a GSA spokesperson said: “GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission.” The GSA did not respond to a question whether the listing was for ICE or National Guard members to carry out immigration enforcement. In August, Gov. Kim Reynolds deployed 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers to offer ""administrative and logistical support"" to ICE, beginning Sept. 8.

GSA's recent efforts come just months after the department, like many federal agencies, was reeling from a wave of firings and lost several employees. The firings, which began in February, were led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and part of the Trump administration's plans to reduce its government workforce.

The ICE budget rose by $75 billion over four years after President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4. Those funds came from the $170 billion allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration and border enforcement.

ICE is using some of that money to hire 10,000 recruits, increasing staff levels to about 30,000 as the administration seeks to fulfill a goal to deport 1 million immigrants every year.

The South Sudanese authorities’ statements underscore the lack of transparency and due process protections surrounding these transfers, Human Rights Watch said.
In Uganda, the Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed in a statement that a temporary bilateral cooperation agreement has been reached with the United States.
Ghanaian president John Mahama confirmed that his government has agreed to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the United States.
“As the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights special rapporteur on refugees has said, these agreements cannot override governments’ human rights obligations,” Ngari said.","The United States’ recent expulsions of third-country nationals to Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda, and South Sudan have exposed several hundred people to a risk of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and refoulement, Human Rights Watch said today.

The opaque deals that facilitate these transfers, at least some of which include US financial assistance, are part of a US policy approach that violates international human rights law and is designed to instrumentalize human suffering as a deterrent to migration.

“These agreements make African governments partners in the Trump administration’s horrifying violations of immigrants’ human rights,” said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “The African governments implementing these deals risk violating international law, including the prohibitions against refoulement and arbitrary detention.”

In August 2025, a Rwandan government spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, reportedly said that the country had agreed to accept up to 250 deportees, a much larger number than has been reported for Eswatini or South Sudan, under an agreement, which Human Rights Watch has seen, that includes roughly $7.5 million in US financial support.

Rwanda’s past role in similar arrangements with Israel, its now-abandoned negotiations for a comparable deal with the United Kingdom, and its own well-documented record of repression raise serious doubts about whether it will provide effective protection for the affected people.

Human Rights Watch has viewed the written agreement between the United States and Eswatini, under which the US will provide $5.1 million to “build [Eswatini’s] border and migration management capacity” and Eswatini will accept up to 160 deportees from the US. So far, Eswatini has received at least five people from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen and is reportedly holding them in the Matsapha Correctional Complex under harsh conditions. An Eswatini official told Human Rights Watch that the country is preparing to receive another 150 people. Lawyers and civil society groups have challenged the legality of detaining these people.

South Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation confirmed on September 4 that it was holding seven foreign nationals deported from the United States in July, while an eighth person, a South Sudanese national, was released to his family. A government spokesperson said that their status is still under consideration. On September 6, the authorities formally announced the repatriation of one Mexican national to Mexico but did not clarify where the remaining six men are being held and under what conditions, nor did it explain the legal basis for holding them.

The South Sudanese authorities’ statements underscore the lack of transparency and due process protections surrounding these transfers, Human Rights Watch said.

In Uganda, the Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed in a statement that a temporary bilateral cooperation agreement has been reached with the United States. Under its terms, Uganda will receive third-country deportees from the United States, but “individual[s] with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted” and preference will be given to individuals of African origin.

Ghanaian president John Mahama confirmed that his government has agreed to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the United States. This agreement is limited to West African nationals. So far, five citizens of Nigeria and The Gambia have been expelled to Ghana under the agreement. Prior to their expulsion, US immigration judges had granted all of them fear-based immigration relief, either withholding their removal under the US Immigration and Naturality Act or deferring their removal under the Convention against Torture.

One of the five, a bisexual man from The Gambia, said in a sworn declaration filed in US federal court that Ghanaian authorities had returned him to his country of origin after their expulsion by the United States. This case underscores the danger that expulsion agreements will lead to the return of people to countries where US courts had determined they face a serious risk of persecution or torture.

Given the abusive US immigration policies that underpin them, Human Rights Watch urges African governments to refuse to enter into agreements to accept third-country deportees from the United States and to terminate those that are already in effect. In the interim, countries that are party to such agreements should disclose their terms, allow access to independent monitors, refrain from detaining any deportees absent a clear legal basis, and ensure that no deportee is returned to their home country if there is credible evidence that they would face the risk of persecution, enforced disappearance, torture, or other serious harm.

“As the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights special rapporteur on refugees has said, these agreements cannot override governments’ human rights obligations,” Ngari said. “The African Union should reiterate that deportations that do not afford people an opportunity to seek protection from persecution or torture are unlawful, abusive and unacceptable.”

In essence, the scheme provides a mechanism to remove foreign nationals who have been convicted of offences in the UK and who have made a human rights claim against their removal in the UK, by deporting them to their home country before they have exhausted their appeal rights. It is stated that these individuals will be able attend any appeal hearings in the UK remotely via video link.

To what extent does this scheme really reflect and uphold the human rights of these individuals? In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted this policy (first introduced in 2014) after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standard.

Former Conservative Justice Secretary Alex Chalk KC expressed concern over this policy and urged Parliament to scrutinise it extremely carefully. His grounds for concern echoed respected legal experts in the field, namely:

The risk of return: the ‘Deport Now, Appeal Later’ scheme is potentially at odds with the assurances of the fundamental principle of non-refoulment, which imposes a duty on states not to return individuals to a country where they risk facing torture or degrading treatment. Furthermore, if the appeal is heard only after they have been returned, there is no guarantee that their Article 6 right to fair trial will be upheld in the respective countries.

The rights of British Children: this scheme can be criticised for its failure to consider the Article 8 right to private and family life and uphold the duty imposed on the Secretary of State under s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. In essence, there are concerns that the impact of this scheme does not pay adequate attention or respect to the child’s right to private and family life, nor to their wellbeing when their parents are deported.

The voice of the victim: the ‘Deport Now, Appeal Later’ scheme also raises concerns about what justice would look like. Would victims receive the finality of justice when foreign nationals are tried in their home countries, rather than in the UK?

It remains to be seen how this scheme can operate within the confines of the UK’s obligations under the ECHR and Human Rights Act, particularly in light of recent government statements confirming that the UK has no intention of leaving the ECHR.

The myriad conflicts and issues confronting the world, including climate change, will also be in the spotlight, as nearly a week of speeches is launched at the UN General Assembly.","U.S. President Donald Trump delivered his first in-person address to the United Nations General Assembly in seven years on Tuesday, telling those assembled that ""your countries are going to hell"" due to green energy policies and what he characterized as runaway migration.

While the theme for this year's UN General Assembly is ""Better Together,"" Trump's remarks on the first of several days of speeches from heads of state arguably undermined the theme, as he encouraged ""all countries to take their own stand in defence of their citizens as well.""

Trump defended the efforts of his administration to secure its southern border and warned of the ""death of Western Europe"" from migration. He also took aim at UN programs that support the world's refugees.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not finance them,"" said Trump, using a term for mass movements of people that activists have criticized for being dehumanizing.

Elsewhere, Trump dismissed climate change as the "" greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

""In closing, I just want to repeat that immigration and the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet,"" he said.

In between, Trump held court on a number of topics, many familiar to regular watchers of his Oval Office comments, and took issue with countries like Canada that have recognized a Palestinian state, saying the ""rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists, for their atrocities.""

With global support for a Palestinian state growing, Israel's devastating war in Gaza is expected to take centre stage at the annual gathering of leaders.

The myriad conflicts and issues confronting the world, including climate change, will also be in the spotlight, as nearly a week of speeches is launched at the UN General Assembly.

""As we meet, civilians are targeted and international law trampled in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and beyond,"" Secretary General António Guterres said at a commemoration on the UN's 80th anniversary on Monday. ""Poverty and hunger are on the rise — the planet burns, with fires, floods and record heat raging through climate chaos.""

The UN is seeing its principles ""under assault as never before,"" said Guterres.

Brazil led off the speeches Tuesday in a decades-long tradition dating to when it was the only nation that volunteered to speak first.

In addition to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Trump, the assembly on Tuesday will hear from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jordan's King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Almost all UN member nations have signed up to take their turn during the assembly's six-day-long speechfest. Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand will deliver Canada's statement on Sept. 29.

Grave warning to drug smugglers

Trump returned to the assembly rostrum five years after he last addressed the gathering by video, due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. He delivered an in-person address in 2018.

He returned in a position of strength, upending U.S. foreign policy in just eight months into his second presidential term. Trump has slashed foreign aid, affecting several UN-led endeavours, and has moved to end American participation in the World Health Organization and UN Human Rights Council.

He's imposed tariffs on friend and foe alike and has approved military strikes, with murky legal authority, on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and on Iranian nuclear facilities.

""To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,"" he said. Nearly three weeks after the first boat strike, Trump's Democratic rivals in Congress have pleaded with his administration for details on the military-led operations.

In his speech, Trump repeated the spurious claim that he's ""ended seven wars"" this year. While he didn't elaborate, Trump in recent weeks has taken credit for administration's efforts to end conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Sudan, Rwanda and the Democratic Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Cambodia and Thailand.

But Trump has struggled to deliver on his 2024 campaign promises to quickly end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with more than a month now passed after a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

While Trump admitted he hoped ending the Russia-Ukraine war ""would be easier,"" he had little in the way of criticism for Putin, focusing instead on purchases of Russian energy by India, China and several European nations.

""Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing,"" he said. ""They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia.""

The EU has stressed its members are phasing out imports or Russian oil and natural gas, pledging last week to accelerate that process a year earlier than planned.

Following his speech, Trump was set to hold a handful of one-on-one meetings, including with Guterres and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He will also hold a group meeting focused on the Middle East, with officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

Trump is scheduled to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House next Monday.

Two-state solution conference

On Monday, a conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, focused on garnering support for the long-standing idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The hours-long meeting ended with several countries, including France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Monaco, announcing or confirming their recognition of a Palestinian state — a day after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal did. Around three-fourths of the UN's 193 member countries now do.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday the move to recognize Palestinian statehood is consistent with Canada's longtime policy of supporting a two-state solution. He said Canada and other countries are actively trying to create conditions for a ceasefire and a peace process.

""It's necessary in our judgment, and the judgment of most other countries in the world, that we have to push on this now,"" Carney said.

There were, however, protesters from out of town, including a contingent sent by the Adams County Democrats.

“We have a booth as a part of Heritage Days, where we’re registering voters of any party.
Griffin summed up the effort, saying, “Because, you know, we want more voters, not less, right?”","McCOOK, Neb. - The message went out from an entity called “Indivisible,” which describes itself as a nonprofit organization that “drives coordinated campaigns” to “defeat the rightwing takeover of American government.”

The message read, in part, “Many Nebraskans feel that the unlawful round-ups and detentions of immigrants by ICE are inconsistent with Nebraskan values.” The invitation then specified, “Come protest the creation of this detention center in McCook on September 20th at 1:00 p.m.”

Rumor merchants took that and ran with it, predicting busloads of Soros-funded protesters, the prospect of civil unrest and even whispers of an active shooter. The rumors were prevalent enough that McCook law enforcement released an unofficial statement acknowledging the rumors, but no busloads of protesters arrived, and if there was civil unrest on Saturday, it was limited to long lines at the food trucks.

There were, however, protesters from out of town, including a contingent sent by the Adams County Democrats. A spokesman for the group, Ryan Griffin, said, “We are just a group of concerned citizens that are just, you know, using their right to peaceful protest.”

When asked what outcome the group was seeking, Griffin said, “We’re just here to say that we don’t support the actions of Governor Pillen and President Donald Trump opening up an unneeded ICE immigrant detention center.” Griffin elaborated, “We believe immigrants are welcome; we welcome them to this country.”

Griffin qualified his position, saying, “If there are any of them that do commit crimes, we do believe they should be prosecuted. None of us are arguing that criminals should be left free.”

Signs held by the protesters followed a few distinct themes: immigration, human rights and participation by the State of Nebraska. One sign said, ”Immigrants built this country,” while another claimed that “Immigrants have always made America great.” One sign, wielded by former McCook resident Larry Harvey, simply read, “Stop the cruelty,” which paired nicely with the sign saying “Stop family separation.” “No Nebraska ICE camps” and “ICE hurts NE.”

Beyond the 1 p.m. protest, participants from both in and out of Red Willow County operated a vendor table in Norris Park where they registered voters. Griffin made it clear that he was willing to help voters of all political stripes register. “We have a booth as a part of Heritage Days, where we’re registering voters of any party. Republicans that come up to us, they’re more than welcome to register to vote.”

When the Gazette reached out to local Republican Party officials for comment, Red Willow County Vice Chair Pam Frecks replied, “I am not speaking for our local group but as an individual. Generally speaking, Republicans do not have a ‘groupthink’ mentality. As a Republican, I believe that individuals have a right to their own opinion, and there are probably differences of opinion within the community concerning the location of the ICE facility.”

Ultimately, it is unlikely that a few signs will have any more influence on the state/federal partnership than our locally elected officials have, but it seemed like a way to energize the grassroots of a party out of power and as a recruiting tool for future elections.

Catch up quick: Elias Escobar, an undocumented immigrant who was obtaining papers through a family-based petition from his wife, was stopped by immigration agents on his way to a construction job Wednesday.

Agents smashed his car window and pulled him out, even after his wife, Leslie Perlera Gonzalez, showed up saying he had a pending immigration petition, GBH News reported.

A Department of Homeland Security official later told Axios he refused to roll down his window and that the ""officers took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation.""

State of play: Elias Escobar is detained in the Plymouth County Correctional Center with other immigrant detainees.

Greater Boston Legal Services, where Perlera Gonzalez works, filed a lawsuit alleging his rights were violated.

Yes, but: The Trump administration has fought habeas lawsuits over immigrant detainees tooth and nail since ramping up immigration enforcement this year.

Context: Immigrants have historically been allowed to adjust their status through a handful of avenues if they have a relative or spouse who is a U.S. citizen.

With the exception of the first Trump administration, it is uncommon for immigration officials to detain and seek to deport an immigrant mid-petition or with legal status if the person poses no public safety threat, said Maggie Morgan, managing attorney for the GBLS immigration unit.

Morgan says she has seen reports of immigration agents detaining people before confirming their identity or status.

""This is violating due process not just for those individuals, but for everyone in the community who could be at risk of having this happen to them,"" Morgan said.

Zoom out: The LUCE hotline has received more than 100 calls in the last week flagging immigration enforcement activity.

Somerville residents tried to stop immigration agents from questioning a man they stopped. He complied and, within minutes, was placed in handcuffs despite having no known record, Rep. Mike Connolly told the Cambridge Day.

In the meantime, Mario Guevara is still at risk of being sent to El Salvador.
“But I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.","The Board of Immigration Appeals has ordered Emmy-award winning journalist Mario Guevara to be deported to El Salvador, a country he fled more than two decades ago after being persecuted for his reporting.

On Friday, Chief Appellate Immigration Judge Garry D. Malphrus, Appellate Immigration Judge Marcos Gemoets, and Temporary Appellate Immigration Judge Paul A. McCloskey — all appointed by Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi — handed down the deportation order.

Guevara’s attorneys were granted an emergency hearing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The court didn’t issue a decision but asked for further briefing. In the meantime, Mario Guevara is still at risk of being sent to El Salvador.

The journalist’s supporters, including Georgia lawmakers, say the Trump administration is targeting Guevara because of his reporting on immigration raids.

“This is yet another example of the Trump administration’s pervasive attempts to stifle journalists and media from doing honest reporting or speaking unfavorably about the administration,” State Sen. Josh McLaurin (D) said in a statement. “This is one of the most dangerous periods for free speech in American history.”

Cory Isaacson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia, said it will be “devastating” if Guevara is deported. Guevara is represented by the ACLU and the state affiliate, the ACLU of Georgia.

“The immediate release of Mr. Guevara is the only way to correct this injustice that has immeasurably harmed his wellbeing and the wellbeing of his family, the community and the people of Georgia,” Isaacson said in a statement. “In a democracy, journalists should not be arrested for exercising their constitutional rights to report the news.”

In June, officers arrested Guevara while he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest in DeKalb County, Georgia. About a minute before his arrest, an officer told the other officers to “Keep an eye on the guy in the red shirt. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. . .. He’s been warned multiple times,” according to his habeas petition. Another officer asked, “Press?” The first officer replied, “Yep.” He was arrested when he stepped off the sidewalk to move out of the way of officers coming through the area.

Although all charges were dropped, he has remained in ICE custody. DHS previously told Truthout in an email that Guevara has been detained because he entered the country illegally in 2004. This is false.

The judge who granted Guevara bond in July wrote that he “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.”

Prosecutors successfully obtained a stay, or pause, of the bond decision. The government has argued that Guevara “is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed’ law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,’” as per Guevara’s petition. “The Government further states that ‘[l]ocal law enforcement reviewed the respondent’s public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.’”

Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” He said while he’s been locked up, some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) have condemned the court’s deportation order. SPJ said in a statement that the decision is “a chilling signal to every reporter in this country: If your coverage makes the government uncomfortable, you could be silenced.”

“SPJ stands firmly with Mario Guevara and calls for his immediate release and the restoration of his ability to remain in the United States,” the group continued. “Deporting him under these circumstances would undermine the First Amendment, erode public trust and set a dangerous precedent for all who believe in a free press.”

Today marks Guevara’s 100th day in detention. For much of that time he has been held in solitary confinement. On Friday, The Bitter Southerner published an essay by Guevara detailing the devastating impact his incarceration has had on himself, his career, and his family. The news outlet he founded, MGNews, is on the verge of bankruptcy. He’s experienced panic attacks and sunk into a depression.

“But I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote. “Hopefully, soon all my tears and my family’s tears will be wiped away, and we can have fun and smile, triumphant, as we did before, together and in absolute freedom.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/cropped-Mario-Guevara-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:12.278660

Trump has already reduced U.S. support for the U.N. since his latest inauguration. He withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization and ended participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council. Global leaders are also dealing with wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan and concerns about artificial intelligence.

What did Trump say at the U.N.?

What they're saying:

Trump warns Europe immigration is ‘destroying your heritage’

Trump called immigration and policies confronting climate change a ""double-tailed monster"" that’s ruining Europe. His rhetoric was especially harsh on what he called ""the unmitigated immigration disaster.""

Here’s what he said: ""If you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. I’m the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.""

Then he directly addressed European leaders: ""You’re doing it because you want to be nice. You want to be politically correct, and you’re destroying your heritage.""

The president scoffed at past predictions on climate change

Trump urged European countries to abandon green energy initiatives, scoffing that, in decades past, some experts predicted that by the year 2000 ""climate change will cause a global catastrophe.""

He said scientists predicted some nations might be ""wiped off the map"" by now, but insisted that’s ""not happening.""

Actually, climate change has indeed triggered rising sea levels and intensifying storms that have caused small island nations to shrink. Such phenomenon has also cost enormous sums of money for disaster response, cleanup and rebuilding in the U.S. and around the world.

Nonetheless, Trump insisted it was ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world in my opinion.""

He said ""all of these predictions were wrong"" and ""made by stupid people,"" adding, ""If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.""

Trump points to US boat bombing and warns drug traffickers of more

Trump is unapologetic about authorizing the bombing of two boats U.S. officials said were carrying drugs, despite bipartisan criticism that the U.S. military actions violated the law.

""Let’s put it this way: People don’t like to take big loads of drugs in boats anymore,"" he said, promising more attacks if he deems it necessary.

""Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,"" he said after the two attacks that U.S. officials said killed 14 people.

Many Democrats and some Republicans have questioned Trump’s policy as a potential overreach of executive authority in part because the military was used for law enforcement purposes.

Trump lectures the world on immigration policy

""It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. I can tell you, I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,"" Trump proclaimed.

It was a lot of bravado on the world stage at the United Nations General Assembly — even for a leader who’s built his political career on public boasts.

Trump has launched a crackdown along the U.S.-Mexico border and pushed hardline domestic immigration policies.

""Once we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border — and removing illegal aliens from the United States — they simply stopped coming,"" he said.

The president called his efforts a ""humanitarian act,"" arguing that it saved people who might have otherwise died trying to cross the U.S. border illegally.

Trump threatens Russia sanctions but says Europe must join in

Trump threatened to hit Russia with ""a very strong round of powerful tariffs"" if Putin doesn’t come to the table to end its war in Ukraine.

He claimed that would ""stop the bloodshed .. very quickly"" but also suggested fighting will not end as long as China and European nations continue buying Russian energy.

""They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?"" Trump said.

Trump tells Hamas to release all hostages now

Trump demanded on Tuesday that Hamas immediately release all hostages living and dead that it’s holding in Gaza, saying the time for partial releases is over.

Speaking to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, Trump also criticized several European nations, including U.S. allies, for recognizing a Palestinian state, which he called a reward to Hamas for its Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel that sparked the current conflict.

""As if to encourage continued conflict, some in this body seek to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state,"" Trump said. ""This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7th. But instead of giving in to Hamas as ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.""

""Just release the hostages now.""

Trump blasts UN as being filled with ‘empty words’ and not helping end wars

Standing in front of top U.N. officials, before more than 150 world leaders, Trump blasted the international organization. He said they didn’t reach out to him on the various wars he says he has brought to a conclusion.

""I’ve always said the U.N. has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential,"" Trump said. ""For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter. It’s empty words and empty words don’t solve war.""

U.N. chief warns world leaders

The other side:

With global peace and progress under siege, the United Nations chief challenged world leaders Tuesday to choose a future where the rule of law triumphs over raw power and where nations come together rather than scramble for self-interests.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the U.N.’s founders faced the same questions 80 years ago, but he told today’s world leaders at the opening of their annual gathering at the General Assembly that the choice of peace or war, law or lawlessness, cooperation or conflict, is ""more urgent, more intertwined, more unforgiving.""

""We have entered in an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering,"" he said in his annual ""state of the World"" speech. ""The pillars of peace and progress are buckling under the weight of impunity, inequality and indifference.""

But despite all the internal and external challenges facing the U.N., he and General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock pleaded with its members not to give up. ""If we stop doing the right things, evil will prevail,"" Baerbock said in her opening remarks.

Guterres said the leaders’ first obligation is to choose peace, and without naming any countries, he urged all parties -- including those in the Assembly chamber – to stop supporting Sudan’s warring parties.

What is the United Nations?

Why you should care:

The United Nations, which emerged from World War II’s rubble on the premise that nations would work together to tackle political, social and financial issues, is in crisis itself. As Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week: ""International cooperation is straining under pressures unseen in our lifetimes.""

Yet the annual high-level gathering at the U.N. General Assembly will bring presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from about 150 of the 193 U.N. member nations to U.N. headquarters. The secretary-general says it is an opportunity that can’t be missed — even in the most challenging of moments.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/gettyimages-2236930053a.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:16.933999

Since President Trump took office, 15 people have died in immigration detention, 10 of those deaths occurred between January and June, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

""Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody,"" Ossoff told NPR in an interview.

The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.

Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.

Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.

But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.

Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.

""We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those,"" Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. ""ICE is dedicated to transparency.""

In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.

""ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates,"" they wrote, adding that ICE guidancerequires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website ""within 48 hours,"" and directs that ""every effort should be made to post the interim notice"" sooner.

Most recently, ICE issued press releases confirming the death of a Mexican national on Aug. 31.

The administration counters that immigration judges have not managed their mounting caseloads effectively, and that it has taken steps to streamline the process involved in adjudicating cases.
Immigration judges, who are more like civil servants, can approve or deny a final order of deportation.
""The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation's immigration courts,"" said IFPTE President Matt Biggs in a statement to NPR.
Earlier this month, about 600 military lawyers were authorized to work for the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges.","Nearly 20 immigration judges received emails this month informing them that they are being let go, NPR has learned, adding to the over 80 judges that have already been cut by President Trump so far this year.

At least 14 immigration judges learned last Friday that they would be put on leave and that their employment would terminate as soon as Wednesday in some cases, according to two people familiar with the firings and a confirmation from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), a union that represents immigration judges. The two people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Courts in Florida, New York, Maryland, California and Washington state are among those affected.

The move follows the firing of five other immigration judges earlier this month. The firings in September constitute the largest terminations in any month since two dozen immigration judges were fired in February right before their first day on the job.

The firings are seemingly at odds with the Trump administration's goals of immigration enforcement, advocates say. The administration counters that immigration judges have not managed their mounting caseloads effectively, and that it has taken steps to streamline the process involved in adjudicating cases. The dispute provides a window into just how complicated the Trump administration's efforts to lower illegal immigration and deport millions of undocumented people are.

Union leaders had been bracing for large cuts this month since it marked the end of the two-year probationary period for many immigration judges. The increased firings come as the Trump administration is trying to increase the number of deportations. Immigration judges, who are more like civil servants, can approve or deny a final order of deportation. Still, immigration advocates argue the high priority on immigration law enforcement is reducing the limited due process that immigrants receive because the dismissed judges are either replaced with adjudicators with no experience or are not replaced at all.

""The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation's immigration courts,"" said IFPTE President Matt Biggs in a statement to NPR. ""At a time when the backlog has reached historic levels and the administration has made immigration enforcement a central issue, the removal of experienced judges is hypocritical, undermines the law, wastes taxpayer dollars, and further delays justice for citizens and immigrants alike.""

Not all judges to be dismissed this year have been at the end of their probationary period with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is a part of the U.S. Justice Department. Still, the firings have resulted in a culture of fear among EOIR employees. Dozens took the ""Fork in the Road,"" a voluntary resignation program introduced after President Trump took office aimed at reducing the size of the federal workforce. EOIR declined to comment.

In the past nine months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700 judges at the start of the year. The loss of judges has resulted in immigration cases being delayed as far out as 2029, NPR previously reported, as vacancies increase despite open job postings to fill roles in those courts.

Terminations continue amid growing backlogs

The latest sets of terminations landed after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including hiring more immigration judges. The funding and additional personnel are aimed at alleviating the growing case backlog, which stands at nearly 4 million. Hiring and training new judges can take more than a year.

In recent months, EOIR leadership has criticized judges for not efficiently managing their caseloads, and has encouraged adjudicators to streamline asylum reviews and give oral, as opposed to written, decisions on case dismissals.

Earlier this month, about 600 military lawyers were authorized to work for the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges. And the DOJ made changes to who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge — effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration experience.

Former California state lawmaker and acting Los Angeles U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Monday morning on “Fox & Friends” that the California law would not be enforceable when it comes to federal immigration agents.

“We’re very confident the state of California does not and cannot have jurisdiction,” he said. “If you had every state trying to regulate the federal government, you would have complete chaos.”

On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 627, called the “No Secret Police Act,” into law along with a host of other restrictions on immigration enforcement. It is slated to go into effect in January.

The governor said he believes the law is enforceable, comparing it to traffic laws that federal agents must comply with in various states.

“The supremacy clause basically asserts that we cannot interfere in federal operations. Well, federal operations have been conducted for decades and decades without masks. It’s never been necessary,” he said.

In response to the signing, Essayli posted on X that he had directed federal agents that the law would not affect them.

“If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress,” he said on X. Essayli has not filed a legal challenge to the new policy, though he mused on the cable news channel Monday that Newsom might file a legal challenge and get a judge to issue an injunction.

“You know what this is about,” he told host Lawrence B. Johnson. “This is to inflame the public.”

The mask question has been a central debate since immigration officials began ramping up enforcement in the state. The Department of Homeland Security contends the officers should be allowed to mask to protect themselves from online doxing and targeting by gangs.

In a news release issued Monday afternoon, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency wouldn’t be following the new law, and asserted “ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults.”

Newsom on Saturday asked for proof of that claim, and encouraged federal officials to pursue criminal charges for people who dox their officers online.

“Do judges then start getting masks? Do elected officials start masking themselves? Does anyone that’s on the receiving end of modern-day bullying, um, as it relates to online activity? That’s why we have laws. Enforce the laws,” he said.

He was convicted of domestic violence last year and entered a one-year intervention program. He graduated July 23 in a Fresno county courtroom where a judge told him he had done a good job.

Minutes later, while leaving the courthouse, five men and one woman in plain clothes approached him.

“Someone came up to him, got in his face and said his name,” said Jennifer, who did not want CalMatters to use her last name because she was concerned about immigration enforcement agents targeting other relatives. “And they grabbed him, and I tried to get between them.”

Her brother, who is undocumented, didn’t provide them with an identification.

“They shoved him in this car, which was a plain, beat-up van,” Jennifer said. “Then one of them asked if they should wait for ‘the other guy,’ and a different person said ‘we’re good with this one,’ like he was just part of their quota that day.”

Her brother is already back in Mexico.

Social media is awash with videos of federal agents making arrests at immigration court hearings, which are on federal property, inside federal courthouses.

What’s different about the detention of Jennifer’s brother is that it took place on the grounds of a state courthouse. Local media have reported the detention of at least two dozen other people on the grounds of California court buildings in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties, and NPR reports federal immigration detentions in state courthouses across the country, from the Chicago suburbs to a county south of Boston.

During the last Trump administration, California Democrats were so concerned about ICE making arrests at superior court buildings and potentially discouraging witnesses from testifying that they passed a law to forbid that kind of enforcement.

Picking people up at a courthouse can have a “potential chilling effect” on witnesses, victims and even suspects who are afraid to show up for court, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said earlier this summer.

“Making courthouses a focus of immigration enforcement hinders, rather than helps, the administration of justice by deterring witnesses and victims from coming forward and discouraging individuals from asserting their rights,” Guerrero said.

By waiting outside the courthouse, immigration agents appear to be complying with California law, though it’s unclear whether the word “courthouse” in the law includes the grounds outside the courthouse. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office wouldn’t provide what it a spokesperson called “legal analysis” of those actions when CalMatters asked about them.

But at least one immigration enforcement action was a clear violation of state law.

In Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse on July 28. State law forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”

“As far as the court is aware, ICE had not conducted enforcement actions inside one of its courthouses prior to Monday, July 28th,” Butte County Superior Court executive officer Sharif Elmallah said in a statement.

“The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”

As with the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law forbidding immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses.

The state Justice Department’s guidance to state courthouses provides some latitude to immigration enforcement agents. They may make arrests inside a courthouse if the case involves a national security threat, someone’s life is in danger, evidence is in danger or agents are in “hot pursuit.”

Failing all of that, under California law, immigration agents can enter a courthouse to detain someone whom they believe poses a danger to public safety if they can’t find an alternate location and they have the approval of a federal immigration enforcement supervisor.

ICE defends courthouse arrests

Jennifer believes immigration agents ran her brother’s name through their own database when it was posted on the Fresno County Superior Court’s public online court docket, then waited for him to appear.

In response to questions from CalMatters, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded with a July quote from a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson which asserted the agency’s right to make arrests of “a lawbreaker where you find them.” The spokesperson also said the arrests are safer for immigration agents, since the people they’re arresting have been through security.

Policies on courthouse arrests have seesawed through Democratic and Republican administrations.

The Obama administration in 2011 designated schools, hospitals and religious buildings as “sensitive locations” where immigration agents need permission to operate. ICE at the time said the list of sensitive locations was longer than those three types of places and urged agents to get permission from higher-ups before making arrests at any organization assisting “victims of crime.”

Trump undid that policy in 2018 with a directive instructing ICE agents to make arrests at state and local courthouses. They proceeded to do so, even in California. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed that guidance, putting courthouses mostly off-limits.In May, Wired reported that the new Trump administration went even further than its 2018 directive, explicitly removing instructions to agents that they should respect local laws that would prevent them from arresting people.

Are immigrants avoiding court?

Jennifer said word has already gotten out among the immigrant community in Fresno to stop attending court. Family members even tried to discourage her brother from appearing on the day he was detained.

“In general, people are just avoiding going to the courthouse, even after meeting with groups who inform them that there’s consequences to not showing up,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, a program manager for the Valley Watch Network, an immigrant rights group.

A Fresno County Superior Court spokesperson said the court hasn’t seen a change in the number of people appearing, but noted that in a county of 1 million people, such shifts among a relatively small population would be hard to notice.

The state Department of Justice said it’s aware of the courthouse arrests. As a former member of the Assembly, Bonta, now the state attorney general, was a co-author of the law that was meant to deter immigration enforcement at California courthouses.

“We are very concerned with the Trump administration’s actions, which make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet,” the California Department of Justice said in an unsigned statement to CalMatters.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825_Fresno-Courthouse_LV_10.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:59:26.388777

PHOENIX (AP) — Southern Arizona voters will select a successor Tuesday to the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a progressive stalwart who represented the state for more than two decades in Congress.

Grijalva died in March, resulting in the 7th Congressional District seat being one of three safely Democratic districts to become vacant due to lawmakers’ deaths. One has since been filled.

Another in Texas has yet to be filled, and a vacancy in a heavily Republican Tennessee district will be filled following an election in December.

Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita Grijalva, is facing off against Republican business owner Daniel Butierez, to fill the final 15 months of the late congressman’s term. Two third-party candidates also are on the ballot.

Grijalva has served on local boards, while Butierez made his political debut with an unsuccessful bid against Raúl Grijalva for the seat in 2024.

Butierez garnered more than one-third of the vote that year in the predominantly Hispanic district and expressed optimism after winning the GOP primary over the summer that he could attract more Democratic support this time.

Democrats enjoy a nearly 2-1 registration advantage over Republicans in the district, which covers parts of Tucson and a majority of the state’s border with Mexico. Most of the 7th District has been represented by Democrats since Arizona first became a state in 1912.

Grijalva has been a household name in Tucson for years. While there are benefits to name recognition, Adelita Grijalva has emphasized that she stands on her own record. The Democrat has the endorsements of fellow progressives U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Grijalva sailed to victory in the Democratic primary with more than 60% of the vote, defeating a slate that included a former state lawmaker and a Gen Z digital strategist. Similarly, Butierez won the GOP primary by large margins.

Immigration and border security have been part of the debate, as the Trump administration moves ahead with deporting people who are in the country illegally and reviewing the status of millions of others who hold U.S. visas for any violations.

Grijalva has said she would advocate for legislation that creates pathways to citizenship for recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other migrants. She also supports prohibiting immigration enforcement operations at schools, churches and medical facilities.

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

The Supreme Court on Sept. 8 lifted a lower court judge’s order prohibiting immigration agents from considering physical appearance and language use, among other factors, when deciding to stop and question people about possible immigration law violations. Though the court did not explain its reasoning, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s separate concurrence suggests that at least one member of the apparent six-justice majority believes the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution permits race-based immigration policing.

The court’s order in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo stays a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in July barring federal officials from stopping, even briefly, people based on their “apparent race or ethnicity”; “[s]peaking Spanish or English with an accent”; “presence at a particular location”; and “the type of work one does.” Frimpong’s order applied to the Central District of California only, which includes Los Angeles and six surrounding counties. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had rejected the Justice Department’s request to stay Frimpong’s order, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court. The justices’ decision was unsigned and, at a mere four sentences, did not provide any explanation of the justices’ reasoning, common in cases that the court decides on its emergency docket.

Though Vasquez Perdomo highlights recent immigration operations in California, the litigation’s legal dispute centers on a constitutional clause typically associated with criminal law enforcement activities: the Fourth Amendment. Aside from permitting arrests based on probable cause to believe that the arrestee has committed a crime, the Fourth Amendment also allows government officials to briefly stop and question someone without first obtaining a warrant based on “reasonable suspicion” that the person is engaging in illegal activity. In making that stop, the official “must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.”

The Vasquez Perdomo lawsuit tests the Fourth Amendment’s limits regarding what constitutes “reasonable suspicion.” In its application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the government relied on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, a 1975 decision in which the court concluded that Border Patrol agents can consider “Mexican appearance” to gauge potential violations of immigration law near the country’s southwestern border. To identify who looks Mexican, agents can consider “mode of dress and haircut,” Justice Lewis Powell wrote on behalf of his colleagues. Powell acknowledged that there are many U.S. citizens with “the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry,” but “[t]he likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor.” The justices were especially swayed by the government’s claim that there were between 1 and 12 million unauthorized migrants living in the United States in the early 1970s – 85% of whom, immigration officials said, were Mexican citizens. Whether a person appears to be Mexican is just one of many factors that officers can consider “in deciding whether there is reasonable suspicion to stop a car in the border area,” the court announced.

Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Vasquez Perdomo relies heavily on Brignoni-Ponce’s acceptance of race-based immigration policing. Across his 10-page opinion, Kavanaugh cites Brignoni-Ponce nine times. Five of those references come in two paragraphs explaining that the Fourth Amendment favors the government’s position. The Fourth Amendment gives law enforcement officers the flexibility to consider “any number of factors,” Kavanaugh explained, quoting Brignoni-Ponce. For that reason, immigration agents in Los Angeles and surrounding counties could constitutionally consider the “high number and percentage” of migrants living in the region in violation of immigration law; that they “tend to gather in certain locations” to look for work; that they “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction” because these “do not require paperwork”; that many “do not speak much English”; and their “apparent ethnicity.” To Kavanaugh, it is constitutionally permissible and “common sense” that these factors “constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

Despite going to the effort of providing his reasoning, Kavanaugh does not explain how immigration agents determine which people “do not speak much English” or how they identify ethnicity. He notes, correctly, that “many” people living in the Los Angeles area without the federal government’s permission “come from Mexico or Central America.” But it is one thing for a person to have been born in a particular eight-country region (which includes Belize, where English is the official language and about three-quarters of the population speak it) and another thing for immigration agents to know, first, where a specific individual hails from and, second, how much English they speak.

Neither country of origin nor English-language ability are readily apparent through observation, and neither is a good indicator of a person’s legal right to live in the United States. In Los Angeles County alone, more than half of residents who were born outside the United States are naturalized U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, in a county where 55% of the population ages five and older speaks a language other than English at home but 58% of that group also speak English at least “very well,” according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, there is every reason to think that most of the people in L.A. who speak a language that isn’t English also speak a lot of English. For that reason, in a region where multilingualism is common, the language that agents hear a person talking – assuming they even do hear a person talking before stopping them – is not a good indicator of what languages the person can speak.

Kavanaugh also fails to explain how immigration agents should determine a person’s ethnic appearance. Though he cites Brignoni-Ponce for support, he neither explicitly embraces nor rejects Powell’s explanation that “mode of dress and haircut” can help agents choose who to target. Whatever Kavanaugh thinks of the constitutional relevance of fashion choices, he unmistakably invites immigration agents to bring policing based on ethnicity into the 21st century. As they do, they are likely to find that many of the people they target are in fact U.S. citizens: Almost half the residents of Los Angeles County – 48% – identify as Hispanic or Latino, and almost three-quarters of those who are of working age are U.S. citizens. Indeed, two of the California residents suing DHS are U.S. citizens whom immigration agents stopped and questioned.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor – joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – harshly criticized her colleagues on the court’s right flank. The court’s order permits government officials to target people who “look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little,” Sotomayor wrote.

Unlike the other justices in the majority, Kavanaugh went well beyond what was necessary to side with the government on the court’s emergency docket. By issuing a 10-page concurrence, he didn’t just explain his reasons for siding with the Trump administration’s contentious approach to immigration law enforcement in the L.A. area. Kavanaugh also made clear that, in his view, immigration agents can use multiple proxies for race without fear of judicial interference.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 10:57:45.809658

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained a New Haven man driving on Dixwell Avenue, three blocks away from Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Sunday morning.

Five unmarked cars surrounded the man as he was driving to visit a potential contracting site for his job as a tile installer, according to two of the man’s family members. He was a few blocks away from his home when agents apprehended him on Dixwell Avenue near its intersection with Webster Street, a video posted to social media indicates.

The agents brought him to ICE’s Hartford base before he was transferred to the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts, according to ICE’s online detainee locator system. In July, ICE detained Esdrás Zabaleta-Ramirez — an 18-year-old student at Wilbur Cross High School — at the same location.

The man’s wife, Claudia, who asked for her last name to be omitted because of her immigration status, said agents were waiting for her husband as he left his home and followed him on his way to work. Claudia said the person who posted the video on social media witnessed the entire encounter.

When it appeared the man would not open the door to his car, an agent broke his car window, according to Claudia. Another video from the scene shows the car’s passenger-side window almost entirely shattered.

Claudia said her husband told her ICE agents forced him out of the car and handcuffed him.

“He doesn’t understand why they were investigating him, because in that same encounter, they told him that he didn’t have a record,” Claudia said in Spanish.

The man’s cousin, who also requested anonymity due to her immigration status, wrote to the News that the man came to the U.S. to secure financial stability for his family in Guatemala. He first attempted to enter the United States in 2011 but was caught and deported. He returned in 2015 and has lived in New Haven since, the cousin wrote.

Currently, the man’s family live in New Haven’s Dixwell neighborhood. He has no criminal record, Claudia and his cousin said.

ICE’s Hartford and Boston offices, as well as the agency’s media inquiry email, did not respond to the News’ requests for comment on Monday about why the man was detained.

Claudia told the News that her husband is the household’s breadwinner and that she was not sure how their family would be able to afford rent without his income. The couple has two daughters, ages 1 and 3, and receives financial support from extended family, she said.

Unidad Latina en Acción, a local organization that advocates for immigrants’ rights, is working to raise money for the family and to help them secure a lawyer, the group’s community organizing director, John Jairo Lugo, told the News.

Lugo noted how close the arrest was to Yale’s campus and said ULA is working to recruit Yale students to support their rapid response line for future cases.

“It’s a federal shooting, you’re not going to investigate a federal officer,” Witz says.
“I don’t know if they shot him before and that’s why he crashed into me,” the driver told Franklin Park officers.
The two federal agents involved in Villegas González’s arrest weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting.","As two federal agents tried to revive a Mexican immigrant who was dying from gunshot wounds, one of them sought to explain the shooting.

“He tried to run us over,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer said in body camera footage captured by a Franklin Park cop arriving at the northwest suburban shooting scene Sept. 12.

Video obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows the blue jeans of the other federal agent were left bloodied and torn, and he told local police that he was “dragged a little bit.”

A short time later, Silverio Villegas González’s body was moved from the street and into an ambulance by a group of firefighters and paramedics. He was later pronounced dead at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, records show.

Speaking over a radio, the federal agent who told police that Villegas González tried to use his car as a weapon said his partner had suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.”

“Nothing major,” the injured agent said.

“Nothing major,” his partner echoed.

Shortly after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported the agent “sustained multiple injuries” and was “seriously injured” when he was “dragged a significant distance” by Villegas González’s car as he fled a traffic stop. DHS officials said the agent had opened fire, fearing for his life.

The injured agent was eventually taken to a second ambulance, and his partner said he was going to follow behind, video shows. DHS said his condition was soon stabilized.

“I think we’re good, man,” the second agent said as he began to drive off. “Just shooken up a little.”

As streets were blocked off and nearby schools were placed on lockdown after the shooting, news crews and protesters gathered behind police tape nearby.

Demonstrators banged drums and chanted, while a member of the media asked Franklin Park Police Director Michael Witz if police would be fielding questions.

At one point, Witz explained to his officers that local cops wouldn’t be investigating the shooting. “It’s a federal shooting, you’re not going to investigate a federal officer,” Witz says.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said protocol calls for the “appropriate investigative agency” to initially review ICE shootings. But she didn’t answer questions about the body camera videos or say which agency is investigating the Franklin Park shooting, apparently the first by an on-duty ICE official since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.

After another agency’s probe, ICE will follow up and review “every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm,” she said.

Dawn Catanzaro, a Franklin Park spokesperson, previously said “the FBI Chicago field office is in charge of the investigation,” referring questions to that agency. An FBI spokesperson previously said the agency responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on the scene, but wouldn’t comment on involvement in an ongoing investigation.

The body camera videos, obtained from Franklin Park police through a public records request, offer the most revelatory look yet at the aftermath of the shooting, which has drawn national attention and continued scrutiny.

The videos raise new questions about the narrative put forth by DHS, which is leading an ongoing deportation campaign in the Chicago area that has stoked fears and sparked protests.

The driver of the truck that was struck by Villegas González’s car told police that Villegas González reversed when the federal agents cut him off and tried to take him into custody, video shows. The truck driver said he assumed that Villegas González was shot before the collision, and he recalled hearing at least one gunshot.

“I don’t know if they shot him before and that’s why he crashed into me,” the driver told Franklin Park officers. “Because there should have been no reason for him to crash into me, he could’ve just gone to the left.”

Doubts have been cast on ICE’s narrative of the traffic stop that started the encounter. A witness said he was driving past as Villegas González’s sedan swerved into the semitractor-trailer and two agents approached the crash, but the witness said he didn’t see Villegas González dragging one of the agents behind his car.

Meanwhile, the feds have largely been silent on the incident since it happened, drawing criticism from Gov. JB Pritzker for a lack of transparency.

The two federal agents involved in Villegas González’s arrest weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting. A program requiring them was scrapped by the Trump administration, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported.

Mourners at a vigil for Villegas González said days after his death that the 38-year-old father and cook from Michoacán, Mexico, was a “devoted father” of two and “kind soul.” He was his two children’s caretaker and had dropped off one of his kids at school minutes before he was shot, according to U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill.

Pritzker has called for a “full, factual accounting of what’s happened.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the killing. And Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, said the Mexican government has requested a ”thorough investigation.”

“For everybody to be clear and to have peace of mind, I think it’s important to do that,” Torres Mendivil said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba0da90/2147483647/strip/true/crop/733x418+0+35/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F72%2F51%2F99c566bf45c6879e8097f8b8b52e%2F0922-fp-bodycam-still.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:31.169922

The U.S. had deported a total of 14 West African immigrants to Ghana under controversial circumstances. Although Ghanaian authorities earlier said they have all been sent home, the deportees and their lawyers later told The Associated Press that 11 of them were still at a military facility in Ghana.

The 11 deportees sued the Ghanaian government last week, seeking their release. Eight of them had told the local court that they had legal protections from being deported to their home countries “due to the risk of torture, persecution or inhumane treatment.”

“We have to inform the court that the persons whose human rights we are seeking to enforce were all deported over the weekend,” their lawyer, Oliver Barker-Vormawo, told the court Tuesday at a virtual hearing, adding that the suit had become irrelevant.

“This is precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” he said of the safety concerns of the deportees.

The 11 were four Nigerians, three Togolese, two Malians and one each from Gambia and Liberia, according to court documents seen by the AP.

The Trump administration’s deportation program has faced widespread criticism from human rights experts who cite international protections for asylum-seekers and question whether immigrants will be appropriately screened before being deported.

The administration has been seeking ways to deter immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally and remove those who already have done so, especially those accused of crimes and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home countries.

Faced with court decisions that migrants can’t be sent back to their home countries, the Trump administration has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries under agreements with those governments.

Ghana has joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S.

The U.S. Department of Justice had argued in a federal court earlier this month that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees, and that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. it wouldn’t send the deportees back to their home countries.

Meanwhile, the Washington Litigation Group which was launched in August has already been tapped by about a dozen fired DoJ employees for legal help.
Lowell’s firm has been on a roll signing up several leading figures who the Trump administration has either fired or tried to oust.
“The legal issue in these cases involving fired DoJ employees is not just limited to them,” said Zelinsky.","As the Trump administration has fired federal employees and top officials for political reasons, blocked millions of dollars Congress appropriated and flouted legal norms, several legal outfits are providing crucial pro bono and other help to many individuals hurt by Donald Trump’s authoritarian actions, say lawyers involved and ex-prosecutors.

Lowell & Associates, Democracy Defenders Fund and the Washington Litigation Group, are among the leading legal groups with clients battling to get their jobs back, avoid prosecutions, or recoup millions of dollars that have been illegally blocked, say attorneys with the trio and experts.

Veteran white-collar lawyers, ex-justice department (DoJ) prosecutors and other legal talent at these firms are representing prominent figures Trump’s administration has fired to settle political scores, ex-officials his administration has launched investigations into, and scores of other officials ousted without cause, say lawyers.

Former DoJ prosecutors credit these smaller legal outfits for challenging administration moves that jeopardize the rule of law

“The creation of these new entities reflects a broad-based professional revulsion at the ongoing efforts to undermine the rule of law by the Trump administration, including turning the DoJ into an extension of the White House rather than a department that is faithful to the facts and the law,” said ex-DoJ inspector general Michael Bromwich.

These newer legal outfits in some ways are also helping fill a vacuum created by Trump’s pressure tactics on several major law firms with some Democratic ties which led them to agree to provide hundreds of millions in pro bono help to administration priorities.

Nine big law firms, including Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis, struck deals with Trump in the first months of his second term to avert an executive order that would have made it very hard for them to represent their clients. In total, they agreed to provide almost $1bn in pro bono help to administration priorities including fighting antisemitism and veterans issues, the New York Times has reported.

A few lawyers have left these large firms including Skadden Arps and Milbank in recent months to join the smaller legal outfits now challenging Trump administration actions.

Consider Lowell & Associates which was started this spring by prominent white collar attorney Abbe Lowell and has quickly amassed several very high profile clients suing the Trump administration in cases involving alleged politically motivated firings.

Lowell, in tandem with an attorney for the FBI Agents Association, filed a major lawsuit on 10 September against the FBI director, Kash Patel, and other senior administration officials on behalf of two ex-senior officials, Brian Driscoll Jr and Steven Jensen, who were canned early this year they alleged in a politically driven purge.

Separately, Lowell teamed up with Democracy Defenders Fund in August to challenge Trump’s efforts to fire Federal Reserve Board governor Lisa Cook, as Trump sought to exert control over the historically independent Fed.

Two courts this month ruled against the administration which temporarily blocked Cook’s firing and allowed her to stay in her post for a pivotal Fed meeting on 16 and 17 September; the administration on the 18th appealed its case to the supreme court.

On another legal front, Democracy Defenders Fund won a major court ruling on behalf of AmeriCorps which it represented as counsel: a district court in July ruled that hundreds of millions of dollars Congress appropriated, but the administration nixed for AmeriCorps, should be restored.

Meanwhile, the Washington Litigation Group which was launched in August has already been tapped by about a dozen fired DoJ employees for legal help. It was formed by an elite group of veteran DC legal figures including former senior DoJ official Peter Keisler, retired DC judge Ellen Segal Huvelle and well-known white-collar lawyer Tom Green, who serve on an advisory steering committee.

Legal battles mounted by this trio and others involving attorneys with Democracy Forward and the Alden Law Group have helped spur a major surge in lawsuits against the administration that the New York Times in July pegged at over 400.

Given the Trump administration’s widespread attacks on the rule of law, the legal battles facing these new firms and their clients are daunting and the dozens of clients they represent vary considerably, say firm leaders.

“Week after chaotic week, we are seeing an onslaught of authoritarian actions, from dismantling government agencies, to firing public servants who refuse to toe the Maga line, to militarizing the police in Washington DC” said Susan Corke, the executive director of the Democracy Defenders Fund.

“The foundations of our democracy are being chipped away in real time, and we are facing a congressional majority that refuses to act as a check on executive power. That is why legal pushback is so critical right now. The courts remain one of the last places where truth, accountability, and the rule of law still matter … We are standing up for the principle that no one, not even a president, is above the law.”

Corke’s points are underscored by the big legal battles that the Fund has been waging.

In February, for instance, the Fund filed a lawsuit challenging the dismantling of USAID under the appointments clause because of the key role played by multi billionaire Elon Musk and his “department of government efficiency”. The lawsuit is now a class action on behalf of thousands of USAID workers who have lost their jobs.

The Fund, founded in 2023 by ex-ambassador Norman Eisen who serves as its executive chair, also conducts investigations in matters ranging from Trump’s ties to notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to the Trump family’s enormously lucrative stakes in cryptocurrency ventures.

To tackle other major legal battles sparked by Trump administration actions, Lowell created his small eponymous firm after leaving the much larger firm of Winston & Strawn where his high-profile clients included former president Joe Biden’s son Hunter, as well as Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner.

In a statement when the firm launched, Lowell said its mission would entail defending clients including institutions, individuals and others that are “facing politicized investigations, civil and administrative actions”.

Lowell’s firm has been on a roll signing up several leading figures who the Trump administration has either fired or tried to oust. Lowell has been representing Susan Monarez, the ex director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was fired by the White House last month: Monarez told a Senate panel on 17 September that her firing came after health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine sceptic, pressured her unsuccessfully to oust career scientists and pre approve vaccine recommendations for the public.

In another high-stakes battle, Lowell and Democracy Defenders Fund filed successfully for a temporary restraining order with DC federal court on 2 September to block Trump’s firing of Cook on the grounds that he doesn’t have the authority to do so.

Another client is the New York attorney general ,Letitia James, who the justice department has been investigating for alleged mortgage fraud which James has denied. Trump has long deemed James a political foe for bringing a successful civil fraud case against Trump’s real estate empire last year with a $500m penalty. The penalty was overturned last month, but Trump and his two eldest sons remain barred from serving in leadership posts for a few years.

Last month too Lowell was hired to represent former Trump national security adviser John Bolton who became a leading critic of Trump at the end of his first term and wrote a hard hitting book about his tenure after Trump ousted him. The FBI recently raided his home amid allegations of retaining classified records.

“Any thorough review will show nothing inappropriate was stored or kept by Ambassador Bolton,” Lowell said in a 4 September statement that was the first public response from Bolton’s team related to the substance of the search.

Lowell’s firm has also teamed up with well-known lawyer Mark Zaid to represent three fired DoJ employees; and Lowell is representing Zaid, who has prominent whistleblower clients and whose security clearance was revoked by Trump.

Lowell’s small firm is staffed with several veteran attorneys who left Winston & Strawn and Skadden Arps after the latter firm cut a deal with the administration to avoid its crackdown on the legal profession.

Meanwhile, the even newer Washington Litigation Group is relying on four attorneys to handle its growing volume of cases, said steering committee member and senior counsel Nathaniel Zelinsky.

The firm’s other lawyers are James Pearce and Mary Dohrmann, who were part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team that brought charges against Trump for election subversion drive after his 2020 election loss and his retention of hundreds of classified documents after he left office, and DoJ veteran Samantha Bateman.

“In an environment where the executive branch has targeted law firms, the WLG stands ready to provide pro bono representation for those seeking to vindicate the rule of law,” said Pearce.

The firm has already filed a successful amicus brief on behalf of the Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey challenging Trump’s naming of Alina Habba, an ex-defense lawyer for Trump, to be US attorney for New Jersey after a very brief stint as interim US attorney.

In late August, a federal judge ruled in their favor declaring that Habba’s appointment was illegal which the government quickly appealed.

“The president’s efforts to install Alina Habba – like his attempt to purge the civil service of non-partisan public servants–are designed to mold the government into his image and undermine the rule of law,” said Zelinsky.

The firm has also been representing about a dozen justice department officials and employees who have been fired, often without cause or explanation, since Trump took office again. One such client is Tara Twomey, a career civil servant who was director of the executive office of the US Trustee program at DoJ which oversees bankruptcy cases and private trustees for about two years until her March firing.

“The legal issue in these cases involving fired DoJ employees is not just limited to them,” said Zelinsky. “The question is whether the President can fire every single employee in the Federal government – down to the person sweeping the floors – in violation of the laws Congress passed ensuring a professional, non-partisan civil service.”

Former DoJ officials say these newer legal shops are badly needed to counter administration attacks on the rule of law.

“The DoJ and the FBI are targeting people rather than crimes, and there is a vast need for lawyers to represent individuals and institutions that are under attack by the administration on multiple fronts,” said Bromwich.

A senior counsel with Steptoe, Bromwich has represented pro bono some clients ousted at DoJ including the former pardon attorney Elizabeth Oyer, who has been battling to get her job back with help from Democracy Defenders Fund and others.

Similarly, Daniel Richman, a Columbia law professor and ex-federal prosecutor, said: “It’s heartening but not surprising that a number of respected lawyers have put political differences aside to defend the governmental institutions they value and the individual government officials who have fallen victim to the Trump administration’s assaults on those institutions.

“Any retaliation by the administration against those lawyers or their clients may hurt them economically, but I’d like to think the profession values those with the law on their side who stand up to lawless and often vindictive executive action.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/575ea9c5dae5efa616e4babbd090b7238984d5a3/616_0_3344_2675/master/3344.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9c96f818bc4d66b54dc02d283f39cc3",N,,2025-09-23 09:57:32.116366

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

President Trump yesterday signed an executive order purporting to designate Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization” and directing “all relevant agencies” to “utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations … conducted by Antifa, any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa,” or those who financially support it. Legal experts point out that the United States does not have a “domestic terrorism” designation. Antifa, a shorthand for anti-fascists, is a diffuse political ideology and not a unified organization. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times; Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

Trump yesterday claimed that the use of a common pain reliever, acetaminophen, in pregnant women causes autism. He did not present evidence backing his claim. In a POLITICO op-ed that announced new research into the root causes of autism and endorsed a B-vitamin-based drug to treat the disorder, Food and Drug Agency Commissioner Marty Makary, National Institute of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz were more circumspect, noting that family control studies “have failed to find a correlation” between acetaminophen and autism. Azeen Ghorayshi reports for the New York Times.

The Agriculture Department yesterday put a team of federal economists and researchers responsible for producing the government survey that measures hunger in the United States on indefinite paid leave, the employees’ union said. According to a notice seen by the Wall Street Journal, USDA officials said the leave is “not a disciplinary action”.

The family fled the South American country in 2017 in the face of a spiraling economy and mounting government repression.
For years, she lived in Colombia and Peru, like millions of other Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years.","JAQUE, Panama -- As the boat bounced across choppy Pacific waters, Mariela Gómez and her two children huddled for 17 hours on top of sloshing gas tanks, uncertain of what lay ahead in the dense jungle.

The 36-year-old Venezuelan mother was among a million migrants who journeyed across the continent in recent years in the hopes of reaching the United States. But with legal pathways slashed under U.S. President Donald Trump, she and thousands of other Venezuelans are now trying to make their way back in a “reverse migration.”

Over 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have returned to South America since Trump’s immigration crackdown began, according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.

Struggling to buy even food after failed attempts to stay in the U.S., Gómez can't afford the $280-per-person charge for the more frequented Caribbean route to Colombia. So a growing number of migrants like her are boarding boats that ferry cargo between Panama's capital and Colombia's jungle-clad Pacific coast.

The new route is half the price and twice as dangerous.

“We lost hope,” she said. “We’re trying to return, but we don’t have the money to go back.”

In recent years, migrants fleeing the crisis in Venezuela once crossed the perilous jungles of the Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama and waited months in Mexico for an asylum appointment in the U.S. But when Trump took office, many of those people were left stranded in Mexico. Without other options, they turned back, winding down through Central America on buses.

They chug aboard slow-moving cargo boats packed with merchandise along Panama’s other coast in the Pacific Ocean for days, before boarding precarious motor boats that shoot along the coast. The boats are often packed with 15 to 30 people. Hundreds so far have traveled the route, according to a United Nations report released earlier this month.

“People arrive with very few resources, some with only the clothes on their backs,” said 56-year-old boat driver Nacor Rivera. “Many can’t pay for the boat ride, so I’ve had to help a lot of them, carrying them for free.”

In June, one of those boats carrying 38 people crashed at sea, injuring a pregnant woman, children and a person with a disability who lost their wheelchair.

They land in jungled swathes of Colombia, a region rife with armed groups that prey on migrants, where there are no shelters and little access to medical care, according to the U.N. report.

“We urge authorities to care for people in this reverse migration to stop them from falling into criminal and trafficking networks of illegal armed groups, and turn them into victims of even greater violence,"" said Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights officer in Colombia, in a statement.

Migrants land with serious cases of dehydration, burns, malnutrition and mental health issues. Those without money can “remain stranded in inhumane conditions,” the report said.

That was the case of Jesús Aguilar, a Venezuelan migrant who was stuck in a rural Panamanian town in the Darien Gap for two months. He managed to slowly scrounge together money to pay for a boat ride to Colombia after a local offered him work cleaning their farm.

Others, like Gómez’s family, spent months in Panama City saving money to travel back to Venezuela, but when they came up short, they decided to take the cheaper route along the Pacific.

Sitting on top of gasoline tanks, Gómez cradles her 5-year-old son swaddled in blankets. The family fled the South American country in 2017 in the face of a spiraling economy and mounting government repression.

For years, she lived in Colombia and Peru, like millions of other Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. Unable to make ends meet in countries that have struggled to manage the crush of vulnerable people, Gómez began to look to the U.S. with hopes of building a new life.

After crossing the Darien Gap and later the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas in October, her family was quickly swept up by the U.S. Border Patrol and handed over to Mexican authorities who dropped them in southern Mexico.

Shortly after, she decided her only way forward was to return home. Without work and with cartels preying on migrants like her, staying in southern Mexico wasn't an option.

At least in Venezuela she has her home and her family, she said.

“It would have been risking our lives and risking the life of my child” to keep going, Gómez said. “We're just hoping God protects us.”

Now, as she returns home, she's not sure what she will find in Venezuela, which has faced an ongoing crackdown on dissent by the government following last year's contested elections.

She said if the government of President Nicolás Maduro remains in power, staying in her country doesn't seem like an option. “I would have to leave my country again, maybe go to Chile,” she pondered. “I would have to try my luck in another country. Again.""

“But right now, we just have to focus on getting to Colombia,” she added.

Juarez Zeferino is now pursuing a legal path to come back to the US, where he had lived since he was eight.","Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino spends much of his days outdoors, harvesting bananas and hiking vast, bramble-laden trails. But for more than a quarter of 2025, he barely saw the sun. After being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in March, the farm-worker activist was placed in a detention center in Washington state, where he remained until he agreed to voluntarily leave the US.

“I probably would say five times, in the three months and a half I was in there, they offered me to go outside,” he explained on a Zoom call from his family farm in Guerrero, Mexico, where he has been for over a month.

Juarez Zeferino is among the thousands of people who have agreed to leave the country after arriving without documentation – a group that is reportedly growing.

His arrest was officially based on a deportation order about which he says he never received a notification.

Between January and July, Ice data shows that more than 11,000 non-citizens reported that they self-deported, but many others have likely done so without registering their departure with the government. The data does not make clear how many people, like Juarez Zeferino, chose to exit the US after being arrested.

Colleagues, friends and supporters of the 25-year-old organizer believe he was targeted by the Trump administration for his success as a farm worker organizer. Juarez Zeferino said he agrees with that assessment.

“I would say definitely,” he said when asked if he believes he was targeted. “I would say yes.”

Ice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached for comment in July, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that allegations of Ice politically targeting Juarez Zeferino were “categorically FALSE”, calling him “an illegal alien from Mexico with a final order of removal from a judge”.

The weeks-long stretches indoors were just one major problem Juarez Zeferino faced during his time in the Northwest detention center in Tacoma, Washington, a massive facility which holds more than 1,500 people who are being threatened with deportation.

Another was the food: meals would often arrive well after midnight, and at times featured “dangerously undercooked” meat. On several occasions, he said, detainees were served nearly raw, bloody chicken; those who ate it often suffered upset stomachs and painful cramps.

“I asked the guards why a lot of the foods were undercooked, or what’s happening in the kitchen,” he said. “The general answer they would give is that they were understaffed.”

The understaffing caused other issues, too. When Juarez Zeferino and others would attempt to receive medical care, for instance, they were often turned away after long, arduous waits.

“When I got sick, I just tried to sleep,” he said. “I stopped even bothering signing up to see a doctor, because I really had no hope of getting in front of one.”

The facility did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Juarez Zeferino’s most harrowing experience in the immigration jail came within his first week in the facility. At about 10pm, he saw a guard walking around with a list of detainees set to be placed on a deportation flight that night. He saw his name highlighted, and in a panic called his lawyer, who was able to have his name removed.

“But the only way we were able to stop it was because I saw my name,” he said. “If I didn’t see my name, they would just have pushed me out, put me on a flight.”

Despite these uncomfortable and sometimes torturous conditions, Juarez Zeferino struggled deeply with his decision to self-deport.

“It was very hard, especially with all the work that I have done, the relationships I’ve built, to decide to leave” he said. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to reconnect, or how I could continue the job of organizing.”

During his 18 years in Washington, Juarez Zeferino fought for labor protections for undocumented agricultural workers like himself, with a remarkable success rate. As a teenager, Juarez Zeferino helped win a farmworker union and organized an international boycott against berry giant Driscoll. He also played an integral part in winning statewide heat protections for outdoor laborers, a cap on rent, and guaranteed overtime pay.

Now, from Mexico, he is continuing to organize with Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the union he helped found, and Community to Community, the food justice group with whom he organizes. Every week, he attends remote meetings.

In recent months, he has been pushing Washington and other states to pass bills authorizing officials to regularly inspect Ice detention centers unannounced.

He is also still organizing for farmworker justice; one top priority is ending reliance on the H-2A contract labor program, which allows farmowners to recruit foreign agricultural laborers to work on their farms temporarily and then return to their home country.

Nearly a third of all Washington state farm laborers have now been replaced by guest workers via the program, which Juarez Zeferino has for years staunchly criticized, arguing it crowds out domestic workers in favor of foreign laborers who can be far easier to exploit and mistreat.

Juarez Zeferino believes the industry’s desire to “replace all local workers with imported guest workers” has fueled the Trump administration’s war on farmworker activists. Since his arrest, border patrol agents in May arrested farmworker organizers on a Vermont dairy farm, and in May, Ice arrested workers on a New York farm who were involved in a seminal labor case. In August, Ice raided the same New York farm again.

“They really want to push out all those folks that know their rights,” he said.

Juarez Zeferino is now pursuing a legal path to come back to the US, where he had lived since he was eight. But in the meantime, he is enjoying his time back in Santa Cruz Yucucani, the village where he is living for the first time since he was a child. He is staying with his parents and siblings, who left the US just days before he was arrested, and his partner.

Though he is still working on a farm, it belongs to his family, so he can take breaks whenever he likes.

The best part of being back in Mexico, he says, is picking plants to eat – not from fields, but from mountaintops where they grow wild.

“Just gathering the food is a whole experience,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef54f1607a2c6b98386edd6a32fb6050225152a/0_108_1536_1229/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=805d92128665ad66845f243c14439b45",N,,2025-09-23 07:57:01.272260

""To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,"" DHS posted on X Monday morning.

The ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests. The bill was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom Saturday and goes into effect in January.

In a news release, DHS called the ban ""unconstitutional"" and claimed ICE officers are ""facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them.""

Trump administration officials have defended use of masks, saying immigration agents face strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they carry out enforcement in service of Trump's drive toward mass deportation. Obscuring their identities is necessary for the safety of the agents and their families, officials contend.

The Supreme Court has decided to review that ruling.
The brief urges the Supreme Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit.
GEO should not be allowed to take a shortcut to the appellate courts rather than face the respondents at trial.","This month, the Cato Institute joined an amicus curiae brief filed with the US Supreme Court, arguing that the GEO Group should not be allowed a pretrial appeal in a lawsuit, as ruled by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

GEO Group, the petitioner, makes billions of dollars a year operating private immigration detention facilities. The company allegedly forced every person detained at the Aurora Immigration Processing Center in Aurora, CO, to perform unpaid janitorial work, threatening that, if they refused, they would be sent to “the hole”—solitary confinement. In addition, GEO allegedly fulfilled its other staffing needs through a “voluntary work program.” Although technically voluntary, many people detained at the Center had little choice but to participate.

Working for GEO was the only way they could earn money to buy food and toiletries from the commissary or make phone calls while detained. These were not luxuries: The “inadequate” meals GEO reportedly served left those in its care “chronically hungry”—unable to get enough to eat without “voluntarily” working for GEO. Initially, the company paid these workers “$1.00 per day and a bottle of soda once a week.” GEO later reduced that to just $1 a day.

Over a decade ago, the respondents filed a lawsuit, alleging that GEO subjected them to human trafficking. The case has yet to go to trial in part because GEO sought a pretrial appeal under a doctrine that shields government contractors from liability for actions that were authorized and directed by the government. The Tenth Circuit held that GEO cannot appeal yet because the district court has not reached a final decision in the case. The Supreme Court has decided to review that ruling.

Cato joined a brief filed by the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center and the Institute for Justice. The brief urges the Supreme Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit. Judges have crafted numerous textually and historically baseless legal doctrines to advantage government officials in litigation. As illegitimate as these doctrines are when applied to actual government bureaucrats, it would be even worse to let private actors share in them, as GEO attempts to do here.

Since President Trump took office, 15 people have died in immigration detention, 10 of those deaths occurred between January and June, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

""Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody,"" Ossoff told NPR in an interview.

The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.

Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.

Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.

But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.

Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.

""We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those,"" Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. ""ICE is dedicated to transparency.""

In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.

""ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates,"" they wrote, adding that ICE guidance requires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website ""within 48 hours,"" and directs that ""every effort should be made to post the interim notice"" sooner.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3068x1726+7+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F56%2F50e3c2784ff4872782ef56419a24%2Fgettyimages-2233996808.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:57:40.170956

Seattle police are the target of new recruiting efforts by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In a new Homeland Security advertisement that first aired last week, the commercial calls out Seattle-area officers encouraging them to join ICE.

“Attention Seattle law enforcement,” the ad begins, “you took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe, but in sanctuary cities you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The ad urges law enforcement members to join ICE and help “catch the worst of the worst."" Those who join ICE can receive a $50,000 bonus, according to the advertisement.

Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson was quick to criticize the campaign.

""Trump is trying to deport our neighbors while weakening the progress we’ve made on public safety as a pretext to sending in the National Guard,"" she said. ""I have one message: stay out of Seattle.”

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's office said it is working with the Seattle Police Department (SPD) to prepare a statement to be released on Tuesday.

KING 5 reached out to the King County Sheriff's Office and has not heard back.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security said the recruitment efforts are paying off and that people interested in becoming ICE agents are responding favorably to the messaging.

“ICE has received more than 150,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,” said United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in a Sept. 16 press release. “We have already issued more than 18,000 tentative job offers. Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country.”

The career pitch could make staffing shortages worse at the local level, said KING 5 Law Enforcement Analyst John Urquhart, the former King County Sheriff.

""If you want to fight crime, become a community police officer ... help people,"" Urquhart said. ""You can make a difference in your local community. You don't need to go to ICE, wear a mask, to fight crime.""

Washington state law prevents local law enforcement agencies from helping federal immigration agents. Seattle Municipal Code also restricts officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.

SPD has previously said it ""does not ask about an individual's immigration status unless directly connected to a criminal investigation, such as human trafficking.""

In recent months, ICE has become a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, ramping up deportations and fear among those who are undocumented. The Trump Administration has a goal of removing 1 million people per year via ICE, according to the 2026 budget overview.

On the ICE recruitment website, it states interested entry-level candidates do not need any college education to apply and clarifies the offered benefits. The salary range listed is $49,739 to $89,528 per year, and $63,148 to $101,860 per year for candidates over 40 years old.

The Seattle Police Department offers a starting salary of $103,000 with a $7,500 signing bonus for new officers.

""This report is critical to our fight against hunger in America, and Trump has abandoned it just as he’s abandoned working families.""","Two months after President Donald Trump enacted the biggest-ever cut to federal food assistance, his administration ended a key yearly report on food insecurity, drawing widespread condemnation Monday from critics who accused the president of once again trying to hide the harms of his policies.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Saturday that it will stop publishing its annual Household Food Security reports, claiming that the surveys—which are the federal government's primary means of gauging hunger—""failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.""

""These redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous studies do nothing more than fear-monger,"" USDA added.

Experts warned that the USDA's move will make it more difficult to track the harmful effects. Critics say that's exactly the point.

""Step 1: Increase hunger with massive SNAP cuts, increase food prices with tariffs,"" Congresswoman Shontel Brown (D-Ohio) said Monday on social media, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. ""Step 2: Abruptly end USDA hunger report.""

""The Trump administration doesn’t solve problems, it hides them,"" Brown added.

Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) also posted about the matter Monday, calling the USDA move ""shameful and cowardly.""

""Trump wants the USDA to stop collecting data on food insecurity because he knows hunger will spike after his Big, Ugly Bill kicks millions of families off food assistance,"" she wrote, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act the president signed on July 4.

The legislation approved the deepest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in history while slashing billions from other essential social programs to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. The law ends health coverage and food assistance for millions of Americans at a time when more than 47 million Americans—including 1 in 5 US children—are living in food insecure households.

As Common Dreams has reported, food banks and other lifelines—many of them severely underresourced—are bracing for a surge in hunger resulting from the Republican cuts.

The USDA's move follows Trump's August 1 firing of former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, baselessly accusing her of manipulating economic data to harm him politically after the agency published a report showing only 73,000 jobs added to the economy the previous month.

Over the last several months, masked immigration officers have abducted people from courthouses, their cars, on the street, and at their workplaces.

On September 20, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed the No Secret Police Act, which bars, with limited exceptions, local, state, and federal law enforcement officers from wearing “a facial covering that conceals or obscures their facial identity in the performance of their duties,” including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, or ski mask. The prohibition does not apply to medical masks worn to prevent transmission of disease. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor and the officer is liable to the victim for no less than $10,000.

California is the first state in the country to ban the practice, although similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois and New York, as well as at the federal level.

“No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,” State Sen. Scott Wiener (D), the bill’s sponsor, said in a statement. “As this authoritarian regime expands its reach into every aspect of daily life — including terrorizing people where they work, where they live, where they go to school, where they shop, where they seek health care — California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.”

The Trump administration has indicated that it has no intention of complying with the legislation.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X: “Good news for Americans and public safety: @ICEGov and @DHSgov law enforcement are part of the federal government. We don’t need to abide by this garbage.”

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli posted on X that he had “directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations” and that “[o]ur agents will continue to protect their identities.”

“The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” Essayli said. “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress.”

The federal government is expected to challenge the law.

In an op-ed for the Sacramento Bee, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, argued that the legislation was constitutional. State and local governments, he wrote, “can require that federal employees comply with general laws unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties.”

According to a criminal complaint, four of the defendants dressed in black military-style clothing, some wearing body armor, and began shooting fireworks at the facility.

When an Alvarado police officer responded to the scene, another defendant in their group allegedly shot the officer in the neck from nearby woods, while another alleged shooter across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional officers who had stepped outside the facility.

The letter urges him to veto Assembly Bill (AB) 715—a dangerous classroom censorship bill that will silence Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Jewish, and other marginalized voices in California public schools by criminalizing honest discussions on Palestine and other global human rights issues.

In the letter, signatories outlined their concerns about AB 715’s vague and sweeping mandates on “factual accuracy,” its disproportionate focus on one form of hate outside a broader civil rights framework, and its reference to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition was first incorporated in President Biden’s 2023 U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and has been widely criticized—including by its own author—for conflating antisemitism with legitimate criticism of the state of Israel and being used to silence free speech on school campuses.

The letter also emphasized that, while challenging antisemitism in schools is essential, AB 715’s narrow framework erases, and even punishes, the identities and lived experiences of Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian students.

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“AB 715 is a dangerous bill that trades facts-based education and honest conversations on critical global justice issues for censorship and erasure. Our students deserve classrooms where they can speak freely, ask difficult questions, and see their histories accurately represented. Instead, this bill threatens to chill free speech and criminalize discussion of Palestinian history and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.

“Governor Newsom has a responsibility to protect students’ right to learn, and we strongly urge him to uphold this responsibility by vetoing AB 715. We cannot allow censorship to masquerade as safety.”

Organizations that signed onto the letter include American Muslims for Palestine, Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, the Council of Sacramento Valley Islamic Organizations, the Islamic Center of Southern California, the Muslim Community Association of San Francisco Bay Area, the Muslim Leadership Council of San Diego, and the Shia Muslim Council of Southern California.

CAIR-CA is calling on all Californians to stand up for academic freedom and urge the Governor to veto AB 715.

In that case, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D. Roosevelt as the president worked to implement the New Deal. The justices unanimously found commissioners can be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.

The justices’ decision then ushered in an era of powerful independent federal agencies charged with regulating labor relations, employment discrimination and public airwaves. But it has long rankled conservative legal theorists who argue such agencies should answer to the president.

The Justice Department argues Trump can fire board members for any reason as he works to carry out his agenda. “The President and the government suffer irreparable harm when courts transfer even some of that executive power to officers beyond the President’s control,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. Courts have no power to order reinstatement, only back pay, Sauer argued.

But Slaughter’s attorneys say that regulatory decisions will be based more on politics than on board members’ expertise if the president can fire congressionally confirmed board members at will. “If the President is to be given new powers Congress has expressly and repeatedly refused to give him, that decision should come from the people’s elected representatives,” they argued.

The court will hear arguments unusually early in the process, before the case has fully worked its way through lower courts.

Two other board members of independent agencies asked the justices to also hear their cases if they took up the Slaughter case: Gwynne Wilcox, of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, of the Merit Systems Protection Board.

In a Monday statement, the department claimed that police ""under JB Pritzker’s sanctuary jurisdiction refused to answer multiple calls for assistance.""

Fox News Digital reported last Friday that federal officials clashed with a group of protesters who were blocking ICE vehicles from entering and exiting a processing facility in Broadview, Illinois.

DHS labeled the protesters ""rioters"" and said that so far, federal law enforcement has arrested 16 rioters.

""The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them of the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety,"" said Hill. He added, ""Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest.""

""The media needs to use extreme caution before reporting what the Trump administration is saying given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement,"" said Hill.

The DHS statement said the protest disrupted an operation targeting ""some of the worst of the worst—including criminals convicted of drug trafficking, domestic abuse, drinking and driving, and assault,"" who were being processed at the facility.

The agency highlighted some of the criminal illegals who were being processed when the protest broke out.

Among those was Andres Ventura-Uvaldo, a criminal illegal and Mexican national, who the agency said was previously arrested for felony DUI and domestic violence.

Another, Alberto Algeria Barron, also a Mexican national, was previously removed from the U.S. in 2014 and was convicted for domestic battery twice, according to DHS.

Erwin Jose Roa-Mustafa, an illegal alien from the Dominican Republic, was also being processed at the facility after pleading guilty on federal charges of conspiracy and intent to distribute a controlled substance and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl.

DHS said that ICE was also processing another alleged drug trafficker, Ibis Alberto Testa Nunez, from Mexico, who was previously arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration for cocaine possession and possession with intent to distribute.

Two others, Salvador Alcantar-Alcantar, from Mexico, was previously arrested for DUI, trespassing and assault, and Carlos Eduardo Chavez-Cardenas, from Bolivia, was previously convicted for DUI and possession of drugs, according to DHS.

Rights guaranteed to all by the Constitution are being eroded, such as the right to due process of law, he said.
Chaplain Shane Sims of Athens Al-Huda Islamic Center told the crowd that immigration is “central” to his faith.
“We are all beloved children of God,” said Joel Siebentritt, representing the Athens Friends Meeting (Quakers).
“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev.","Nearly 300 people chanted and sang their way along Prince Avenue to the federal courthouse downtown Sunday afternoon in a protest march and rally against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

Sponsored by two Athens faith-based organizations, the tone of the protest was not so much political as moral and religious, condemning the crackdown as contradicting the spiritual teachings of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim congregations that form the two groups, the Interfaith Clergy Partnership of Greater Athens and the Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition.

Marchers held hand-drawn signs, chanted slongs like “Hey, ho, hey, ho, ICE has got to go,” and sang familiar protest songs such as “We Shall Overcome” as they made their way up the sidewalk, some using canes, some couples with strollers. Often, passing drivers blew their car horns in support.

Organizers warned the marchers after they had gathered across Prince Avenue from the Clarke County School District headquarters that if they encountered counterprotesters, they should meet them with love, but no counterprotesters materialized.

As they quietly gathered at the courthouse, music minister Tom Eggleston played hymns of his own composition on a portable electric organ set up on the building’s portico.

The Rev. Daryl Bloodsaw, one of the faith leaders who spoke after the long line of protestors had arrived at the federal building, quoted from the Bible: “It has been said, ‘We are commanded to love them as we love ourselves.’”

Bloodsaw is pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church West, a church with a long history of civil rights activism. Ebenezer’s sanctuary is a block away from the development going up at the old Milledge Avenue Varsity site, where Black students picketed the segregated restaurant. The church was at the heart of protests during the 1960s and 1970s, when racial barriers finally came down at the University of Georgia and the Clarke County public schools.

He reminded the gathering of how the Christian Bible instructs the faithful to treat strangers—with welcome and kindness.

“I feel like our democracy is being melted,” Bloodsaw said. Rights guaranteed to all by the Constitution are being eroded, such as the right to due process of law, he said.

“We are called here by our moral values,” said another speaker, the Rev. Pippin Whitaker of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. “We are living in a time of spiritual peril,” she said.

Chaplain Shane Sims of Athens Al-Huda Islamic Center told the crowd that immigration is “central” to his faith. “The earliest Muslims were immigrants,” he said.

“We are all beloved children of God,” said Joel Siebentritt, representing the Athens Friends Meeting (Quakers).

“God just made God’s children. It isn’t God’s children and somebody else’s,” said the Rev. Nikki Mathis of St. Gregory the Great Episcopal Church. She encouraged the marchers to “Pray the name, talk the talk and walk the walk.” The abuse of immigrants didn’t just begin in January, but has been going on much longer, she reminded them.

“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev. Tom Buchanan of Covenant Presbyterian Church.

Mr. Trump had fired Ms. Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the F.T.C., in March. The federal agency, which enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws, typically has five commissioners — three from the president’s party and two from the opposing party.

After their firing, the two commissioners had said they planned to challenge their removal in court, relying on a 1935 landmark Supreme Court case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that also involved the firing of an F.T.C. commissioner.

In its brief order Monday, the court said it would consider in December the broader question of whether to overturn the precedent that has prevented presidents from removing independent regulators without cause and solely over policy disagreements.

The decision by the court’s conservative majority to allow Mr. Trump to remove Ms. Slaughter drew a dissent from the three liberal justices.

“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency.","CHICAGO — Organizers are planning daily protests at the Broadview ICE facility until it shuts down amid the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement activity.

Organizers have long held regular protests on Fridays at the facility, 1930 Beach St. in suburban Broadview; but now, they’re calling on demonstrators to join daily protests at 7-9 a.m. and again at 6 p.m.

“Shut down the Broadview ICE facility,” reads an Instagram post announcing the intent to now stage daily protests.

The facility is a processing center for people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Detainees are taken from the facility to detention centers across the United States.

That’s made it a key area as the federal administration has launched two operations — the ICE-led Midway Blitz and Border Patrol-led At Large — aimed at arresting undocumented people in Chicago and across Illinois.

Chicagoans and suburban residents, seeking to resist, have increasingly turned up at the Broadview facility protests. Friday’s protests saw federal agents attack peaceful protesters, tear gassing them and shooting pepper balls.

Over the weekend, there were reports the facility was “evacuating” people or closing entirely. Those are untrue, a Department of Homeland Security leader said in a statement Sunday.

“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency. “Since Friday, rioters and sanctuary politicians have obstructed and assaulted law enforcement. These rioters have thrown tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.

“Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Federal agents have arrested 16 people connected to the protesters, McLaughlin said.

Last week, four Illinois lawmakers asked top officials at the Department of Homeland Security to disclose how many people have been held at the Broadview Processing Center and describe its conditions, Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia said in a press release last week. Garcia is one of four representatives who ICE denied access to the building after showing up to investigate “inhumane conditions” earlier this summer.

Other Chicago ICE Sightings

Federal agents detained one person in the 2600 block of West 35th Place in Brighton Park, organizers of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council reported on social media.

Early Monday, organizers and neighbors spotted federal agents wearing black vests that read “police” in Gage Park and Chicago Lawn, including at West 63rd Street and South Kedzie Avenue, West 55th and South Kedzie Avenue and West 63d and South Rockwell Streets, according to a social media alert posted by the Southwest Side Rapid Response team.

Northwest Side organizers said two people were detained by federal agents after receiving suspicious calls asking them to report to 5700 N.

One person was detained Friday after receiving a call asking them to pick up a prize at that site, while another was detained when the person showed up to pick up scrap metal, according to the group.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning ICE agents and most law enforcement from wearing masks to hide their identities. He says it's the country's first. Trump administration officials say they won't obey it because the state lacks that authority. Gerardo Zavala of CapRadio in Sacramento reports.

GERARDO ZAVALA, BYLINE: Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed the new law over the weekend in Los Angeles, the city that has seen an immigration crackdown that he says continues.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GAVIN NEWSOM: Unmarked cars. People in masks. People quite literally disappearing. No due process. No rights. No rights in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights.

ZAVALA: The law bars local and federal law enforcement from wearing masks except for things like riot gear and medical masks or when doing undercover work. Newsom also signed laws requiring officers to display their name or badge number and to restrict ICE access to schools and hospitals without warrants.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NEWSOM: This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.

ZAVALA: ICE officials have said their agents face doxing, targeting and threats - something Newsom says are dealt with by laws protecting police. But Bill Essayli, the acting U.S. attorney for the central district of California, said on social media that the new mask law would have no effect on federal operations. Many California law enforcement groups also oppose the law. And Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, who's running for governor, called it reckless while campaigning Friday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHAD BIANCO: They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks. They didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves. They have a love affair for criminals, and they have an absolute hatred for law enforcement.

ZAVALA: The law could end up in court like other disputes between states and the Trump administration over sanctuary policies and the use of National Guard units. It takes effect next year, and a few other states are considering similar measures.

SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and 26 other U.S. Senators to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

In a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers urgently requested that ICE stop detaining pregnant women absent exceptional circumstances, and asked the Department to provide information about the number of pregnant women in its custody and the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women who are in ICE detention—as well as answers to a long list of additional oversight questions no later than September 26th.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study published in 2020 found that between 2016 and 2018, ICE detained pregnant women over 4,600 times. As Congress increased its oversight into the detention of pregnant women, that number dropped to just 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women detained in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024. After President Trump took office this year, the Administration stopped providing reports to Congress on the number of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in their custody.

The Senators wrote: “We write to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee site visit and media reports point to the alarming detention of a significant number of pregnant women in ICE custody. We urgently request that ICE cease detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women absent exceptional circumstances and that the agency provide information about the number and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in its custody.”

In their letter, the senators referenced reporting on 911 calls recorded from ICE facilities involving pregnant women in “distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain,” as well as a recent Senate Judiciary Committee staff visit to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, LA that found 14 pregnant women—a shockingly large number—detained at the time of the visit, with many of them receiving little to no medical care.

The Senators continued: “Medical research links ICE detention to high rates of pregnancy complications, with physicians finding serious risks to both fetal and maternal health. These already serious risks are heightened by the deteriorating conditions inside detention facilities, including severe overcrowding, reports of inadequate food and water, and lack of emergency medical care. At this time, we do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing.”

The Senators concluded: “ICE’s own standards are unambiguous on the detention, monitoring, and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in detention. ICE Directive 11032.4, Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant, Postpartum, or Nursing Individuals (2021 Pregnancy Directive), states that ICE should not detain pregnant, postpartum, or nursing individuals except under very limited circumstances. If detention of these individuals is deemed absolutely necessary, the directive provides detailed requirements for ensuring that they are monitored closely, kept in suitable facilities, and given access to both routine and emergency health care… Given the urgent nature of pregnant women’s health and safety needs, we request that you ensure all detention facilities are in full compliance with current law and the 2021 Pregnancy Directive.”

“In defiance of medical evidence counseling against their detention, ICE is horrifically detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in conditions that compromise their physical and mental health. It is clear that ICE is ill-prepared to meet even the minimum healthcare and safety standards for pregnant women in their custody. The National Immigration Law Center calls on Secretary Noem to immediately halt the detention of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women, resume transparent reporting, and ensure full compliance with federal law and agency directives. The health and dignity of these women must no longer be compromised,” said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, Senior Policy Counsel for the National Immigration Law Center.

“U.S. policy makes clear that pregnant, postpartum, and lactating women should not be detained — yet ICE continues to ignore these protections. We continue to hear reports of pregnant women being held in dangerous conditions without adequate food or medical care, putting their health and lives at risk. These harms are occurring in a black box, where we know precious little about immigrant women’s access to healthcare and nutrition. We thank Senators Murray and Blumenthal for demanding that the Department of Homeland Security end this inhumane practice and call for vital transparency around their access to services. Together we must shine a light on detention conditions and ensure these women and their babies are treated with safety, dignity, and humanity,” said Zain Lakhani, Director of Migrant Right and Justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

In addition to Durbin, Murray, and Blumenthal, the following 26 senators also signed onto the letter to Secretary Noem: Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NM), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full text of the letter is available here.

In July, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Florida, providing new incriminating insight into the cruelty of the illegal Trump mass deportation agenda, including overcrowding, inhumane conditions, no access to medical care, and difficulty accessing legal counsel.

In May, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Louisiana and escalated congressional oversight of the Trump Administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration detention, which has created a major financial boon for private prison companies.

Earlier this year, Durbin released a revealing investigative report on inadequate care in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities and pressed for further investigation into deficient medical care in CBP detention facilities after whistleblower reports alleged systemic failures by DHS to ensure proper oversight of its medical care contractor.

Durbin continues to actively investigate care in ICE detention facilities, which he initiated with letters to ICE and GAO. A June 2024 report from the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight found that 95 percent of documented deaths in ICE custody between 2017-2021 were likely preventable.

This oversight work was prompted by the death of Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, an eight-year-old Panamanian girl, at a CBP detention facility in Harlingen, Texas, on May 17, 2023.

Alvarado ICE Detention Center Ambush

What's new:

On Monday, six women were arraigned on charges connected to the ambush-style shooting of an Alvardo police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center on July 4.

They include Savanna Batten, Joy Gibson, Maricela Rueda, Elizabeth Soto, Lynette Sharp, and Rebecca Morgan.

The backstory:

In all, at least 16 people have been charged in the case.

According to the federal complaint, several of the defendants were dressed in black, military-style clothing.

The complaint states that the protestors began shooting fireworks at the detention center. Two people broke off from the main group and began to spray graffiti on vehicles and a guard structure.

Officials believe it was all a ploy to draw ICE detention officers out of the building. Instead, the correctional officers called 911 to report the vandalism.

When the Alvarado police officer arrived, a defendant positioned in the woods shot the officer in the neck. Another assailant across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional officers.

Investigators found AR-style rifles at the scene, two-way radios, and a total of 12 sets of body armor after searching the scene and the defendants' cars.

The complaint said the shooters ran away, but law enforcement officers stopped them.

One attacker had cellphones inside a type of bag that blocks cellphone signals.

The complaint called the attack a conspiracy.

What they're saying:

The six defendants’ supporters strongly dispute the conspiracy claim.

They argue the women were there to attend what they thought would be a peaceful protest.

They did not want to make any official statements after Monday’s arraignment but questioned why the hearings were taking place 11 weeks after the arrests.

The court-appointed attorney for the women also did not want to make any statements yet on what happened.

The attorney said the time was not unusual, given that both state and federal agencies are involved.

What's next:

Additional defendants will be arraigned on Tuesday.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/5p-head-2-alvarado-ois_00.00.00.58.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-22 22:57:03.441368

There hasn’t been a time when Hernan felt truly alone because this community has shown up for him,” Popperson told the crowd.

His wife Leslie Perlera, an attorney, alleged that Escobar's rights were violated during the operation.

Among the protesters were Margo Lindauer, attorney and law professor; Ashley Popperson, associate minister of Old South Church; Malden City Councilors Carey McDonald and Stephen Windslow; Massachusetts State Rep. Steven Ultrino and Maggie Morgan, managing attorney at Legal Services of Greater Boston. They were joined by family members.

“Here’s what I know. I cannot imagine the terror that he felt. I know that there was not a moment that he was alone. Not really. Although the authorities did all they could to keep him separate from his community, they could not get in the way the love that this community has for one another. They do not have that kind of authority. There hasn’t been a time when Hernan felt truly alone because this community has shown up for him,” Popperson told the crowd.

Shortly after, dressed in black and looking exhausted, Escobar's wife addressed the crowd.

“I want to thank everyone who came here today. I'm trying to memorize everyone who's been here so I can tell him when I talk to him later… he's going to feel as loved, as supported, as wanted as I have felt,” his wife said, getting emotional as she then recounted what her life was like with her “husband and best friend.”

According to Perlera and the legal team at Greater Boston Legal Services, the arrest was violent.

""My husband was still sitting inside the car when I arrived. I had the gun in his face; he didn't want to get out, so they broke the window,” she said.

In response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a statement stating: “Officers took appropriate measures and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation in a manner that ensured the success of the operation and prioritized the safety of the public and our officers.”

An attorney involved in the case asserted that what happened represents a violation of constitutional rights and warned that ICE is detaining many people who, like Escobar, have no criminal record.

“The only thing I asked them was if they had identification. All I wanted to know was who they were and why they stopped him,” Leslie added.

After the arrest, Edgar was taken by ambulance to a hospital for his injuries and later taken to a detention center in Massachusetts.

“We've been married for almost a year,” Leslie commented, noting that they will celebrate their first anniversary in October. She also stated that Edgar is in the process of adjusting his immigration status to obtain residency.

DHS suggested the masks provide protection for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who have seen a sharp rise in attacks in recent months.

“At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signed unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” DHS said in a statement.

The https://trumpcard.gov/ website went live with new information, outlining three categories of programs:

The Gold Card: Requires a USD $1 million contribution for permanent residency. The website states that the Gold Card is based on the individual’s ability to substantially benefit the United States. Notably there are no tax provisions; applicants would remain subject to worldwide income taxation.

The Platinum Card: Requires a USD $5 million contribution and allows the holder to reside in the United States for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on non-U.S. income. This would replace other temporary visas.

The Trump Corporate Gold Card: Allows a U.S. business to make a USD $2 million contribution to transfer an employee to the United States. This benefit may be transferable to another employee for a fee.

The website states that processing fees and background vetting will occur for all three card types, although no information about the fees or the process has been posted as of the date of this blog. The site also indicates that contributions will be made to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but no information is available about how those funds will be used by the U.S. government. Importantly, this contribution differs from the EB-5 program, where investors may eventually recover their investment funds depending on the success of the business. It also unclear whether the “vetting” will involve a background check, proof of the source of funds ( as required in the EB-5 program), or both. Moreover, there is no mention of dependent applicants or whether family members of the main applicable will receive benefits under the program.

Of particular interest is a statement on the website that a Gold Card will be either an EB-1 or EB-2 preference green card. These categories, and their underlying subcategories of permanent residence, are statutorily authorized by Congress and have specific visa number allocations. It is possible this designation could be challenged in court as outside the authority of the Executive Branch. Additionally, applicants born in Mainland China and India may face significant visa backlogs, as these delays already exist in the EB-1 and EB-2 preference categories.

At this time, it is unknown when the fees or application instructions will be released to the public.

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.","Detainees inside California’s largest immigration detention center are being placed in solitary confinement, experiencing delays in medical care, and facing retaliation from officers for protesting “inhumane” conditions, two detainees told The Fresno Bee.

The detainees are among the 500 or so who’ve been transferred to the newly opened California City Immigration Processing Center, a 2,560-bed U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement detention facility about 70 miles east of Bakersfield.

“The living conditions are inhumane. We have all kinds of health hazards. It’s dirty, they don’t clean up or have any chemicals to clean. It’s unsanitary,” Sokhean Keo, a detainee who was transferred to the facility this month, told a Bee reporter in a phone interview.

Conditions at the 70-acre facility in the Kern County desert have been scrutinized by immigrant rights advocates since Tennessee-based private prison operator CoreCivic began housing undocumented immigrants there in late August.

Kern County-based immigrant rights advocates raised alarm regarding a detainee who was hospitalized this month after he attempted to take his own life. Detainees accuse facility staff of withholding medication.

Last Thursday, more than 100 detained individuals staged sit-ins and refused meals across several housing pods at the sprawling facility in protest over what they describe as widespread poor living conditions, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a Bay Area-based legal aid nonprofit for undocumented immigrants.

One detainee told The Bee that immigrants have been placed on 17-hour lockdowns and pepper-sprayed for participating in the sit-ins.

Attorneys for the nonprofit spoke with California City detainees who alleged officers in riot gear threatened use of force against detainees who participated in a sit-in and placed at least one housing unit on a multi-day lockdown without access to telephones. Immigrants at the facility told the nonprofit that four detainees were handcuffed and placed in solitary confinement, and one person was denied toilet paper by a CoreCivic officer for participating in a hunger strike.

In an email to The Bee, CoreCivic denied the accusations of unsanitary conditions and mistreatment of detainees. The operator said all detainees receive clothing, bedding and toiletries at no cost and have access to medical care and legal resources.

“No detainee has faced prolonged lockdowns of 17 hours or more or have been pepper sprayed for acts of disobedience,” said Brian Todd, a CoreCivic spokesperson.

“CoreCivic takes seriously our obligation to adhere to all applicable federal standards in all our federally contracted facilities, including our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF). All our facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability, including being monitored by federal officials on a daily basis, to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for every individual.”

Detainee says he was threatened with solitary confinement

One of the detainees who spoke with The Bee said he was threatened with solitary confinement the day he was transferred to the California City detention center.

Sokhean Keo was transferred from the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield to the California City facility in early September and has been in ICE detention since January 2023. Keo, an immigrant from Cambodia, said he served time in prison for a “mistake” he made when he was 20 years old and had earned his release in 2023 before ICE agents detained him.

On his first day inside the California City facility, Keo said correctional officers forced him and others to take off their shirts and took pictures of their tattoos. Officers threatened to take Keo to “the hole,” or solitary confinement, unless he admitted to being affiliated with gangs, which he said he is not. Personnel withheld his medication for several days, he said.

“I don’t understand why we’re being threatened for not answering them,” Keo said. “I feel like giving up. There’s no hope for me anymore. Every day I wake up, I’m just sad. It’s horrible.”

The use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has grown exponentially under the second Trump administration, according to a report published Wednesday by the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights.

The sit-ins and meal refusals at California City mirror a broader wave of protests across immigration facilities in California, where an estimated 3,727 undocumented people are under ICE detention, according to a recent analysis of ICE data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. This data does not reflect the current detainee population at California City.

From Adelanto to Mesa Verde and the Golden State Annex, the hunger strikes have been part of a pattern of detainee protests over accusations of inadequate food, facilities and medical care in recent years.

A detainee who identified herself as Loba was detained in January 2024 and held at the Golden State Annex, an ICE facility in McFarland, before her transfer to California City in late August.

Loba said detainees in her dorm have been placed on lockdowns for more than 17 hours, in which they weren’t allowed to leave their sleeping quarters, pepper sprayed and prohibited from participating in Thursday’s sit-ins.

Loba also described severe issues inside the facility, including leaking pipes that flooded cells, food that was water-soaked, and poor food handling and sanitation practices, such as staff not using gloves or hair nets and failing to accommodate people with food allergies.

“It’s already been more than 20 days since I arrived here, and I still haven’t received my psychiatric medication,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing. We’re being locked in for more than a third of the day.”

Todd, the CoreCivic spokesperson, said the facility was impacted by the heavy rains and flash flooding Thursday after remnants of a tropical storm descended on southern California. CoreCivic informed ICE of the situation, and maintenance staff worked to mitigate rising water levels outside the facility and removed any water that seeped into the facility, Todd said.

“No detainees were required to be moved from their assigned living areas during our response,” he said.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment. CoreCivic did not immediately address the allegations of solitary confinement.

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident

Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.

Jeannie Parent, a coordinator with Kern Welcoming and Extending Solidarity to Immigrants, said one of her volunteers spoke with a detainee who said someone tried to take their own life.

The details weren’t immediately clear. CoreCivic confirmed to The Bee that there was an incident of self-harm.

In a Sept. 11 statement, Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said that on the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 9, a staff member called a medical emergency “after finding an individual inside of his living area who was observed trying to harm himself.”

The responding staff called for emergency medical services to respond to the facility, who transported the individual to a local hospital for assessment and possible treatment.

“Our government partners at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were notified immediately of this incident,” Gustin said.

California City mayor says conditions are humane

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins toured the ICE detention facility on Sept. 9 in what he described as an “oversight assessment.”

Detainees had access to dental, medical, psychiatric care, he said. He also said detainees wear either blue or brown uniforms, depending on whether they have a prior criminal conviction.

He said the conditions there appeared to be humane.

Hawkins acknowledged that the facility opened without the proper city permits and that the legal team is looking into levying daily fines.

“We are exploring all options related to CoreCivic not being in compliance with municipal code,” Hawkins said. “As a city, we have to respond to that.”

He also said he spoke with a representative from California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office last week regarding the ICE detention facility “and other matters.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.","Free press advocates and lawyers for metro Atlanta journalist Mario Guevara are fighting to keep him in the United States after the Board of Immigration Appeals last week ordered he be deported to his native El Salvador.

Why it matters: Monday marked roughly 100 days since Guevara, a prominent Spanish-speaking journalist who founded digital media outlet MG News, was arrested while reporting at a protest in DeKalb County.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Georgia said it filed a temporary restraining order to halt the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling Friday that Guevara must be returned to El Salvador.

The ACLU told Axios in a statement that it's concerned Guevara ""could be removed at any time because he remains in detention.""

What they're saying: Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of Digital Justice and Civil Rights at Free Press, an advocacy organization, said a coalition of over 25 human rights and press freedom groups is calling for Guevara's release.

Guevara is believed to be the only journalist who has been detained by ICE in the U.S. in connection with his work.

Benavidez said the government has tried to portray Guevara's activities ""as somehow dangerous, criminal or illegal.""

""It's really a case about this journalist who was … targeted because of his filming of police and ICE,"" Benavidez said. ""And so it feels like it's part of a much broader censorship regime that we're seeing.""

State of play: Guevara wrote in a letter published Monday on MG News' website that his arrest and ongoing detention have crushed his dignity ""because I've been humiliated by both federal and local authorities, and I don't believe I deserve it.""

""Life isn't always fair,"" Guevara wrote. ""If I'm deported, I'll leave with my head held high, because I'm convinced it's for carrying out my journalistic work, not for committing crimes.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.

,Policy,2025-09-22 20:56:45+00:00,the Guardian,Democrats urge Trump border czar investigation over bribery allegation - The Guardian,"David Smith, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/democrats-tom-homan-report,"Democrats have urged treasury watchdogs to investigate reports that Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent in return for political favours.
In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets.
At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment.
“Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.
She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.","Democrats have urged treasury watchdogs to investigate reports that Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent in return for political favours.

In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets. The justice department subsequently shut down a bribery investigation.

On Monday, Congressman Dave Min of California, a member of the House of Representatives oversight committee, wrote to treasury inspector general Russell George and treasury inspector general for tax administration Russell Martin to call for scrutiny of whether Homan reported the payment and whether it was connected to his private consulting firm.

“History suggests that we should follow the money – especially if it went unreported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” wrote Min, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s Fighting Corruption Taskforce. “Under federal law, all income, legal or illegal, must be reported to the IRS, including payments stemming from bribery.

“Knowingly failing to report this income would likely violate federal tax law. Accordingly, I request that your offices investigate whether Mr Homan properly reported this payment on his 2024 federal tax return.”

Homan oversees the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. An unapologetic immigration hardliner, he explained a decision to defy a court order that barred the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members by stating: “I don’t care what the judges think.”

Homan was previously an official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) under Barack Obama and its acting director in Trump’s first term. During Trump’s four years out of power, he ran a consulting business to help companies obtain immigration-related government contracts.

In the recorded sting operation, Homan accepted a $50,000 bribe contained in a bag from the restaurant chain Cava, claiming he would keep the money in a trust until he had completed his service in the Trump administration, a source told the Reuters news agency.

Homan was then investigated for bribery and other crimes but this was shut down after Trump took office, reportedly because he did not hold a government position at the time and because of the difficulty of proving that he had agreed to carry out any specific acts in exchange for the money.

At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment. “Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.

“The White House and the president stand by Tom Homan 100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong,” Leavitt added. She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.

But Carol Leonnig, one of the MSNBC journalists who broke the story, responded on social media: “White House spokesperson says that Homan never took $50,000; we reviewed internal document saying Homan accepted the cash payment from undercover FBI agents in September 2024.”

Political pressure on Homan is mounting. On Sunday Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, posted on the X platform: “The act was caught on camera. The administration must turn over the tapes to Congress. Every decision made by Homan must be scrutinized for possible corruption.”

Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut added on Monday: “$50,000 cash in a bag – clearly Border Czar Tom Homan isn’t afraid to solicit personal payments in exchange for government favors. Trump leaders aren’t serving the country – they’re failing it, putting personal profit first. Another example of rampant corruption in this admin.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9aaf9b2451a8ec78befb78e892d5c295e4df3f/730_0_5706_4565/master/5706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=066d2b8113391f95556a467bf4537b55",N,,2025-09-22 17:56:51.851117

The court’s 6-3 decision is the court’s strongest signal yet that it may overturn Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., a 90-year-old ruling that until recently largely protected independent agencies from undue political interference stemming from the White House.

In addition to granting Trump’s request to a stay lower court ruling reinstating FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, the court also said it will hear oral arguments in December on officially overturning Humphrey’s.

The majority did not offer a legal explanation in exempting Trump from standing court precedent.

Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, heavily rebuked the court for granting the stay while Humphrey’s remained precedent.

“The President cannot, as he concededly did here, fire an FTC Commissioner without any reason,” Kagan wrote. “To reach a different result requires reversing the rule stated in Humphrey’s: It entails overriding rather than accepting Congress’s judgment about agency design.”

“The majority may be raring to take that action, as its grant of certiorari before judgment suggests. But until the deed is done, Humphrey controls, and prevents the majority from giving the President the unlimited removal power Congress denied him.”

In her dissent, Kagan also echoed complaints and frustrations that several federal judges have raised about the majority’s use of the court’s emergency — or “shadow” — docket.

Dozens of times now, the court has granted the president broad exemptions from normal legal and legislative procedures and given him extraordinary control over the executive branch — often without detailing their reasoning.

These consequential emergency rulings have often left lower court judges in a bind, not knowing whether they should follow formal court precedent or the majority’s shadow docket orders — which are not binding legal precedent.

“Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” Kagan wrote. “Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”

For 45 years, the U.S. Catholic Church has celebrated National Migration Week, which has traditionally been linked to the Vatican’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees (WDMR), as an opportunity for the Church to reflect on the circumstances confronting migrants and to engage in prayer and action for those who are forced to flee their homes. In solidarity with the Vatican, National Migration Week will use the theme chosen by Pope Leo XIV of “Migrants, missionaries of hope.”

WDMR typically occurs on the last Sunday of September, however, this year it will take place on Oct. 4-5 to coincide with the Jubilee of Migrants that will include meetings and festivities in the presence of the Holy Father. On Oct. 5 at 10:30 a.m. (Rome time), Pope Leo XIV will celebrate Mass for the Jubilee of the Missionary World and the Jubilee of Migrants at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.

“As Pope Leo’s theme of ‘Migrants, missionaries of hope’ reminds us, our migrant brothers and sisters are not strangers; they are family in Christ,” said Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, archbishop of Chicago. “They enrich our Church and serve as a reminder that the gospel knows no borders and that God’s love is for all people.”

National Migration Week culminates locally on Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025, with a 5:15 p.m. Mass at Holy Name Cathedral, 735 N. State St., Chicago. Bishop Lawrence J. Sullivan, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago, will preside over the Mass that will begin with a procession of nations representing 15 countries and feature readings and prayers in nine languages including English, Spanish, Polish, Italian, Swahili, Filipino, Bahasa (a language spoken in Indonesia), Luganda (a language spoken in central Uganda) and Vietnamese. A parishioner of St. Anne Parish in Barrington will offer a testimony of the collaborative immigrant ministry with Holy Family Parish in Inverness.

The Archdiocese of Chicago’s National Pastoral Migratoria (Immigrant Social Ministry) has coordinated a comprehensive effort with other U.S. dioceses which have Pastoral Migratoria to raise awareness about National Migration Week. In the dioceses of New York, Newark , Baltimore, Orange, Calif., Stockton, Calif. and Joliet, Ill., Pastoral Migratoria leaders are coordinating rosaries, legal clinics, health fairs, holy hours, forums, and other events to support the immigrant community. The dioceses of Los Angeles, Newark and Washington, D.C., will hold Masses in observance of National Migration Week.

In his message for the 111th World Day of Migrants and Refugees 2025, Pope Leo XIV said the observance offers us an opportunity to reflect on the connections between hope, migration and mission. The Holy Father said in part, “In a world darkened by war and injustice, even when all seems lost, migrants and refugees stand as messengers of hope. Their courage and tenacity bear heroic testimony to a faith that sees beyond what our eyes can see and gives them the strength to defy death on the various contemporary migration routes.”

He added, “Faced with frightening scenarios and the possibility of global devastation, it is important that there be a growing desire in people’s hearts for a future of peace and of respect for the dignity of all.”

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops encourages Catholic communities to come together as a universal Church to welcome immigrants and refugees in local parishes, dioceses and broader communities to reflect on the circumstances confronting migrants and to pray for and act on the circumstances confronting migrants, including immigrants, refugees, children, and victims and survivors of human trafficking, and to stand in solidarity with them.",https://www.archchicago.org,N,,2025-09-22 16:57:56.211233

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehemently condemns California Governor Gavin Newsom for signing the “No Secret Police Act,” which further demonizes law enforcement and attempts to ban law enforcement from being able to protect their identities to keep them from being targeted by cartels, criminal rings, terrorists, and doxxed online.

This stunt comes as our ICE officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicles being used as weapons towards them, and doxing campaigns targeting federal officers and their families. When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists. Our officers also wear vests marked with ICE/ERO or Homeland Security and are flanked by vehicles marked with the name of the department.

“Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom’s unconstitutional ban.”

Despite these obstacles from Governor Newsom, ICE continues to put the safety of Californians first and remove violent criminal illegal aliens from the streets of California. Below are examples of some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested in California since January 20, 2025, who Governor Newsom’s sanctuary policies protect at the expense of the American people:

Later, 700 active-duty Marines were sent to the region. A small number of troops remain stationed in the city.

Trump has defended the deployment, saying he “saved” Los Angeles after the Supreme Court cleared the way for federal agents to continue conducting sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles by lifting a restraining order from a judge who found “roving patrols” were leading to indiscriminate arrests.

A US State Department “concept note” for the event outlines an approach that seems determined to run roughshod over the rights of refugees.

This is happening parallel to an executive order that requires a national-interests review of all conventions and treaties the United States has joined.

Alarmingly, the US State Department’s list of the “core principles” in its concept note fails to include the principle of nonrefoulement, which holds that refugees cannot be returned to places where they would likely be persecuted, the foundation of the global refugee system.

The note asserts that “every nation has the absolute right to control its borders.” While international law is highly deferential to states in controlling their borders, the principle of nonrefoulement maintains that states don’t have unfettered discretion to push people away.

Everyone’s right “to seek and enjoy asylum in other countries from persecution” is the flip side of nonrefoulement. If countries are prohibited from sending someone to a place where they would be tortured or persecuted, they need to afford them a way to secure protection.

The US concept note contends that “asylum is a temporary, not permanent, status, and that asylees should ultimately return home.” But in reality, that depends on the home country situation. If the threats and harm that caused someone to flee their country are unchanged, or get worse, sending them back is not an option.

The note also asserts that “sovereign states, not transnational bodies, make the determination whether conditions in a country of origin permit return.” True, but in making refugee determinations in good faith, states should respect assessments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, whose determinations are guided by its mandate, whereas states often have conflicting interests.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/09/202509afr_libya_coast_guard_interception.jpg?h=53227e21&itok=sw49CGoq,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:10.659203

Founded in 2023, Wasatch Immigration Project said it quickly saw demand for legal assistance exceed the service capacity of its four part-time volunteer attorneys. The project opened its Park City office in June 2024 and, in its first full year of operation, represented 266 clients and filed over 350 applications or other legal forms. The firm ended 2024 with over 150 people on its wait list and said it saw a surge in need in early 2025 due to changes to immigration policy and enforcement.

“It is a scary time for many members of our community who are trying to navigate the immigration system,” said Maggie AbuHaidar, executive director and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. “In order to reach more people, more quickly, we have been working hard to raise the funds needed to grow our legal team.”

With individual donations and grants from the Utah Bar Foundation and Park City Community Foundation, the firm hired its first full-time attorney, Laura Rojas, in March. Although Laura has helped the team put procedures in place to reduce its waitlist, many individuals and families who live and work in the Wasatch Back are still waiting to be seen — and many more call every day asking for help, the firm said.

“With generous support from community members, a special service contract from Park City, and recent grants from the Women’s Giving Fund, the Marriott Daughters Foundation, and the Promontory Foundation, we have now expanded our legal team again with the hire of two new full-time attorneys, Jessica Hamilton and Kaite Hogan,” said AbuHaidar.

Hamilton and Hogan both graduated from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah in May and sat for the Utah Bar exam in July. They both learned that they passed the Bar just last week.

After graduating from the University of Kansas, Hamilton spent two years in Washington, D.C. working for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal services to undocumented minors in detention. For two years during law school, she directed the Pro Bono Initiative Immigration Clinic, a monthly legal clinic staffed by Utah attorneys to provide pro bono legal advice to immigrants. Hamilton was recently profiled by the law school for her work in expanding access to justice.

“As someone deeply committed to immigrant justice,” Hamilton said, “I’m honored to join the (Wasatch Immigration Project) team and stand with families in the Wasatch Back as they navigate the complex immigration system. I look forward to helping (Wasatch Immigration Project) expand its capacity so that even more families can access the legal support and representation they deserve.”

Hailing from Washington state, Hogan graduated from Utah State University before attending law school. She focused her law school studies on immigration law, completing multiple intern placements with renowned local immigration law firms and nonprofits, including Gardner & Taylor, Stowell Crayk, Catholic Community Services, and No Mas. Just prior to graduation, the law school’s alumni honored Hogan with its Outstanding 3L Colleague Award.

When asked why she chose to focus on immigration law, Hogan said, “It is to the detriment of our society to ignore the plight of a minority for the easy routine of the majority.”

Working for Wasatch Immigration Project was the “right fit” for her, she said, because “the organization has chosen to support all members of our community and make the continual effort to uphold basic human rights.”

“Kaite and Jessica are joining WIP with a demonstrated passion for the work we do and the clients we serve, as well as a level of practical experience unusual for recent law school grads,” AbuHaidar explained, adding, “So, they will be able to hit the ground running, which is good, because running is all we have been doing since January.”

In addition to hiring two new Staff Attorneys, WIP hired its first full-time paralegal, Yoselyn Monsalve, in May and added a part-time paralegal, Santiago Carvajal, in August. Both law school graduates in their countries of origin, Monsalve and Carvajal are unable to practice law in the United States, but are “contributing a wealth of knowledge, experience,

perspective, energy, and compassion to WIP’s legal team,” said AbuHaidar.

With these new hires over the last six months, WIP has transitioned from a nearly all volunteer-driven organization to an established non-profit law firm. “Once we understood the need in the community, the transition was necessary to make the organization as sustainable as possible,” said John Sharkey, WIP Board Chair and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. AbuHaidar added, “Frankly, it is hard to imagine how we were functioning before expanding our team. And we could not have done any of this without the overwhelming support of the Park City community.”

“They say this is undermining the work of local law enforcement who, in many cases, have had to work really hard to build trust in their communities,” she said.
In March, the Trump administration cut staff to DHS’s Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Affairs — which investigated civil rights complaints filed by the public related to DHS and ICE enforcement.","Some of the images look like World War II recruiting posters. Uncle Sam asking you to defend the homeland.

Others reference a glorified version of the past. White settlers traveling across the planes toward their Manifest Destiny as Native Americans retreat to the shadows.

These are the words and images the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using to recruit more than 10,000 Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents by the end of the year, which would make it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government. DHS is also offering signing bonuses of $50,000, student loan repayment and starting salaries as high as $80,000.

These posts have millions of views on social media platforms like X. Experts who study extremist groups are flagging them as dangerous.

Pete Simi is a sociologist at Chapman University who has been studying extremist groups and violence for more than 25 years.

“Propaganda is an art,” he said. “It’s a very powerful way of communicating and it typically obscures the truth. When it’s done effectively, it makes it hard to call it out.”

Ambiguity plays a major role in white supremacist messaging because it allows whoever posts hateful rhetoric to hide behind plausible deniability, Simi said.

Coded language

Simi went on to say that someone who isn’t versed in far-right extremist culture will see an image of Uncle Sam and won’t think twice about it. But the posts DHS is using to recruit ICE agents can be interpreted through a white nationalist lens.

For example, the caption on the post showing settlers expanding westward, the words heritage and homeland are capitalized.

“In white supremacist circles, H.H. stands for Heil Hitler,” Simi said.

Also, the caption contains exactly 14 words, which is a symbolically significant number for people who follow that ideology.

White nationalists use messaging with 14 words as a hidden reference to a famous phrase from the 1980s: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”

“It became one of the most central slogans among white supremacists,” Simi said. “They reference it in everything from tattoos, to t-shirts, to emails. It’s just ubiquitous among these folks.”

ICE did not respond to questions from KPBS about the agency’s recruitment efforts and concerns raised by experts like Simi.

Because ambiguity is such a big part of extremist communications, the messages can be interpreted in a variety of ways, Simi said. Whoever posted the image can simply say people are overreacting — it’s just an old painting with a caption that happens to have 14 words.

Which means academics or members of the media cannot say for sure whether something is explicitly supporting extremist ideology.

“Unless you’re able to find the person who created that post and they were to admit that this was intentional, it’s hard to ever definitively say,” Simi said.

Cautionary tale

Historically, the federal government has struggled with rapid expansions to law enforcement agencies.

In the mid-2000s, when Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) workforce grew by 20,000, anti-corruption measures took a back seat to the hiring spree, according to a 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

At the time, agency policy required every employee to undergo an internal affairs review every five years to ensure they were still fit for service.

But CBP employees responsible for those reviews said they conducted ""few periodic reinvestigations during fiscal years 2006 to 2010 because resources were focused on meeting mandated hiring goals,” according to the report.

By 2010, the agency had a backlog of 15,000 investigations, according to the report.

During the hiring binge , criminal organizations like drug cartels tried to infiltrate the agency. The 2012 report also notes that corruption convictions among CBP agents increased during that time.

ICE did not respond to questions asking what measure they have in place to ensure standards do not drop during the current expansion.

A change in standards

ICE’s current expansion comes at a unique time for the agency, according to experts like Allie Preston, who studies law enforcement as a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

“It has turned into a militarized, authoritarian form of policing and I really think it will damage this institution’s ability to continue,” Preston said.

While polling shows there is broad support for arresting and deporting immigrants convicted of violent crime, there is significantly less support for masked agents stopping anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally — even if they have no criminal record.

As part of her research, Preston regularly interviews retired local and federal police officers. Lately, they’ve told her that ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics are eroding trust between communities and law enforcement.

“They say this is undermining the work of local law enforcement who, in many cases, have had to work really hard to build trust in their communities,” she said.

In addition to the deteriorating trust, Preston is also concerned about the fact that ICE has already lowered hiring, training and oversight standards.

The agency waived age restrictions that previously required applicants to be older than 21 and younger than 37 or 40 depending on the role. DHS officials also cut down ICE’s 18-week training course to eight weeks, and waived Spanish-language requirements, vehicle pursuit courses and other training.

In March, the Trump administration cut staff to DHS’s Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Affairs — which investigated civil rights complaints filed by the public related to DHS and ICE enforcement.

“In light of everything that’s happened, it’s really like a perfect storm of different circumstances that are making policing more dangerous for communities and really undermining the roles that they are supposed to be playing,” Preston said.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/6c44b3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+725/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fb3%2Fdca601b94a6fa0fe12809c9a6932%2Funclesam.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:28.159556

UN Member States, the UN itself, civil society around the world and in the United States, and U.S. leaders who understand the essential role of human rights and the rule of law have a critical role to play in standing up for multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties that protect the human rights of people everywhere.

In the wake of an executive order issued in February, the Trump administration has conducted a “review” to determine “which organizations, conventions, and treaties are contrary to the interests of the United States and whether such organizations, conventions, or treaties can be reformed.” That order also stated that the U.S. would not participate in the UN Human Rights Council, would not fund UNRWA, and would review membership in UNESCO, from which it subsequently withdrew. Among the many treaties that the U.S. has ratified or signed are core multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties. While the order called for review within 180 days, the results of the review—if indeed it is finalized—have not been publicly reported.

In August 2025, the United States decided to refuse to participate in its own Universal Periodic Review (UPR) before the UN Human Rights Council, an unprecedented and damaging step to human rights accountability. On September 12, 2025, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is trying to enlist UN Member states in an effort to undo legal norms and agreements that protect refugees from persecution, and plans an event during the UN General Assembly to advance its efforts. The report also indicated that there had been no signs of broad support for the plan. Trump administration nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration testified on September 11 that he would seek to work with other countries to build support for “reform” of international agreements and norms on migration.

True reform does not tear down multilateral international treaties and endanger human lives. Indeed, the Trump administration’s plan for refugees fleeing persecution appears designed to abandon refugees to persecution. Whatever label is slapped on the initiative, the reality is that the Trump administration approach is to cut aid and resettlement that helps other countries host refugees, block people seeking refuge from U.S. asylum, end temporary protections despite ongoing dangers, and subject people seeking U.S. asylum to enforced disappearances, refoulement to torture and persecution, family separations, due process denials, and arbitrary detention in horrible conditions. While banning refugees from resettlement, the administration is ramping up efforts to resettle white Afrikaners. This right-violating approach should not be exported to other countries.

Policies and systems can be strengthened through genuine reforms that adhere to the law and protect lives. By contrast, steps towards undermining or withdrawing from refugee, human rights, and/or humanitarian treaties would threaten the human rights and safety of people around the world and undermine international law, stability, peace, and prosperity.

These pieces of legislation rely on white supremacist tropes that portray immigrant men and men of color as predatory and violent toward white American women.
Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women.","In July, President Trump and Congressional Republicans rammed through a sweeping budget bill that invests over $100 billion in ICE and border enforcement. In recent months, ICE agents — often masked, wearing plain clothes, and without anything to outwardly identify them as agents — have escalated their campaign of terror on immigrant communities at the direction of this administration, worsened after Trump rescinded policies that once restricted immigration enforcement in locations like domestic violence shelters, hospitals, and churches. Predictably, all of this has resulted in chaos and devastating state-inflicted violence — and a chilling rise in civilian violence against women.

A letter from the Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC) addressed to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials, which was shared with HuffPost, alleges that civilian men are impersonating ICE agents to kidnap and sexually assault immigrant women. It wouldn’t be difficult to do as ICE agents increasingly wear plain clothes, conceal their faces to avoid accountability, and are not required to wear paraphernalia to identify themselves as officers. ICE has also directed its agents to detain undocumented people they encounter incidentally, even if the agents don’t have an arrest warrant.

The allegations are horrifying: A North Carolina man has been accused of posing as an ICE agent, threatening to deport an immigrant woman, then kidnapping and raping her; police in New York are searching for a man suspected of posing as an ICE agent, assaulting and trying to rape a woman, before robbing her and fleeing the scene in broad daylight.

“All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles,” the DWC wrote in an August letter to the administration. “We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed. Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks, plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles — tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public.”

Lawmakers in the California legislature and in Congress have introduced legislation to address horrific scenarios like these, by requiring ICE agents to have proper identification and prohibit them from covering their faces. This could be a step in the right direction.

But we can’t bury the deeper, driving forces behind why this is happening. This phenomenon is only possible because of the outsized power that state agents — ICE, police officers, prison staff — have always had to abuse and control women and victims' bodies. Civilians are impersonating state agents to assault vulnerable women and victims because state agents — under every presidential administration — have always been able to do this.

The reason civilians would even think to pose as state agents to get away with sexual violence is that, nationwide, state power in a range of forms is routinely wielded to perpetrate gender-based violence. Unmasking ICE agents is important, but it’s a Band-Aid on a broader, systemic crisis.

Sexual abuse, often inflicted on children, is rampant across the immigrant detainment system. In one survey, 40% of police officers self-reported acting violently toward their spouses or children, and 60% of prison rapes are committed by guards and staff.

Sexual assault is the second-most common form of police misconduct, according to one study. From 2013 to 2014, an Oklahoma City police officer, Daniel Holtzclaw, was accused by 13 Black women of exploiting his state power to sexually abuse them. (Holtzclaw was ultimately convicted of assaulting eight of those women, and sentenced to 263 years in prison.) Over the last decade, cops in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, and other states have similarly been ousted after being accused by local women of stalking or harassment.

It wasn’t until 2022 that Congress passed the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act, ending a practice that previously allowed cops to defend themselves from allegations of sexually abusing people in their custody by claiming the encounter was consensual — which, some legal experts have argued, is impossible due to the massive power disparity between a state agent and a detainee. BuzzFeed reported in 2018 that 35 states have no laws to prohibit supposedly “consensual” sex between police officers and a person in custody.

All too often the government and legal system enact violence on victims while protecting assailants, which amounts to state violence: In one survey, about a quarter of victims who called 911 due to a domestic violence incident reported being arrested or threatened with arrest themselves. It is estimated that just 3% of rapists will ever spend a day in prison, while a 1999 survey of a women's maximum security prison in New York found that 90% of incarcerated women were survivors.

Outside of directly carceral contexts, just look at abortion bans, which grant lawmakers sweeping access to and power over our bodies. In 2020, a whistleblower alleged that a doctor at an immigrant detainment center had nonconsensually sterilized women; ultimately over 40 women claimed that they’d been subjected to invasive medical procedures while in ICE custody.

To be clear, men wouldn’t be posing as ICE agents and assaulting women if ICE didn’t exist. Its very existence — and the vile policing of immigrants in this nation altogether — dehumanizes immigrants and renders them exponentially more vulnerable to a range of violent acts, including gender-based violence.

Laws like the Laken Riley Act — which subject any undocumented immigrant who is merely accused of one of several crimes such as shoplifting to potential, indefinite detainment — are devastating for immigrant domestic violence victims, whose abusers or traffickers can potentially threaten to report them for made-up crimes if they don’t comply, experts have warned.

The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, introduced in January, would similarly render immigrant abuse victims exponentially more vulnerable to detainment, should their abusers wield the common abusive tactic DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim-Offender) to accuse them of abuse.

These pieces of legislation rely on white supremacist tropes that portray immigrant men and men of color as predatory and violent toward white American women. There is no crime statistic that could ever justify this nation’s shameful treatment of immigrants — and, that said, US citizens are substantially more likely to be the perpetrators of violent crime than noncitizens.

Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women. And the Trump administration is shipping immigrant men to horrific, foreign prisons that effectively operate as torture sites — in some cases to face brutal sexual violence — and wielding any imperfection in an immigrant's record to justify it, much like how our patriarchal society treats rape victims who are “imperfect” victims.

Among the most upsetting aspects of this rising crisis of violence against immigrants and women is how predictable it was. Of course men believe that if they pose as the state they can perpetrate the same violence the state often does to terrorize and violate women and victims, especially victims in more precarious positions. But unmasking ICE isn’t enough. The agency must be abolished, and the root causes of state and carceral violence must be addressed.","https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68d16d1fae58da46c3dc9463/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/2233847009",N,,2025-09-22 15:57:00.682068

NEW YORK – Last week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York rejected a discovery request by an individual sanctioned for violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank that would have undermined established protections for civil society groups and threatened their ability to continue their advocacy work without fear of irreparable harm. The court adopted arguments advanced by the organization targeted by the request, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), and an amicus brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), and Human Rights First.

“The court’s decision affirms DAWN’s right to engage in research, reporting, and advocacy without coercive interference by people who disagree with its speech. NGOs should never be forced to comply with this kind of abusive request, and this decision will allow human rights organizations’ work to continue providing accountability for human rights abuses,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

The court found that DAWN did not have to comply with a discovery request filed by Isaac Levi Pilant, dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who was previously sanctioned under the West Bank sanctions program. DAWN had publicly recommended that the U.S. government impose sanctions on him and others for documented violence against Palestinians. After President Trump effectively terminated the program, Pilant filed an application against DAWN and its executive director, Sarah Leah Whitson, pursuant to a U.S. law that provides a mechanism for foreign litigants to obtain discovery from people and entities in the United States. He sought a court order for an extremely wide set of information related to DAWN’s investigation of Pilant and its sanctions advocacy efforts for use in a possible future defamation case in Israel against Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization.

“This ruling confirms that foreign litigants cannot exploit our courts to silence NGOs that report on human rights abuses and advocate for accountability,” said Bobby Hodgson, assistant legal director at the NYCLU. “The Constitution protects organizations like DAWN from being forced to reveal confidential aspects of their work. The discovery process cannot sidestep the First Amendment — and we’re glad the court agrees.”

The court’s decision reflected the arguments put forth in the supporting amicus brief. The court found that various protections, including the reporter’s privilege and statutory provisions, barred it from granting the discovery requested. It further found that Pilant had failed to demonstrate how the requested information was relevant to contemplated litigation against a different organization in Israeli court.

As explained in the ACLU and HRF amicus brief, the U.S. government has established frameworks and processes to encourage nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to share sensitive information that can assist it in more effectively implementing various human rights and corruption sanctions and visa restriction programs. Undermining the protections for NGOs to securely and confidentially share this information would not only impact the ability of the U.S. government to use such tools to hold human rights abusers and corrupt actors accountable, but it would also put NGOs, victims of abuse, and others in civil society in jeopardy by opening them up to retaliation and harassment from people they accuse of human rights violations.

The brief further argued that Pilant’s broad discovery request implicates information protected under the First Amendment and the reporter’s privilege, which provide grounds to reject his request under the relevant discovery statute.

The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.
That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.
Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.
“U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.” Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.","This story was originally reported by The 19th.

Immigrant women were facing high rates of domestic violence, and yet the fear of deportation and lack of trust in police was so pervasive it kept many of them from reporting the crimes to law enforcement. That made it “virtually impossible” to hold many perpetrators accountable, Congress found.

In response, lawmakers from both parties created two new visas: U visas for victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes, and T visas for victims of human trafficking. About 3 in 5 U and T visa applicants are immigrant women.

Twenty-five years later, the programs are bogged down by lengthy wait times, which have grown to over a decade. Now, with President Donald Trump back in office, they’re also facing an existential threat.

At the center are thousands of immigrants who have been trafficked or have been the victim of a violent crime, who reported that crime to law enforcement, and who bear the physical or mental scars of that crime — all requirements to obtain one of these visas. Their lives remain stuck in limbo as they await a decision, now more vulnerable to detention and deportation due to Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s second term and whose architects hold high-ranking roles in his administration, calls for the total elimination of the two visas, concluding that “victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit.”

Until then, the blueprint calls on the president and federal agencies to use their power to “significantly restrict” access to the programs. Data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lawyers working with crime victims and gender-based violence advocates say that work toward that goal is already underway. Similar efforts were undertaken in Trump’s first term, when, for example, a new policy was quietly rolled out that rejected any application with a blank space — even if it was something simple, like a middle name section left blank because the applicant didn’t have one. The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.

Since Trump’s second inauguration, the administration’s close cooperation with local police to help with immigration enforcement, layoffs at the agency that handles visa applications and the stripping away of policies that protected applicants from deportation have all had a chilling effect on new applications and could be exacerbating processing delays for new applications.

“I’m concerned that what we’re seeing is the early days of a multifaceted effort to chip away at these programs — make them less accessible, less desirable, less functional,” said Kursten Phelps, a lawyer with the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that offers legal and social services to immigrant women and girls.

Data from January through March published by the agency that handles these visas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), shows a sharp drop off in U visa applications, which are granted to immigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes who cooperate with police. The data shows that while T visa applications for human trafficking victims remained steady, the agency approved far fewer applications than it had previously, despite a growing backlog.

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement makes it easy for abusers to use the fear of deportation as a tool for coercion. That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.

“I would love a world in which we don't need the T and the U visa. That is the world I am working towards, where we have a fair and honest immigration system that … can’t be used as a weapon against immigrants,” said Bruggeman, the executive director of Freedom Network USA, a nonprofit focused on human trafficking.

Until then, she said, “we at least have to protect the brave victims and survivors who come forward and ask for our help.”

Reporting crimes and applying for a visa is riskier under Trump

Denisse, now 40, immigrated from Mexico in the mid-1990s seeking safety and better work opportunities. She met her future partner while working at a restaurant in New York City. The pair dated and eventually welcomed two daughters. Her first pregnancy, Denisse said, marked the beginning of years of beatings, verbal abuse and rape. Once, Denisse said, her partner threatened to kill her with a screwdriver. On another occasion, she found he had taken photos of her undressed; he threatened to distribute them to friends and family, which left her with a lasting fear of hidden cameras.

After a night of beatings and strangulation in 2015, Denisse decided to call the police. “I just thought, ‘No more. He’s going to kill me.’” The 19th is not publishing Denisse’s last name out of concern for her safety.

She was hesitant to press charges — Denisse had little support or financial stability, was not authorized to live or work in the United States, and was afraid of losing custody of her two daughters. Eventually, she decided to help the authorities prosecute her former partner, and was counseled by social workers about the U visa. She submitted an application in 2018, and by 2023, had received a “bona fide determination” — an acknowledgement that Denisse had met the basic criteria for the visa.

That determination came with a work permit and deferred immigration enforcement while she waits for a final decision on her case. The long wait times have taken a toll.

“I’m living in the in-between,” she said. With Trump’s inauguration, that limbo has become scarier: She fears that she is no longer safe from being detained, deported and separated from her children, especially since her pending application makes her visible to federal immigration officials.

“I’ve heard of people being detained, even having a work permit like me,” she said. “I can feel the fear creeping in.”

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say that the Trump administration’s policies are making it riskier for victims to reach out to law enforcement and submit visa applications, challenging the goals of a program approved by Congress with bipartisan support.

Kinda Velloza, an immigration attorney based in the Atlanta metro area, said reaching out to law enforcement — already a difficult task for many victims — has become a scarier proposition since the Trump administration began working with local police to enforce immigration laws. That’s especially true if immigrants perceive their locality as being hostile to immigrants.

“If they are victims of crime, they're not calling law enforcement — they're not going over there to report anything,” Velloza said. “So, I think we're going to see a decline in new visa filings because nobody's just voluntarily putting themselves in the U.S. immigration system right now.”

A spring 2025 survey of 170 advocates and lawyers for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence and human trafficking, conducted by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, found that more than three-quarters said their clients had concerns about contacting the police. Victims have long been hesitant to contact law enforcement, but Trump’s immigration agenda is challenging advocates’ long-held advice to always seek help.

One advocate in the report said they watched a human trafficking victim with no criminal record be detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The incident has made them question whether it is advisable to tell victims that it’s safe to seek help from law enforcement.

Data from DHS confirm applications for U visas have slowed. In the first three months of the year — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term — applications for U visas fell by almost half from the previous three months. Approvals and denials continued at a similar rate.

The data is an early glimpse into the program under Trump. Advocates for immigrant victims point to two policy changes that could contribute to the chilling effect. First, the Trump administration rolled out new guidance in February telling ICE officers that they don’t have to actively check if someone has a pending U or T visa while carrying out arrests — meaning that they could be more easily detained and deported by ICE.

The administration also reinstated a policy from Trump’s first term that allows ICE to immediately start deportation proceedings against people who are denied a U or T visa. Phelps said the policy is already leading to arrests of U and T visa applicants, and complicates an immigrant’s decision to apply for the program in the first place.

That deportation policy was shown to have a particularly strong impact on human trafficking applicants. A 2022 report out of Boston University based on DHS data and a survey of close to 200 legal experts working with T visa applicants found that while applications under the program had been rising since 2008, they decreased dramatically after the new deportation policy went into effect. Between 2019 and 2021, DHS sent “Notices to Appear” — the letter that triggers deportation proceedings — to nearly 2,000 U and T visa applicants.

Wait times have long plagued the programs

Luz, an immigrant from Ecuador with two children born in the United States, has waited nearly five years for the initial determination in her case and accompanying work permit — just the first step in a long journey to possibly obtaining a U visa.

USCIS estimated last year that the median wait time for a U visa was over six years; for a T visa, it was about 15 months. But lawyers who file these applications say the waits can be much longer. The Domestic Violence Project at the Urban Justice Center, which regularly helps victims file applications, projects that someone who filed in 2020 should expect to get a final decision in 2033, while someone who files this year could be waiting nearly two decades at the current rate.

Luz had been married as a teenager in rural Ecuador and eventually followed her partner to New York City in the mid-1990s. When she arrived, she found poor living conditions, low-paying work and spousal abuse that began almost immediately. She lacked family or community support and spoke little English.

One night, when her partner came home intoxicated and violent, hurting Luz and one of their daughters, Luz called the police.

After the arrest, a law enforcement official encouraged Luz to take her claims to court, instead of dropping the charges, which victims of domestic violence often do. Years later, a mental health counselor urged Luz to apply for a U visa; she filed for it in October 2019. The 19th agreed not to publish Luz’s last name out of concern for her safety.

Luz works at a grocery store under conditions that have exacerbated her asthma — extreme cold and heat, and dust. The pay is also low, which has put strain on her family as food costs rise. She has not received a work authorization, which she said has kept her from pursuing work in health care. She’s interested in working for a pharmacy or a lab, a desire born out of her being a caregiver decades ago for her brother during a battle with liver disease.

“Well, that’s my dream,” Luz said. “And at the same time, I think about how many women like me are sitting, waiting with frustration, wondering if they’ll accept my application or not — if I’ll wind up in the same or a worse situation.”

A 2022 USCIS Inspector General’s report flagged the backlog facing U visas and said it was putting victims at risk. Mismanagement of the program, the report found, was leaving “legitimate victims waiting more than 10 years to receive U visas.”

Some visa applicants are also experiencing longer waits for the immigration agency to even acknowledge their applications. During the Biden administration, that acknowledgement often spared someone from deportation. That’s no longer the case.

The 19th documented the case of a Salvadoran immigrant, Yessenia Ruano, who was forced to self-deport in June after filing a T visa application in February. At the time, the wait for a receipt number was around four weeks. That same month, the Trump administration fired 50 employees from USCIS. By early May, an agent told Ruano that the wait had grown to four months.

By the time Ruano could show the proof of her T visa application in May, ICE agents said it wasn’t enough and told her to leave the country or face detention.

In August, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore and Jimmy Panetta introduced legislation that would protect most U and T visa applicants from immigrant detention and deportation. Moore cited Ruano’s case.

“By subjecting these vulnerable individuals to immigration enforcement, the Trump administration is helping create a two-tiered justice system that empowers criminals and discourages certain victims from coming forward,” Moore said. “Congress created these visas as a tool to make our communities safer and support the flow of critical information during criminal investigations. This legislation creates stronger T and U visa protections, helping victims and law enforcement.”

The Protect Immigrant Witness and Victim Protection Act would also lift the cap on U visas and require USCIS to issue work permits to applicants if their cases are pending for over 180 days.

Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed

Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.

During the first two months of the Trump administration, USCIS denied more T visa applications than it approved, a first in the history of the program.

Between January and March — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term and the first two months of Trump’s second term — USCIS approved 430 applications and denied 497. Taken altogether, the agency decided 927 cases — a number advocates say is strikingly small next to the backlog.

“There is a significant slowing down of adjudications of these applications,” said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, a nonprofit that connects victims of human trafficking with pro-bono legal representation.

“It's troubling to see the numbers dropping. You could understand the lack of approvals without the backlog, but there's no excuse for not adjudicating,” Vanderberg added.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the decline in adjudications of T visa applications.

The Human Trafficking Legal Center and other groups had advocated for more resources to speed up decisions in T visa cases during the Biden administration. In 2023, for the first time in history, the number of T visa applications exceeded Congress’ 5,000 visa cap.

Despite the growing number of applications, USCIS has never reached that cap. Between October 2023 and September 2024, the agency received a record 15,332 T visa applications and approved 3,786. About 600 applications were denied, and the backlog grew from about 9,000 applications the year prior to more than 20,000.

This year, Vanderberg said the organization has no hope that USCIS will meet the cap. “I think we'll be lucky to see 2,000 approvals.”

The role of the visas in maintaining public safety

Last month, the Justice Department said it uncovered a decade-long scheme that resulted in hundreds of fraudulent U visa applications. Three small-town police chiefs in Louisiana took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for false reports of armed robberies.

A federal prosecutor on the case who has worked at the agency for over 20 years said in a news conference that the scheme exposed flagrant abuse of the program — but that the visas are an important law enforcement tool.

“These visas are designed to help law enforcement and prosecutors prosecute crimes where you need the victim or the witness there, ” U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said last month. “U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.”

Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.

“If they don't have to worry about the fear of being deported, they're more likely to report a crime to law enforcement, and that's important to us,” said Captain Jeffrey Bunge, the director of the special victims investigations division at the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland.

In an interview with The 19th, Bunge described U visas as critical to the work of law enforcement — from building trust with immigrant communities to report crimes to mounting strong cases for prosecution that may involve several victims.

Bunge runs the office that issues law enforcement certifications for his police department and described a careful process in which officers work to link the certification request to a crime report and ensure that the agency gets the cooperation of the victim. Not every jurisdiction has a dedicated office like Montgomery County’s.

The U visa program isn’t without criticism. The 2022 USCIS watchdog report found that the program was mismanaged, susceptible to fraud and that better data was needed to understand whether it was meeting the goals that Congress laid out — protecting victims and helping law enforcement.

The report argued that USCIS could do a better job making sure that it wasn’t approving cases using fraudulent law enforcement certifications and that the agency could take a closer look at how it defines whether a victim was helpful to a law enforcement case.

Experts in the visa programs agreed that while improvements could be made, their existence continues to play an important humanitarian and public safety role.

“It does us no good if there are serious crimes that are taking place in the community, and we can’t investigate and charge and arrest those individuals. Particularly for the U visa, [these] are some of the more serious crimes,” Bunge said. “We want to get the bad guy or the bad girl off the street so that overall makes the community safer.”",https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/files/entryimages/112823_lukeville_migrants-2363_1.jpg&fltr[]=wmi|/gfx/shareoverlays/sentinellogo4color_nobackbig.png|BR|77|4|4|0]&w=1200&h=630&zc=C&f=jpg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:06.574793

Some of the Supreme Court's rulings blocking lower court decisions against Trump have been badly flawed and are likely to have harmful effects.","There is a widespread perception - reinforced by a number of high-profile Supreme Court decisions - that the judiciary has been largely ineffective in curbing the second Trump Administration's many illegal actions. In an insightful recent post, Georgetown law Professor Steve Vladeck (one of the nation's leading experts on the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary), explains that courts have actually had more impact than many think:

There is, alas, plenty of Supreme Court-related news…. But I wanted to use this week's ""Long Read"" to tell a slightly different story—about cases that aren't making headlines, for instance, the ongoing litigation challenging President Trump's executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship. That order remains on hold—thanks to a series of rulings by lower courts after the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling on June 27. These lower-court rulings have flown under the radar—at least largely because the government has not sought emergency relief from the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court, nor has it refused to comply with them. For now, it is ""taking the L.""

That's an important story unto itself—not just in the birthright citizenship cases, but more generally. For all of the attention that is (understandably) being paid to the unprecedented number of cases the Trump administration is rushing to the Supreme Court (we're up to 28), and to the Court's (troubling) behavior in those cases, they represent only a small subset of the broader universe of legal challenges to Trump administration behavior. In the majority of cases in which the government is losing in the lower courts, it is (1) not seeking emergency or expedited intervention from above; and (2) otherwise complying with the adverse rulings while the cases move (very slowly) ahead.

Because this reality doesn't make for quite as attractive headlines, it's one to which too many folks are largely oblivious. That's a problem worth fixing—not only because it's important to tell both sides of the litigation story, but because including these cases paints a more complicated (and, in my view, far less nihilistic) picture of the role of the courts—and of the law, more generally—as a check on the Trump administration.

Vladeck goes on to explain that the birthright citizenship order - like a number of other Trump policies - remains blocked by lower courts, and that the administration often chooses not to appeal, or to do so only slowly. He also notes that this record shows that the Court's ruling in Trump v. CASA, Inc., barring most universal injunctions, has so far not had the devastating effect some predicted, because lower courts have found other ways to impose broad injunctions constraining illegal policies:

[F]olks might recall the loud and sharp debate following on the heels of the Supreme Court's ruling in CASA over just how much (or how little) of an impact that decision would have on the ability to challenge lawless (and allegedly lawless) behavior by the Trump administration. As I wrote at the time, the answer was always going to depend upon what happened both on remand in those three cases and elsewhere—and on how viable other means of seeking nationwide relief would be in challenges to Trump administration policies. It's still early, but at least so far, the returns have largely borne out the views of those who did not think that CASA would be a cataclysm. To be clear, that doesn't mean CASA was rightly decided (or even rightly framed, as Professor Jack Goldsmith has explained). And the Court may yet impose tighter limits on (1) nationwide class actions; (2) state standing; (3) what plaintiffs must show to demonstrate that a universal injunction is necessary to obtain ""complete relief""; or (4) nationwide vacatur of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act—any of which will necessarily affect the ability of plaintiffs to bring nationwide challenges to federal policies. But at least for now, CASA's effects have been decidedly modest—and felt most perhaps by lawyers, who have had to reconfigure many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Vladeck opposes the ruling in CASA (as do I). But he's right that its impact will depend on the scope and availability of alternative modes of relief. I made a similar point in my post criticizing CASA at the time it came down.

I think Vladeck's other points here are mostly well-taken, as well. In assessing the impact of the judiciary we should look to the full range of cases, not just those that reach the Supreme Court on the ""shadow"" docket, as the latter are in some ways unrepresentative (Vladeck is a well-known longtime critic of the shadow docket). His analysis undercuts some left-wing narratives about the seeming ineffectiveness of the judiciary. And, as he notes, it also undercuts right-wing narratives to the effect that lower-court rulings against the administration are all indefensible ""Lawfare"" that will surely be overturned by the Supreme Court. If the latter were true, we would expect to see the Administration taking many more of these cases to the Supreme Court, at an accelerated pace.

That said, we should not assume that the judiciary has been completely effective, or even close to it. Some of the Supreme Court's rulings blocking lower court decisions against Trump have been badly flawed and are likely to have harmful effects. The recent ruling on racial profiling in immigration enforcement is a notable example. And some illegal actions are hard to stop completely or swiftly enough through judicial rulings alone.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/Court-4-1.png,N,,2025-09-22 15:58:02.272946

Chellie Pingree says federal officials are prohibiting attorneys from accompanying their clients to routine immigration appointments here in Maine.

Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine’s 1st Congressional District, also joined calls from local officials to get a tour of the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement office in Scarborough that opened five years ago amid secrecy.

In a letter Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree said town officials have been denied entry to the office and that such moves risk “deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation — as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” she said. “I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

She further called on federal officials to immediately disclose any written policy that prohibits barring attorneys from its facilities.

Public officials across the country have been showing up at ICE facilities to get eyewitness accounts of the conditions, only to be rebuffed and in some cases arrested. Last Thursday, 11 officials were arrested at an ICE detention facility in New York City. The Trump administration has made aggressive immigration enforcement, detention and deportation a top priority since his inauguration eight months ago.

Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to immigrants, said attorneys in Maine have been rebuffed on “multiple occasions over the past months” when trying to join clients at their routine appointments, including clients with active immigration cases.

“In the current environment, with the federal government flagrantly disregarding due process and attempting to indiscriminately deport as many people as they can, having your attorney by your side during any ICE appointment is beyond critical,” Roche said in a written statement.

The Scarborough facility has been cloaked in secrecy since plans were first made public in 2020. Two years later, ICE remained tight-lipped about its operations, though at the time it was listed as a “check-in location,” rather than being used for “enforcement and removal operations.”

ICE was later forced to produce nearly 2,000 pages of records after being sued, but the additional information did not answer basic questions about operations, how many detainees could be held and for how long.

It’s still unclear what the facility is used for and federal officials did not respond to an interview request for this story.

That uncertainty is unacceptable to residents like Louise Secordel, who was alarmed that Scarborough police officers had called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection earlier this summer after pulling over a van that was subject to statewide alert amid a fatal drowning investigation in Waterford. CBP and ICE are separate agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that perform similar and sometimes overlapping functions.

Scarborough police apparently called border patrol because the men didn’t speak English and needed help with translation. Federal agents ended up arresting 14 men, including the brother of the drowning victim.

“What began as a sad drowning accident became a questionable detention, aided by our local police resources, of individuals working in our community, with no transparency about what has happened to them since,” Secordel said.

Jonathan Anderson, vice chair of the Scarborough Town Council, said he, too, has been trying to get a tour of the Scarborough facility and open up a dialog between town leaders and ICE since the June 14 arrests, which took place along the busy Route 1 corridor.

Anderson said he is seeking more information about the activities so he can address constituent concerns and ensure ICE is following local town ordinances.

He also wants to ensure that “it’s a facility that is treating people humanely.”

“This is something I know many people in our community are worried about,” Anderson said. “And we’re just looking for transparency around what’s happening and getting to know our neighbor a little bit better.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/41174386_20250204_pingree_0004.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 14:58:13.195767

According authorities, there are currently no plans to temporarily close the facility in suburban Broadview.

""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing are FALSE,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said in a statement.

The department accused demonstrators of throwing tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, while also slashing car tires and blocking entrances to the building. Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowd of protesters.

The National Lawyers Guild alleged agents appeared to ""fire projectiles directly at individuals, including at their heads"" and said at least two people were taken to nearby hospitals.

Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowds. Videos and photos captured numerous scuffles between protesters and ICE guards outside the facility.

DHS accused the state of refusing to ""answer multiple calls for assistance,"" blaming its sanctuary city policies, but in his own statement Gov. J.B. Pritzker denied receiving any calls for help.

""It's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials. The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety,"" Pritzker's office said in a statement. ""Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest.""

The governor's office added that the village of Broadview and Cook County have also not requested state help.

According to DHS, at least 16 protesters have been arrested at the facility so far. The National Lawyers Guild reported at least 10 of those arrests were ultimately released.

""Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" McLaughlin's statement read.

“These egregious acts of violence against people exercising their rights to free speech exemplify this administration’s flagrant assault on the First Amendment,"" Brad Thomson, a volunteer attorney with NLG Chicago, said in a statement. ""The violent use of government power to suppress dissent embodies the authoritarian and xenophobic agenda being pursued by federal authorities.”

The heightened demonstrations come as officials conduct what they've called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in the Chicago area. In just two weeks, more than 550 undocumented immigrants have been detained by ICE, the agency told NBC 5 Investigates.

The Broadview facility serves as a processing center for many of those arrested.

Though protests have taken place every Friday for weeks, the clashes on Sept. 19 were some of the most tense so far. That evening, tensions escalated as someone in the crowd launched fireworks outside the heavily armed ICE compound. Federal agents responded to the fireworks with tear gas and dozens of rounds of pepper ball shots.

Activists and some Illinois democrats running for office were seen gagging and struggling to breathe as tear gas filled the air. Some used milk and water to clear their eyes.

Kat Abughazaleh, who is running for Congress in Illinois' 9th District, was thrown to the ground by federal agents at the protest.

""What's really important to mention here, I’m gonna have a bruise on my side, but that doesn’t hold a candle to the people trapped in the facility are dealing with,"" Abughazaleh said.

A photo captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk Friday morning showed a bottle of what appeared to have been sprayed at protestors, marked with the words ""riot control.""

""We just got sprayed with -- I don't know if it was tear gas, or pepper spray -- I know it stung my eyes,"" NBC Chicago reporter Jenn Schanz, who was at the scene, said.

In recognition of the inalienable human dignity of each person, States built a rules-based system to maintain peace and security and to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. Multilateral refugee, humanitarian, and human rights treaties are central to the objectives enshrined in the UN charter, and essential to preventing and deterring conduct that harms people and threatens global stability and peace. Adherence to treaties has saved lives, upheld human dignity, and protected millions of people from persecution, torture and other human rights abuses.

Human rights treaties play a vital role in helping people live safely and protected where they are, reducing the conditions that lead to forced migration. The Refugee Convention, its Protocol and other agreements provide a foundation for states to host refugees and provide critical protection, thereby reducing onward displacement. Indeed, the substantial majority—over two-thirds—of refugees are already hosted in neighboring states and nearly three-fourths are hosted in low- and middle-income states.

Treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses are more necessary than ever. Many of us have witnessed, day in and day out, how international treaties and law save lives and protect people from return to persecution, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Indeed, the Refugee Convention and its Protocol have protected millions of people from persecution. The sad reality is that today’s global crises and mass displacements often stem from, or are exacerbated by, the failure to adhere to international human rights, refugee and humanitarian conventions and law.

We call on States to:

Sign and/or deposit instruments of ratification or accession to human rights, refugee, and humanitarian treaties, and encourage other states to do so – including by welcoming those that do so during the UNGA Treaty Event and by marking the upcoming 75th Anniversary of the Refugee Convention through acceding to the Refugee Convention and Protocol and encouraging other states to do so.

Celebrate and affirm support for such treaties, and explain the ways they benefit people and states.

Share steps taken to fulfill and honor commitments under treaties – such as enactment of implementing legislation, celebrating treaty commitments, measures taken in response to treaty body recommendations or UPR, or creating a national human rights institution. With respect to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, share steps taken to strengthen asylum systems, support rights protection capacities, or increase cooperation through expanded resettlement and/or aid that helps enable other countries to host large numbers of refugees.

Should there be any denunciations, withdrawals, or attempts to reject, “reform,” and/or replace such treaties with frameworks that deny people protection from persecution and human rights abuses, we call on states to express strong disagreement, reiterate support for such treaties, explain their benefits to human lives, peace, and stability, emphasize the negative impacts of actions that undermine such treaties, and urge reversal of such efforts.

Many people now safely living in countries around the world are the children and grandchildren of people who fled persecution and found refuge in other countries. Conversely, before states came together to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights treaties and the Refugee Convention and Protocol, millions were abandoned to suffer horrific fates. Too many continue to suffer due to the failures to uphold human rights and humanitarian norms.

At this critical crossroads, we call on states to work together and with civil society to strengthen—and reject efforts to undermine—the treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses.

Executive Order Related to H-1B Nonimmigrants Issued

Note: This news item was originally posted Sept. 20, 2025; it was updated with additional information and reposted Sept. 22, 2025.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Sept.19, which places a ""restriction on entry"" of certain (H-1B) nonimmigrant workers and a new $100,000 fee. The executive order went into effect at 12:01 a.m., Sept. 21, 2025, and will remain in effect through Sept. 21, 2026, unless extended or changed.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued memoranda clarifying the executive order Sept. 20, and the U.S. State Department posted an H-1B FAQ Sept. 21.

Based on the administrative guidance in the memoranda and FAQ, it does not appear that this new order applies to individuals who are in the United States or those outside the United States who have an approved or pending H-1B petition. There are still a number of questions raised by this order, including whether it will apply to H-1B applications for extension or change of employer/change of status. It does appear to apply to new H-1B applications, although it is unclear whether cap-exempt H-1B employers/employees may be exempt or able to obtain a national interest exemption.

While the order is likely to be challenged in court, due to the uncertainties and potential for impact, the Office of International Education recommends the following:

Individuals in H-1B status who were not in the United States at the time of the order were encouraged to re-enter the United States by 11:59 p.m., Sept. 20, 2025 (before the order took effect Sept. 21), if possible.

Individuals currently in the United States on an H-1B visa are advised to consider travel carefully and potentially postpone international travel in the near future. While the new memoranda seem to minimize travel risks for individuals who currently hold H-1B status, until the implications and applicability of this new executive order are more fully clarified and potential litigation unfolds, travel guidance may continue to evolve.",https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 12:58:52.885068

IRS seeks to rebuild legal staff after mass resignations. Following an exodus of attorneys from the Office of Chief Counsel, the IRS has opened hiring for more than 60 positions in areas such as international tax and litigation support, reports Tax Notes. The office has lost about 13 percent of its workforce this year, part of broader staff reductions across the agency, and had previously rescinded job offers due to a federal hiring freeze. Experts say the agency may need added resources to handle litigation and implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Court scrutinizes IRS–ICE tax data sharing. A federal judge has ordered the IRS to identify individuals involved in providing taxpayer data to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but allowed some names to remain sealed. The case, Center for Taxpayer Rights v. IRS, focuses on a memorandum of understanding under which the IRS shared addresses of 47,000 taxpayers under investigation for remaining in the U.S. after deportation orders. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has also restricted further disclosures without court notice.

Next Steps for Employers Identify potential future foreign national hires who are abroad and assess the financial and operational implications of the $100,000 payment.","On September 19, 2025, the White House issued a Proclamation, effective September 21st, that restricts the entry into the United States of certain nonimmigrants who seek to be admitted in H-1B status to perform services in a specialty occupation unless their H-1B petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a $100,000 one-time payment per individual or the individual receives a national interest exemption. This payment is new and is in addition to the existing registration and filing fees for H-1B petitions which generally are less than $4,000 for private employers. On September 20th, the White House provided much needed clarification that the payment only applies to new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025 and does not impact current H-1B workers or beneficiaries of pending H-1B petitions.

The immigration shift targets new H-1B petitions for beneficiaries who are currently outside the United States. This affects employers' talent acquisition strategies with overseas hiring plans facing immediate and costly decisions. The intent is to encourage U.S. employers to hire U.S. workers instead.

Future federal court litigation is anticipated and may impact implementation of the Proclamation. Additional governmental guidance is also anticipated to further clarify the scope of the payment and the logistics of payment collection. Unless extended, the Proclamation is set to expire on September 21, 2026.

Who is NOT impacted by the Proclamation?

The White House, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection all separately confirmed all H-1B workers currently in the United States are not subject to the Proclamation with no restriction on international travel. In addition, the Proclamation and $100,000 payment will not apply in the following scenarios:

Beneficiaries with pending or approved H-1B petitions filed prior to September 21, 2025.

Beneficiaries of H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025, seeking extension/amendment of H-1B stay, or change of H-1B employer within the United States.

Family members in H-4 dependent visa status.

Based on the guidance from the Department of State, we anticipate that foreign nationals currently outside the United States with pending or approved H-1B petitions as of September 21, 2025, should be able to secure new H-1B visas at U.S. counsular posts abroad and enter the United States in H-1B status after September 21, 2025.

Who Is Subject to the Proclamation and $100,000 Payment?

Beneficiaries of new H-1B petitions filed after 12:01am EDT on September 21, 2025, currently abroad, who attempt to enter the United States in H-1B status will be subject to the $100,000 payment. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service will not adjudicate H-1B petitions and the Department of State will not issue H-1B visas without evidence of the $100,000 payment for the new H-1B workers outside of the United States.

National Interest Exemptions

The Proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant exemptions of the $100,000 supplemental payment to any individual foreign national, all foreign nationals working for a company, or all foreign nationals working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the hiring of such foreign nationals ""is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States."" We are awaiting further details on the logistics of the national interest exemption process. We anticipate that employers seeking an exemption will be required to provide strong documentation demonstrating the employee's or the organization's strategic importance, economic harm, or public interest impact if the entry payment was enforced.

Prevailing Wage Changes anticipated for H-1B Petitions

The Proclamation directs changes be made to the way prevailing wages are set in the H-1B program and prioritizes higher paid and higher skilled foreign workers. The Secretary of Labor is instructed to initiate rulemaking to revise prevailing wage levels so that they align with the policy goals of the Proclamation. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security is instructed to initiate rulemaking to prioritize the admission of high-skilled, high-paid nonimmigrants.

Employers who sponsor H-1B beneficiaries will need to budget for higher level wages, and specific geographies where prevailing wages are higher or lower under the current rules. Employers may run a risk of Requests for Evidence or denials of their petitions if they routinely only qualify for the lowest of wage level for lower paid, entry-level positions. Department of Homeland Security will develop rules that favor applicants who are both highly skilled and well-compensated setting thresholds for minimum wages, educational or experience as distinguishable factors.

The new wage rules are anticipated to be published followed by a comment period before the next H-1B lottery which is expected to begin in March 2026. In the meantime, the current prevailing wage levels remaining in effect.

Next Steps for Employers

Identify potential future foreign national hires who are abroad and assess the financial and operational implications of the $100,000 payment.

Evaluate whether any positions or business units may qualify for national interest exemptions.

Evaluate and stay informed of recommendations related to rulemaking changes to the prevailing wage levels and prioritization of highly skilled and highly paid nonimmigrants.

The decision comes two and a half months after President Donald Trump signed legislation sharply reducing food aid to the poor. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

The decision to scrap the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Household Food Security Report was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

RELATED STORY | SNAP benefit cuts begin taking effect, changing how many Americans buy food

In a press release Saturday, the USDA said the 2024 report, to be released Oct. 22, would be the last.

""The questions used to collect the data are entirely subjective and do not present an accurate picture of actual food security,'' the USDA said. ""The data is rife with inaccuracies slanted to create a narrative that is not representative of what is actually happening in the countryside as we are currently experiencing lower poverty rates, increasing wages, and job growth under the Trump Administration.''

The Census Bureau reported earlier this month that the U.S. poverty rate dipped from 11% in 2023 to 10.6% last year, before Trump took office.

Critics were quick to accuse the administration of deliberately making it harder to measure hunger and assess the impact of its cuts to food stamps.

– Providing guidance and creating legal safeguards to prevent non-US banks and service providers from over-complying with threats of US sanctions.","22 September 2025. Civil society from around the world urgently calls on States Parties to the Rome Statute to do everything in their power to stop the proposed US sanctions against the ICC, an independent judicial institution with a mandate to confront impunity for the gravest crimes known to humanity. Sanctions against the ICC, taken unilaterally by a non-State Party, amount to an all-out assault on a global court backed by 125 States Parties and relied on by the international community to ensure accountability for atrocity crimes. Such sanctions would leave countless victims abandoned by obstructing a last resort to justice, weaponising the global financial system to choke the Court’s work, and entrenching double standards where power and politics dictate which survivors deserve justice.

Sanctioning the ICC would mark a dangerous turning point in the history of international justice, transforming a system designed to hold the most powerful accountable for atrocity crimes into one that instead shields the powerful. It involves retreating from hard-fought progress toward a rules-based order to a world where might triumphs over right. An international justice system built over decades could crumble in the face of external pressure exerted to unduly influence the course of justice. It is a total affront to the rule of law with devastating repercussions for justice everywhere: if the ICC can be manipulated through financial coercion, no court or accountability mechanism is safe in any country or region.

Sanctioning the ICC as an institution could sever the Court’s ability to function, including its access to financing from banks and states, and block essential services needed to keep it operating. US control over the global financial system ensures the impact of mere threats of sanctions reaches far beyond Washington, as non-American banks, insurers, and service providers often over-comply in fear of themselves being sanctioned, blocking even basic transactions. Without funds, the Court risks not being able to keep the lights on, pay staff, protect data, protect witnesses supporting its work, pay legal aid to victims and defendants, let alone deliver reparations to victims. It threatens core functions of the Court, including the detention of suspects. Hard-won gains, such as the recent arrest and surrender of former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and the German arrest of Libyan suspect, Khaled Mohamed Ali El Hishri, could be lost. Ongoing investigations of alleged international crimes in other situations might be stalled or abandoned indefinitely, leaving victims unable to access justice worldwide.

If sanctions render the Court inoperative, there will be no way back and one of the most relevant institutions of the past century will have been lost. The global community cannot let this happen.

The signatories call on ICC States Parties to urgently save the ICC and the Rule of Law by:

– Publicly and firmly rejecting sanctions against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Bilaterally engaging with the US Administration to prevent designations against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Adopting domestic and regional blocking measures including enforcing the European Union’s Blocking Statute (Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96), to demonstrate solidarity and protect individuals and entities from the impact of sanctions and shield businesses within their respective territories so that they can continue to work with the ICC, its staff and officials, and civil society supporting the Court.

– Protecting service providers by guaranteeing that providing services to the ICC and organisations supporting its work is lawful and shielded.

– Developing practical alternatives to the US-dollar banking network of transactions that are cleared through the US financial system, so the Court and its supporters can keep funding their essential work.

– Providing guidance and creating legal safeguards to prevent non-US banks and service providers from over-complying with threats of US sanctions.

– Fulfilling their legal obligations under the Rome Statute, including financial contributions to the Court’s annual budget, strong political backing to the Court’s independence and continued functioning, cooperation with the Court notably on the arrests and surrender of suspects, and resisting any pressure to disengage in response to sanctions.

Paragon Solutions, Israel’s premier mercenary spyware firm, is headquartered on the top five floors of a glass panel skyscraper that sits next to a discount bank branch in central Tel Aviv. When I stopped in for a visit last month, I encountered twenty-somethings with smartwatches gliding through open floor plans, dogs lounging on shag carpets, fridges stacked with glass bottles of sparkling water, and conference rooms angled to gaze out over the hazy Mediterranean. The breezy atmosphere was at odds with the controversies the company has recently faced. But perhaps by then most of the staff knew the tide had changed.

Earlier this month Paragon scored one of its heftiest deals yet when the Trump administration reactivated a $2 million contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), following the firm’s acquisition by Florida-based investment group AE Industrial Partners last December. The company builds surveillance weapons such as Graphite, a zero-click smartphone hack that can access encrypted communications, turn on the camera and microphone, and vacuum up every text, direct message, intimate photograph, and personal file stored on the device—all without the user noticing. The technology gives those who deploy it a power once reserved for the top commanders of the world’s most vaunted spy outfits.

Scandal came for the company earlier this year when Italian authorities reportedly used Paragon’s spyware to surveil prominent journalists and human rights activists. For the Trump administration, it might have been a proof of concept. The news of the DHS deal—quietly announced on a federal procurement form that was circulated by journalist Jack Poulson—reversed a U.S. government freeze on a deal originally minted in 2023. Over the last decade, American law enforcement agencies have tested and even procured spyware offered by companies with spotty human rights records. Yet outrage surrounding the abuse of Pegasus—another zero-click surveillance tool sold by Paragon’s main rival, the NSO Group, itself based just north of Tel Aviv in Herzliya, near Mossad’s headquarters—propelled Biden to sign an executive order clamping down on government use of commercial spyware.

Trump’s reelection has changed all that. Over the last eight months, he has aspired to govern the United States like a strongman. The summer began with federal agents dispatched to round up undocumented migrants at gun point in Los Angeles. It ended with U.S. military forces carrying out a drone strike in the Caribbean, killing eleven Venezuelans in a brazen execution that legal experts say amounts to a war crime. Arming DHS with Paragon’s mercenary spyware spells only further escalation.

Like a reaper drone, mercenary spyware is an expensive weapon usually reserved for elite military operations. The technology became popular with national security agencies in the early 2010s at the height of U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns in the Middle East. Militant organizations were hiding behind state-of-the-art encryption, and superpowers were lacking in the ingenuity needed to hack their phones. The NSO Group was the first to capitalize on the opportunity.

Within a few years’ time, a handful of companies came to dominate the industry. Whether headquartered in Israel or elsewhere, they were often staffed by Israeli veterans of elite intelligence outfits such as Unit 8200. Military-trained developers had spent years honing their surveillance skills in the occupied Palestinian territories and neighboring countries; now they could apply them for eye-watering salaries at the behest of governments eager to shore up their power. Israel’s foray into the private surveillance industry was a natural update to the country’s old brand as the world’s ultimate security state.

The technology was initially marketed as a weapon, for use in military conflicts or intelligence operations. But despots, keen to surveil and terrify their enemies, found it hard to resist a tool that can decipher the secrets stored in anyone’s personal phone, and spyware companies found it hard to resist the prospect of more paying customers. Soon enough, the industry was embroiled in a number of public relations disasters. Governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Latin America became enthusiastic customers. A technology marketed to clamp down on terrorism, drug cartels, and pedophilia was used to monitor, blackmail, and arrest journalists, human rights advocates, and opposition politicians. Among the victims was journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, who in 2018 was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was murdered and dismembered. Pegasus was found on the phones of his wife and at least one other associate.

Though most victims of mercenary spyware evade such cruel fates, they still describe the technology’s effects as debilitating. “Pegasus was (the authorities’) sending me a message that anything they wanted they could have, that nowhere was free from their control,” Salah Hamouri told me when we spoke in Ramallah in 2022. The lawyer was one of six Palestinian activists who found the NSO group’s spyware on their devices in late 2021. Hamouri, also a French citizen, figured something was amiss when he picked up his phone after gym sessions to find he had been active on Instagram during stretches of time he stored the device in a locker. But news of the hack—confirmed by a forensic scan on his iPhone—sent him spiraling. In the aftermath, Hamouri spent months offline, not even speaking to his wife and kids in Paris over encrypted messaging apps. By the time we met he was carrying a pink Motorola flip phone and still limited his communication to just a few people. “The only time I feel secure is when I’m not using any kind of technology, but it’s impossible to live like that,” he said.

Painstaking documentation of similar travails led to international investigations and lawsuits here in the United States. For the Biden administration, which had toyed with buying the technology, the mounting pressure was enough to shift their course: rather than signing deals with the firms, it wound up blacklisting a number of them. Unable to access their biggest market, the industry seemed, for a moment, to be on the wane: the NSO Group and its peer companies teetered on the edge of bankruptcy; in recent years three other Israeli spyware outfits folded.

Then came Trump’s return. He campaigned on a pledge to build up American military power, and even before taking office, he promised Silicon Valley titans hefty contracts to develop surveillance and weapons systems for U.S. security agencies—in August, the surveillance firm Palantir scored a $10 billion contract with the Department of Defense—while casually talking of conquering Greenland. In campaign speeches, Trump offered an alternative to the last few decades of liberalism: belligerent nationalism, hard militarism, and a frontier ethos.

Many tech CEOs were eager to cash in. They parroted conservative talking points, vowing to inject Silicon Valley with a warrior spirit to protect Western civilization. Executives from Meta, OpenAI, Palantir, and Thinking Machines enlisted in a special unit within the newly renamed Department of War. Others signed deals with DHS to make the agency over into what its secretary, Kristi Noem, has called a “vigilant and proactive and innovative” force. And all of this has been helped by the massive entanglement of the U.S. and Israeli military-tech complex—a longstanding economic relationship that Trump has not invented whole cloth. The late twentieth century’s steady supply of tanks and Uzis morphed into a twenty-first-century exchange of predator drones, facial recognition algorithms, and, now, spyware.

Still, DHS’s contract with Paragon marks escalation, coming amid Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s brutal crackdown that critics say is flouting constitutional checks on the agency’s power. In recent months the DHS has sought to ramp up its mass surveillance capacities; ICE has detained valid visa holders based on social media posts at odds with the Trump administration’s position on Palestine. It has offered Palantir a $30 million contract to develop ImmigrationOS, a surveillance database that advocates worry “concentrates enormous power in the hands of AI-driven platforms with minimal public oversight.” And in February, The Intercept reported that it was courting companies to develop a tool—making use of “social and behavioral sciences” and “psychological profiles”—allowing the agency to monitor individuals who criticized it on social media.

The Paragon deal also demonstrates how the U.S.-Israel alliance will endure despite plummeting domestic support for the war in Gaza. Calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments have mounted in recent months, as Israeli officials barrel ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza City. Endless documentation of war crimes, skyrocketing civilian casualties, allegations of famine have fueled calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments. Various EU member states have frozen the import of Israeli manufactured weapons and surveillance systems. Germany and Spain have halted all arms sales to Israel, while many members of the Hague Group, a collective of several countries in the Global South, has banned arms transfers and sales. Though 84 percent of Americans support an immediate ceasefire, the Trump administration has balked at even the most tepid of sanctions.

There are old and strategic interests at play. The United States has long relied on Israel’s military prowess to further its interest in the Middle East, from the CIA, the NSA, and Mossad tag-teaming targeted assassinations in Syria and Iran to Israeli and American security bodies sharing a steady stream of surveillance data extracted from governments, militant networks, and civilians. Despite campaigning on an “America First” campaign platform, Trump is keen to maintain these relations and often praises Israel as a bulwark against Iranian influence in the region.

More than anything else, though, Trump is a power-monger. He finds a compelling model in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strongman rule and the military arsenal that backs it up. Indeed, Netanyahu has managed to cling onto power through brute displays of military force. Exploding pagers in Beirut, suicide drones beelining toward Iranian nuclear scientists’ bedrooms, 2,000 munitions dropped on civilian complexes in Gaza city, bombing Hamas negotiators in Doha: all of these have distracted from charges of corruption, the dismantling of Israeli democratic institution (imperfect as they may have been), and the fact that more Israelis have died under his watch than any government since the 1970s. Last week, as Israeli troops invaded Gaza City and a United Nations inquiry accused Israeli officials of genocide, Netanyahu told a group of American congressmen the he was remaking Israel into a warrior nation. “We’re going to be Athens and Supersparta” he said, “we’ll have to defend ourselves and know how to attack our enemies.”

Trump has copied a few of Netanyahu’s strategies in the months since he assumed the presidency. Since March, U.S. airstrikes in Yemen have killed over 500 combatants and more than 200 civilians, more than all those killed in two decades of U.S. bombings in the country. As of June, Trump had deployed thousands of National Guards into the heart of U.S. cities. Noem requested “drone surveillance support” to turbocharge their efforts to find and arrest undocumented migrants in Los Angeles. ICE has detained a record-breaking number in recent months, though actual deportation numbers are lagging behind the “millions and millions” promised.

For those living under this expanding offensive, the results are catastrophic. Some have been held for months on end in crowded detention centers. Others, including legal residents, have simply been deported without due process. And that’s just within U.S. borders. Abroad, the embrace of aerial targeting and drone strikes with vanishingly few efforts to minimize civilian casualties mark an unrestrained phase of U.S. militarism, one that shirks even the most symbolic adherence to human rights norms and international rule of law. Instead, allegations of war crimes are touted by those in power as proof of a job well done.

Which returns me to the Tel Aviv skyscraper where Israeli developers build out mercenary spyware at the behest of America’s DHS. On the sunny day I stopped in for a visit, a surveillance UAV hummed somewhere just beyond cloud cover. Fighter jets rumbled overhead on their way to launch guided munitions towards Gaza city. To some, the scene might conjure a kind of dystopia. To others, it offers a model of martial strength.",https://www.bostonreview.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-22358164931.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:30.685230

Amnesty International has issued a call for the data analytics companies Palantir and Babel Street to “immediately cease their work with the US administration related to immigration enforcement.” Amnesty’s action is an important reminder that surveillance technology not only raises critical policy issues around just what kind of a society we want to live in, but that when connected to abusive and illegal actions such as those being taken by the Trump Administration, it can also violate internationally recognized human rights standards. And that can apply to other companies besides Palantir and Babel Street.

In its letters to the two companies, the renowned global human rights group points out that companies have a “responsibility to protect human rights,” including the rights of refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants. Amnesty writes,

The scope and meaning of this responsibility have been articulated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles). The UN Guiding Principles require all businesses, from small and medium-sized enterprises to large multinational enterprises, to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own business activities.

The Trump Administration’s systematic abuses of immigrants certainly count as human rights violations. As Amnesty and my ACLU colleagues have been pointing out, the administration has been violating human rights obligations to protect migrants and asylum seekers, violating due process rights, violating the right to free expression, and engaging in arbitrary and prolonged detention and cruel and degrading treatment. For example, as Amnesty explains, while the U.S. government may have

discretion to deny and revoke visas to applicants, they may not do so in ways that violate rights protected by the US Constitution and international human rights law, including rights to free speech and due process.

As ICE, CBP and others carrying out the Trump Administration’s human rights violations increasingly tap into surveillance infrastructures being run by private companies, those companies have an obligation not to facilitate such violations — and as Amnesty points out, also have human rights responsibilities under United Nations principles to be transparent about how they’re addressing activities in contexts where they “pose risks of severe human rights impacts.”

Unfortunately, there are a growing number of companies that are engaging in mass surveillance, including those collecting significant amounts of data through our cellular networks, video surveillance cameras, face recognition and license plate recognition systems, and other technologies that could prove useful to the Trump Administration’s efforts to target undocumented and documented immigrants and other assorted perceived enemies.

Let’s not forget that two large Chinese companies, Dahua and Hikvision, were sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019 for their role in carrying out surveillance that was connected to the current Chinese government’s ongoing oppression of the Uighur minority in the Xinjiang province. These are not small companies; their products were widespread in the U.S. surveillance camera market. The government issued the sanctions against the companies for “enabling” and being “implicated in”

human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the XUAR. [emphasis added]

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree stressed that preventing legal counsel from attending such visits undermines constitutional protections and erodes public confidence in DHS’s commitment to transparency and accountability.

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” Pingree wrote. “If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities.

I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

Pingree also formally requested a tour of the ICE field office in Scarborough, Maine, citing concerns raised by local town officials who have sought to engage with the facility but have been denied entry.

“Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely,” Pingree wrote. “Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

The Congresswoman reiterated that robust constituent services and agency oversight are core congressional responsibilities, and said she will continue to monitor DHS’s responsiveness.

Dear Secretary Noem,

As you know from your time in the U.S. House of Representatives, providing casework and acting as an intermediary to executive agencies is one of the most fundamental services we provide for our constituents, ensuring that the government serves the people it represents. My office frequently assists constituents with immigration petitions pending with your agency—including adjustments of status, naturalization, and non-immigrant visa petitions—that have been delayed or lost. I take immense pride in my ability to serve the thousands of Mainers who have sought assistance from my office.

Moreover, robust casework functions to directly support Congress’s oversight responsibilities. Elevating constituent concerns provides valuable insights into how federal programs are being implemented on the ground. It can also reveal systemic inefficiencies, inequities, and gaps in service that may warrant legislative or administrative attention.

It is within this oversight capacity that I raise alarm about several reports from my district that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities. Further, should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation. I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.

In service of my oversight responsibilities, I request your assistance in scheduling a tour in the coming weeks of the ICE field office within my district in Scarborough, Maine. In accordance with this request, I wish to stress the importance of the Department’s responsibility to engage with and be responsive to the local communities in which ICE facilities operate. It has been brought to my attention that officials from the Town of Scarborough have made efforts to engage with the ICE facility in the Town, but have yet to be allowed entry. Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely. Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.

I respectfully request a written response to this letter no later than 30 days from receipt. Please provide confirmation of whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if so, its legal justification. My office will also follow up on scheduling a visit to the Scarborough, Maine facility as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters. Congress will continue to closely monitor the Department’s responsiveness, and I fully expect your office will take the necessary actions to address these concerns. Please reach out to my office at (202) 225-6116 should you have any questions.

On the evening of Feb. 11, 22-year-old Ward Sakeik sat on a plane from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Miami. She and her husband, Taahir Shaikh, were returning from their honeymoon, but he was sitting a few rows away. She didn’t look back at him — her handlers told her that even smiling at him could be considered a crime.

Sakeik, a wedding photographer who’s lived in Texas since the age of 9, hadn’t slept for two days. She’d spent nearly 36 hours confined to a small intake room at the Cyril E. King Airport in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tired, she kept her eyes on the book she’d brought on board. It was about marriage and relationships.

Behind her, a woman made small talk. “You look like you’re so sleepy,” Sakeik remembered the woman saying before offering her a pillow. “Here, borrow this.”

The woman — along with almost every other passenger on the plane — was unaware that Sakeik and three others were in ICE custody. Sakeik had been on her honeymoon one day and detained the next.

After arriving in Miami, Sakeik and her fellow detainees were ushered to the back of the plane to deboard. Sakeik was searched and handcuffed while her new husband, a U.S. citizen who was not detained, was free to go back to their new home alone.

“I was just so filled with anger, it’s like human trafficking,” Sakeik later told The Barbed Wire. “Everything happened behind the airport, under the airport, on the side of the airport, I felt like I was being trafficked.”

Sakeik spent the next 141 days in ICE detention. Her release in July made national and international headlines as a dragnet of immigration crackdowns has caught immigrants on legal paths to citizenship alongside those with criminal histories who were the supposed targets.

As a Palestinian woman born in Saudi Arabia — a country with no birthright citizenship — she is stateless.

This week, Israel launched ground invasions on Gaza City as a United Nations inquiry found Israel has committed genocide in Palestinian territories. Sakeik has nowhere to be deported to — though that didn’t stop the Trump administration from trying.

In addition to her husband and legal team, Sakeik said a sisterhood she formed while detained with other women helped her to survive the trauma of her experience in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Now, she is using her platform to bring attention to the plight of women in detention, including the case of 32-year-old Palestinian Leqaa Kordia, the second Columbia University protester arrested this spring. Kordia, who did not attend Columbia University as a student but protested on its grounds in solidarity, has since been dubbed “the forgotten prisoner” while sitting in ICE detention for over six months.

The Barbed Wire spent several days with Sakeik. The following is reconstructed from her memory, as well as interviews with her husband, Shaikh, and her lawyers. Sakeik spoke in-depth about her time in detention to shed light on some of ICE’s increasingly scrutinized and legally dubious practices, which she described as stripping her of her humanity.

“Being detained was one of the hardest, most difficult challenges that I’ve had to face in my entire life. Physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually challenging,” Sakeik said. “I wouldn’t wish this upon anybody, not even my worst enemy.”

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said “any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”

The statement continued: “Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Why does the media continue to fall for the sob stories of illegal aliens in detention and villainize ICE law enforcement?”

‘There’s no place else that ward can call home’

The United States once seemed to Sakeik like a break from conservative Saudi Arabia, where she spent the first few years of her life before her family moved to Texas seeking asylum in 2010. Her parents’ asylum request was denied, but the family was granted an order of supervision, which allows noncitizens awaiting deportation or other immigration proceedings to stay in the U.S. without being held in detention. Their order required annual check-ins, among other conditions.

In Garland, Sakeik, who is Muslim, had “the most beautiful, craziest childhood,” with her tight-knit Middle Eastern family. As a middle child, Sakeik said she “wanted to do everything that my older sister did.”

“I wanted to breathe the same air she was breathing.”

Sakeik was a model student. She took an interest in photography in the 9th grade, when a teacher, who she affectionately called Mamma Donna, handed her a camera. She stayed late to use a school laptop to learn Photoshop and attended football practice and games, taking action shots she’d sell to the players and their parents for $1.

Sakeik graduated early from University of Texas at Arlington in 2023, with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and a minor in Arabic, to build her photography business.

All the while, her annual check-ins with ICE had become routine: She went to the same ICE processing center every year for 13 years. ICE officers there remembered her. One even congratulated her on graduating from college.

Sakeik met Shaikh briefly in college. He later hired her to take professional head shots for his job at Fidelity Investments.

“Headshot sessions take me like, max, 25 minutes. This took two hours,” Sakeik said.

They got engaged in September 2024, then wed in Dallas in January in front of more than 300 guests. The happy couple beamed at each other, hands interlocked underneath twinkle lights as their families looked on.

They chose the U.S. Virgin Islands for their honeymoon destination. Sakeik said she picked it because of the gorgeous views. But it also kept her in line with one of the conditions of her order of supervision — she must remain in a U.S. territory.

In a photo taken in St. Thomas, Sakeik smiles, relaxed, on the edge of a pier in a white silk dress. After nine days of watching glorious sunsets over the water, Sakeik and Shaikh packed and headed out from their hotel, back home.

But when they arrived at the St. Thomas airport, Sakeik was flagged by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent who asked if she was a U.S. citizen. Sakeik tried to explain that she had an order of supervision that allowed her to legally stay in the country, and had been in compliance with ICE for years. She said she showed him notice of her next reporting date with ICE as proof. It didn’t seem to matter.

When she asked why she was detained, Sakeik said the agent told her it was because she’s not a U.S. citizen.

Photos of Sakeik’s life — her graduation, wedding, and honeymoon — were soon splashed across news sites the world over, as her husband pleaded for her release.

During her detainment, Sakeik was shuttled between three facilities, each of which she said suffered from overcrowding and hygiene issues. In some, there were cockroaches, ants, grasshoppers, and spiders, which bit the women, Sakeik said after she was released.

Sakeik’s legal team argued that the U.S. government did not have the right to deport her due to protections offered to Palestinians under a deferred enforced departure memorandum enacted by the Biden administration. Because of the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack carried out by Hamas, the Biden administration determined that civilians were in danger in Gaza and deferred the removal of Palestinians in the United States until Aug. 13 of this year.

Yet, the Department of Homeland Security said they had the authority to detain her.

“Ward Sakeik chose to fly over international waters outside the U.S. customs zone and was then flagged by CBP trying to renter (sic) the continental U.S.,” McLaughlin, the assistant secretary, said in a statement.

Sakeik’s lawyers disagreed. Maria Kari, an attorney on Sakeik’s legal team, emphasized that her client had a right to travel to U.S. territory.

“We all have these documents that we take for granted that allow us to get on flights and see the world, but this is something that Sakeik has never had,” Kari added. “There is no country that claims her to be a citizen of that country. There is no place else that Sakeik can call home.”

‘This is just the beginning’

By the time the van reached what seemed to be an old pink adobe hotel, Sakeik was indignant. Only later did she learn she was at the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

The staff, Sakeik said, were disrespectful — “they literally bullied us.” The food was disgusting. “I wouldn’t even feed it to dogs,” she said. And it was freezing cold.

“I started getting extreme depression. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t talk, I felt paralyzed,” Sakeik said. “I would cry the entire time. I started having panic attacks.”

By her third week in Broward, Sakeik said she realized she needed to get into a routine. She started working out with old dance DVDs. And she made friends: She bonded with a woman from Slovakia and two Muslim women in her dorm.

Meanwhile, Sakeik and her legal team filed a green card application, and a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. They argued she was being wrongfully detained, in violation of the Biden administration’s deferred enforcement memo.

As her lawyers continued to work on her case back in Texas, Sakeik began making preparations for Ramadan, a sacred time for Muslims that typically involves fasting, communal prayer, and reflection. She said she got the OK from officers and the art department to hang lanterns and a banner she made that read, “Ramadan Kareem.” Later, she was instructed to take it all down.

“I’m celebrating the holiday that’s supposed to be the closest with families alone in a place that I don’t know, I don’t have family around me, and you took down my decorations,” Sakeik said. “I started crying, but I didn’t let it get to me.”

Instead, she decided to host a dinner. Sakeik used commissary funds for ingredients, and with help from a friend from Taiwan, she made sushi from crushed Doritos, tortillas, and uncooked Maruchan noodles.

That same night, Sakeik said she was told to pack her bags. “Baby, you are going back home! You’re going to Dallas,’” Sakeik remembered an officer telling her. She left her shampoo and conditioner along with her remaining food as a parting gift to her roommates. But as she waited with a handful of other women downstairs, a friend turned to her: “I don’t think we’re going home. We’re being transferred. This is just the beginning.”

‘Just like human trafficking’

Sakeik and her friend spent two days in handcuffs as they were transferred to Texas, first to a facility in Harlingen, then El Valle Detention Center outside of McAllen.

The facility was packed, Sakeik said, and covered in dust. Every day, more women were shuffled in, processed, and then taken away, “literally, just like human trafficking.” By the time she left, Sakeik said there were 100 detained women in each of the three women’s dorms. There was no privacy, even in bathrooms where they showered six at a time.

She faced a greater language barrier at El Valle since many detainees only spoke Spanish.

Still, she managed to make friends. She got close with another Muslim woman. They cooked together, ate together, prayed together.

“It’s very normal to bond off of trauma. So a lot of friendships are being made in there,” Sakeik said. “You have to now make family there, because God knows how long it’s gonna take for you to see your actual family.”

On June 11, Sakeik was told she was being transferred, though not where.

“I didn’t even pack my stuff. I was too busy saying goodbye to all the girls,” she said.

Her newfound friends cried, cheered her on, and helped her gather her things: “It was a beautiful sisterhood.”

She was put in a van and taken to Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, where other women told her they’d already spent four days in an overcrowded intake room. Later, she was shuffled to another room, where Sakeik said she slept on the ground. The next day, Sakeik said ICE agents wrote numbers on their wrists — she was #4 — then boarded them onto a bus to Alliance Airport in Fort Worth.

When Sakeik saw that the Palestinian woman next to her had a #3 on her wrist, she said she knew she was being deported. She had only $45. She turned to the woman and said, “‘Can I please stay with you until my husband comes? Please?’ She’s like, ‘Absolutely. We have enough to buy a shawarma and to make a phone call.’”

However, with no explanation, Sakeik and the Palestinians on the bus were brought back to Prairieland. She later heard that Israel’s airspace may have been closed following their bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Back at Prairieland, Sakeik met 32-year-old Leqaa Kordia.

Like Mahmoud Khalil, Kordia was arrested after protesting at Columbia University over the war in Gaza last year, though prosecutors later dropped the charges against her. Then, after President Donald Trump came into office threatening to deport protesters who are foreign students, Kordia was arrested in March in New Jersey. The Department of Homeland Security said she’d overstayed an expired student visa; her lawyers said she’s been detained for her pro-Palestinian activism.

Just a week earlier, Kordia had been confined to Prairieland while a federal court hearing in her case went on without her.

Both cases had made national news.

“I saw you on TV!” Kordia later said to Ward when the pair first met.

Ward said she could tell that Kordia — wrapped in a sweater — was sick. The fact that she was still so friendly was endearing to Sakeik. The pair became fast friends. They talked about growing up in Middle Eastern households, their favorite dresses, “girl talk, all that good stuff.”

For Sakeik, Prairieland was both the closest to — and furthest from — home. After the failed effort in mid-June, ICE attempted to deport Sakeik again on June 30.

By then, her lawyers had filed an emergency motion to keep her in the country, as well as another habeas petition in federal court for the Northern District of Texas. They asserted that the government had violated Sakeik’s due process by trying to deport her while deferred enforcement for Palestinians was still in effect. A judge in the case granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from being deported.

Sakeik’s husband and lawyers said that, despite the order, they had to argue with Prairieland staff over the phone to stop them from moving her again.

“Two days later, I was released,” Sakeik said. She later found out she had been, once again, only a hair’s breadth away from being deported.

‘They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers’

Sakeik and her lawyers spoke at a press conference from the Wyndham Hotel in Irving on July 3 — fewer than 36 hours after she was finally released. The hotel was familiar; she’d done photoshoots at its wedding venue.

The specifics of Sakeik’s legal status are complex. She had a final order of deportation stemming from her parents’ asylum application years ago — which DHS said was part of the reason she was detained.

However, her lawyer, Maria Kari, said that the final order was issued when she was a child, and that it doesn’t mean immediate deportation. “You won’t be removed if there’s no place that accepts you, and there is no place that accepts Ward and her family,” Kari told The Barbed Wire. “They are stateless.”

Additionally, Kari said Sakeik has never had a credible fear interview — part of the asylum process allowing applicants to explain why they fear persecution or torture were they to be deported. Sakeik said she fears, in part, that no country will take her.

DHS said that “following her American husband and her filing the appropriate legal applications for her to remain in the country and become a legal permanent resident, she was released from ICE custody.”

Kari countered — “we don’t accept that statement, what they did was unlawful” — noting that Sakeik got preliminary approval on her green card application days before DHS tried to deport her for the second time. Still, she should be protected as her green card application process plays out, Kari said.

At the press conference, Sakeik summed up her case a different way: “I was criminalized for being stateless,” she said. “I didn’t choose to be stateless.”

Then she pivoted to her sisters — the women she met in detention, and who she is now focusing her efforts on supporting.

“I want to share with you the honor of those who I left behind,” Sakeik told reporters. “Women who come here for better lives are voiceless and helpless. A lot of these women don’t have the money for lawyers or media outreach. They come here to provide for their families.”

“They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers,” she continued. “They’re superheroes. There are humans, and their lives hold value, and I will continue to fight with them.”

Sakeik’s return home was accomplished through the proper legal channels, but her wellbeing was only ensured by her friendships with the women who kept her company during detention. These women, from backgrounds both similar and wildly different from Sakeik’s, provided her a network of support.

“We bonded over trauma, over this thing we share,” Sakeik said.

When Sakeik was detained, her husband and attorneys started a social media page and a petition to present to their local congresswoman, which grew to more than 4,000 signatures. Shaikh also gathered testimonials from Sakeik’s mosque, professors, friends, teachers — anyone they could think of. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yagqeen Institute for Islamic Research, also shared Sakeik’s story to millions.

Since her release, Sakeik has paid that work forward.

She has become an outspoken critic of Trump’s immigration policies, namely relating to the broad criminalization of immigrants across ethnicities and backgrounds. But she’s also become an outspoken advocate for Leqaa Kordia, whom she calls her best friend, and whose case has been platformed by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project. In May, Kordia’s legal team told reporters that she hadn’t had access to halal meals, which meant she had lost nearly 50 pounds since her arrest in mid-March.

In June, Korida’s attorneys filed a petition to the court citing the “miserable conditions” in the Prairieland detention center, which was so crowded upon her arrival that she slept on the floor and developed “a severe rash,” reported The Dallas Morning News. Kordia’s attorneys have said the lack of hygiene at Prairieland “makes her feel unworthy of God,” the newspaper reported.

That same month, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford issued an opinion recommending that Korida be released from federal custody.

Still, as summer turns to fall, Kordia remains in detention.

In late August, Sakeik held a letter-writing event on Kordia’s behalf, which drew almost 100 supporters to a coffee shop in Irving.

“Inside, you hold onto the smallest things that can give you hope,” Sakeik said in a video posted on Instagram two weeks ago, urging others to send messages of support to Kordia. With no phones inside, letters matter more than ever, Sakeik explained.

“To know that you have voices behind you” can make all the difference in the world, she continued. “People assuring her that they care for her and she’s not alone — and that she will never be alone. There’s people behind her.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/palestinian_woman_ICE.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:44.104986

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security.
“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers.
Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.
“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit.","The American Civil Liberties Union is suing five Wisconsin sheriffs over their practice of holding people in jail at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The group filed a petition with the Wisconsin Supreme Court this week on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigration rights group Voces de La Frontera.

The petition asks the court to take up the case directly. That’s because Wisconsinites need statewide clarity on the issue, said Hannah Schwarz, an attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin.

“There’s this really inconsistent patchwork of enforcement affecting the public rights of individuals,” she said.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone for an additional 48 hours after that person was set to be released, according to the lawsuit.

Most, but not all, Wisconsin sheriffs are choosing to comply with those requests, which are known as detainers.

But the suit specifically names the sheriffs of Walworth, Kenosha, Brown, Marathon and Sauk counties as defendants because those counties have been among those carrying out the highest numbers of detainers in Wisconsin, Schwarz said.

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law

Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security. If detainers are honored, someone could end up staying in jail even after they post their bond or after criminal charges against them are dropped.

The goal of detainers is to give immigration agents more time to pick someone up if that person is suspected of being in the country illegally.

But the ACLU contends those requests do not give jails the legal authority to keep holding someone after that person was supposed to be let out.

“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers. “We do not consider them warrants. Under Wisconsin state law, a warrant is something issued by a court or a judge. That is not happening here.”

The ACLU argues that under Wisconsin law, jailing someone for extra time because of a detainer amounts to a new arrest. According to the ACLU, that arrest needs to be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines that there is probable cause.

Schwarz argues the current practice of granting detainers doesn’t have enough checks and balances, and it can lead to the wrong people being targeted for deportation.

“In ICE detainer cases, there’s no neutral third party, there’s no judge,” Schwarz said. “That has led to a system where people can get wrongfully caught up in this dragnet.”

Marathon County Sheriff Chad Billeb declined to comment on the lawsuit because it’s a pending legal matter. Other sheriffs named as defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.

Even if it clears the Republican-led Senate, that bill is likely be killed by a veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

Republican backers have argued the proposal would protect public safety by compelling local authorities to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

Opponents, however, have said such requirements would take away local decision-making. And they’ve said it’s a mistake to treat local cops as an extension of immigration enforcement.

“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit. “(It) has a chilling effect on victims and the vulnerable who might otherwise seek help from the police.",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/08/new-gavel.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:00:23.553664

When including the removal of wildlife habitat protections—on public and private lands—the total impact of the rollbacks stretch across more than 175 million acres of U.S. land, an area larger than California, Florida, and Georgia combined.

Earlier this summer, public opposition forced Congress to remove language from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would have sold millions of acres of public lands. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s actions will directly affect far more states and regions of the country than Congress’ proposed sell-off, with more than 70 percent of U.S. states feeling the impact of these rollbacks.

At the same time, the Trump administration is also increasing sales that will hand corporations primary control of public lands, including those lands stripped of their conservation protections.

“Even after Americans loudly rejected attempts to sell off public lands, the Trump administration is rolling forward with actions to transfer control of massive amounts of public lands for corporate profits,” said Drew McConville, senior fellow for Conservation Policy at CAP and co-author of the report. “These efforts to unprotect and sell out public lands are wildly out of step with what the public wants.”

Trump administration actions to eliminate or weaken protections for public lands include:

Removing protections for some of the most intact national forest lands

Opening sensitive Arctic wildlife habitat for drilling

Eliminating restrictions on mining for ecologically sensitive lands and waters

Erasing conservation requirements and habitat protections

The new analysis represents a conservative estimate of affected lands and does not quantify the impacts from public lands attacks on the horizon—such as potential erasure of national monuments—or the widespread impacts of rewriting regulations and policy to favor oil and gas, mining, and timber extraction across publicly managed lands.
